Mandell (Mandell) contests the Sixth Judicial District Court\u2019s granting of relief in <em>quantum meruit </em>and awarding of attorney fees to Appellees Bayliss Ward and Bayliss Architects, P.C. (Bayliss) in this residential construction dispute. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings. We address the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-8\"><em>1. Did the District Court err in granting equitable relief in </em>quantum meruit, <em>despite violation of the statutory requirement that residential construction contracts be in </em>writing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-9\"><em>2. Did the District Court err in awarding attorney fees for the entire case, including the </em>quantum meruit <em>claim?</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b404-11\">\u00b62 Mandell is the owner of real property in the Paradise Valley, outside of Livingston. He contacted architect Bayliss Ward via email in March 2012 to inquire whether Ward and Ward\u2019s firm, Bayliss Architects, P.C.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> would design and provide architectural services for a proposed house on the property. Mandell worked in Thailand as the events herein unfolded, so the communication between the parties was primarily electronic, especially through email.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-12\">\u00b63 Bayliss and Mandell engaged in extensive communications regarding the proposed construction project and Mandell\u2019s budget. At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>one point, Bayliss stopped the process, stating to Mandell in an email: \u201cAfter spending several hours on your residence, I am going to have to stop work and decline any further effort towards your project. The budget for this project and the items that you want to include will be very difficult to achieve and I will not lead you as if we could really do your project for your budget. Your site it beautiful, but I cannot design a home for you with your budget.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">\u00b64 However, Mandell continued to pursue Bayliss, sending an email three days later, stating: \u201cI think it would be beneficial for both of us to have every person floating the Yellowstone admire your work. ... Maybe you can design something within my budget that I will be happy with.\u201d When Bayliss explained that the house Mandell was requesting would cost at least $170 per square foot, Mandell answered that \u201cI may be able to swing the $170 per sq. ft[.] range if you think you can make it work.... Let\u2019s just save where we can, without compromising quality and your style.\u201d In June 2012, the parties met on the site, and Mandell testified that Bayliss agreed that he would design an approximately 2000 square foot home costing $300,000. Bayliss testified that the parties agreed to a construction price of $170 per square foot, with an 8-10% fee for architectural design and structural engineering of the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">\u00b65 Mandell originally intended to have another party act as the general contractor on the project. However, this did not occur, and Mandell requested that Bayliss provide construction management services, in addition to the architectural and structural engineering services. Bayliss agreed to do so for an additional payment of 7-10% of the construction costs as a construction management fee.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ALfQ\">\u00b66 The details of the parties\u2019 agreement were not reduced to writing, but construction commenced, in Bayliss\u2019 words, as a \u201cfast track\u201d project. Mandell wired funds in payment of Bayliss\u2019 invoices as the project continued, ultimately paying a total of $394,198.65. At trial, the parties disputed the occurrence of changes in the project, with Mandell testifying that he never approved any changes to the design, plans, or finishes, and Bayliss testifying that he consulted with Mandell on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>number of changes as the project evolved, to which Mandell had typically responded to Bayliss to \u201cCj]ust make it nice.\u201d No written change orders were prepared. The home was essentially completed in 2013, at which time Bayliss presented Mandell with a final invoice, identifying additional amounts still owing. Mandell refused to pay, and Bayliss filed a construction lien on the property in the amount of $138,241.35 in October 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">\u00b67 Mandell initiated this action, stating counts for breach of contract, declaratory judgment that the lien was invalid, and quiet title to the property. Bayliss answered and stated three counter-claims for foreclosure of the construction lien, <em>quantum meruit, </em>and breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">\u00b68 Mandell sought summary judgment, arguing that because the parties had not reduced their agreement to writing, in violation of \u00a7 28-2-2201(2), MCA, the oral contract between them was invalid and unenforceable, and there was no basis for the construction lien on his property, nor any basis for Bayliss to claim breach of contract. The District Court partially granted Mandell\u2019s claim for declaratory relief, concluding that because Bayliss failed to obtain a written contract for construction services, the contract for construction services was void and the lien for those services was invalid, leaving only that portion of the lien related for architectural services, in a maximum amount of $29,250, the amount claimed by Bayliss for those services. The District Court thus denied all claims for quiet title and foreclosure, awaiting trial to determine the final architectural lien amount. Mandell did not request summary judgment on Bayliss\u2019 <em>quantum meruit </em>claim, and it was not addressed in the order. The District Court reserved the issue of attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">\u00b69 At trial, Bayliss produced evidence that $75,409.53 of the amount he had claimed was based upon invoices still owing for materials and subcontractors. The District Court issued Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order, concluding that Mandell owed $29,250 to Bayliss for architectural services and holding Mandell in breach of that contract between the parties. The court held that Bayliss\u2019 construction lien was valid only for the $29,250 owed to him for architectural services, and ruled that, because Bayliss had established the lien, \u201cthe Court must award Bayliss [] its fees incurred for filing and recording the lien and reasonable attorney fees ....\u201d The court further held that \u201cunjust enrichment and <em>quantum meruit </em>concepts apply to the transaction^]\u201d and awarded $75,409.53 as \u201can appropriate measure of <em>quantum meruit </em>damages. Mr. Mandell would be unjustly enriched if he retained the benefit of said services and materials, without paying for them.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>The court summarily concluded that \u201c[biased on the foregoing findings of fact and conclusions of law, Mr. Mandell cannot succeed to prove any of his claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">\u00b610 The District Court conducted a hearing on attorney fees. Mandell disputed Bayliss\u2019 entitlement to any fees beyond those related to establishing the construction lien related to architectural services. Bayliss called an expert witness who testified briefly of her opinion that the <em>quantum meruit, </em>breach of contract, and construction lien claims were inseparably intertwined. The District Court thereafter issued an order granting the entirety of Bayliss\u2019 attorney fees and costs in the case. Mandell appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">\u00b611 Mandell\u2019s appeal involves a review of both the District Court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law. When reviewing conclusions of law, this Court looks to see \u201cwhether the district court correctly interpreted the applicable law.\u201d <em>James Talcott Constr., Inc. v. P&amp;D Land Enters., </em>2006 MT 188, \u00b6 26, 333 Mont. 107, 141 P.3d 1200. This Court applies a clearly erroneous standard using a three-part test to review a district court\u2019s findings of fact. <em>Talcott Constr., </em>\u00b6 26. \u201cA district court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous if they are not supported by substantial credible evidence, if the trial court has misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if a review of the record leaves this Court with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Morton v. Lanier, </em>2002 MT 214, \u00b6 12, 311 Mont. 301, 55 P.3d 380 (citing <em>Guthrie v. Hardy, </em>2001 MT 122, \u00b6 24, 305 Mont. 367, 28 P.3d 467).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">\u00b612 This Court reviews a trial court\u2019s order granting or denying attorney fees and costs for abuse of discretion. <em>Talcott Constr., </em>\u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">\u00b613 <em>1. Did the District Court err in granting equitable relief in </em>quantum meruit, <em>despite violation of the statutory requirement that residential construction contracts be in </em>writing?</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">\u00b614 Section 28-2-2201, MCA, part of legislation enacted in 2009, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-11\">Residential construction contracts \u2014 disclosure and warranty requirements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-13\">(1) For the purposes of this section, \u201cresidential construction contract\u201d means a contract between a general contractor and an owner for the construction of a new residence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-14\">(2) All residential construction contracts that are subject to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>provisions of this section must be in writing and must contain the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-4\">(a) a disclosure that the general contractor has a current general liability policy;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-5\">(b) a disclosure that the general contractor has a workers\u2019 compensation policy or is an independent contractor without employees;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-6\">(c) a provision setting out the billing cycle establishing the payment schedule to be followed by the owner;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-7\">(d) a provision establishing procedures for handling change orders by the owner;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-8\">(e) a statement of all inspections and tests that the general contractor will perform or have performed prior to, during, or upon completion of construction and a statement that the owner is entitled to receive the results of any tests conducted by the general contractor or conducted at the general contractor\u2019s request;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-9\">(f) a statement that the owner is entitled at the owner\u2019s expense to have any inspections and tests conducted that the owner considers necessary; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-10\">(g) a statement that the general contractor is providing an express warranty that is valid for a period of at least 1 year from completion of the construction project. The warranty must provide detailed descriptions of those components that are included or excluded from the warranty, the length of the warranty, and any specialty warranty provisions or time periods relating to certain components. The warranty provisions must also clearly set forth the requirements that must be adhered to by the buyer, including the time and method for reporting warranty claims, in order for the warranty provision to become applicable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">\u00b615 Mandell argues that the District Court erred by permitting Bayliss to pursue relief under the equitable theory of <em>quantum meruit </em>because such relief circumvents \u00a7 28-2-2201(2), MCA, which requires that residential construction contracts be in writing. Mandell argues that a <em>quantum meruit </em>claim undermines the purposes of the statute, which he summarizes as \u201chelp[ing] to prevent conflicts that arise between builders and homeowners.\u201d He cites to <em>Featherman v. Kennedy, </em>122 Mont. 256, 260, 200 P.2d 243, 245 (1948), where we stated in regard to a statute requiring real estate brokerage contracts to be in writing, that \u201c[t]o hold there could be recovery upon quantum meruit is to \u2018open the door to the very abuses the statute was enacted to prevent, and defeat its manifest purpose.\u2019 \u201d (citing <em>Barney v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number><em>Lasbury, </em>107 N.W. 989, 991 (Neb. 1906)). Mandell also cites <em>In re Estate of Braaten, </em>2004 MT 213, \u00b6 12, 322 Mont. 364, 96 P.3d 1125, where we rejected a <em>quantum meruit </em>claim in light of the \u201cabsolute\u201d wording of a statute prohibiting oral agreements for a devise from an estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">\u00b616 Bayliss argues that <em>Feather man </em>and <em>Braaten </em>involved particular statutes of fraud that are discrete exceptions to the broader rule that \u201cwhere one party repudiates a contract or breaches it by nonperformance, the injured party may seek restitution of the unjust enrichment whether the Statute of Frauds applies or not.\u201d <em>Robertus v. Candee, </em>205 Mont. 403, 407, 670 P.2d 540, 542 (1983). Bayliss\u2019 argument finds support in the recent Third Restatement of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment, which provides that equitable claims may be brought despite statutes requiring contracts to be in writing so long as the statute does not \u201cprohibit a claim in restitution as well as a claim on the contract itself.\u201d Restatement (Third) of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment, \u00a7 31 (2011). On this point, Bayliss notes that \u00a7 28-2-2201, MCA, does not contain language prohibiting equitable claims. Bayliss further disputes Mandell\u2019s argument that permitting equitable claims would undermine the statute. Noting concerns expressed in the statute\u2019s legislative hearings about homeowners choosing not to fight liens despite defects in construction because of the fear they would have to pay attorney fees, Bayliss states that \u201c\u00a7 28-2-2201 did [] away with a very powerful tool in any general contractor\u2019s kit, the construction lien. By doing so, a contractor cannot recover attorney\u2019s fees and must prove the fair value of his services.\u201d Bayliss states that his failure to have a written contract led to the District Court forcing him to forfeit his construction management fee, but that forfeiture of the costs of materials and subcontractors in addition would be harsh and inequitable, as Mandell has received the benefit of these costs.</p>\n<p id=\"AB0\">\u00b617  \u201cAll contracts maybe oral except such as are specially required by statute to be in writing.\u201d Section 28-2-901, MCA. Section 28-2-2201(2), MCA, requires a \u201cresidential construction contract\u201d to be in writing. An oral contract, when expressly required to be in writing, is void. <em>See, e.g., Hanson v. Water Ski Mania Estates, </em>2005 MT 47, \u00b6\u00b6 17-21, 326 Mont. 154, 108 P.3d 481 (to be valid, a transfer of rights to run with land had to be in writing pursuant to \u00a7 28-2-903, MCA). Therefore, the District Court did not err in holding that the agreement between Mandell and Bayliss for residential construction services was void for failure to be reduced to writing. Further, because a contractor\u2019s lien rights arise from a \u201creal estate improvement contract,\u201d \u00a7 71-3-523, MCA, the District Court correctly held that the voiding of the contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>eliminated Bayliss\u2019 lien rights for the construction management services he provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">\u00b618 Turning to the question of whether equitable remedies remain under the statute, we are persuaded by Bayliss\u2019 arguments. Section 28-2-2201, MCA, does not prohibit equitable remedies, a factor emphasized by the Restatement. The statute\u2019s purpose of protecting the homeowner is not undermined by equitable remedies, because the statute operates to eliminate a contractor\u2019s lien rights and the ability to collect attorney fees. Where the homeowner has reaped a benefit from the contractor\u2019s efforts, unjust enrichment should be prevented. <em>See Robertus, </em>205 Mont. at 408-09, 670 P.2d at 542 (\u201cThe theory of unjust enrichment requires that a person who has been unjustly enriched at the expense of another must make restitution to the other.\u201d) (citation omitted); <em>see also Brown v. Thornton, </em>150 Mont. 150, 156, 432 P.2d 386, 390 (1967) <em>(quantum meruit </em>theory \u201carises not from consent of the parties but from the law of natural justice and equity, and is based on the doctrine of unjust enrichment.\u201d). Here, although the District Court denied Bayliss\u2019 construction management fee as a matter of equity, Mandell nonetheless also received the materials and services provided by subcontractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">\u00b619 We conclude that our holdings in <em>Featherman </em>and <em>Braaten </em>are distinguishable. <em>Featherman </em>dealt with a statute requiring real estate agency contracts to be in writing, the purpose of which was \u201cto prevent fraud and perjury in the enforcement of obligations depending for their evidence on the unassisted memory of witnesses ....\u201d <em>Featherman, </em>122 Mont. at 259, 200 P.2d at 244. We reasoned that permitting recovery upon <em>quantum meruit </em>\u201cto the case of real estate brokers absolutely nullifies\u201d the statute. <em>Featherman, </em>122 Mont. at 261, 200 P.2d at 245. We also distinguished those cases in which an unwritten contract was fully executed \u2014 as here \u2014 from a real estate agent\u2019s claim. \u201cThe fact that the contract between the buyer and seller of the real estate has been fully performed has nothing to do with the contract between the seller and the agent claiming a commission .... [The seller] has done nothing that can be said to be referable to the oral agreement to pay a commission.\u201d <em>Featherman, </em>122 Mont. at 262, 200 P.2d at 246. Thus, unlike <em>Featherman, </em>neither the claims nor defenses here depend on the \u201cunassisted memory of witnesses,\u201d the statute would not be \u201cabsolutely nullified\u201d by equitable remedies, as explained above, and the contract here between the original parties to the transaction has allegedly been completed. Similar reasons distinguish <em>Braaten. </em>There, we held the statute at issue was stated in \u201cabsolute\u201d terms, which, for obvious reasons, stated an absolute prohibition on claims that a deceased party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>had orally promised to make a devise while he was alive, unless he had verified his promise in writing. <em>Braaten, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">\u00b620 Other courts have reached the same conclusion on this issue. <em>See, e.g., Shafer Elec. &amp; Constr. v. Mantia, </em>96 A.3d 989, 996 (Penn. 2014) (allowing recovery under theory of <em>quantum meruit </em>when statute required contracts for home improvements to be in writing); <em>Fleissner v. Fitzgerald, </em>937 N.E.2d 1152 (Ill. 2010) (permitting equitable recovery despite oral contract for home repair services in violation of statute which required such contracts to be in writing).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">\u00b621  We hold that the District Court did not err in declaring the parties\u2019 residential construction contract void in light of \u00a7 28-2-2201(2), MCA, and also did not err in concluding that the statute does not prohibit equitable remedies and require absolute forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">\u00b622 <em>2. Did the District Court err in awarding attorney fees for the entire case, including the </em>quantum meruit <em>claim ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">\u00b623 Mandell first argues that the District Court fully adjudicated the construction lien in its summary judgment order, that any further time Bayliss\u2019 attorney spent on the lien issue was unnecessary, and that the District Court erred by awarding any attorney fees for time spent on the lien after that date. While Mandell appears to concede that Bayliss is entitled to attorney fees for prosecution of the portion of the lien deemed valid for architectural services, he argues that the remaining claims are easily separable and have no statutory basis for a fee award. \u00b624 Bayliss contends that the District Court correctly awarded all of his attorney fees pursuant to the Lodestar analysis, citing <em>Blue Ridge </em>Homes, <em>Inc. v. Thein, </em>2008 MT 264, 345 Mont. 125, 191 P.3d 374, and <em>JTL Group, Inc. v. New Outlook, LLP, </em>2010 MT 1, 355 Mont. 1, 223 P.3d 912, for the proposition that his claims were all inextricably intertwined, and therefore were properly awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">\u00b625 The District Court\u2019s Decision and Order Ruling on Plaintiffs Motion for Summary Judgment stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-9\">All of these issues raise questions of fact th\u00e1t preclude summary judgment as to the issue of the construction lien, in so far as it reflects professional services for the [architectural] design of the home. ... At this juncture, there are additional questions of fact that exist regarding the appropriate level of fees for the architectural services and whether some or all of the fees have been paid. ... The amount of the architectural fee outstanding, if any, is the subject of further determination after resolution of the disputed fact inherent in this aspect of the case. ... [B]ut the lien amount that can be claimed ... may not exceed $29,250.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">After trial, the District Court found that \u201c[t]he construction lien filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>by Bayliss [], only so far as to the $29,250 for architectural services, is a valid lien.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">\u00b626 Although the District Court made potentially inconsistent statements about the status of the lien, we conclude upon review that the matter of the lien for architectural services was not finally adjudicated by the summary judgment order, as the court specifically found there were questions of fact remaining. After trial, the District Court determined the final amount of the lien, granting the $29,250 originally claimed. Because the matter was not considered final until trial, we conclude that further reasonable time expended by Bayliss\u2019 counsel on this matter for trial is compensable. Section 71-3-124(1), MCA, authorizes costs, and attorney fees to be awarded to the prevailing party in a construction lien case.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">\u00b627 Finally, we address the District Court\u2019s award of attorney fees for Bayliss\u2019 remaining claims. \u201cA court may award attorney fees only where a statute or contract provides for their recovery.\u201d <em>Thein, </em>\u00b6 78 (citing <em>Stavenjord v. Mont. State Fund, </em>2006 MT 257, \u00b6 21, 334 Mont. 117, 146 P.3d 724). \u201c[W]here a lawsuit involves multiple claims or theories, an award of attorney fees must be based on the time spent by the prevailing party\u2019s attorney on the claim or theory under which attorney fees are allowable.\u201d <em>Thein, </em>\u00b6 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">\u00b628 In <em>Thein, </em>Blue Ridge Construction brought claims against the homeowner that were similar to Bayliss\u2019 claims here: breach of contract, foreclosure of construction lien, and <em>quantum meruit. Thein, </em>\u00b6 13. The jury awarded both contract damages and recovery in <em>quantum meruit, </em>and Blue Ridge elected contractual damages. <em>Thein, </em>\u00b6 18. The district court awarded attorney fees on all of Blue Ridge\u2019s related claims, including the <em>quantum meruit </em>claim, because they were \u201cinextricably intertwined.\u201d <em>Thein, </em>\u00b6 77. We affirmed the fee award, reasoning that the claims at issue were \u201cinseparable.\u201d <em>Thein, </em>\u00b6 79.</p>\n<p id=\"AFS\">\u00b629 However, this case differs from <em>Thein </em>as a matter of both law and fact. We are faced here with the application of a new statute not at issue in <em>Thein. </em>Bayliss has argued and we concluded above that <em>quantum meruit </em>is an available remedy here in part because \u00a7 28-2-2201, MCA, would not be undermined by such relief \u2014 a violation of the statute still operates to eliminate the contractor\u2019s lien rights, including attorney fees. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 16,18. However, despite having forfeited attorney fees under the statute, Bayliss was nonetheless awarded fees on his <em>quantum meruit </em>claim in the final fee order. In order to give effect to the new statute, we conclude that the award of fees on the <em>quantum meruit </em>claim was error and must be reversed. Further, unlike <em>Thein, </em>the claims here in our view are not inseparable as a matter of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>fact, and the District Court\u2019s finding to the contrary was clearly erroneous. Though some factual questions remained, the architectural lien issue was largely established by the summary judgment order, and the District Court ultimately granted the amount it had set as the maximum amount for the lien in its earlier order.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">\u00b630  We remand this matter to the District Court to enter an award of attorney fees due to Bayliss in conjunction with the prosecution of his lien for architectural services only, pursuant to the analysis for determining reasonable attorney fees, <em>see JTL Group, </em>\u00b6 18, and for entry of an amended judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">\u00b631 Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b413-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES McKINNON, COTTER and SHEA concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b404-13\"> The record indicates that Bayliss Ward is the sole shareholder of Bayliss Architects, P.C.
