We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-18\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b146-19\">\u00b62 This Court is familiar with Montgomery\u2019s criminal history.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Montgomery entered a no-contest plea to felony incest in Ravalli County District Court and received a twenty-year suspended sentence in 2004. In May 2006, Montgomery was charged with numerous felony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>counts of sexual assault and sexual abuse of four children. Montgomery pleaded guilty to two counts of felony sexual assault in exchange for the dismissal of the remaining counts and withdrawal of a persistent felony offender notification. In January 2007, the District Court sentenced Montgomery to twenty years in Montana State Prison (MSP) with ten years suspended for each felony, to run consecutively. The court also revoked Montgomery\u2019s suspended sentence from his 2004 conviction and committed him to MSP for twenty years with ten years suspended, to run consecutively with the sexual assault convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"ACn\">\u00b63 Montgomery filed motions to withdraw his pleas to all of the above-described charges. In October 2008, the District Court denied the motions in both cases. Montgomery appealed. This Court affirmed the denial, concluding the motions were time-barred. <em>State v. Montgomery, </em>2010 MT 193, \u00b6\u00b6 14-19, 357 Mont. 348, 239 P.3d 929 <em>(Montgomery I).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">\u00b64 He subsequently filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, claiming his incarceration was illegal and his three convictions for sexual offenses were invalid because the court lacked the authority to accept a no-contest plea in a sex offense case. <em>Montgomery v. Law, </em>No. OP 10-0489, 2010 Mont. LEXIS 605 (Dec. 7, 2010) <em>(Montgomery II). </em>We rejected his petition, noting that Montgomery could have raised these issues in an appeal \u201cbut elected not to do so and instead accepted the benefit of his bargain.\u201d <em>Montgomery II, </em>*3. We concluded he was therefore procedurally barred from raising these issues via habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">\u00b65 In May 2013, Montgomery again sought habeas corpus relief on the grounds that \u201chis convictions [were] \u2018generally and/or facially invalid.\u2019 \u201d <em>Montgomery v. Green, </em>No. OP 13-0279, 2013 Mont. LEXIS 294, 311 P.3d 444 (table) (May 29, 2013) <em>(Montgomery III). </em>We reiterated that \u201cMontgomery did not appeal from his 2004 or 2007 convictions.\u201d <em>Montgomery III, </em>*2. Citing \u00a7 46-22-101(2), MCA, we stated that \u201c[t]he writ of habeas corpus is not available to attack the validity of the conviction or sentence of a person who has been adjudged guilty of an offense in a court of record and has exhausted the remedy of appeal.\u201d <em>Montgomery III, </em>*2 (citing <em>Lott v. State, </em>2006 MT 279, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 19, 334 Mont. 270, 150 P.3d 337).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">\u00b66 In October 2014, Montgomery, appearing pro se, filed a motion to vacate his conviction and dismiss the charge. The District Court also denied this motion. He appealed, claiming that the District Court erred in concluding that it had subject matter jurisdiction over the State\u2019s case against Montgomery. We affirmed the order of the District Court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number><em>State v. Montgomery, </em>2015 MT 151, \u00b6 2, 379 Mont. 353, 350 P.3d 77 <em>(Montgomery IV). </em>In August 2015, Montgomery filed another petition for habeas corpus relief, challenging the May 2006 commencement of his prosecution in the Ravalli County District Court. <em>Montgomery v. Green, </em>No. OP 15-0507, 2015 Mont. LEXIS 527, 381 Mont. 544, 357 P.3d 337 (table) (Sept. 1, 2015) <em>(Montgomery V). </em>In denying his petition, we stated that \u201c[h]e raises the same argument that this Court already rejected in his direct appeal.\u201d <em>Montgomery V, </em>*3.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">\u00b67 On October 26, 2015, Montgomery filed a \u201cMotion To Vacate Conviction and Dismiss Charges\u201d with the Ravalli County District Court. The court summarily denied the motion with a hand-written notation on November 10, 2015. This appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">\u00b68 \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to dismiss in a criminal case de novo for correctness.\u201d <em>State v. Maloney, </em>2015 MT 227, \u00b6 12, 380 Mont. 244, 354 P.3d 611 (citing <em>State v. Betterman, </em>2015 MT 39, \u00b6 11, 378 Mont. 182, 342 P.3d 971).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">\u00b69 Montgomery filed a motion in the District Court to vacate his conviction and dismiss the charges against him, which the court summarily denied. He now appeals because of \u201ca new rule of law ....\u201d Montgomery complains that \u201cthe lower court side-stepped the constitutionally mandated procedure (vehicle) for making [a probable cause] determination.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) He further complains that as a pro se litigant he should have meaningful access to the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">\u00b610 The Attorney General for the State of Montana counters \u201cthat there must be an end to litigation at some point.\u201d <em>State v. Perry, </em>232 Mont. 455, 464, 758 P.2d 268, 273 (1988) (internal citation omitted), <em>overruled in part on other grounds, State v. Clark, </em>2005 MT 330, \u00b6\u00b6 30-32, 330 Mont. 8, 125 P.3d 1099. It argues that meaningful access to the courts is not a \u201clicense to relitigate a cause or to burden the resources of the court with successive claims which could have been brought in one action.\u201d <em>Perry, </em>232 Mont. at 463, 758 P.2d at 273. The State maintains that Montgomery\u2019s appeal is barred by the doctrine of res judicata, and argues that Montgomery\u2019s successive appeals and petitions must come to an end. Montgomery replies that res judicata does not apply here.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-11\">\u00b611 Before we resolve the arguments presented, we address why we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>have referenced Montgomery\u2019s petitions for habeas corpus relief with this Court. This Court recognizes \u201cthe familiar principle that <em>res judicata </em>is inapplicable in habeas proceedings.\u201d <em>Sanders v. United States, </em>373 U.S. 1, 8, 83 S. Ct. 1068, 1073 (1963) (citing <em>Fay v. Noia, </em>372 U.S. 391, 423, 83 S. Ct. 822, 840 (1963)). <em>See also Coleman v. State, </em>194 Mont. 428, 438, 633 P.2d 624, 630 (1981) (\u201cHistorically the principle of <em>res judicata </em>was not seen to apply to writs of habeas corpus or petitions for relief under [the Federal Act, 22 U. S. C.] \u00a7 2255.\u201d) However, when viewed in the aggregate, all of Montgomery\u2019s challenges constitute collateral attacks against his convictions. We have stated that \u201c[r]es <em>judicata </em>cannot be applied in such a manner as to deprive [a petitioner] of the right to file a post-conviction procedure. However, <em>res judicata </em>can be used to bar the rehearing of issues already litigated under the rule in <em>Sanders.\u201d Coleman, </em>194 Mont. at 438, 633 P.2d at 630 (citing <em>Sanders, </em>373 U.S. at 15, 83 S. Ct. at 1077). <em>See Dawson v. State, </em>2000 MT 219, \u00b6 162, 301 Mont. 135, 10 P.3d 49 (\u201cThe doctrine of res judicata may also pose a procedural bar to postconviction relief.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">\u00b612 The doctrine of res judicata bars relitigation of issues in criminal cases if three criteria are met:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-6\">(1) the same ground presented in the subsequent application was determined adversely to the applicant on the prior application,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-8\">(2) the prior determination was on the merits, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-9\">(3) the ends of justice would not be served by reaching the merits of the subsequent application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-11\"><em>Kills on Top v. State, </em>279 Mont. 384, 399, 928 P.2d 182, 192 (1996) (citing <em>State v. Baker, </em>272 Mont. 273, 282, 901 P.2d 54, 59 (1995)). <em>See also State v. Southwick, </em>2007 MT 257, \u00b6 17, 339 Mont. 281, 169 P.3d 698.</p>\n<p id=\"AMdY\">\u00b613  The doctrine of res judicata (claim preclusion) applies squarely to the instant appeal. <em>McDaniel v. State, </em>2009 MT 159, n.2, 350 Mont. 422, 208 P.3d 817. Montgomery has previously raised the same arguments he now raises as to the legality of his convictions and sentences. \u201c ] C llairri preclusion\u2019 refers to the preclusive effect of a judgment...\u201d and forecloses litigation of matters that should have been raised in earlier, timely proceedings. <em>Perry, </em>232 Mont. at 464, 758 P.2d at 274. This Court denied his two prior appeals on the merits, determining they were time-barred and invalid, respectively. <em>Montgomery I; Montgomery IV. </em>This Court also denied his habeas corpus petitions as procedurally barred. <em>Montgomery II; Montgomery III; Montgomery V. </em>He now raises the same arguments we have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>previously rejected. The ends of justice will not be served by reaching the merits of Montgomery\u2019s latest appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">\u00b614 Based upon the foregoing, this Court affirms the Ravalli County District Court\u2019s summary denial of Montgomery\u2019s motion to dismiss his conviction and vacate the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">\u00b615 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that, prior to filing any pleading or original petition with this Court regarding his prior convictions or sentences as imposed in the Ravalli County District Court in 2004 and 2007, Montgomery must file with this Court a motion for leave to file the pleading or petition. The motion must be sworn under oath before a notary public, must not exceed three pages in length, and must make a preliminary showing that the motion has merit and is not barred under the foregoing criteria. Only when this Court has reviewed the motion and issued an order granting leave to file may the Clerk of Court file the pleading or petition. The Clerk shall reject any nonconforming pleading or petition that Montgomery seeks to file and shall so inform Montgomery.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">DATED this 12th day of July, 2016.</p>\n<author id=\"b150-9\">/S/ PATRICIA COTTER</author>\n<author id=\"Axd\">/S/ MICHAEL E WHEAT</author>\n<author id=\"Au5\">/S/JAMES JEREMIAH SHEA</author>\n<author id=\"asl-dedup-0\">/S/ BETH BAKER</author>\n<author id=\"Aq9\">/S/JIM RICE</author>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b146-20\"> Since 2009, Montgomery has filed three direct appeals, two of which were consolidated, and four original proceedings for habeas corpus relief with this Court.
