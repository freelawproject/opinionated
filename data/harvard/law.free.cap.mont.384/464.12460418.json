Junkermier merged with the Bozeman accounting firm ofVeltkamp, Stannebein, and Bateson, P.C. (Veltkamp Firm) in 2002. At the time of the merger, the Veltkamp Firm had four shareholders\u2014Former Shareholders Uithoven, Bateson, and Veltkamp, and nonparty Harry Stannebein. Under the merger agreement, Junkermier and the Veltkamp Firm equalized their book value and the Veltkamp Firm shareholders received equal value shares of Junkermier. The merger agreement provided that the Veltkamp Firm could be \u201cspun-off\u2019 if either party determined within eighteen months that the merger was not in its best interest. Neither party exercised this option. Former Shareholder Riekenberg was a non-shareholder employee at the Veltkamp Firm who became a Junkermier employee and shareholder after the merger.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">\u00b64 Former Shareholder Alborn became a Junkermier shareholder in 1980. He served on Junkermier\u2019s board of directors and, by the spring of 2013, he had been the Junkermier Bozeman office branch manager for nearly ten years. Former Shareholders were five of the six Junkermier shareholders in Junkermier\u2019s Bozeman office and held nearly fifteen percent of Junkermier\u2019s shares. All Junkermier shareholders are subject to a Stock Purchase and Redemption Agreement (Stock Agreement), which requires that shareholders be employed by Junkermier in a professional capacity, restricts the transfer of shares, and details the parties\u2019 obligations regarding the sale and redemption of shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">\u00b65 Throughout their employment with Junkermier, Former Shareholders\u2014like all Junkermier shareholders\u2014were employed under the terms of an annual Shareholder\u2019s Employment Agreement (Employment Agreement). The Employment Agreement defines the parties\u2019 various rights and obligations and contains a covenant restricting competition (Covenant) that provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-7\">7. POST-EMPLOYMENT REPRESENTATION OF CLIENTS. If this Agreement is terminated for any reason and Shareholder provides professional services... in competition with [Junkermier] the Shareholder agrees as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-8\">a. To pay to [Junkermier] an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the gross fees billed by [Junkermier] to a particular client over the twelve month period immediately preceding such termination, if the client was a client of [Junkermier] within the twelve month period prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>Shareholder\u2019s leaving [Junkermier\u2019s] employment (hereinafter \u201cparticular client\u201d), and the particular client is thereafter within one year of date of termination served by Shareholder, Shareholder\u2019s partners, or any professional services organization employing the Shareholder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pA98\">\n<img class=\"blockquote\" height=\"37\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAOkAAAAlAQAAAACPZvOBAAAAV0lEQVR4nGP8z4AHNDLhk2VgGJUelR5U0k9gXAUo/bcBWfoeVPT/ByjjzwESDFeC8hgFoAwWB5h5///////9PxTsh9L/IFQDRDcHzDCYJkYUwwnYPQylAaTwJqxNV+X2AAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\" width=\"232\"/>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-4\">f. For purposes of this Section, a Shareholder shall be considered to be in competition with [Junkermier], by providing professional services within the county of the Shareholder\u2019s primary office (the office through which the Shareholder provides the majority ofhis professional services), or any county contiguous thereto.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Under the Employment Agreement, Former Shareholders acknowledged that they were entering into the agreement \u201cwith full understanding of the nature and extent covered by the\u201d Covenant, and that they realized that the Employment Agreement \u201cwould not be entered into without the [Covenant] contained herein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">\u00b66 The Employment Agreement contained also a section entitled \u201cDisclosure of Information.\u201d That section prohibited shareholders from disclosing confidential information\u2014defined to include \u201clists of [Junkermier\u2019s] clients.\u201d The disclosure term made clear that it applied both during the agreement\u2019s term and \u201cat all times after the termination of employment with [Junkermier].\u201d The Employment Agreement specified further that any and all confidential information was \u201cthe sole and exclusive property of [Junkermier].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">\u00b67 Under the Employment Agreement, Junkermier agreed \u201cto compensate the Shareholder at a mutually agreeable amount.\u201d The agreement specified further that Former Shareholders would be paid a salary \u201cpursuant to the policies and procedures contained in the [Junkermier] Employee Manual.\u201d Former Shareholders were paid a base salary by Junkermier and they also received bonuses when approved by the board of directors, typically on an annual basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">\u00b68 The Employment Agreement\u2019s term would \u201cexpire one (1) year from the date of execution.\u201d It also could be terminated upon the happening of certain specified events. The Employment Agreement provided further that it could be extended for a one-year term by Junkermier on written notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">\u00b69 In June 2012, Former Shareholders were notified that Junkermier was exercising its option to extend the terms of their most recent Employment Agreements through June 30,2013. In the spring of2013, Former Shareholders began discussing splitting from Junkermier due to various frustrations with the firm. Former Shareholders retained an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>attorney, who suggested that the Covenant was not enforceable. In early June 2013, Former Shareholders met with a consultant to get advice about splitting from Junkermier.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">\u00b610 Around that same time, Former Shareholders informed Junkermier CEO Jerry Lehman in writing that they wanted to discuss leaving Junkermier. Shortly after, the majority of Former Shareholders met with Lehman. Lehman then informed the other Junkermier shareholders that Former Shareholders intended to leave. He called a special meeting of the shareholders to discuss the topic. At that meeting the other Junkermier shareholders appointed a committee to negotiate the details of Former Shareholders\u2019 split from the firm. The committee and Former Shareholders discussed a transition; each side made proposals regarding the Bozeman office\u2019s clients, but they never reached an agreement. On June 20, 2013, Lehman met with the Bozeman office employees and informed them that Former Shareholders were leaving. Also that same day, Junkermier sent all the Bozeman office employees a \u201cCOBRA Election Notice\u201d informing them that their employment would end on June 30, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">\u00b611 The last week of June 2013, F ormer Shareholder Alborn prepared a \u201cto do list\u201d assigning various tasks to Former Shareholders and other Bozeman office employees relating to forming the new Amafies accounting firm, andfiled articles of incorporation for Amafies. Former Shareholders worked for Junkermier until June 30, 2013. The next day, Former Shareholders and almost all of the Junkermier Bozeman staff began work at Amafies. Amafies ran a full-page advertisement that same day in the <em>Bozeman Daily Chronicle </em>announcing its formation and new location. The ad stated that Amafies had \u201cevolved\u201d from Junkermier.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">\u00b612 Prior to Former Shareholders\u2019 leaving Junkermier, a Junkermier employee downloaded a copy of Junkermier\u2019s Bozeman client list at Former Shareholder Alborn\u2019s request. The client list was taken to a local printing shop to print letters to the clients. On its first day of business, Amafies sent the letters to all of the clients on the downloaded client list informing them about the split from Junkermier. The letter included a document that asked the clients to choose whether they wanted to continue their relationship with Junkermier or to continue their relationship \u201cwith the Shareholders and staff of the former [Junkermier] Bozeman office, now known as [Amafies].\u201d Junkermier sent its own letter to the Bozeman clients informing them of the changes in the office in mid-July. Ultimately, about 2,100 of the 2,400 clients on the client list transferred their accounting work from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>Junkermier to Amatics. A significant number of these clients had preexisting relationships with Former Shareholders Uithoven, Bateson, Veltkamp, and Riekenberg from their days at the Veltkamp Firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">\u00b613 Following the split, Junkermier filed a complaint to declare the Covenant enforceable and to recover damages. The complaint included claims for breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty against Former Shareholders. Pursuant to the Covenant, Junkermier sought 100% of the gross fees that Junkermier billed in fiscal year 2013 to clients that were serviced by Amatics in fiscal year 2014. The complaint originally named a number of other defendants who had left Junkermier\u2019s Bozeman office, but they were voluntarily dismissed, leaving Former Shareholders and Amatics as the only defendants. Former Shareholders asserted statutory wage, breach of contract, and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing counterclaims that eventually also were dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">\u00b614 On the parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court held that the Employment Agreement was unenforceable because it was merely an agreement to agree and also was a contract of adhesion. The court concluded, however, that there were issues of material fact regarding the breach of fiduciary duty claim. It set a bench trial to resolve the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">\u00b615 Following three days of trial, the District Court determined that Junkermier is not a closely held corporation and concluded that Former Shareholders, other than Alborn, owed no legal duty to Junkermier. The court concluded that Alborn breached his fiduciary duty to Junkermier. The court held, however, that Alborn was not liable for damages because Junkermier failed to prove damages by substantial evidence. Junkermier appeals the District Court\u2019s summary judgment and trial rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">\u00b616 We review summary judgment rulings de novo. <em>Garza v. Forquest Ventures, Inc., </em>2015 MT 284, \u00b6 11, 381 Mont. 189, 358 P.3d 189. Summary judgment is appropriate when the moving party demonstrates the absence of a genuine issue of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. M. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3); <em>Garza, </em>\u00b6 11. If this burden is met, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to establish with substantial evidence\u2014as opposed to mere denial, speculation, or conclusory assertions\u2014that a genuine issue of material fact does exist or that the moving party is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Garza, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>\u00b617 We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine if they are clearly erroneous. M. R. Civ. P. 52(a)(6); <em>Letica Land Co., LLC v. Anaconda-Deer Lodge Cnty., </em>2015 MT 323, \u00b6 13, 381 Mont. 389, 362 P.3d 614. A finding is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the district court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if our review of the record convinces us that the district court made a mistake. <em>Letica Land Co., LLC, </em>\u00b6 13. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine if they are correct. <em>Letica Land Co., LLC, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">\u00b618 <em>1. Whether the District Court erred by failing to analyze the reasonableness of the Covenant because it concluded that the underlying contract was unenforceable.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">\u00b619 The District Court acknowledged that in order to be considered reasonable, a covenant not to compete must meet each of three factors that we articulated in <em>Dobbins, De Guire &amp; Tucker, P. C. v. Rutherford, MacDonald &amp; Olson, </em>218 Mont. 392, 708 P.2d 577 (1985) (hereafter <em>Dobbins). </em>The court concluded that while there were genuine factual issues as to some of the <em>Dobbins </em>elements, the Employment Agreement as a whole was not enforceable. Relying on cases from other jurisdictions, the court concluded that the amount of compensation is an essential term in a contract for services. Because the Employment Agreement did not specify the amount of compensation, or provide a \u201cformula, mode, or provision\u201d for determining compensation, the District Court determined that the agreement was an unenforceable agreement to agree. The court concluded further that the Employment Agreement was unenforceable because it was a contract of adhesion. The court thus held that the Covenant was unenforceable because the Employment Agreement was unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">A. Junkermier\u2019s arguments pertaining to the Employment Agreement\u2019s enforceability</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">\u00b620 Former Shareholders contend that Junkermier did not respond to their summary judgment arguments that the Employment Agreement lacked an adequate compensation term and was only an agreement to agree. Because it was Junkermier\u2019s duty to respond as the party opposing the motion, Former Shareholders claim that the District Court had no duty to develop arguments on Junkermier\u2019s behalf. The District Court adopted Former Shareholders\u2019 position and granted summary judgment to them in large part because Junkermier failed to address the arguments. Former Shareholders contend that Junkermier cannot now raise the arguments it failed to raise with the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">\u00b621 In response, Junkermier claims that it specifically addressed the issues of compensation and whether the Employment Agreement was an agreement to agree. As such, Junkermier argues that its arguments are properly before this Court on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">\u00b622 A review of the record demonstrates that although Junkermier did not develop the argument, it did address briefly Former Shareholders\u2019 claims regarding the issues of compensation and agreements to agree both in its briefing and in oral arguments before the District Court on summary judgment. Either way, Junkermier\u2019s alleged failure to respond to Former Shareholders\u2019 arguments did \u201cnot relieve the District Court of the duty to engage in a Rule 56 analysis when presented with [F ormer Shareholders\u2019] motion for summary judgment.\u201d <em>Chapman v. Maxwell, </em>2014 MT 35, \u00b6 11, 374 Mont. 12, 322 P.3d 1029. Thus, the District Court was required to look beyond the parties\u2019 briefs in concluding on summary judgment that the Employment Agreement was unenforceable. M. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3); <em>Chapman, </em>\u00b6 11. We do the same in our de novo review of the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the Employment Agreement was unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">B. The Employment Agreement\u2019s enforceability</p>\n<p id=\"AjK2\">\u00b623 Junkermier contends that the District Court\u2019s ruling is wrong because the \u201camount of the salary is not the consideration for the [Covenant], the employment itself is.\u201d Junkermier claims that the Employment Agreement was an enforceable contract, supported by adequate consideration, because Former Shareholders had employment and they had been compensated for their work through the end of their employment. Junkermier points out that Former Shareholders admitted as much in their counterclaims when they asserted that the parties mutually agreed upon a compensation amount and that they were compensated for their employment at Junkermier. Junkermier accordingly claims that the agreement was not merely an agreement to agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">\u00b624 Junkermier contends also that the District Court erred in determining that the Employment Agreement was a contract of adhesion because Former Shareholders were not just Junkermier employees, but officers, shareholders, and a director. The Employment Agreement, Junkermier maintains, was effectively an agreement that Former Shareholders entered into with themselves as owners of Junkermier. Junkermier contends that Former Shareholders\u2019 bargaining power precludes a conclusion that the Employment Agreement was an adhesion contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">\u00b625 Former Shareholders counter that the Employment Agreement\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>compensation term does not include the amount of compensation or a mode or means to calculate it. Therefore, Former Shareholders claim that the agreement does not include all of an employment contract\u2019s essential terms and therefore is unenforceable. Former Shareholders argue that the Employment Agreement is merely an agreement to agree because it left the compensation to be determined later. Former Shareholders also contend that the Employment Agreement is a contract of adhesion because they \u201chad no meaningful choice in signing\u201d the agreement, they were in a weaker bargaining position, and the agreement\u2019s terms are more favorable to Junkermier.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">I. Whether the Employment Agreement was an agreement to agree</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">\u00b626 \u201cBoth the existence of a contract and its interpretation are questions of law which we review for correctness.\u201d <em>Hurly v. Lake Cabin Dev., LLC, </em>2012 MT 77, \u00b6 14, 364 Mont. 425, 276 P.3d 854. In order to be binding, \u201c[a] contract must contain all its essential terms.\u201d <em>Hurly, </em>\u00b6 17 (citation and internal quotations omitted). A contract\u2019s essential elements include \u201ca sufficient cause or consideration.\u201d Section 28-2-102(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">\u00b627 Consideration is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-7\">Any benefit conferred or agreed to be conferred upon the promisor by any other person, to which the promisor is not lawfully entitled, or any prejudice suffered or agreed to be suffered by the person, other than prejudice that the person is at the time of consent lawfully bound to suffer, as an inducement to the promisor is a good consideration for a promise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">Section 28-2-801, MCA.

The Employment Agreement specifies the parties\u2019 performance obligations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>to each other: Junkermier would employ and compensate Former Shareholders, and Former Shareholders would provide professional services, would not disclose confidential information, and would not compete without paying liquidated damages. And, to quote Former Shareholders\u2019 counterclaims, the Stock Agreement and the Employment Agreement \u201cwere interdependent. The execution of one of the Agreements <em>was consideration </em>for the execution of the other Agreement.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Not only was each Former Shareholder paid a salary, each was issued stock in Junkermier as called for by the Stock Agreement once he or she became an employee under the Employment Agreement. Clearly, Junkermier and Former Shareholders, \u201ceach as to the other, confer[red] some legal benefit and/or incur[red] some detriment as an inducement to performance.\u201d <em>State Pub.

A court will find a contract unconscionable, however, \u201cif the bargaining process itself had some inherent unfairness that actually prevented the contract from being freely negotiated and thus defeated the principle of freedom of contract.\u201d <em>Arrowhead Sch. Dist. No. 75, </em>\u00b6 49. A contract is unconscionable if: (1) it is a contract of adhesion, and (2) the contractual terms unreasonably favor the drafter. <em>Arrowhead Sch. Dist. No. 75, </em>\u00b6 48. Here, the District Court found that the Employment Agreement was a contract of adhesion; we therefore analyze the unconscionability inquiry\u2019s first factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">\u00b634 A contract of adhesion is \u201ca standard form contract prepared by one party, to be signed by the party in a weaker position (usually a consumer), who adheres to the contract with little or no choice about its terms.\u201d <em>Graziano v. Stock Farm Homeowner\u2019s Ass\u2019n, </em>2011 MT 194, \u00b6 18, 361 Mont. 332, 258 P.3d 999 (citation omitted). \u201cDisparity in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>bargaining power is an essential element of a contract of adhesion.\u201d <em>Day v. CTA, Inc., </em>2014 MT 119, \u00b6 10, 375 Mont. 79, 324 P.3d 1205. Yet, mere disparity \u201cin bargaining power does not equate to unenforceability and not all standardized contracts are unenforceable as adhesion contracts.\u201d <em>Denton v. First Interstate Bank of Commerce, </em>2006 MT 193, \u00b6 33, 333 Mont. 169, 142 P.3d 797.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">\u00b635 Granted, the Employment Agreement was a standard form contract\u2014each Junkermier shareholder signed the same Employment Agreement. Missing, however, is the essential disparity in bargaining power between the parties. For starters, Former Shareholders are not \u201cunsophisticated and unsuspecting ordinary citizens\u201d entering into a contract \u201cas part of the intercourse of daily life.\u201d <em>Kloss v. Edward D. Jones &amp; Co., </em>2002 MT 129, \u00b6 55, 310 Mont. 123, 54 P.3d 1. Rather, they are \u201csophisticated business personl s I\u201d who entered into contracts to which they had been subject the entire time they worked at Junkermier. <em>Denton, </em>\u00b6 33. Former Shareholders point to no evidence that shows that they \u201crequired specific protection or [were] improvident in [their] business dealings.\u201d <em>Denton, </em>\u00b6 33. To the contrary, the evidence shows that Former Shareholders all have extensive accounting experience and were sophisticated and shrewd enough to form and run a new accounting firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">\u00b636 In addition, Former Shareholders were not merely Junkermier employees\u2014they owned nearly fifteen percent of Junkermier\u2019s shares at the time they left; Former Shareholder Bateson was on Junkermier\u2019s board of directors immediately prior to the split; and Former Shareholder Alborn was on Junkermier\u2019s board of directors from 2006-2012 and was the branch manager for Junkermier\u2019s Bozeman office at the time of the split. Former Shareholders\u2019 bargaining power is readily distinguishable from the disparity between parties in cases recognizing adhesion contracts. <em>E.g., Kelker v. Geneva-Roth Ventures, Inc., </em>2013 MT 62, \u00b6 31, 369 Mont. 254, 303 P.3d 777 (concluding that \u201c[n]o doubt exists that [a payday lending company] afforded [a consumer] no opportunity to negotiate the terms of the [payday loan] contract\u201d); <em>Woodruff v. Bretz, Inc., </em>2009 MT 329, \u00b6\u00b6 9-10, 353 Mont. 6, 218 P.3d 486 (concluding that a purchase contract between a consumer and a motor home dealer \u201ceasily falls within\u201d the adhesion contract definition in part because the consumer \u201cwas the weaker party to the transaction\u201d and had a \u201c \u2018relative lack of sophistication\u2019 \u201d); <em>Kloss, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 27, 37 (concluding that agreements between a financial service provider and \u201ca 95 year old widow with no bargaining power and a relative lack of sophistication in such matters\u201d were \u201cclearly contracts of adhesion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>\u00b637 The fact that Former Shareholders Uithoven, Bateson, and Veltkamp were involved in the merger between Junkermier and the Veltkamp Firm in 2002 casts further doubt on Former Shareholders\u2019 contentions that the Employment Agreement was an adhesion contract. Former Shareholder Bateson testified that he participated in the merger negotiations and \u201cdid the due diligence\u201d for the merger. The merger agreement\u2019s terms explicitly provided, \u201cEach employee of [the Veltkamp Firm] that remains in the employ of [Junkermier] shall sign both an Employment Agreement and Confidentiality Agreement.\u201d Junkermier\u2019s CEO during the merger, Robert Nebel, testified that the Veltkamp Firm reviewed the Employment Agreement during the merger negotiations. The merger agreement provided further that the former Veltkamp Firm members had the option of splitting from Junkermier within eighteen months of its effective date if they \u201cdetermine^] that [the] Merger [was] not in their best interest.\u201d Former Shareholders Uithoven, Bateson, and Veltkamp did not determine that the Employment Agreement was not in their best interest during the eighteen months they were subject to it and could have opted out. They therefore had a \u201cmeaningful choice regarding [the Employment Agreement\u2019s] acceptance.\u201d <em>Highway Specialties, Inc. v. State, </em>2009 MT 253, \u00b6 16, 351 Mont. 527, 215 P.3d 667 (concludingthat an adhesion contract is one in which \u201cthe weaker bargaining party had no meaningful choice regarding its acceptance\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"aq2-dedup-0\">\u00b638  We conclude that the District Court erred in determining that the Employment Agreement was an unenforceable adhesion contract. The Employment Agreement is an enforceable contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">C. The Covenant</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">\u00b639 Contracts that restrain trade are \u201cstrongly disfavor[ed].\u201d <em>Access Organics, Inc. v. Hernandez, </em>2008 MT 4, \u00b6 17, 341 Mont. 73, 175 P.3d 899. Consequently, covenants are to be construed \u201cstrictly\u201d and \u201cin favor of rather than against the interest of the\u201d party who is subject to the covenant. <em>Access Organics, Inc., </em>\u00b6 17 (citation and internal quotations omitted). Covenants that act as an absolute prohibition on trade\u2014absent an express statutory exception\u2014are void. Section 28-2-703, MCA; <em>Mungas v. Great Falls Clinic, LLP, </em>2009 MT 426, \u00b6\u00b6 37-38, 354 Mont. 50, 221 P.3d 1230. Yet, when \u201ca contract contains a restraint on a person\u2019s ability to practice their profession, but such restraint is not an absolute prohibition,\u201d a determination must be made as to the covenant\u2019s reasonableness. <em>Mungas, </em>\u00b6 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">\u00b640 Here, the District Court concluded, and we agree, that the Covenant only partially restrains trade. The Covenant is not an absolute prohibition on Former Shareholders\u2019 right to engage in their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>profession. Nor does it prohibit them from competing with Junkermier. Rather, the Covenant requires Former Shareholders to pay liquidated damages if they provide services to a Junkermier client within one year of their departure from the firm. Because the Covenant is not an absolute prohibition, it cannot be declared invalid as a matter of law. <em>Mungas, </em>\u00b6 38. Rather, when a covenant only partially restrains trade, we have repeatedly examined the following factors, articulated in <em>Dobbins, </em>to determine the reasonableness of an employment agreement\u2019s covenant not to compete:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-4\">1) The covenant should be limited in operation either as to time or place;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-5\">2) the covenant should be based on some good consideration; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-6\">3) the covenant should afford a reasonable protection for and not impose an unreasonable burden upon the employer, the employee or the public.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-7\"><em>E.g., Mungas, </em>\u00b6 39; <em>Access Organics, Inc., </em>\u00b6 16; <em>Mont.

The <em>Dobbins </em>test \u201crequires a balancing of the competing interests of the public as well as the employer and employee\u201d in order to determine whether a covenant constitutes a restraint on trade prohibited by \u00a7 28-2-703, MCA. <em>Dobbins, </em>218 Mont. at 397, 708 P.2d at 580.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">\u00b641 Junkermier asserts that the District Court erred by not determining whether the Covenant was reasonable under <em>Dobbins </em>and its progeny. Junkermier contends that the Covenant is similar to other covenants that this Court has determined are partial restraints on trade. Junkermier asserts that the Covenant satisfies the <em>Dobbins </em>test as a matter of law because the Covenant was limited as to both time and place, it was based on consideration, and the Covenant serves a legitimate business interest. Accordingly, Junkermier asserts that the Covenant is reasonable and should have been enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">\u00b642 Former Shareholders contend first that the Covenant does not apply because the Employment Agreement expired by its terms. Given the use of the terms \u201cterminated\u201d and \u201cexpired\u201d in the Employment Agreement, the common meaning of the terms, and Junkermier\u2019s own interpretation of the terms, F ormer Shareholders argue that this Court should construe the Covenant to be applicable only if Junkermier terminated the Employment Agreement. Former Shareholders contend next that questions of fact prevent a conclusion that the Covenant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>supported by adequate consideration or that it was reasonable. Finally, Former Shareholders allege that Junkermier did not have a legitimate business interest in the Covenant because its actions following Former Shareholders\u2019 departure demonstrate that the Covenant was not necessary to protect its goodwill, customer relations, and trade information.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">\u00b643 Both parties rely on <em>Wrigg v. Junkermier, Clark, Campanella, Stevens, P.C., </em>2011 MT 290, 362 Mont. 496, 265 P.3d 646, to support their respective arguments regarding the Covenant\u2019s reasonableness. In <em>Wrigg, </em>an accountant who was subject to the same Junkermier covenant at issue here was informed that her employment agreement would not be renewed. <em>Wrigg, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 5-6. The \u201cdispositive issue\u201d in <em>Wrigg </em>was whether an employer could \u201cenforce a covenant not to compete when the employer ends the employment relationship\u201d\u2014an issue that had not yet been addressed by this Court. <em>Wrigg, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 2-3, 40. We held squarely that our analysis of a covenant\u2019s enforceability \u201capplies to both a terminated contract and an expired contract.\u201d <em>Wrigg, </em>\u00b6 42. We concluded that \u201cI w|hether [Junkermier] terminated the [contract], or it expired under its own terms, proves immaterial to our analysis.\u201d <em>Wrigg, </em>\u00b6 42. The District Court correctly rejected Former Shareholders\u2019 contentions that the Covenant does not apply here because the Employment Agreement expired and was not terminated. The \u201cinterdependent\u201d Stock Agreement also helps to show that whether the Employment Agreement expired or was terminated by one party, both parties retained continuing obligations to each other. That agreement required Junkermier to redeem Former Shareholders\u2019 shares after they retired, \u201cwhether voluntary or otherwise,\u201d or began working at another accounting firm. None of these obligations under the Stock Agreement, nor of those under the Covenant, would materialize unless and until the employment relationship was severed. Former Shareholders\u2019 claims that the Employment Agreement\u2019s expiration terminated the obligations between them and the firm are inconsistent and we reject their argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">\u00b644 We considered in <em>Wrigg </em>our statement in <em>Dobbins </em>that a covenant must \u201creasonably be related to a \u2018legitimate business interest.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wrigg, </em>\u00b6 22 (quoting <em>Dobbins, </em>218 Mont. at 397, 708 P.2d at 580). We made that observation in <em>Dobbins </em>while analyzing the \u201cessential\u201d components of a reasonable covenant. <em>Dobbins, </em>218 Mont. at 396-97, 708 P.2d at 580. We said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-6\">in the absence of a controlling statute the enforceability of a covenant not to compete, ancillary to the withdrawal of a partner from an accounting firm, depends upon whether the restriction is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>reasonably related to the legitimate business interest of the remaining partners and is not unduly burdensome to the covenantor or the public.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-4\"><em>Dobbins, </em>218 Mont. at 397, 708 P.2d at 580.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">\u00b645 In the context of Wrigg\u2014where it was the employer who terminated the employment relationship\u2014we highlighted \u201cthe requirement that an employer must establish a legitimate business interest\u201d in order for a covenant to be enforceable. <em>Wrigg, </em>\u00b6 22. We observed that \u201ca legitimate business interest [is] an interest that must necessarily be enforced to protect the basis of the employer\u2019s bargain.\u201d <em>Wrigg, </em>\u00b6 24 (citing Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 188 cmt b. (1981)). Because an employee has \u201clittle disincentive\u201d to take \u201ceconomic advantage of his employer),] [a] covenant may be necessary ... to prevent an employee from exploiting his employment to later compete and capture the employer\u2019s market.\u201d <em>Wrigg, </em>\u00b6 25. A covenant protects the employer\u2019s interest against an \u201cemployee appropriating valuable trade information, good will, and customer relationships to compete directly against\u2014and take business from\u2014his former employer.\u201d <em>Wrigg, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">\u00b646 We analyzed cases from various jurisdictions demonstrating that determining whether a covenant serves a legitimate business interest requires the court to weigh a number of factors relating to the employer\u2019s and the employee\u2019s interests. <em>Wrigg, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 26-36. We noted that courts enforce covenants when employers demonstrate an interest in protecting themselves from employees who use \u201ccustomer relationships and information acquired during the employment relationship to compete directly against [their] former employer.\u201d <em>Wrigg, </em>\u00b6 26. In contrast, we noted that courts object to covenants when employers cannot demonstrate that a covenant is needed \u201cto protect customer relationships or valuable trade information.\u201d <em>Wrigg, </em>\u00b6 28. We opined further that when an employee initiates termination of an employment relationship that is subject to a covenant, the employee\u2019s interests are diminished because \u201c[t]he employee makes an informed decision ... about the risks associated with a covenant\u2019s enforcement and voluntarily chooses to encounter those risks.\u201d <em>Wrigg, </em>\u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">\u00b647 We pointed out in <em>Wrigg </em>that the language of the <em>Dobbins </em>factors \u201cdoes not <em>explicitly </em>require that an employer possess a legitimate interest in the covenant.\u201d <em>Wrigg, </em>\u00b6 22. (Emphasis added.) But when the employer discontinues the relationship, consideration of its legitimate business interest is inherent in the court\u2019s balancing and examination of \u201cthe competing interests of the public as well as the employer and employee.\u201d <em>Dobbins, </em>218 Mont. at 397, 708 P.2d at 580; <em>see Wrigg, </em>\u00b6 22 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>(concluding that establishing a legitimate business is \u201cimplicit in the <em>Dobbins </em>analysis\u201d). That balancing process is undertaken within the framework of the <em>Dobbins </em>test. <em>See Myers v. Howmedia Osteonics Corp., </em>2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 42583, 25-27 (D. Mont. 2016) (analyzing under the <em>Dobbins </em>test\u2019s third element whether an employer that terminated the employment relationship had a legitimate interest in a covenant).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">\u00b648 Balancing the <em>Dobbins </em>factors requires a particularized inquiry into the facts and circumstances of a particular case. <em>Daniels, </em>246 Mont, at 144, 804 P.2d at 370 (concluding that \u201cunder certain factual circumstances a covenant restraining a lawful profession ... may be acceptable if it passes\u201d the <em>Dobbins </em>reasonableness analysis). Here, protecting the basis of Junkermier\u2019s bargain may justify restrictions against unfettered access to confidential information and established business relationships by Former Shareholders who, without such a restriction, have no disincentive to take advantage of their former employer. Equally, the court must consider Former Shareholders\u2019 interests in being able to continue their profession and their clients\u2019 ability to maintain the trusted relationships they may have built with their personal accountants. The court must balance the nature of Former Shareholders\u2019 relationships with their clients with the protectable interest in Junkermier\u2019s client base.</p>\n<p id=\"AqHr\">\u00b649  The District Court did not analyze any of these considerations under <em>Dobbins </em>because it held the contract unenforceable. This was error. Such an inquiry is \u201ca factual determination.\u201d <em>Mungas, </em>\u00b6 39; <em>accord Daniels, </em>246 Mont. at 144, 804 P.2d at 370 (concluding that \u201cunder certain factual circumstances a covenant... may be acceptable if it passes a three part test of reasonableness\u201d). Accordingly, we remand to the District Court to undertake a <em>Dobbins </em>analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">\u00b650 <em>2. Whether the District Court erred in concluding that only one Former Shareholder breached a fiduciary duty and that Junkermier failed to prove awardable damages from that breach.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">A. Breach of fiduciary duty</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">\u00b651 The District Court made a number of determinations in addressing Junkermier\u2019s breach of fiduciary duty claim. First, the court concluded that Junkermier is not a closely held corporation because its ownership and management are not substantially the same. The court grounded this conclusion on its finding that\u2014prior to Former Shareholders leaving\u2014Junkermier had twenty-six shareholders but was governed by a six-member board of directors and was managed by a chief executive officer. The District Court next found that Former Shareholders were unaware that they were considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>Junkermier vice-presidents, that none of them were ever assigned any duties as vice-presidents, and that Junkermier\u2019s bylaws required the board to appoint shareholders as vice-presidents, which it failed to do. The court therefore concluded that Former Shareholders were not Junkermier officers and consequently owed no legal duty to Junkermier as officers. Similarly, the court concluded that Former Shareholders did not breach any duties as Junkermier employees prior to the termination of their employment because it found no evidence that Former Shareholders solicited other employees to leave Junkermier, solicited clients to leave Junkermier, or misappropriated any business opportunity of Junkermier.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">\u00b652 The court concluded further that Former Shareholder Bateson did not breach a duty to Junkermier as a director because he had resigned from the board in early June 2013 and there was no evidence that he took any action that could be considered a breach of fiduciary duty prior to that time. The court did conclude, however, that Former Shareholder Alborn breached his duty to Junkermier as a branch manager given that he actively participated in planning the split from Junkermier, created the \u201cto do list,\u201d and directed an employee to download the client list. But the court found that Alborn\u2019s breach of his duty to Junkermier was \u201clargely offset by the subsequent acts of [Junkermier].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">\u00b653 Junkermier asserts several points of error in these rulings. First, while Junkermier agrees that it is not a statutory close corporation under \u00a7 35-9-102, MCA, it asserts that it is a close corporation because its management and ownership are substantially identical and its shares are not publicly traded. As a close corporation, Junkermier contends that Former Shareholders owed fiduciary duties of the \u201cutmost good faith and loyalty\u201d to Junkermier, which they breached by acting for their personal gain. Junkermier contends further that even if it was not a close corporation, the District Court erroneously found that Former Shareholders were not Junkermier officers. Junkermier argues therefore that the District Court erred in concluding that Former Shareholders did not breach their fiduciary obligations as officers. Finally, Junkermier asserts that as employees Former Shareholders owed a duty not to violate Junkermier\u2019s bylaws and agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">\u00b654 Former Shareholders respond that Junkermier is not a close corporation because, contrary to Junkermier\u2019s assertions, such a determination does not \u201cturn on the fact that a corporation\u2019s shares are not publicly traded or are not readily marketable.\u201d Rather, Former Shareholders argue, a close corporation is one in which management <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>and ownership are substantially identical. Former Shareholders emphasize that the court\u2019s determination on this point is supported by substantial evidence, and therefore is not clearly erroneous. Next, Former Shareholders claim that the District Court correctly concluded that they did not owe Junkermier a fiduciary duty as shareholders or as officers. Furthermore, Former Shareholders contend, the District Court did not err in determining that Bateson did not breach a fiduciary duty as a director because, as the court found, he resigned as director in early June and his actions before his resignation were in good faith. Former Shareholders do not cross-appeal the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Alborn breached his fiduciary duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">\u00b655 A corporation that does \u201cnot elect to become a statutory close corporation under the Montana Close Corporation Act, \u00a7\u00a7 35-9-101 et seq., MCA,\u201d still may be considered a close corporation. <em>Warren v. Campbell Farming Corp., </em>2011 MT 324, \u00b6 10, 363 Mont. 190, 271 P.3d 36; <em>accord Daniels, </em>246 Mont. at 134, 804 P.2d at 364. It is well-established that \u201c[a] close corporation is one in which management and ownership are substantially identical to the extent that it is unrealistic to believe that the judgment of the directors will be independent of that of the stockholders.\u201d <em>Warren, </em>\u00b6 27 (quoting <em>Skierka v. Skierka Bros., Inc., </em>192 Mont. 505, 519, 629 P.2d 214, 221 (1981)) (internal quotations omitted). We have characterized a close corporation relationship as \u201cclosely approximatl ingI the relationship between partners.\u201d <em>Daniels, </em>246 Mont. at 136-37, 804 P.2d at 366 (citing Fox <em>v. 7L Bar Ranch, </em>198 Mont. 201, 212-13, 645 P.2d 929, 935 (1982)). While \u201cclose corporations often utilize share transfer restrictions,\u201d we have underscored that this is \u201c|b lecause ownership and management are so intimately related in such entities.\u201d <em>Gray v. Harris Land &amp; Cattle Co., </em>227 Mont. 51, 53, 737 P.2d 475, 476 (1987). The relationship between management and shareholders is therefore the key component in determining whether a corporation is closely-held. <em>See Fox, </em>198 Mont. at 213, 645 P.2d at 935 (citations omitted) (\u201cThe enterprise before us is a \u2018close corporation\u2019 in the strictest sense, that is, one in which, regardless of the distribution of the shareholdings, \u2018management and ownership are substantially identical.\u2019 \u201d); <em>see also Warren, </em>\u00b6 27; <em>Gray, </em>227 Mont. at 53, 737 P.2d at 476; <em>Skierka, </em>192 Mont. at 519, 629 P.2d at 221.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">\u00b656 In determining that Junkermier is not a close corporation, the District Court made the following findings: that Junkermier had twenty-six shareholders but was managed by a CEO and governed by six directors; that Junkermier\u2019s bylaws allowed for twenty-five director positions, but it opted not to have that many directors; and that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>major reason for Former Shareholders\u2019 decision to leave Junkermier was because they felt that shareholders had been removed from the firm\u2019s decision-making processes. A review of the record demonstrates that these findings were supported by substantial evidence. Junkermier has not demonstrated clear error in the District Court\u2019s finding that Junkermier\u2019s ownership and management are not substantially the same. Based on that finding, the District Court did not err in concluding that Junkermier is not a close corporation. We affirm its holding that Former Shareholders did not owe Junkermier a fiduciary duty in their capacity as shareholders. <em>Cf. Daniels, </em>246 Mont. at 136, 804 P.2d at 366 (citation omitted) (concluding that \u201cthe fiduciary duty between stockholders of a close corporation is one of the \u2018utmost good faith and loyalty\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">\u00b657 Junkermier also urges that Former Shareholders owed a fiduciary duty as officers. Section 35-1-236(2), MCA, provides that \u201c[t]he bylaws of a corporation may contain any provision for managing the business and regulating the affairs of the corporation that is consistent with law or the articles of incorporation.\u201d \u201cIt is a well[-]established precedent that the bylaws of a corporation ... constitute a contract between the member and the corporation.\u201d <em>Walker v. Helena Ass\u2019n of Realtors tm, Inc., </em>2000 MT 343, \u00b6 16, 303 Mont. 224, 15 P.3d 414 (quoting <em>Appeal of Two Crow Ranch, Inc., </em>159 Mont. 16, 23, 494 P.2d 915, 919 (1972)); <em>accord </em>18A Am. Jur. 2d <em>Corporations </em>\u00a7 264 (\u201cThe bylaws of a corporation constitute part of a binding broader contract among the directors, officers, and stockholders formed within the statutory framework of the state.\u201d). The interpretation of a contract is a question of law that we review for correctness. <em>Hurly, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"aol-dedup-0\">\u00b658  Junkermier\u2019s bylaws provide that all \u201cshareholders not elected by the board [as other officers] shall be appointed vice-president by the board upon initial receipt of stock.\u201d This provision does not deem shareholders to be officers, but\u2014as the District Court determined\u2014requires \u201cboard action\u201d for a shareholder to be appointed an officer of Junkermier. Our review of the record demonstrates that the District Court did not misapprehend the effect of the evidence or make a clear mistake in finding that there were no director meeting minutes evidencing Former Shareholders\u2019 appointment \u201cas vice-presidents upon the initial receipt of their respective stock, or at any other time,\u201d and that Junkermier \u201coffered no evidence of any such board action.\u201d The District Court properly determined that Former Shareholders were not Junkermier officers. We thus affirm its ruling that Former Shareholders did not breach a fiduciary duty as officers. \u00b659 Finally, we are unpersuaded by Junkermier\u2019s contention that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>Former Shareholder Bateson breached a fiduciary duty as a Junkermier director. Montana statute provides general standards of care for directors of corporations. Section 35-1-418, MCA. The standards apply, however, only if the person is acting as a director. <em>Cf. </em>\u00a7 35-1-418(4), MCA (\u201cA director is not liable for any action <em>taken as a </em>director... if the director performed the duties of the director\u2019s office in compliance with this section.\u201d (Emphasis added)). The District Court therefore concluded correctly that it could consider whether Bateson breached a duty as a director up until the point he resigned from the board in early June 2013. The record supports the District Court\u2019s factual findings that there was no evidence that Bateson breached a fiduciary duty during the time he was a director. We conclude that the District Court did not err in determining that Bateson did not breach a fiduciary duty to Junkermier.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">\u00b660 The District Court likewise did not err in concluding that Former Shareholders\u2014other than Alborn\u2014did not breach any duties as Junkermier employees. The court\u2019s findings that there was no evidence that, prior to leaving Junkermier, Former Shareholders solicited other employees to leave Junkermier, solicited any Junkermier clients, misappropriated any Junkermier trade secrets, or usurped any Junkermier business opportunity are supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">\u00b661 In sum, we conclude that the District Court did not err in determining that only Former Shareholder Alborn breached a fiduciary duty to Junkermier.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">B. Damages stemming from Alborn\u2019s breach</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">\u00b662 The District Court concluded first that under \u00a7 27-1-317, MCA, Junkermier had the burden of proving both causation and damages stemming from Alborn\u2019s breach of fiduciary duty. The court concluded further that Junkermier\u2019s damages claims must be supported by substantial evidence and that damages may not be awarded absent such proof. Next, the court found that Junkermier\u2019s damages claims for breach of fiduciary duty were based on the Covenant. The court therefore concluded that \u201c[t]he claim for breach of fiduciary duty cannot be used as a basis for attempting to recover damages specified in an unenforceable contract.\u201d Finally, the court determined that Junkermier\u2019s damages claim\u2014which the court characterized as 100% of gross fees billed under the Covenant\u2014was not a proper measure of damages because it represented Junkermier\u2019s loss of anticipated gross income, was predicated on gross receipts of business, and was the \u201cproduct of a mere guess or speculation.\u201d Accordingly, the District Court concluded that Junkermier failed to support its damage claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>with substantial evidence and was not entitled to collect any damages stemming from Alborn\u2019s breach of fiduciary duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">\u00b663 To begin with, our conclusion that the Employment Agreement is an enforceable contract repudiates much of the District Court\u2019s damages analysis. The court clearly tied its damages analysis to its determination that the Employment Agreement was unenforceable. Because we are remanding for analysis of the <em>Dobbins </em>factors, we reverse the District Court\u2019s ruling. If the court concludes that the Covenant is valid under <em>Dobbins, </em>further analysis of damages may be unnecessary. If, in contrast, the court rejects the Covenant on the basis of its <em>Dobbins </em>reasonableness analysis, the court must reanalyze damages stemming from Alborn\u2019s breach of fiduciary duty. In doing so, the District Court must consider the effect of Junkermier\u2019s evidence regarding the value of the business it lost stemming from Alborn\u2019s breach, the recurring loss of business caused by the breach, and whether Junkermier has proven that loss with reasonable certainty. \u00b664 It is undisputed that Alborn breached his fiduciary duty to Junkermier. Thus, it is undisputed that Alborn is liable to Junkermier for that breach. \u201cOnce liability is shown, that is the certainty that damages are caused by the breach, then loss of profits on a reasonable basis for computation and the best evidence available under the circumstances will support a reasonably close estimate of the loss by a District Court.\u201d <em>Sebena v. AAA, </em>280 Mont. 305, 310, 930 P.2d 51, 54 (1996) (quoting <em>Stensvad v. Miners &amp; Merchants Bank, Etc., </em>196 Mont. 193, 206, 604 P.2d 1303, 1310 (1982)). Upon remand, if necessary, the District Court shall determine \u201cthe amount which will compensate [Junkermier] for all the detriment proximately caused\u201d by Alborn\u2019s breach, \u201cwhether it could have been anticipated or not.\u201d Section 27-1-317, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">\u00b665 We reverse the District Court\u2019s ruling that the Employment Agreement is not an enforceable contract. We affirm the District Court\u2019s ruling that Former Shareholders, other than Alborn, owed Junkermier no fiduciary duty. We reverse the court\u2019s ruling on damages resulting from Alborn\u2019s breach of fiduciary duty. We therefore reverse the judgment of the District Court and remand for the court to analyze the Covenant\u2019s reasonableness under <em>Dobbins </em>and, if necessary, to analyze Junkermier\u2019s damages stemming from Alborn\u2019s breach of fiduciary duty.</p>\n<judges id=\"b511-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES McKINNON, COTTER, SHEA, RICE and WHEAT concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b491-13\"> Appellees are Albom, Uithoven, Riekenberg, P.C., Terry Alborn, Paul Uithoven, Christina Riekenberg, Joe Bateson, and ShermVeltkamp.
