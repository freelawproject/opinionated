We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>Commissioner raises several issues, which we restate as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-4\">\n<em>1. Does Krakauer, a Colorado resident, have standing to avail himself of the right to know granted under Article II, Section 9 of the Montana Constitution?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-5\">\n<em>2. Is the release of records responsive to Krakauer\u2019s request prohibited by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA), as amended, and/or by \u00a7 20-25-515, MCA?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-6\">\n<em>3. How does Article II, Section 9 of the Montana Constitution apply to the request for release of the subject student records?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-7\">\n<em>4. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it awarded attorney fees and costs to Krakauer?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">Because we remand for further proceedings, we do not address the merits of the attorney fee issue. We vacate the fee award so that the matter may be reconsidered upon conclusion of the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">\u00b62 This is a dispute over release of student records related to allegations of sexual assault occurring near the Missoula campus of the University of Montana (University). The underlying allegations of the case were part of a broader campus cultural concern that garnered local and national media attention. Krakauer, a journalist and resident of Colorado, conducted an investigation and published a book chronicling instances of alleged sexual misconduct on or near the University campus. This case involves one of those instances. When Krakauer\u2019s request for release of certain student records related to the matter was denied by the Commissioner, Krakauer initiated this action by filing a petition in the First Judicial District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-11\">\u00b63 In support of his petition, Krakauer submitted documents that the United States District Court for the District of Montanahad previously unsealed and released. <em>Doe v. Univ. of Mont., </em>No. CV 12-77-M-DLC, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 88519 (D. Mont. June 26, 2012), <em>available at </em>https://perma.cc/3RRE-ETXB.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There, a student (Doe) initiated the action under seal, seeking a preliminary injunction halting the University\u2019s disciplinary proceedings against him. The documents, now part of the record here, indicate that after a female student made an allegation that Doe had raped her in an off-campus apartment, the University initiated an investigation into a possible violation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>Student Conduct Code. Dean of Students Charles Couture determined that Doe committed sexual intercourse without consent, and as sanctions, recommended Doe\u2019s immediate expulsion from the University and restriction from all University property and University-sponsored events. Doe, represented by counsel, appealed the Dean\u2019s determination to the University Court, a body made up of faculty, staff, and students appointed to hear disciplinary matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">\u00b64 The University Court conducted a hearing and concluded by a 5-2 vote that Doe had committed sexual intercourse without consent, and further concluded by a unanimous vote of 7-0 that he should be sanctioned by expulsion from the University. Pursuant to the Student Conduct Code, Doe requested that the University Court\u2019s determination be reviewed by President Engstrom. President Engstrom\u2019s review considered whether the evidence provided a reasonable basis for the findings and disciplinary sanction, and whether procedural errors were so substantial as to deny a fair hearing to either party. President Engstrom upheld the University Court\u2019s findings and proposed sanction, and found no procedural error that denied a fair hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">\u00b65 As the final step in the disciplinary appeal process, Doe appealed President Engstrom\u2019s decision to the Commissioner, whose office acknowledged receipt of the appeal. This is the last step in the process documented in the records released by the U.S. District Court in <em>Doe. </em>Nothing more is documented there or in the record here about the Commissioner\u2019s subsequent actions in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">\u00b66 Krakauer filed a request with the Commissioner\u2019s office on January 17, 2014, naming a particular student and asking for \u201cthe opportunity to inspect or obtain copies of public records that concern the actions of the Office of the Commissioner of Higher Education in July and August 2012 regarding the ruling by the University Court of the University of Montana in which student... was found guilty of rape and was ordered expelled from the University.\u201d Krakauer asserted factual connections between the federal <em>Doe </em>case and a highly-publicized state criminal proceeding that had been initiated against the then-starting quarterback of the University\u2019s football team. He maintained that the student Doe and the quarterback were the same person, and his request to the Commissioner named the student specifically. Krakauer postulated that the Commissioner must have overturned the University Court\u2019s and President Engstrom\u2019s decision and sanction of expulsion, noting that the student had \u201cremained in school and continued to participate as the Grizzly quarterback.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">\u00b67 The Commissioner refused to acknowledge that such records existed, and further refused to permit inspection or release of any such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>documents, asserting that federal and state law prevent him from doing so. Krakauer initiated this action on February 12, 2014, citing the right to know under the Montana Constitution. Upon cross-motions for summary judgment, and after holding a hearing, the District Court granted summary judgment to Krakauer, and ordered the Commissioner to \u201cmake available for inspection and/or copying within 21 days\u201d the requested records, with students\u2019 names, birthdates, social security numbers, and other identifying information redacted.</p>\n<p id=\"Atzn\">\u00b68 The Commissioner appealed and we initially dismissed the case without prejudice, as the District Court had not yet entered an order addressing the attorney fee issue. The District Court awarded fees to Krakauer on June 19,2015, and the Commissioner again undertook an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">\u00b69 \u201cWe conduct de novo review of summary-judgment orders, performing the same analysis as does a district court pursuant to Rule 56 of the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure.\u201d <em>Lorang v. Fortis Ins. Co., </em>2008 MT 252, \u00b6 36, 345 Mont. 12, 192 P.3d 186 (citing <em>LaTray v. City of Havre, </em>2000 MT 119, \u00b6 14, 299 Mont. 449, 999 P.2d 1010).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">\u00b610 Substantively, Krakauer\u2019s Petition was based upon the constitutional right to know, and the Commissioner likewise raises constitutional issues. \u201cOur review of questions involving constitutional law is plenary. A district court\u2019s resolution of an issue involving a question of constitutional law is a conclusion of law which we review to determine whether the conclusion is correct.\u201d <em>Bryan v. Yellowstone Cnty. Elementary Sch. Dist. No. 2, </em>2002 MT 264, \u00b6 16, 312 Mont. 257, 60 P.3d 381 (internal citation omitted) (citing <em>Schuff v. A.T. Klemens &amp; Son, </em>2000 MT 357, \u00b6 28, 303 Mont. 274, 16 P.3d 1002).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">\u00b611 <em>1. Does Krakauer, a Colorado resident, have standing to avail himself of the right to know granted under Article II, Section 9 of the Montana </em>Constitution?</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">\u00b612 The Commissioner argues that Krakauer, as a resident of Colorado, does not have standing to pursue his Petition, because he is not a party intended to benefit from the Montana Constitutional right to know provision, and related statutes. The Commissioner argues this privilege was created and enacted for the sole benefit of Montana citizens, to allow them access to the workings of their own government.</p>\n<p id=\"AHF\">\u00b613 In <em>Schoof v. Nesbit, </em>2014 MT 6, 373 Mont. 226, 316 P.3d 831, we clarified the standing requirements, and more specifically the required showing for injury, under Article II, Section 9 of the Montana <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>Constitution. After doing so for purposes of that case, we noted, \u201cIt is not appropriate in this case to address the parameters of standing for right to know and right of participation claims that may arise in other contexts.\u201d <em>Schoof, </em>\u00b6 25. Later the same year, we addressed another standing argument related to Article II, Section 9 of the Montana Constitution, in <em>Shockley v. Cascade Cnty., </em>2014 MT 281, 376 Mont. 493, 336 P.3d 375. There, we held that the Montana Constitution does not prohibit a citizen of one Montana county from requesting public documents from a public body in another county. <em>Shockley, </em>\u00b6 22. We declined to address \u201cthe question of whether standing extends beyond Montana citizensl. I\u201d <em>Shockley, </em>\u00b6 23. That question arises here.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">\u00b614 Article II, Section 9 of the Montana Constitution is short and clear. \u201cNo person shall be deprived of the right to examine documents or to observe the deliberations of all public bodies or agencies of state government and its subdivisions, except in cases in which the demand of individual privacy clearly exceeds the merits of public disclosure.\u201d The Commissioner asks this Court to consider that, while the actual constitutional language uses the word \u201cperson,\u201d the enabling statutes use the word \u201ccitizen\u201d in describing the persons having the right to inspect public documents. <em>Compare </em>\u00a7 2-6-102, MCA (2013) (\u201cEvery citizen has a right to inspect and take a copy of any public writings of this state ....\u201d) (repealed 2015), <em>and </em>2015 Mont. Laws 1484, 1486 (effective date Oct. 1,2015) (\u201cExcept as provided in subsections (2) and (3), every person has a right to examine and obtain a copy of any public information of this state.\u201d). The Commissioner also cites to the use of the word \u201ccitizen\u201d in transcripts of debates about the issue during the Montana Constitutional Convention.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">\u00b615 As we have previously stated, Article II, Section 9 of the Montana Constitution is \u201cunambiguous and capable of interpretation from the language of the provision alone.\u201d <em>Great Falls Tribune Co. v. Day, </em>1998 MT 133, \u00b6 30, 289 Mont. 155, 959 P.2d 508 (citing <em>Great Falls Tribune v. District Court of Eighth Judicial Dist., </em>186 Mont. 433, 437, 608 P.2d 116, 119 (1980)). We have also stated that the provision is \u201cunique, clear and unequivocal,\u201d and that \u201c[w]e are precluded, by general principles of constitutional construction, from resorting to extrinsic methods of interpretation.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Associated Press v. Bd. of Pub. Educ., </em>246 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>Mont. 386, 391, 804 P.2d 376, 379 (1991). We thus rely on the language of the provision itself, which expressly provides that \u201cno person\u201d shall be deprived of the right to examine documents or observe the deliberations of public bodies, except when required by the demands of individual privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"afp-dedup-0\">\u00b616  \u201cSince the alleged injury is premised on the violation of constitutional and statutory rights, standing depends on \u2018whether the constitutional or statutory provision ... can be understood as granting persons in the plaintiff s position a right to judicial relief.\u2019\u201d <em>Schoof, </em>\u00b6 21 (citing <em>Warth v. Seldin, </em>422 U.S. 490, 500, 95 S. Ct. 2197, 2206 (1975)). Therefore, under the plain language of the provision, we hold that Krakauer, though an out-of-state resident, has standing to invoke the right to know guarantees under Article II, Section 9 of the Montana Constitution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">\u00b617 <em>2. Is the release of records responsive to Krakauer\u2019s request prohibited by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA), as amended, and/or by \u00a7 20-25-515, MCA?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">\u00b618 The Commissioner contends that because Krakauer\u2019s records request referenced a student by name, FERPA prohibits his office from releasing any records responsive to Krakauer\u2019s request. The Commissioner argues that \u00a7 20-25-515, MCA, likewise prohibits him from releasing the requested records. Krakauer responds that FERPA is essentially spending clause legislation that does not actually prohibit the University or the Commissioner from releasing records, that one of the explicit exceptions to FERPA\u2019s general prohibition on the release of student records applies in this context, and that \u00a7 20-25-515, MCA, actually permits the release of the requested records.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">a. General Applicability of FERPA</p>\n<p id=\"acn-dedup-1\">\u00b619 Krakauer argues that FERPA \u201csimply does not prohibit anything\u201d; it merely conditions federal funding on confidentiality compliance. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>cites to <em>Bd. of Trs. v. Cut Bank Pioneer Press, </em>2007 MT 115, \u00b6 24, 337 Mont. 229, 160 P.3d 482, where we stated that FERPA has been described as \u201cspending legislation.\u201d Krakauer contends that the Commissioner\u2019s fear of losing federal funding is \u201cwholly speculative,\u201d and points out that, in its amicus brief, the United States has conspicuously refrained from \u201cany claim or assertion that ... the [Montana University System] will suffer any penalty\u201d if it releases the requested documents. Krakauer asserts that \u201cFERPA\u2019s spending legislation merely sets conditions on the receipt of federal funds and cannot forbid or prohibit any state action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">\u00b620 Congress enacted FERPA to \u201cprotect the privacy of students and their parents.\u201d <em>Pioneer Press, </em>\u00b6 24; <em>see also </em>34 C.F.R. \u00a7 99.2 (\u201cThe purpose of this part is to set out requirements for the protection of privacy of parents and students ....\u201d). FERPA prohibits educational institutions and agencies from having a policy or practice of releasing education records or personally identifiable information contained in education records, and conditions receipt of federal monies on those institutions\u2019 compliance with its directives. <em>See </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g. The University, as a recipient of federal funds, agreed in its Program Participation Agreement to comply with \u201cThe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 and the implementing regulations... [,] \u201d and thereby assumed the risk the Secretary of Education would withhold future funds in the event of substantial non-compliance. <em>See </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1234c(a)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">\u00b621 Krakauer is seeking records related to a specific student\u2019s disciplinary proceedings, and the Commissioner argues that Krakauer\u2019s particular request fell squarely under FERPA\u2019s prohibitions. The Commissioner offers that another kind of request would have been handled differently by his office: \u201cIf Krakauer had wanted an understanding of how the Commissioner\u2019s office handles appeals related to student conduct code complaints ..., he could have requested all decisions resolving complaints for some appropriate specified period of time, and he would have received the Commissioner\u2019s decisions for a variety of cases with the names, dates and any other personally identifiable information redacted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AU9Q\">\u00b622  Title 20, Section 1232g(a)(4)(A) of U.S. Code provides: \u201cFor the purposes of this section, the term \u2018education records\u2019 means,..., those records, files, documents, and other materials which\u2014(i) contain information <em>directly related to a </em>student; and (ii) are maintained by an educational agency or institution or by a person acting for such agency or institution.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In <em>Pioneer Press, </em>\u00b6 27, we noted that several jurisdictions had interpreted the term \u201ceducation records\u201d to exclude disciplinary records. However, since that decision, as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>Commissioner and amicus United States point out, not only have FERPA regulations been broadened, but courts have recognized that disciplinary records constitute \u201ceducation records\u201d under FERPA. <em>See State ex rel. ESPN, Inc. v. Ohio State </em>Univ., 970 N.E.2d 939, 946-47 (Ohio 2012) (\u201cwe agree with the Sixth Circuit and hold that the [student disciplinary] records here generally constitute \u2018education records\u2019 subject to FERPA.... The records here\u2014insofar as they contain information identifying student-athletes\u2014are directly related to the students\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> FERPA regulations also now confirm that disciplinary records fall within the purview of the Act, authorizing limited, non-consensual release of student disciplinary records in certain circumstances. <em>See, e.g., </em>34 C.F.R. \u00a7 99.31(a)(13) &amp; (14). Based upon the understanding that the term \u201ceducation records\u201d encompasses disciplinary records, the Commissioner correctly asserted that the records at issue here fall under the application of FERPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">\u00b623 It is also apparent to us that the Commissioner, as Chief Executive Officer of the Montana University System (MUS), was properly cognizant of the heavy strings that FERPA attached to the MUS\u2019 federal funding. Although FERPA has been characterized as \u201cspending legislation,\u201d we find Krakauer\u2019s argument that it \u201cprohibits nothing\u201d delusive. FERPA is more than mere words in the wind. As outlined above, the University, a unit of the MUS, promised to abide by FERPA\u2019s directives in exchange for federal funding. By signing the Program Participation Agreement, the University acknowledged the potential consequence of loss of federal funding in the event that it violated FERPA. <em>See United States v. Miami Univ., </em>294 F.3d 797, 808 (6th Cir. 2002) (\u201cEven in the absence of statutory authority, the United States has the inherent power to sue to enforce conditions imposed on the recipients of federal grants. \u2018Legislation enacted pursuant to the spending power[, like the FERPA,] is much in the nature of a contract: in return for federal funds, the States agree to comply with federally imposed conditions.\u2019 \u201d) (citing <em>Pennhurst State Sch. &amp; Hosp. v. Halderman, </em>451 U.S. 1, 101 S. Ct. 1531 (1981)). Whether or not FERPA explicitly prohibits state action, the financial risk it imposes upon MUS for violation of the statute is a real one. As the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>Commissioner stated, \u201cThe MUS should not be put in the position of predicting what decisions might be made by the federal government.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">b. Applicability of FERPA to the Subject Documents</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">\u00b624 FERPA prohibits institutions from having a \u201c \u2018policy or practice of permitting the release of education records (or personally identifiable information contained therein ...) of students without the written consent of the students or their parents.\u2019 \u201d <em>Miami Univ., </em>294 F.3d at 806 (internal brackets omitted) (citing 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g(b)(1)). The regulation defines \u201cPersonally Identifiable Information\u201d to include information such as a student\u2019s name, family names, date of birth, or \u201cother information that, alone or in combination, is linked or linkable to a specific student that would allow a reasonable person... to identify the student with reasonable certainty).]\u201d 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 99.3 <em>(see </em>\u201cPersonally Identifiable Information\u201d at (a)-(f)). Since our decision in <em>Pioneer Press, </em>this definition has been expanded to include \u201cI i Information requested by a person who the educational agency or institution reasonably believes knows the identity of the student to whom the education record relates.\u201d 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 99.3 <em>(see </em>\u201cPersonally Identifiable Information\u201d at (g)). The records in question facially fall within the restrictions of FERPA, and the Commissioner rightly considered FERPA\u2019s requirements in determining whether to release them. As noted by amicus United States, \u201cI Wlhere a request targets education records relating to a particular student, identified by name, FERPA\u2019s protections unquestionably apply.\u201d Under these provisions, had the Commissioner released the documents that Krakauer originally requested, using the specific student\u2019s name, he would have violated the statute. FERPA and its accompanying regulatory scheme, including its expanded definition of \u201cPersonally Identifiable Information,\u201d prohibited the unilateral release of the requested documents by the Commissioner, as Krakauer clearly knew the identity of the student that he named specifically in his request.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">c. Exceptions Permitting Release Under FERPA</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">\u00b625 While FERPA generally prohibits the release of student educational records and personally identifiable information in those records, the records do not necessarily recede into the recesses of Chateau d\u2019lf, never to see the light of day. FERPA contains several non-consensual exceptions that permit an institution to release educational records. <em>See, e.g., </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g(b)(l)(c); 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">\u00b626 Krakauer argues that the requested records must be made available under the exception that provides for release of the final results of a disciplinary proceeding \u201cif the institution determines as a result of that disciplinary proceeding that the student committed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>violation of the institution\u2019s rules or policies with respect to such crime or offense.\u201d 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g(b)(6)(B).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He argues that the exception \u201cexplicitly authorizes disclosure of records related to the Commissioner\u2019s decision since it is, undisputedly, the \u2018final result\u2019 of the [MUSJ\u2019s disciplinary proceeding against [the named student].\u201d The information permitted to be released under this exception is limited, as \u201cfinal results\u201d include \u201conly the name of the student, the violation committed, and any sanction imposed by the institution on that studentl, I\u201d and other information, including \u201cthe name of any other student, such as a victim or witness,\u201d can only be released upon the written consent of those other persons. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g(b)(6)(C)(i)-(ii). As noted by the Commissioner, this narrow exception permits release of limited information about \u201ca violation\u201d of certain University rules, and the sanction imposed. Thus, if no violation was found to have occurred, this exception, by its own terms, would not apply. The record before us here does not indicate whether the Commissioner ultimately held that a violation occurred, and thus, we are unable to now determine whether this exception authorized release of limited information related to Krakauer\u2019s request. However, upon remand and after conducting an <em>in camera </em>review of the records, the District Court may consider the applicability of this exception along with the other considerations set forth below.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">\u00b627 Additionally, FERPA authorizes release of personally identifiable information in education records when \u201csuch information is furnished in compliance with judicial order, or pursuant to any lawfully issued subpoena, upon condition that parents and the students are notified<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of all such orders or subpoenas ....\u201d 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g(b)(2)(B); 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 99.31(a)(9)(i). This exception broadly permits release of personally identifiable information pursuant to a \u201cjudicial order, or pursuant to any lawfully issued subpoena,\u201d neither restricting the orders to those issued by particular, such as federal, courts nor limiting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>the legal basis or grounds for release of the records. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g(b)(2)(B). FERPA thus generally authorizes the release of records upon orders from courts acting properly within their jurisdiction. Krakauer\u2019s petition sought an order pursuant to this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">d. Section 20-25-515, MCA</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">\u00b628 Notably, Montana law operates similarly to FERPA. Chapter 357, Laws of Montana (1973), was entitled \u201cAn Act Requiring Montana Colleges and Universities to Develop Procedures to Protect a Student\u2019s Rightto Privacy Concerning... His College or University Records,\u201d and stated it was \u201cthe legislature\u2019s intent that an institution of the university system of Montana is obligated to respect a student\u2019s right to privacy\u201d in the student\u2019s records. 1973 Mont. Laws 706. As codified from that 1973 Act, \u00a7 20-25-515, MCA, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-6\">A university or college shall release a student\u2019s academic record only when requested by the student or by a subpoena issued by a court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction. A student\u2019s written permission must be obtained before the university or college may release any other kind of record unless such record shall have been subpoenaed by a court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ayn\">State law thus also prohibits disclosure of student records, but, similar to FERPA, permits release when \u201csubpoenaed by a court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction.\u201d Section 20-25-515, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">\u00b629 Krakauer argues that \u00a7 20-25-515, MCA, \u201cdoes not condition a university\u2019s disclosure of student records on a court order. It merely requires a subpoena, which in Montana can be effectuated at any time by an issuing party\u2019s counsel of record.\u201d The Commissioner replies that, under Krakauer\u2019s interpretation, the statute would have no meaning because \u201ca party would only need to file a lawsuit and request the records through subpoena,\u201d and, in any event, the District Court did not issue a subpoena here.</p>\n<p id=\"axh-dedup-0\">\u00b630  The District Court ordered the records be made available for inspection in its Memorandum and Order, not by a subpoena. Answering the Commissioner\u2019s argument, a reading of the statute as enacted in 1973 makes it clear that the Legislature intended student records would be subject to release following legal process conducted \u201cby a court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction,\u201d and did not intend to restrict that legal process exclusively to the issuance of a \u201csubpoena,\u201d the purpose of which is to compel a person\u2019s attendance in a court or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>proceeding. <em>See </em>\u00a7 26-2-102, MCA. The statute is satisfied by the issuance of a court order upon completion of that legal process. Answering Krakauer\u2019s argument, merely filing a lawsuit and requesting a records subpoena without a court\u2019s consideration of a student\u2019s privacy interests would fail to satisfy the statute\u2019s requirements that student privacy be protected and that release of records be prohibited until a court or tribunal conducts that legal process. In Montana, the law regarding a student\u2019s privacy is governed by the Montana Constitution, by which a student\u2019s right to privacy in his or her records is balanced against the public\u2019s right to know and obtain the records. That process must be completed before requested records can be released pursuant to the applicable judicial exceptions in FERPA and \u00a7 20-25-515, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">\u00b631 <em>3. How does Article II, Section 9 of the Montana Constitution apply to the request for release of the subject student records </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">\u00b632 The Commissioner challenges the District Court\u2019s determination that the student records at issue should be released, arguing that the court \u201cincorrectly shifted the balance between the right to privacy and the right to know in favor of Krakauer and his book deal and against the well-established privacy rights of the student named in his reque.stl. I\u201d In response, Krakauer argues that the public\u2019s right to know outweighs the privacy expectation in the records here because the specific student at issue has a diminished expectation of privacy, which the District Court correctly determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">\u00b633 The District Court emphasized the public exposure of the events in question, noting that \u201cthe entire incident, from the initial administrative investigation to the conclusion of the criminal trial, is a matter of public record. The only aspect of the lengthy process that is not a matter of public record is the action taken by the Commissioner.\u201d Citing approvingly of the U.S. District Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Doe </em>that \u201cwhile there may be good reasons to keep secret the names of students involved in a University disciplinary proceeding, the Court can conceive of no compelling justification to keep secret the manner in which the University deals with those students,\u201d the District Court determined that the subject student \u201cdoes not have a reasonable expectation of privacy regarding the redacted records of the Commissioner,\u201d and therefore ruled that the merits of public disclosure outweighed \u201cthe individual privacy rights of the student in this case.\u201d The court did not conduct an <em>in camera </em>review of the records, but broadly ordered the Commissioner \u201cto make available for inspection and/or copying\u201d to Krakauer the records responsive to his request, subject to redaction of student identification information, presumably to be accomplished by the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>\u00b634 Our concerns over the principles applied by the District Court in the constitutional balancing process, as well as the unique considerations under the federal and state law applicable to student records, compel us to reverse the District Court\u2019s order and to remand this matter with instructions to the District Court to conduct an <em>in camera </em>review of the requested records, and to re-apply the constitutional balancing test to those records in accordance with the following analysis of the interests here at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">\u00b635 Article II, Section 9 of the Montana Constitution provides that \u201c[n]o person shall be deprived of the right to examine documents ... of all public bodies or agencies of state government and its subdivisions, except in cases in which the demand of individual privacy clearly exceeds the merits of public disclosure.\u201d As we have explained, \u201c[t]his constitutional provision generally requires information regarding state government to be disclosed to the public, except in cases where the demand of individual privacy clearly exceeds the merits of public disclosure.\u201d <em>Associated Press, </em>Inc., \u00b6 24. Indeed, \u201cour constitution gives a high priority to the public\u2019s right to know.\u201d <em>Lence v. Hagadone Inv. Co., </em>258 Mont. 433, 447, 853 P.2d 1230, 1239 (1993), <em>overruled on separate grounds by Sacco v. High Country Indep. Press, </em>271 Mont. 209, 896 P.2d 411 (1995). Krakauer asserts an interest in the process that the Commissioner employed in reviewing the student\u2019s appeal and points out: \u201cIt cannot be denied that the entire rape culture at the University, and universities in general, has become one of increasing public import and concern\u00ed,]\u201d and \u201cThe University\u2019s compliance with its Title IX obligations is also one of public import and interest.\u201d We acknowledge that Krakauer\u2019s interest in the MUS\u2019 policies in responding to and handling complaints of alleged sexual assault are important matters of concern to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">\u00b636 However, as the District Court correctly noted, \u201c[T]he right to know is not absolute. It requires a balancing of the competing constitutional interests in the context of the facts of each case, to determine whether the demands of individual privacy clearly exceed the merits of public disclosure.\u201d <em>Associated Press, Inc., </em>\u00b6 24 (bold in original) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Pursuant to the Montana Constitution, we have established a two-part test in order to strike a balance between the needs for government transparency and individual privacy: (1) \u201cwhether the person involved had a subjective or actual expectation of privacy I, I\u201d and (2) \u201cwhether society is willing to recognize that expectation as reasonable.\u201d <em>Great Falls Tribune Co. v. Day, </em>1998 MT 133, \u00b6 20, 289 Mont. 155, 959 P.2d 508 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">\u00b637 In the context of this particular case, as discussed above, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>national and state legislatures have taken the affirmative action of enacting legislation establishing the privacy interests of students in their records, as a matter of law. This action sets this case apart from others involving general privacy interests, and courts must honor the unique privacy protection legislatively cloaked around the subject records by factoring that enhanced privacy interest into the balancing test.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We have implicitly recognized this interest in the past, <em>Pioneer Press, </em>\u00b6 36, and since then, as noted above, stricter FERPA regulations have been adopted. We cite, merely for illustrative purposes because it does not contemplate Montana law, the phrasing of the increased burden that must be shown by a petitioner in order to access protected student records, provided by the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-4\">When a third-party seeks disclosure of education records covered by FERPA, the trial judge, in exercise of discretion, must conduct a balancing test in which the privacy interests of the students are weighed against the genuine need of the party requesting the information. <em>While FERPA does not create a privilege, it does represent the strong public policy of protecting the privacy of student records. </em>Courts balance the potential harm to the privacy interests of students with the importance and relevance of the sought information to resolving the claims before the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"avj-dedup-0\"><em>Moeck v. Pleasant Valley Sch. Dist., </em>No. 3:13-CV-1305, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 142431, at *6-7 (M.D. Pa. Oct. 7, 2014) (internal citations omitted) (emphasis added). This enhanced privacy interest must be considered and factored into the constitutional balancing test on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">\u00b638 The District Court should not have concluded, without noting the unique facts here, that the student at issue \u201cdoes not have a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>expectation of privacy regarding the redacted records of the Commissioner,\u201d in reliance on <em>Doe. </em>The U.S. District Court in <em>Doe </em>was not presented, as here, with a records request explicitly identifying a particular student. Rather, the <em>Doe </em>case involved an unnamed litigant. While redaction may have served to protect the privacy interest of the unnamed litigant in <em>Doe, </em>and may well provide a privacy safety net in many situations, redaction of records provided in response to a request about a particular student may well be completely futile. As amicus United States points out, \u201cwhen an educational institution is asked to disclose education records about a particular person, then no amount of redaction in [the] records themselves will protect the person\u2019s identity, because the requestor knows exactly whom the records are about.\u201d Obviously, records provided in response to a request naming a particular student will be about that student, whether redacted or not, and thus, there is more of machination than of cooperation in Krakauer\u2019s offer, repeated at oral argument, to accept redacted records in response to his request. Consequently, on remand, the District Court must consider whether the futility of redaction affects the privacy analysis and the ultimate determination about what records can be released, if any.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">\u00b639 We have recognized the efficacy of an <em>in camera </em>review of requested records by a district court to ensure that privacy interests are protected. <em>Billings Gazette, </em>\u00b6 42; <em>Jefferson Cnty. v. Mont. Standard, </em>2003 MT 304, \u00b6 19, 318 Mont. 173, 79 P.3d 805 (\u201cit is proper for a district court to conduct such an <em>in camera </em>inspection in order to balance the privacy rights of all of the individuals involved in the case against the public\u2019s right to know.\u201d). As these cases note, <em>in camera </em>review is particularly appropriate when the interests of third parties are involved. As the Commissioner stated at oral argument, the requested records could also include information pertaining to student members of the University Court, the victim, and other University students who acted as witnesses in the multiple-step process, and counsel hinted that the records are extensive. On remand, the District Court should review the requested documents <em>in camera, </em>and in the event it determines to release any document after conducting the balancing test, every precaution should be taken to protect the personal information about other persons contained in the documents.</p>\n<p id=\"AuTs\">\u00b640 We have stated that, when conducting the balancing test, a district court must consider all of the relevant facts of each case. <em>See Associated Press, Inc., </em>\u00b6 24 (\u201cIt requires a balancing of the competing constitutional interests in the context of the facts of each case, to determine whether the demands of individual privacy clearly exceed the merits of public disclosure.\u201d). Both parties argue at great length <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>about various factors at issue here, such as the publicity that has followed this case, the source of the original request, the reasons behind the request, the named student\u2019s status as an athlete at a publicly-funded university, and the prior litigation, all of which may be considered and weighted by the District Court when conducting the balancing test. We decline to address these issues individually in favor of the District Court\u2019s application of the balancing test on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"AEW\">\u00b641  Finally, the Commissioner argues that an order by the District Court requiring release of documents pursuant to Krakauer\u2019s request would \u201ccreate binding precedent\u201d establishing a \u201cpolicy or practice\u201d of the MUS to release personally identifiable information, in violation of FERPA. However, we disagree. As noted in <em>Miami University, </em>\u201cOnce the conditions and the funds are accepted, the school is indeed prohibited from <em>systematically </em>releasing education records without consent.\u201d 294 F.3d at 809 (emphasis added). A court order for release entered in one case does not require MUS to commence systematically releasing student records. Each case turns on its individual facts and circumstances, assessed and weighed through the balancing test. While court decisions do set precedent, MUS will nonetheless still evaluate each request on the basis of its individual facts, assessing the request in light of the precedent that has been created by litigation. This review is not a systematic policy or practice of releasing student records in violation of FERPA, which provides an exception for the release of such information \u201cin compliance with judicial order, or pursuant to any lawfully issued subpoena[.]\u201d 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g(b)(2)(B). If the MUS believes a request cannot be fulfilled without violating FERPA and state protections, that decision can be reviewed by the courts following the filing of a petition by either MUS or the requestor.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">\u00b642 Having concluded that the records in question in this case appear to fall under the \u201cPersonally Identifiable Information\u201d protection granted by FERPA, and also having concluded that FERPA and state statute provide an exception for release of information pursuant to a lawfully issued court order, we remand this case to the District Court for an <em>in camera </em>review of the documents in question. After giving due consideration to the unique interests at issue in this case, as discussed herein, the District Court will re-conduct the constitutional balancing test and determine what, if any, documents may be released and what redactions may be appropriate. As noted above, the exception to FERPA that allows for release of documents pursuant to a court order requires advance notice to the affected student or parents, and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>district court must comply with this directive before releasing protected information. <em>See Opinion, </em>\u00b6 27 n. 6.

Opinion, \u00b6 24. I depart from the Court, however, in our decision to remand for a determination of whether 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g(b)(6)(B) applies, which is part of FERPA and the regulatory scheme. Pursuant to this provision of FERPA, a university may disclose to the public the final results of disciplinary proceedings against an alleged perpetrator of a crime of violence or nonforcible sex offense, but only if the university determines that the student violated the university\u2019s rules or policies with respect to the offense. The Commissioner has stated on several occasions that this provision is inapplicable. As the Court states, \u201cif no violation was found to have occurred, this exception, by its own terms, would not apply.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 26. I therefore would not remand for the District Court to consider the applicability of this exception when counsel for the Commissioner has represented, following acknowledgment of the specific exception, the inapplicability of the subsection. Indeed, it is apparent that the reason Krakauer is interested in obtaining all of the student\u2019s records is that the Commissioner found no violation. Further, as the Court properly notes, this narrow exception would only permit release of limited information related to the name of the student, the violation committed, and any sanction imposed by the institution. Opinion, \u00b6 26. The record already establishes that no sanctions were imposed; the Commissioner has represented, through counsel, that the specific exception is inapplicable; and Krakauer\u2019s request identifies the student by name. It is therefore pointless to remand for an in camera review to determine whether the exception applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>\u00b646 Montana law also prohibits the Commissioner from releasing the student\u2019s academic records in response to Krakauer\u2019s request. Section 20-25-515, MCA, prohibits the release of a student\u2019s records absent consent of the student or \u201csubpoena [issued] by a court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction.\u201d At the time the Commissioner denied Krakauer\u2019s request, the student had not consented to the release of his records and a subpoena or court order had not issued. Therefore, the Commissioner correctly refused to disclose the student\u2019s academic records in response to Krakauer\u2019s request. The Court nonetheless fails to find that the Commissioner\u2019s actions in following both federal and state law within the context of a discretionary award of attorney fees pursuant to \u00a7 2-3-221, MCA, does not warrant a conclusion that Krakauer be responsible for his own fees and costs. Given the conclusion reached by the Court\u2014that the Commissioner was required to follow FERPA and \u00a7 20-25-515, MCA\u2014I would hold that the Commissioner is not responsible for Krakauer\u2019s fees and costs since Krakauer has pursued an exception to FERPA and Montana law. Given the context of FERPA, the federal regulatory scheme, and Montana law, it would be unreasonable to conclude that the Commissioner should be held responsible for Krakauer\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"A7P\">\u00b647 A larger concern, however, is the Court\u2019s decision to remand these proceedings for an in camera review by the District Court and our abbreviated analysis of the balancing test to be employed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the context of this particular case, we have left unanswered many of the questions raised by the parties which, in my opinion, were incorrectly resolved as a matter of law by the District Court. Our guidance to the District Court is essentially that, \u201c[t]his enhanced privacy interest must be considered and factored into the constitutional balancing test on remand.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 37. In an attempt to describe \u201cthis enhanced privacy interest,\u201d we cite \u201cphrasing\u201d from another jurisdiction, \u201cmerely for illustrative purposes,\u201d but are unwilling to a set forth a standard, rule, or appropriate analysis regarding a statutorily protected enhanced privacy interest. In my opinion, we have failed to address the parties\u2019 arguments. If correct legal principles and analyses are applied by this Court while considering the specificity of Krakauer\u2019s request, it is not necessary to remand these proceedings to the District Court for an in camera review and balancing of privacy interests and the right to know.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>\u00b648 When considering the disclosure of confidential information, the constitutional right to know granted by Article II, Section 9 of the Montana Constitution, must be balanced with the constitutional right of privacy granted by Article II, Section 10 of the Montana Constitution. We have stated that when balancing these competing interests, a court must perform a two-part test: (1) whether the individual has a subjective or actual expectation of privacy; and (2) whether society is willing to recognize that expectation as reasonable. <em>Bozeman Daily Chronicle v. City of Bozeman Police Dep\u2019t., </em>260 Mont 218, 225, 859 P.2d 435, 439 (1993). We have on many occasions determined that society is not willing to recognize as reasonable the privacy interest of individuals who hold positions of public trust when the information sought bears on that individual's ability to perform public duties. <em>See Great Falls Tribune v. Cascade Cnty. Sheriff, </em>238 Mont. 103, 107, 775 P.2d 1267, 1269 (1989) (the public\u2019s right to know outweighed the privacy interests of three disciplined police officers in the public release of their names because police officers hold positions of \u201cgreat public trust\u201d); <em>Bozeman Daily Chronicle, </em>260 Mont. at 227, 859 P.2d at 440-41 (investigative documents associated with allegations of sexual intercourse without consent by an off-duty police officer were proper matters for public scrutiny because \u201csuch alleged misconduct went directly to the police officer\u2019s breach of his position of public trust ...\u201d); <em>Svaldi v.

City of Billings, </em>2013 MT 334, \u00b6 49, 372 Mont. 409, 313 P.3d 129 (\u201can employee may have a lower expectation of privacy in misconduct related to a duty of public trust, such as responsibility for spending public money or educating children.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">\u00b649 These cases, referred to by the Court in the Opinion, \u00b6 37, n.8, are examples of a <em>reduced </em>expectation of privacy\u2014reduced because the privacy interest is unreasonable and therefore not one that society is willing to recognize. They are examples of how a reduced expectation of privacy is balanced against the right of the public to know how its public monies are spent or its public institutions are managed. Undisputedly public employees have no statutory protection for their privacy rights when the information relates to the ability of the individual to perform his public duties. <em>Bozeman Daily Chronicle, </em>260 Mont. at 226-27, 859 P.2d at 440-41. Here, in contrast, we are applying an enhanced privacy interest, with significant protections afforded that interest by the Montana Legislature in Title 20, Chapter 25. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>addition to \u00a7 20-25-515, MCA, prohibiting the release of student records unless there is consent or a lawfully issued subpoena, universities are prohibited from requiring students to waive privacy rights, \u00a7 20-25-512, MCA; students must be given written notice before university officials may enter their rooms, \u00a7 20-25-513, MCA; and academic transcripts may only contain information of an academic nature, \u00a7 20-25-516, MCA. The existence of these student privacy protections and the absence of any applicable exception establish both the actual expectation of privacy and the reasonableness of that expectation. Accordingly, when the privacy rights of the student may not be protected by redacting \u201cpersonally identifiable information\u201d the student\u2019s right of privacy in school records outweighs the public\u2019s right to know because that privacy interest has been statutorily determined to be reasonable. Once we have found an actual expectation of privacy that is reasonable, we must protect that privacy interest. <em>See Bozeman Daily Chronicle, </em>260 Mont. at 228, 859 P.2d at 441. (\u201cIn this case ... the victim of the alleged sexual assault and the witnesses involved in the investigation have a subjective or actual expectation of privacy which society is willing to recognize as reasonable. Accordingly, the privacy rights of the alleged victim and of the witnesses outweigh the public\u2019s right to know and must be accorded adequate protection in the release of any of the investigative documents at issue.\u201d) Thus, whenever we cannot adequately protect a recognized reasonable expectation of privacy, the records may not be disclosed. The Court has presented no authority to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">\u00b650 Montana law does not distinguish between types of students. The protected interest a student has in his education records is not diminished if the information is already public or if there has been publicity about an event involving the student. Information in a student disciplinary proceeding is broader than that presented in a criminal proceeding, where a defendant receives numerous constitutional and statutory protections. Student education records exist primarily to assist the university in the education of its students. The fact that information revealed through the evolution of a criminal proceeding may also be duplicated within the broader student disciplinary file is irrelevant to whether the student maintains his privacy rights in his education records. The occurrence of a criminal proceeding, which must be public, does not serve to strip a student\u2019s privacy interests from his confidential education files. The purposes and objectives underlying these separate proceedings are distinct and we should articulate as much for the trial courts. The laws protecting a student\u2019s education records are neither limited nor lessened because a student has been charged with a criminal offense or is being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>scrutinized by the media. This remains true even though that student may be a star quarterback for a Montana university, a redshirt freshman from a small, rural Montana town, or any other student in whom the public may have a particular interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">\u00b651 In agreeing with the Court that a student\u2019s education records enjoy \u201cthe unique privacy protection [that is] legislatively cloaked around the subject records,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 37, I do not contend that a student\u2019s privacy right is absolute. Many proceedings in other jurisdictions have balanced FERPA, state statutory provisions protecting the confidentiality of student records, and countervailing interests in disclosure <em>See Ragusa v. Malverne Union Free Sch. Dist., </em>549 F. Supp. 2d 288, 293-94 (E.D.N.Y. 2008) (ordering the production of relevant education records in a discrimination case); <em>Catrone v. Miles, </em>160 P.3d 1204, 1210-12 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2007) (holding that education records could be ordered to be produced in a medical malpractice case and noting \u201cthe protections afforded to educational records by statute do not prohibit, but rather permit, disclosure pursuant to court order\u201d); <em>Gaumond v. Trinity Repertory </em>Co., 909 A.2d 512, 518 (R.I. 2006) (holding that FERPA does not bar the production of relevant education records pursuant to court order in a personal injury case). In many of these instances, the records were relevant to litigation that did not involve the records themselves. <em>See Gaumond, </em>909 A.2d at 518 (distinguishingprior cases where public disclosure was sought by newspapers and was not granted).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">\u00b652 In the context of Krakauer\u2019s request for the specific student\u2019s records, the student\u2019s enhanced privacy interest would receive no protection. As the Court observes, \u201cI o Ibviou.sly, records provided in response to a request naming a particular student will be about that student ....\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 38. Here, Krakauer requested a specific student\u2019s records by name, because he wanted the specific student\u2019s records. Had he been interested in the process by which the Commissioner handled complaints of sexual assault, his request would not have been specific as to the student. Krakauer\u2019s request of the Commissioner was to \u201cinspect or obtain copies of public records that concern the actions of the Office of the Commissioner of Higher Education in July and August 2012, regarding the ruling by the University Court of the University of Montana in which student [name redacted] was found guilty of rape and expelled from the University.\u201d With the exception of 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g(b)(6)(B), which the Commissioner indicated was inapplicable, state and federal privacy laws clearly prohibited the Commissioner from disclosing the records based upon the specificity of the request. Significant to the resolution of these proceedings, Krakauer did <em>not </em>make his request in a manner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>which would allow the student\u2019s \u201cunique\u201d privacy right\u2014cloaked with legislative protection, Opinion, \u00b6 37\u2014to receive any semblance of protection through, for example, redaction of personally identifiable information. If Krakauer had wanted an understanding of how the Commissioner\u2019s office handles appeals related to the student conduct code and, in particular, sexual assaults, he could have requested all decisions resolving complaints for an appropriate specified period of time. Such an interest is substantial and appropriately protected by our constitutional and statutory provisions concerning the public\u2019s right to know. It is undisputed that the Commissioner would have responded to such a request by supplying the student education records with personally identifiable information redacted in a manner which would have also protected the student\u2019s substantial privacy interest in his education records. Thus, given the manner in which Krakauer has made his request, any \u201cbalancing\u201d of interests that could include protection of the student\u2019s enhanced privacy interest is unobtainable. It is clear that what Krakauer sought were particular student records for the publication of his book. Although this Court has precedent for the disclosure of confidential records of a particular person, those cases exist in the context of a reduced expectation of privacy of public employees. The student here is not a public employee, but a student\u2014and Montana law does not distinguish between types of students and their expectation of privacy. Their records are uniformly private. Disclosure here violates not just the federal protections provided by FERPA, but also our own law in Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"A5hP\">\u00b653 I would reverse the judgment of the District Court. I would conclusively decide the issue of attorney fees and costs in favor of the Commissioner. Remand for in camera review is not necessary given the manner in which the request for records was made and that, as a result, no protection can be accorded the student\u2019s substantial and weighty privacy interests. I would affirm on issue one.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b571-4\"> Krakauer arguably foreclosed his opportunity for an in camera review of the records when he represented to the District Court and this Court that an in camera review was not necessary.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
