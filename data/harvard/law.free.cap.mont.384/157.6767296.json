We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-12\">\u00b62 We restate the issues Kline presents for review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-13\">\n<em>1. Did the District Court err hy concluding S.K. was not legally accountable for Kline\u2019s incest?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-15\"><em>2. Was there sufficient evidence corroborating S.K.\u2019s </em>testimony?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-16\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b184-17\">\u00b63 On December 11, 2013, the State charged Kline by information with criminal distribution of dangerous drugs, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-9-101(1), MCA; endangering the welfare of children, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-622(3)(c), MCA; and incest, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-507, MCA. The information alleged Kline committed these offenses when he gave methamphetamine to S.K., Kline\u2019s biological daughter, on more than one occasion; allowed S.K. to ingest methamphetamine while in his care on more than one occasion; and had sexual intercourse or sexual contact with S.K.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>\u00b64 The District Court held a jury trial from May 27 to May 29, 2014. At trial, S.K. testified that, while she was 17 years old, Kline repeatedly recommended she try methamphetamine. She initially said no, but eventually said yes and tried the drug. She continued using methamphetamine with Kline, often in Kline\u2019s vehicle while it was parked at a local truck stop and casino. Kline\u2019s other daughter, S.K\u2019s younger sister (Sister), testified that she observed Kline give S.K. methamphetamine and observed Kline and S.K. smoking methamphetamine in the front seat of Kline\u2019s vehicle while she was in the back seat. S.K\u2019s blood tested positive for methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">\u00b65 S.K. testified that sometimes, when Kline parked at the truck stop and casino, Kline would go inside and gamble while S.K. waited alone in the vehicle. S.K could not go inside because she was underage. After Kline gambled, Kline and S.K. would have sexual intercourse in the vehicle. S.K. testified that she and Kline had consensual sexual intercourse every day for around two months, sometimes in Kline\u2019s vehicle and sometimes in the bed they shared while intermittently living at Kline\u2019s parent\u2019s house. S.K. testified that she first disclosed her incestuous relationship in several text messages she sent to her cousin, some of which read \u201cI had sex with my dad like 100 times,\u201d \u201cIt was my choice,\u201d and \u201cI was high on that white shit.\u201d S.K. testified that she sent text messages with similar content to Sister, who in turn notified their mother (Mother).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">\u00b66 The jury returned verdicts of guilty for each of the three felony offenses charged. The District Court sentenced Kline to concurrent terms of twenty years for criminal distribution of dangerous drugs, five years for endangering the welfare of children, and life imprisonment for incest.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">\u00b67 Kline appeals only his incest conviction on the grounds that S.K., his 17-year-old daughter, was legally accountable for Kline\u2019s conduct when he had sexual intercourse with her. Kline argues that S.K. was legally accountable for his incest and, as a result of her accountability, the State was required to provide evidence corroborating her testimony and he was entitled to a jury instruction cautioning the jurors to view S.K\u2019s testimony with distrust.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">\u00b68 Prior to trial, the State filed a motion in limine requesting the District Court preclude Kline \u201cfrom arguing and/or introducing evidence that [S.K.] is an accomplice to the crime of <em>Incest </em>or that she is in any way legally accountable for [Kline\u2019s] conduct for the crime.\u201d Kline objected to the State\u2019s motion and argued that S.K. was legally accountable for his incest. The District Court concluded S.K. was Kline\u2019s victim, stating, \u201cIt\u2019s illegal for relatives to have sex with each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>other. It\u2019s incest. They are each other\u2019s victims.\u201d The District Court concluded S.K, as Kline\u2019s victim, was not legally accountable for Kline\u2019s conduct and granted the State\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">\u00b69 At trial, Kline raised the issue of S.K.\u2019s legal accountability for his incest when he moved for a directed verdict of acquittal on the incest charge because the State failed to present evidence of incest corroborating S.K\u2019s testimony. The District Court denied Kline\u2019s motion. Kline also requested a jury instruction directing the jury to view S.K\u2019s testimony with distrust because she was legally accountable. The District Court refused to give that instruction. Kline appeals. On appeal, Kline argues the District Court erred in granting the State\u2019s motion in limine, denying his motion for a directed verdict of acquittal, and refusing to instruct the jury on accountability. The errors Kline asserts are all premised upon the District Court\u2019s initial conclusion that S.K. was not legally accountable because she was a victim under \u00a7 45-2-302(3)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">\u00b610 A District Court\u2019s interpretation of a statute is reviewed for correctness. <em>Payne v. Knutson, </em>2004 MT 271, \u00b6 14, 323 Mont. 165, 99 P.3d 200 (citations omitted). We conduct a de novo review of the record for sufficient evidence. <em>State v. Bekemans, </em>2013 MT 11, \u00b6 18, 368 Mont. 235, 293 P.3d 843 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">\u00b611 <em>Did the District Court err by concluding S.K. was not legally accountable for Kline\u2019s </em>incest?</p>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">\u00b612 \u201cA person commits the offense of incest if the person knowingly marries, cohabits with, has sexual intercourse with, or has sexual contact, as defined in 45-2-101, with an ancestor, descendant, a brother or sister of the whole or half blood, or any stepson or stepdaughter.\u201d Section 45-5-507(1), MCA. Pursuant to \u00a7 45-5-507(2), MCA, \u201c[cjonsent is a defense ... to incest with or upon a stepson or stepdaughter, but consent is ineffective if the victim is less than 18 years old.\u201d The parties maintain that subsection (2) applies only to incest involving stepchildren and that it is therefore not applicable to the circumstances here. We agree. Additionally, the penalty provisions of \u00a7 45-5-507, MCA, are graduated and dependent upon the age of the participants, distinguishing when the \u201cvictim\u201d is under 16 years of age or under 12 years of age. S.K. was 17 years old at the time of the offense and thus the provisions characterizing one of the participants as a \u201cvictim\u201d are similarly inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>\u00b613 \u201cUnder Montana criminal law, an individual is responsible for his or her own <em>conduct.\u201dIn re B.W., </em>2014 MT 27, \u00b6 18, 373 Mont. 409, 318 P.3d 682. In fact, pursuant to general maxims of jurisprudence, \u201c[n]o one should suffer for the act of another,\u201d and \u201c[a] person is not responsible for that which a person cannot control.\u201d Sections 1-3-211, -217, MCA. These maxims arise from fundamental principles in criminal law which seek to hold the primary perpetrator responsible for his or her own conduct in causing the criminal offense; that is, it is a basic precept that personal wrongdoing is a predicate to criminal punishment. The law recognizes, however, that circumstances may exist in which persons other than those actually committing the offense should nonetheless be held criminally culpable. \u201cOne may be responsible for the conduct of another only in limited circumstances.\u201d <em>B. W., </em>\u00b6 18. The theory of accountability, or accomplice liability, is one such limited circumstance and has its origins in early Anglo-American jurisprudence. Such a theory prevents secondary parties from escaping liability when they are as equally blameworthy for committing the crime as the perpetrator herself. Accountability theory evolved from and attempted to simplify intricate common law distinctions between principals in the first degree, principals in the second degree, accessories before the fact, and accessories after the fact. Thus, we have explained, \u201caccountability is not a separate offense from the crime for which the actor assumes accountability but \u2018is merely a conduit by which one is held criminally accountable for the acts of another.\u2019 \u201d <em>B. </em>W., \u00b6 19, (quoting State <em>v. Hatten, </em>1999 MT 298, \u00b6 50, 297 Mont. 127, 991 P.2d 939).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">\u00b614 Sections 45-2-301 and -302, MCA, entitled \u201cAccountability for conduct of another\u201d and \u201cWhen accountability exists,\u201d \u201cdescribe those circumstances in which liability may be based upon the conduct of another.\u201d <em>B.W., </em>\u00b6 18 (citation omitted). \u201cA person is responsible for conduct that is an element of an offense if the conduct is either that of the person or that of another and the person is legally accountable for the conduct as provided in 45-2-302, or both.\u201d Section 45-2-301, MCA. Section 45-2-301, MCA, provides that a person is \u201ceither:\u201d (1) <em>responsible </em>for their own conduct, \u201cor\u201d (2) <em>legally accountable </em>for the acts of another if \u00a7 45-2-302, MCA, applies.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Section 45-2-301, MCA, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>therefore encompasses both theories of criminal culpability \u2014 personal wrongdoing and accountability.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">\u00b615 Section 45-2-302, MCA, specifies when the accountability theory of culpability may be applied to hold one responsible for the conduct of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">A person is legally accountable for the conduct of another when:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-7\">(1) having a mental state described by the statute defining the offense, the person causes another to perform the conduct, regardless of the legal capacity or mental state of the other person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-8\">(2) the statute defining the offense makes the person accountable; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-9\">(3) either before or during the commission of an offense with the purpose to promote or facilitate the commission, the person solicits, aids, abets, agrees, or attempts to aid the other person in the planning or commission of the offense. However, a person is not accountable if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-10\">(a) the person is a victim of the offense committed, unless the statute defining the offense provides otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">Section 45-2-302, MCA. Accordingly, \u00a7 45-2-302, MCA, \u201creplaces all prior law regarding accessories. Under this section, any person who assists in the commission of a crime, either before or during the occurrence, other than the victim, is liable as a principal offender.\u201d Compiler\u2019s Comments to \u00a7 45-2-302, MCA, at 166 (2014 annotations). \u00b616 In recognition that a person responsible or accountable for an offense may be inherently untrustworthy and have a motive to testify untruthfully, \u00a7 46-16-213, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-12\">A person may not be found guilty of an offense on the testimony of one responsible or legally accountable for the same offense, as defined in 45-2-301, unless the testimony is corroborated by other evidence that in itself and without the aid of the testimony of the one responsible or legally accountable for the same offense tends to connect the defendant with the commission of the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APX\">Additionally, if \u201ca person legally accountable for the acts of the accused\u201d testifies, the jury must be instructed that the person\u2019s testimony \u201cought to be viewed with distrust.\u201d Section 26-1-303(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>\u00b617 Relying on \u00a7 45-2-302, MCA, Kline argues S.K. was legally accountable for his incest. Kline argues that, because S.K. was legally accountable, \u00a7 46-16-213, MCA, required the State to corroborate her testimony with other evidence of his incest, and \u00a7 26-1-303(4), MCA, required the jury be cautioned about her veracity. However, the District Court concluded S.K. was not legally accountable for Kline\u2019s incest, making the evidentiary corroboration and jury instruction unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">\u00b618 We agree with the District Court that S.K. was not legally accountable. Had the State chosen to charge S.K., it would have been incorrect to rely upon accountability theory to prosecute S.K. for incest. S.K. was responsible for her own commission of incest, and she was not simultaneously responsible under a theory of accountability for Kline\u2019s commission of incest. The rules governing legal accountability do not arise in circumstances where liability could be based on S.K\u2019s responsibility for her own conduct in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">\u00b619 The State did not prosecute S.K. The State\u2019s choice does not implicate whether or not she was also responsible for incest. In <em>State v. Harris, </em>1999 MT 115, \u00b6 22, 294 Mont. 397, 983 P.2d 881, the State prosecuted Harris for engaging in incest with his adopted daughter. Harris argued that the State\u2019s failure to prosecute his adopted daughter for her incest with him constituted disparate treatment of members of the same class and violated his constitutional right to equal protection. <em>Harris, </em>\u00b6 21. This Court disagreed. We concluded that the prosecutor had broad discretion to prosecute or not prosecute Harris\u2019 adopted daughter and Harris failed to show the prosecutor\u2019s decision was based on an arbitrary or unjustifiable standard. <em>Harris, </em>\u00b6 24. Here, the prosecutor\u2019s decision not to charge S.K. similarly demonstrates an appropriate exercise of its broad discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">\u00b620 S.K. was not legally accountable for Kline\u2019s incest under \u00a7 45-2-302, MCA, because 1) S.K. did not knowingly cause Kline to commit incest; 2) \u00a7 45-5-507, MCA, does not make S.K. accountable for Kline\u2019s conduct; and 3) S.K. did not purposefully solicit, aid, abet, agree, or attempt to aid Kline plan or commit incest. Instead, S-K. independently committed the actions proscribed by \u00a7 45-5-507, MCA, by knowingly having sexual intercourse with Kline. Therefore, although S.K. is responsible under \u00a7 45-2-301, MCA, the rules governing when \u201c[a] person is legally accountable for the conduct of another\u201d do not apply to S.K. or make her accountable for Kline\u2019s incest.</p>\n<p id=\"APe\">\u00b621  Incest is a qualitatively unique sexual offense because the act itself is unlawful whether or not it is consensual or a minor is involved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>and especially because it requires two participants. Accountability cannot be applied to the participants in incest because accountability is a theory of transferring culpability to a non-actor that is unnecessary where each participant is responsible for his or her own conduct and independently commits the offense. Instead, our case law suggests that accountability for incest requires three actors: two related participants engaging in sexual contact or sexual intercourse and a third party who in some manner either knowingly causes incest or solicits, aids, abets, agrees, or attempts to aid another in the planning or commission of incest.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">\u00b622 In <em>State v. Guill, </em>2011 MT 32, \u00b6 3, 359 Mont. 225, 248 P.3d 826, which we noted was \u201cfactually one of the more bizarre cases to reach this Court,\u201d a third party, Nicole, was convicted of incest by accountability for facilitating incest between her boyfriend and his daughter. Douglas Guill started molesting his daughter when she was six years old. <em>Guill, </em>\u00b6 27. Nicole and Douglas started dating and Nicole moved in with him, his children, and his then-wife, Candace, who was thereafter \u201crelegated to the status of an unseen domestic worker.\u201d <em>Guill, </em>\u00b6 12. \u201cNicole began participating in the sexual abuse\u201d of Douglas\u2019s daughter when she was eight years old and continuing until she was 22 years old. <em>Guill, </em>\u00b6 28. Together the three would regularly engage in behavior constituting sexual contact and sexual intercourse. <em>Guill, </em>\u00b6 28. Although Nicole did not commit incest, because, at the time, she was unrelated to Douglas\u2019s daughter by either blood or marriage, she was convicted of incest by accountability, among other offenses, for her sexual involvement with Douglas and his daughter. <em>Guill, </em>f 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">\u00b623 In another case of accountability for incest, <em>State v. Henderson, </em>265 Mont. 454, 457, 877 P.2d 1013, 1015 (1994), Henderson coerced his three stepchildren into undressing and simulating sex acts while he masturbated nearby. This Court overturned his conviction because the children\u2019s actions did not constitute the predicate offense of incest that was necessary to uphold his conviction for accountability for incest. <em>Henderson, </em>265 Mont. at 458, 877 P.2d at 1016. The children\u2019s actions did not constitute incest because incest requires sexual contact, which, under \u00a7 45-2-101(60), MCA, requires participation be motivated by either sexual arousal or gratification. <em>Henderson, </em>265 Mont. at 458, 877 P.2d at 1015. The children\u2019s actions did not constitute sexual contact because they did not \u201cengage in the touching for the purpose of sexual arousal or gratification.\u201d <em>Henderson, </em>265 Mont. at 458, 877 P.2d at 1016. Instead, evidence showed that the children were angry, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>embarrassed, and did not want to participate in the forced acts. <em>Henderson, </em>265 Mont. at 458, 877 P.2d at 1015-16. Under the circumstances, we concluded, \u201cthe State failed to introduce evidence on which the jury could find that the children committed the offense of incest and, therefore, Henderson could not be legally accountable for that offense.\u201d <em>Henderson, </em>265 Mont. at 458, 877 P.2d at 1016.</p>\n<p id=\"A-o-\">\u00b624  <em>Guill </em>and <em>Henderson </em>demonstrate that a person can be held accountable for incest under \u00a7 45-2-302, MCA, when the person is a third party to two related participants in incest and the person\u2019s conduct alone does not satisfy the offense. Here, S.K. was not a third party, but a participant in incest. In both <em>Guill </em>and <em>Henderson, </em>the person charged with incest by accountability had not committed incest. In <em>Guill, </em>Guill was not related to Douglas\u2019 daughter by either blood or marriage. In <em>Henderson, </em>Henderson did not have sexual contact or sexual intercourse with his stepchildren. Unlike in <em>Guill </em>and <em>Henderson, </em>here, S.K. was not a third party to incest, but personally responsible for every element of incest. Therefore, S.K. was not legally accountable for Kline\u2019s incest under \u00a7 45-2-302, MCA. The District Court did not err in granting the State\u2019s motion in limine and refusing to instruct the jury under \u00a7 26-1-303(4), MCA, because S.K. was not legally accountable.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">\u00b625 <em>2. Was there sufficient evidence corroborating S.K\u2019s testimony?</em></p>\n<p id=\"AF-\">\u00b626 Despite not being legally accountable, S.K. was responsible for incest and the State was required to provide \u201cother evidence that in itself and without the aid of the testimony of the one responsible or legally accountable for the same offense tends to connect the defendant with the commission of the offense.\u201d Section 46-16-213, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">\u00b627 The State presented evidence to the jury, through testimony from various witnesses other than S.K. Several of S.K.\u2019s family members testified. Sister testified that Kline and S.K. shared a bed, pillow, and blanket when they lived at Kline\u2019s parent\u2019s house in their \u201cback bedroom,\u201d even though an additional bed in the house was unoccupied. When S.K. needed to go to the police station to meet a detective, Kline testified that he dropped her off a half block away instead of accompanying her inside. He explained to the jury, \u201cI thought I was in trouble too, so I didn\u2019t want to go to jail that night.\u201d Kline\u2019s mother, testified that S.K. was very attached to Kline, was upset, cried, and called him when he left without her, and would accompany him to casinos and wait in the car \u201cfor hours on end\u201d while he gambled. Sister testified she disclosed to Mother that S.K. was smoking methamphetamine with Kline, cutting herself, and having an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>incestuous relationship with Kline. Mother testified that after she was notified, she took S.K. to the hospital to be examined by Douglas Dunham, a doctor of emergency medicine, and contacted local police.</p>\n<p id=\"Aal\">\u00b628 A detective and several medical professionals testified. Detective Ken Walund testified that Mother contacted him with concerns about Kline supplying drugs to, and having sex with, S.K. Detective Walund testified thatwhenhe interviewed S.K., S.K. disclosed using drugs and having sexual intercourse with Kline. Detective Walund testified that S.K. seemed \u201cvery embarrassed, shy, withdrawn,\u201d had difficulty answering his questions, and \u201c[s]he was blaming herself.\u201d Detective Walund testified that, during her interview, S.K. expressed that she did not want criminal charges brought against Kline. Detective Walund testified that he also interviewed Kline. During his interview with Kline, Detective Walund testified that Kline\u2019s reactions to the allegations were unexpected, \u201che got extremely nervous, fidgeting, no eye contact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AsF\">\u00b629  After examining S.K., Dr. Douglas testified that he diagnosed her with \u201cdepression, methamphetamine use and mood disorder.\u201d Sue Casey, a forensic interviewer and contractor with the Child Evaluation Center, testified that she interviewed S.K. Casey testified that, during her interview with S.K., S.K. seemed reluctant, which is a characteristic consistent with victims of sexual abuse. Casey testified that S.K. disclosed the sexual activity to her by writing down what had happened to her, while verbally expressing her embarrassment. Casey testified that when family members are involved in sexual abuse cases, the children are often groomed beforehand \u201c[a]nd kids, they crave the love and affection and attention from the parents, so it gets really confusing to them when those boundaries are just violated.\u201d We conclude the State presented sufficient evidence to the jury corroborating S.K.\u2019s testimony regarding incest. The District Court properly denied Kline\u2019s motion for a directed verdict of acquittal based on the State\u2019s failure to present corroborating evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">\u00b630 Finally, we take this opportunity to explain why both the State and the District Court reached the correct conclusion, that S.K. was not legally accountable, but for the wrong reasons. Section 45-2-302(3)(a), MCA, excepts victims from being legally accountable. The State and the District Court agree that S.K. was not accountable because she was Kline\u2019s victim under this exception, although they disagree about why she was his victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">\u00b631 Relying on <em>People v. Tobias, </em>21 P.3d 758 (Cal. 2001), the State argued S.K. was Kline\u2019s victim because she was under 18 years old. In <em>Tobias, </em>the defendant appealed his conviction for incest, \u201carguing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>among other things that the trial court should have instructed the jury to consider whether [defendant\u2019s daughter] was an accomplice.\u201d <em>Tobias, </em>21 P.3d at 760. Based on California\u2019s statutory scheme, which penalized sexual intercourse with someone under 18 years old, the California Supreme Court concluded, that a minor is a victim of incest, not an accomplice to incest. <em>Tobias, </em>21 P.3d at 762. Concluding defendant\u2019s daughter was a victim because of her age, the California Supreme Court affirmed the district court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on accomplices. <em>Tobias, </em>21 P.3d at 765.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">\u00b632 In contrast, relying on <em>State ex rel. Keyes v. Montana Thirteenth Judicial Dist. Court, </em>1998 MT 34, 288 Mont. 27, 955 P.2d 639, the District Court concluded both that S.K. was Kline\u2019s victim and Kline was S.K.\u2019s victim. In <em>Keyes, </em>Keyes and LaFromboise \u201cexchanged gunfire from their respective vehicles\u201d and, during their \u201cshoot-out,\u201d a passenger in LaFromboise\u2019s vehicle was killed. <em>Keyes, </em>\u00b6 1. The State charged Keyes with three alternative counts of deliberate homicide, one under the felony murder rule and two by accountability. <em>Keyes, </em>\u00b6 3. Discussing the accountability statute, this Court stated, \u201c[e]ven if the charge was interpreted to allege the commission of two criminal offenses, Keyes becomes the victim of LaFromboise\u2019s offense, and LaFromboise becomes the victim of Keyes\u2019 offense. As a victim, neither can be legally accountable for a death caused by the other\u2019s crime. Montana\u2019s accountability statute excludes victims from such accountability.\u201d <em>Keyes, </em>\u00b6 31. The District Court used this case as authority to conclude S.K. and Kline \u201care each other\u2019s victims. [S.K.], if this happened, is [Kline\u2019s] victim. The statute does not say otherwise, [\u00a7 45-2-302(3)(a), MCA], and she\u2019s not accountable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ARC\">\u00b633  We disagree with the conclusion that either S.K. or Kline is a victim of incest. If both participants are over the age of 16, as they were here, the statute criminalizes both as participants in incestuous conduct. In our reading, \u00a7 45-5-507(1), MCA, does not require a victim. Incest requires two relatives engaging in sexual contact or sexual intercourse. Depending on the circumstances, it could be that neither are victims, both are victims, or only one is a victim. In some cases it may be clear who constitutes a victim; in others, unclear. Fortunately, \u00a7 45-5-507(1), MCA, does not contemplate, or require, a determination of who is a victim of incest unless one party is under the age of 16. In that case, \u00a7 45-5-507(4), MCA, presumes the party under 16 is a victim because they are legally incapable of consenting to sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">\u00b634 \u201c[W]e will affirm a district court\u2019s decision when it reaches the correct result for the wrong reasons.\u201d <em>State v. Morrisey, </em>2009 MT 201</p>\n<p id=\"b194-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>\u00b6 49, 351 Mont. 144, 214 P.3d 708 (citing <em>State v. Howard, </em>2008 MT 173, \u00b6 20, 343 Mont. 378, 184 P.3d 344). Although the District Court concluded S.K. was a victim under \u00a7 45-2-302(3)(a), MCA, instead of a participant under \u00a7 45-5-507(1), MCA, its conclusion that she was not legally accountable was the correct result.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"AnD\">\u00b635  For the foregoing reasons, the District Court correctly concluded S.K. was not legally accountable for Kline\u2019s incest.

However, as we discuss <em>infra, </em>the crime of incest is unique in that it requires two participants who may willingly engage in and each be held responsible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>for their actions if they are over 16 years of age. Whether a person can be held both responsible and accountable for the acts of others will depend on the particular facts and the crime(s) charged.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b194-7\">JUSTICE BAKER,</author>\n<p id=\"AY3\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">\u00b636 The Court correctly analyzes the Incest statute and its application to Kline. I add only an observation: the statute as written treats both an adult man and his minor daughter as equally complicit in a sexual relationship. I doubt this is what the Legislature intended, but the statute is not reasonably susceptible to another construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">\u00b637 Applied to consenting adults or to siblings, the statute properly treats both actors in an incestuous relationship as responsible for the offense. Section 45-5-507(1), MCA. And the statute rightly makes a stepson\u2019s or stepdaughter\u2019s consent ineffective if the child is under 18. Section 45-5-507(2), MCA. But when, as here, a father has sexual intercourse with his underage natural daughter, her consent to the act makes her his partner in crime. The statute thus seems to perpetuate a long-outdated philosophy that a young girl is responsible for sexual crimes committed against her. Public policy otherwise spurns the notion that an adult may use a parental relationship to take sexual advantage of his minor child. See, <em>e.g., Langford v. State, </em>2013 MT 265, 372 Mont. 14, 309 P.3d 993 (upholding sex offender registration for offender convicted of incest with teenage daughter); <em>In re S.L.T., </em>215 Mont. 289, 697 P.2d 472 (1985) (affirming finding that teenage girl subjected to sexual acts by her adopted father was abused and neglected, and upholding grant of legal custody to the State). The Legislature may wish to take a fresh look at the Incest statute to address this paradoxical result.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">JUSTICE WHEAT joins in the concurring Opinion of JUSTICE BAKER.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
