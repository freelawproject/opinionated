Anderson, and Rowdy Anderson, (collectively the Andersons) appeal from the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law of the Montana Twenty-First Judicial District Court, Ravalli County. The District Court concluded in its Order that Chriss and Carolyn Mack (Macks) shall have access to install a headgate at the point of diversion (POD) for Headgate No. 103 in South Burnt Fork Creek; that the Macks shall be provided access to the same POD, and along the course of the Mack Ditch across Andersons\u2019 property to install the headgate at POD No. 103; that the Temporary Restraining Order (TRO), stipulated to by the parties and Order on May 19, 2014, shall remain in full force and effect; and that the District Court may still award the Macks all of their reasonable attorney fees and costs under \u00a7 70-17-112, MCA. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-13\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b395-14\">\u00b62 The Andersons raise several issues on appeal which we consolidate and restate as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b395-15\">\u00b63 <em>Did the District Court exceed its jurisdiction by ruling on the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number><em>merits of the parties\u2019 dispute ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">\u00b64 <em>Did the District Court exceed its jurisdiction by establishing or changing the POD for the ditch in dispute?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">\u00b65 <em>Did the District Court usurp the Andersons\u2019 right to a jury trial regarding the existence of an irrigation ditch which crosses Andersons\u2019 property?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">\u00b66 The Anderson and Mack families both own property in the South Burnt Fork Creek Watershed in Ravalli County, Montana. The Macks own a 160-acre section adjacent to the Andersons, who individually own several adjoined five-acre parcels along with a forty-acre parcel. The Mack property has fully adjudicated water rights in the South Fork Burnt Creek which are not at issue in the case. The water rights are \u201chigh water\u201d rights which provide water for a limited time each year to the Mack property when there is high runoff in the creek. The Macks\u2019 water right claims, 76H 125130-00 and 76H 125131-00, have an attached map that depicts the general location of Headgate 103 and a ditch crossing the Andersons\u2019 property to the Mack property. While the record reflects some confusion regarding the name of the ditch, we will refer to the ditch as \u201cMack Ditch\u201d for clarity. The water right claims set forth the legal description for the headgate in the SW1/4NW1/4SW1/4 of Section 4, Township 8 North, Range 19 West. The Macks\u2019 water rights POD was assigned the designation of Headgate 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">\u00b67 After purchasing the property in 2002, the Macks performed yearly maintenance on their irrigation ditch from South Burnt Fork Creek from the POD continuously through 2012. In 2014, the Macks hired Tracey Turek to oversee maintenance on the ditch to prepare for the high water season. During this maintenance, the Macks discovered that a dam existed on the ditch that diverted South Burnt Fork water to a pond on the Andersons\u2019 property. Ms. Turek contacted the Andersons about removal of the blockage and received a hostile response. As a result, the Macks filed a complaint on May 8, 2014, against the Andersons alleging violations of \u00a7 70-17-112, MCA, and seeking a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">\u00b68 On May 9, 2014, Judge Haynes issued a TRO restraining the Andersons from interfering with the Macks\u2019 access to the Mack Ditch including their related rights under \u00a7 70-17-112, MCA, and ordered a show cause hearing for May 20, 2014. The parties subsequently entered into a Stipulation on May 16, 2014, that the TRO should remain in effect until further court order. The court upheld the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>stipulation on May 19, 2014, and vacated the show cause hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">\u00b69 Under the May 19, 2014 Order, Ms. Turek, with a work crew and the assistance of Dan Claggatt, water commissioner for South Burnt Fork Creek, initiated maintenance on the Mack Ditch. While the work was ongoing Jimmy Anderson allegedly threatened to harm Ms. Turek and anyone working on the Mack Ditch. On May 27, 2014, the Andersons filed a Motion to Dismiss the Macks Complaint. The motion claimed that the Mack Ditch did not exist on the Anderson property. The Andersons also filed a complaint with the Bitterroot Conservation District alleging the Macks failed to get a 310 permit prior to conducting maintenance on the ditch. The Bitterroot Conservation District determined Macks must obtain a permit and mitigate the disturbance to the Mack Ditch, including an improved control structure at the head of the ditch. When the Macks and Ms. Turek attempted to comply with the Bitterroot Conservation District mitigation order, they were stopped by the Andersons. The Andersons also obstructed the ditch with a load of gravel near the headgate.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">\u00b610 In an effort to resolve the issue, the District Court held hearings to take evidence and ascertain whether the Macks were entitled to a preliminary injunction. The Macks presented evidence showing that the physical location of Headgate 103 and the legal description set forth in the Statement of Claim contained a discrepancy. The Statement of Claim included an attached map, which was not to scale, showing the ditch POD in the SWNWSW Section 4, Township 8 North, Range 19 West. The physical location of the headgate is in the NESWSW Section 4, Township 8 North, Range 19 West. Ms. Turek testified that the legal land description was listed in error. The Andersons contended this was because the Mack Ditch was not on their property but was in the SWNWSW section as listed on the Statement of Claim. The Macks presented extensive evidence demonstrating the land description was in error, including the \u201cAmended and Updated Decree of Distribution of the Waters of the Burnt Fork Watershed, Ravalli County, Montana\u201d issued by the Ravalli County District Court in 1978 (1978 Decree). The 1978 Decree included a map that located and numbered the various PODs in the drainage including Headgate 103, which was located in the NESWSW Section 4, Township 8 North, Range 19 West. Based upon this information, the Macks amended the Statement of Claim to correct this error on April 10, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">\u00b6 11 The District Court issued its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order on September 16, 2015. The court found that the Macks were entitled to the preliminary injunction, and that the Macks or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>their agents must be provided access to the POD in the NESWSW Section 4, Township 8 North, Range 19 West, and along the course of the Mack Ditch for the purpose of installing the headgate and for repair and maintenance purposes. The court also indicated that the Macks demonstrated a likelihood they would prevail on the merits and reserved the issue of an award of attorney fees and costs allowed under \u00a7 70-17-112, MCA. Andersons appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">\u00b612 District courts are vested with a high degree of discretion to maintain the status quo through injunctive relief. <em>Shammel v. Canyon Res. Corp., </em>2003 MT 372, \u00b6 12, 319 Mont. 132, 82 P.3d 912. This Court will not disturb a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a preliminary injunction unless a manifest abuse of discretion is shown. <em>Cole v. St. James Healthcare, </em>2008 MT 453, \u00b6 9, 348 Mont. 68, 199 P.3d 810 (citing <em>Sweet Grass Farms, Ltd. v. Bd. of Cnty. Comm\u2019rs, </em>2000 MT 147, \u00b6 20, 300 Mont. 66, 2 P.3d 825). \u201cA \u2018manifest\u2019 abuse of discretion is one that is obvious, evident or unmistakable.\u201d <em>Shammel, </em>\u00b6 12. If the district court issues an injunction based on conclusions of law, we review those conclusions for correctness. <em>Cole, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">\u00b613 <em>Did the District Court exceed its jurisdiction by ruling on the merits of the parties\u2019 dispute ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">\u00b614 Preliminary injunctions are governed by \u00a7 27-19-201, MCA, which provides in five subsections the circumstances under which an injunction may be granted. Arguments at the District Court were directed toward subsections (1) and (2), which provide that a preliminary injunction may be issued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-9\">(1) when it appears that the applicant is entitled to the relief demanded and the relief or any part of the relief consists in restraining the commission or continuance of the act complained of, either for a limited period or perpetually;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-10\">(2) when it appears that the commission or continuance of some act during the litigation would produce a great or irreparable injury to the applicant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-11\">\u00b615 Wenotethatthe subsections of\u00a727-19-201, MCA, are disjunctive, and findings that satisfy one of the five factors are sufficient to support a preliminary injunction. <em>Sweet Grass Farms, </em>\u00b6 27 (citation omitted). For the injunction to issue, the applicant must show that he \u201chas a legitimate cause of action, and that he is likely to succeed on the merits of that claim,\u201d and must also show that an injunction is an appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>remedy. <em>Sandrock v. DeTienne, </em>2010 MT 237, \u00b6 16, 358 Mont. 175, 243 P.3d 1123 (citing <em>Cole, </em>\u00b6 15). \u201c[A]n applicant for a preliminary injunction must establish a prima facie case, or show that it is at least doubtful whether or not he will suffer irreparable injury before his rights can be fully litigated.\u201d <em>Sandrock, </em>\u00b6 16 (citation omitted). \u201cUpon the requisite showing, a preliminary injunction is issued to maintain the status quo pending trial, which has been defined as \u2018the last actual, peaceable, noncontested condition which preceded the pending controversy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sandrock, </em>\u00b6 16. Finally, regarding the determination of a preliminary injunction, \u201c[w]e have consistently held that a district court should not resolve the ultimate merits of the case when initially analyzing the propriety of a preliminary injunction.\u201d <em>City of Whitefish v. Bd. of Cnty. Comm\u2019rs of Flathead Cnty., </em>2008 MT 436, \u00b6 18, 347 Mont. 490, 199 P.3d 201 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">\u00b616 The Andersons challenge the District Court\u2019s factual findings and legal conclusions arguing that the court adjudicated matters beyond the preliminary injunction and reached the merits of the case. The Macks respond that the Andersons have failed to identify any language in the Order which improperly reached the merits of the case while defending Judge Haynes\u2019 position that the court reserved judgment on the merits without prejudice to the ultimate resolution of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">\u00b6 17 The District Court held four hearings to gather evidence regarding the ditch easement and headgate location in an attempt to determine the status quo or \u201cthe last actual, peaceable, noncontested condition which preceded the pending controversy.\u201d <em>Sandrock, </em>\u00b6 16. Because the Andersons\u2019 defense in the matter was based on the premise that the Macks lacked ditch rights through the Andersons\u2019 property, not that the Andersons were interfering with the Macks\u2019 irrigation ditch rights, the District Court needed to inquire whether the Macks were likely entitled to the relief they requested as applicants for an injunction. This determination included whether the Macks possessed water rights, and if so, how the water is delivered to the Mack property.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">\u00b618 While the Andersons characterize this inquiry as a final adjudication on the merits, it is clear from the District Court Order that the court\u2019s findings were not a final determination. The court concluded in the Order that \u201cit is likely that the Macks will succeed on their claims against Defendants.\u201d Regarding the prescriptive easement the District Court noted \u201c[t]he Macks have established the strong likelihood they will succeed on the merits\u201d and listed its reasoning for the initial determination. Finally, the court found that the status quo to be maintained in this case is the Macks\u2019 ability to make beneficial use of their undisputed South Burnt Fork Creek water right by way of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>the historic diversion point and route of the Mack Ditch. The court established this as the status quo, imposed the injunction, and added that a determination on the merits would follow as part of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">\u00b619 The court determined that the Macks made a proper showing for an injunction, including a showing that they are likely to succeed on the merits. The court was also careful to state, both during the hearing and in its order, that it was reserving judgment on the ultimate issues of the case. <em>Sandrock, </em>\u00b6 24. The Andersons have not identified language in the court\u2019s order that reached the merits of the case. Instead, their arguments are directed at their dissatisfaction with the court\u2019s determination of the status quo of the current controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">\u00b620  The District Court gathered evidence and carefully untangled the issues of the case to establish the status quo prior to the request for preliminary injunction. The District Court made proper findings and clearly reserved final adjudication on the merits in the Order. The preliminary injunction determination was not an abuse of the court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">\u00b621 <em>Did the District Court exceed its jurisdiction by establishing or changing the POD for the ditch in dispute?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">\u00b622 Andersons argue that the District Court brushed aside the Water Court\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction to determine points of diversion under \u00a7 85-2-234(6)(g), MCA, and created a new POD for Headgate 103. Macks respond that no place of use or means of diversion was changed under the court\u2019s findings and Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">\u00b623  It is well established that ditch or easement rights are separate and distinct property rights from a water right. <em>Connolly v. Harrel, </em>102 Mont. 295, 57 P.2d 781 (1936). Jurisdiction to interpret and determine existing water rights rests exclusively with the water court. <em>Mildenberger v. Galbraith, </em>249 Mont. 161, 166, 815 P. 2d 130, 134 (1991); \u00a7 3-7-501, MCA. Conversely, district courts are granted authority to supervise the distribution of water through ditches and other distribution means concerning water rights which have already been adjudicated. <em>Baker Ditch Co. v. District Court, </em>251 Mont. 251, 255, 824 P.2d 260, 262-63 (1992); \u00a7 85-2-406(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-11\">\u00b624 The District Court in these proceedings was tasked with the responsibility for interpreting the 1978 Decree and the location of Headgate 103 referenced within the 1978 Decree, as it was the place of diversion for Macks\u2019 claimed ditch right which was the water distribution method in dispute. The 1978 Decree had a map depicting the physical location of Headgate 103 within the NESWSW Section 4, Township 8 North, Range 19 West. The Andersons presented the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>District Court with evidence that had been submitted to the Water Court, in the form of Statements of Claim 76H 125130-00 and 76H 125131-00, which indicated a different location for the Headgate 103 and which tended to defeat Macks\u2019 ditch claim under the 1978 Decree because it placed Macks\u2019 POD in SWNWSW Section 4, Township 8 North, Range 19 West. In order to assess the weight to be attributed the Statements of Claim evidence, the District Court considered Macks argument that the Statements of Claim contained an error in the location of the POD, as well as evidence presented by Turek, two water commissioners, Mack, and documentary evidence. Presentation of this evidence spanned four days. The District Court ultimately concluded that the 1978 Decree depicted the POD as claimed by Mack and rejected Andersons\u2019 argument that the Statements of Claim altered that which had been set forth in the 1978 Decree. That the District Court concluded the Macks\u2019 water rights claims contained an error is inconsequential, except for the fact that it demonstrated the court weighed and considered the evidence presented in an effort to distribute the water pursuant to the 1978 Decree. The District Court did not change the physical location of a POD, which is the province of the Water Court, but rather interpreted the location of the POD as depicted in the 1978 Decree, following consideration of evidence which had also been submitted to the Water Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">\u00b625 The District Court therefore was careful not to tread upon the jurisdiction of the Water Court while maintaining its obligation to determine whether a preliminary injunction was necessary to protect the Macks\u2019 ditch rights. The considerations are often discreet and demonstrate the difficulty for a district court in managing distribution controversies concerning water.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">\u00b626 <em>Did the District Court usurp the Andersons\u2019 right to a jury trial regarding the existence of an irrigation ditch which crosses Andersons\u2019 property?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">\u00b627  The Andersons\u2019 final argument is that the District Court determined the merits of the dispute regarding the Mack Ditch. The Andersons argue this conclusion took away their right to a jury trial. However, this argument fails to recognize the plain language of the District Court\u2019s Order. Judge Haynes clearly acknowledged in the Order that the court\u2019s determinations were to preserve the status quo and that the rights of the parties would be determined at trial. The Order specifically directs the parties to file status reports within 90 days and make requests at the time for a trial setting \u201cto permanently decide and finalize any remaining contested issues.\u201d The District Court anticipated further litigation of the issues, including a final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>determination regarding rights on the Mack Ditch. The Andersons\u2019 argument that their right to a jury trial was usurped by the court\u2019s status quo determination is incorrect. The District Court\u2019s conclusions of law were correct and the court clearly reserved the merits of the case for a jury as requested by the Andersons.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">\u00b628 The District Court made proper findings and clearly reserved final adjudication on the merits in the Order and the preliminary injunction determination was not an abuse of the court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b402-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES McKINNON, COTTER and BAKER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
