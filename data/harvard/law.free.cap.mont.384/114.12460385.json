We address the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-10\">\n<em>Whether the District Court abused its discretion by requiring Rickett to wear a leg brace during trial.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-12\">\u00b62 We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-13\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b141-14\">\u00b63 On July 27, 2012, the State of Montana charged Rickett with Aggravated Kidnapping, Burglary, Intimidation, and Escape. The State alleged that Rickett escaped from his incarceration at the Gallatin County Re-Entry Facility\u2019s pre-release center, traveled to Manhattan, Montana, and kidnapped his former foster mother to gain access to the safe at the Bay Bar and Grill in Bozeman, where she worked as a bookkeeper.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-15\">\u00b64 The District Court held a jury trial from February 25 through February 27, 2014. Rickett appeared in person at the trial. He was wearing street clothes with a leg brace on his right leg underneath his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>pants. Before jury selection, Rickett asked the Court to order sheriffs deputies to remove his leg brace. Rickett\u2019s counsel stated that the leg brace \u201ccreates a large bulge\u201d in Rickett\u2019s pants leg, and said he was \u201cconcerned\u201d that if Rickett stood up before the jury, he would \u201cfiddle with [the brace], and the jury\u2019s going to take obvious note of this large leg brace.\u201d The District Court denied Rickett\u2019s request, finding that the leg brace was \u201cjust a bulge underneath [Rickett\u2019s] pants\u201d and \u201cthe minimum security that the Sheriff requires for [bringing] prisoners back and forth.\u201d However, the District Court told Rickett he could raise the issue again before standing or walking in front of the jury. Before taking the stand on the last day of trial, Rickett again requested that the Court order sheriff s deputies to remove his leg brace. The District Court denied Rickett\u2019s request, stating: \u201cI believe that [the leg brace] is concealed enough that... it does not prejudice Mr. Rickett.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">\u00b65 On February 27, the jury found Rickett guilty of Aggravated Kidnapping, Intimidation, and Escape.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District Court designated Rickett a persistent felony offender and sentenced him to the Montana State Prison for forty years with no time suspended. Rickett appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of his request to order sheriffs deputies to remove his leg brace.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">\u00b66 We review a district court\u2019s decision to restrain a criminal defendant during trial for abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Jackson, </em>2009 MT 427, \u00b6 57, 354 Mont. 63, 221 P.3d 1213. \u201cNotwithstanding this deferential standard, however, judicial discretion must be guided by the rules and principles of law; thus, our standard of review is plenary to the extent that a discretionary ruling is based on a conclusion of law.\u201d <em>State v. Price, </em>2006 MT 79, \u00b6 17, 331 Mont. 502, 134 P.3d 45. In such circumstances, \u201cwe must determine whether the court correctly interpreted the law.\u201d <em>Price, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">\u00b67 <em>Whether the District Court abused its discretion by requiring Rickett to wear a leg brace during trial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">\u00b68 The Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 17 of the Montana Constitution entitle criminal defendants to appear before a jury free of shackles and other physical restraints. <em>State v. Herrick, </em>2004 MT 323, \u00b6\u00b6 12, 15, 324 Mont. 76, 101 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>P.3d 755. However, this right is not absolute, and a trial court\u2019s decision to restrain a defendant during trial is not per se unconstitutional. <em>Herrick, </em>\u00b6 12. In <em>Herrick, </em>we adopted a two-step test for determining whether a trial court abused its discretion in restraining a criminal defendant during trial. <em>Herrick, </em>\u00b6 15. First, the trial court \u201cmust be persuaded by compelling circumstances that some measure is needed to maintain the security of the courtroom.\u201d <em>Herrick, </em>\u00b6 14. Second, the court \u201cmust pursue less restrictive alternatives before imposing physical restraints.\u201d <em>Herrick, </em>\u00b6 14. A trial court\u2019s decision to restrain a defendant without first engaging in the two-step <em>Herrick </em>analysis constitutes an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Hartsoe, </em>2011 MT 188, \u00b6 22, 361 Mont. 305, 258 P.3d 428.</p>\n<p id=\"Ak-\">\u00b69  In this case, the District Court did not apply the <em>Herrick </em>test before denying Rickett\u2019s request to remove his leg brace. Therefore, the District Court abused its discretion. However, our inquiry does not end here. Rather, once we have established that a trial court has violated either prong of <em>Herrick, </em>we next determine whether the court\u2019s error is structural in nature. <em>Hartsoe, </em>\u00b6 31. \u201cA structural error is one \u2018which so infect! s I and contaminate^] the framework of the trial as to render it fundamentally unfair, requiring automatic reversal.\u2019\u201d <em>Hartsoe, </em>\u00b6 31 (quoting <em>State v. Charlie, </em>2010 MT 195, \u00b6 40, 357 Mont. 355, 239 P.3d 934) (changes in original). When a defendant is physically restrained, a structural error occurs if the impact of the physical restraint on the defendant or the defense is \u201cso pervasive that the error is not susceptible to analysis under harmless error <em>standards.\u2019\u2019 Hartsoe, </em>\u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"awy-dedup-0\">\u00b610  In <em>Hartsoe, </em>we concluded that the District Court\u2019s error of allowing a defendant to be observed by the jury while shackled to a chair without engaging in the <em>Herrick </em>test did not constitute structural error. <em>Hartsoe, </em>\u00b6 33. We reasoned that the court\u2019s error did not inhibit the defendant\u2019s ability to conduct his defense because the defendant was shackled for only a portion of voir dire and remained free from shackles for the remainder of his trial. <em>Hartsoe, </em>\u00b6 33. In contrast to <em>Hartsoe, </em>Rickett\u2019s leg brace was underneath his clothing and not immediately visible. Although Rickett\u2019s counsel argued that the brace created a \u201clarge bulge\u201d in Rickett\u2019s pant leg and would cause him to limp while walking, we cannot discern from the record whether the jury suspected Rickett was wearing a restraint device. Moreover, at the beginning of the trial, Rickett\u2019s counsel informed the jury that Rickett was an inmate with the Montana Department of Corrections, and that he had escaped from the pre-release center. While he was on the stand, Rickett himself told the jury that he escaped from the pre-release <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>center. Given the relatively unobtrusive nature of the leg brace, and Rickett\u2019s admission to being an inmate and an escapee, we cannot conclude that the impact of the leg brace on Rickett or his defense is so pervasive that the District Court\u2019s error is not susceptible to a harmless error analysis. <em>See Hartsoe, </em>\u00b6 31. Our review of the record thus leaves us convinced that the District Court\u2019s error is not structural.</p>\n<p id=\"AqQ\">\u00b611  Once we have established that a trial court\u2019s error is not structural, we next consider whether the error is harmless. <em>Hartsoe, </em>\u00b6 32. Under the harmless error analysis, the State must demonstrate that there is no reasonable possibility that the trial court\u2019s failure to adhere to <em>Herrick </em>prejudiced the defendant. <em>Hartsoe, </em>\u00b6 32. \u201cIn other words, the State has the burden of persuading the Court that the violation was harmless in light of the interests that the right to remain free of physical restraints was designed to protect.\u201d <em>Hartsoe, </em>\u00b6 32. Visible restraints create a \u201chigh risk of prejudice\u201d because they indicate that the court believes there is a \u201cneed to separate the defendant from the community at large, creating an inherent danger that [the] jury may form the impression that the defendant is dangerous or untrustworthy.\u201d <em>Hartsoe, </em>\u00b6 32 (quoting <em>Dyas v. Poole, </em>317 P.3d 934, 937 (9th Cir. 2002)) (changes in original). Visible restraints also may prejudice the defendant by undermining the presumption that the defendant is innocent. <em>Hartsoe, </em>\u00b6 32. Conversely, if a jury never sees the restraints, the presumption of innocence is not undermined and the court\u2019s error is harmless. <em>See Castillo v. Stainer, </em>983 F.2d 145, 149 (9th Cir. 1992) (holding that a waist chain could not be seen by the jury and, therefore, \u201cthe court\u2019s error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"Aay\">\u00b612  The District Court determined that Rickett\u2019s leg brace was not visible, and there is no indication in the record that the jury noticed it. However, even if the jury did notice Rickett\u2019s brace, we find persuasive the Ninth Circuit\u2019s reasoning, in <em>Walker v. Martel, </em>709 F.3d 925, 942 (9th Cir. 2013), that a leg brace \u201conly suggested [the defendant\u2019s] custody status, not a proclivity for violence, as his hands were unencumbered.\u201d Rickett admitted to being an inmate and an escapee, and leg braces are designed to prevent rapid movement. Assuming the jury did, in fact, notice the brace, this would only confirm what Rickett had himself acknowledged\u2014his custody and escapee status; it does not suggest a proclivity for violence. By the same reasoning, Rickett\u2019s presumption of innocence was not undermined. At most, the leg brace might indicate that Rickett was a potential flight risk. Such an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>indication would not undermine Rickett\u2019s presumption of innocence because Rickett admitted to being an escapee. We therefore conclude there is no reasonable possibility that Rickett was prejudiced by the District Court\u2019s violation of <em>Herrick. See Hartsoe, </em>\u00b6 32. Accordingly, the District Court\u2019s error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">\u00b613 We affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of Rickett\u2019s request to order sheriffs deputies to remove a security brace from his leg during trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"AnC\">JUSTICES COTTER, WHEAT, BAKER and McKINNON concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b142-11\"> The District Court dismissed the Burglary charge mid-trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
