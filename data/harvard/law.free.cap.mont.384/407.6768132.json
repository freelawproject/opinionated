We address:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-10\">\n<em>Whether the District Court prejudiced Blake when it conducted an in-chambers conference in Blake\u2019s absence.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-12\">\u00b62 We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-13\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b434-14\">\u00b63 On January 9, 2013, the State of Montana filed an Information charging Blake with eight offenses: seven sex offenses involving three alleged victims \u2014 two minors, B.S. and L.L., and one adult, K.L. \u2014 and one offense of tampering with evidence. Blake pled not guilty to all eight charges, and a trial was scheduled for June 25, 2013. Less than one week before trial, the State filed several motions, seeking to: (1) add a witness, (2) exclude certain evidence from trial, and (3) amend the Information as to form. Also just before trial, the State provided discovery that included a 911 recording, a Montana Crime Lab report, and police reports of two witness interviews, one of whom was an alleged minor victim. On June 21,2013, Blake filed a motion to dismiss the case with prejudice, contending that the State\u2019s motions were untimely, that the State committed \u201cviolations of discovery by disclosing information, exculpatory and otherwise, less than one week before trial,\u201d and that this information would have impacted Blake\u2019s plea negotiations. That same afternoon, the District Court conducted an emergency in-chambers conference. Blake did not appear at the conference. His counsel appeared telephonically. When asked whether she had any concerns about Blake not being present at the conference, Blake\u2019s counsel stated: \u201cif we reach a point where I believe he needs to be present I will alert the Court.\u201d During the conference, the District Court vacated the June 25,2013 trial date and continued the jury trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>to August 26, 2013. After the conference, the District Court issued a written order continuing the trial to August 26, 2013. The District Court also issued a written order denying Blake\u2019s motion to dismiss, ruling that Blake\u2019s counsel waived Blake\u2019s right to be present at the June 21, 2013 hearing, and finding that the continuance mooted Blake\u2019s complaints regarding the State\u2019s late-filed discovery disclosure. \u00b64 The District Court held a jury trial from August 26 through 29, 2013. The jury found Blake guilty of three offenses: one count of sexual assault of L.L. and two counts of sexual assault of B.S. On November 25, 2013, the District Court sentenced Blake to fifty years at Montana State Prison for each of the three convictions. The District Court also designated Blake as a Level II sex offender and required him to complete Phases I and II of sex offender treatment in prison. Blake appeals the District Court\u2019s order denying his motion to dismiss, claiming that he was prejudiced by his absence at the June 21, 2013 emergency hearing, and that his convictions should therefore be reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">\u00b65 \u201cWe exercise plenary review over constitutional questions, including alleged violations of a criminal defendant\u2019s right to be present at critical stages of the proceedings against him.\u201d <em>State v. Wilson, </em>2013 MT 70, \u00b6 9, 369 Mont. 282, 297 P.3d 1208.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">\u00b66 <em>Whether the District Court prejudiced Blake when it conducted an in-chambers conference in Blake\u2019s absence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">\u00b67 Under both the Montana Constitution and the United States Constitution, a defendant has the right to be present at all \u201ccritical stages\u201d of the criminal proceedings against him. <em>Wilson, </em>\u00b6 11. A critical stage includes \u201cany step of the proceeding where there is potential for substantial prejudice to the defendant.\u201d <em>State v. Charlie, </em>2010 MT 195, \u00b6 40, 357 Mont. 355, 239 P.3d 934 (citation omitted). The right to be present thus attaches \u201cwhenever the defendant\u2019s presence \u2018has a relation, reasonably substantial, to the fullness of his opportunity to defend against the charge.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Reim, </em>2014 MT 108, \u00b6 36, 374 Mont. 487, 323 P.3d 880 (quoting <em>Charlie, </em>\u00b6 40).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">\u00b68 In determining whether a district court violated a defendant\u2019s right to be present, we typically consider: (1) whether the defendant was excluded from a critical stage of the proceedings; (2) whether the defendant waived his right to be present at the critical stage; and (3) whether the defendant was prejudiced by his absence. <em>State v. Price, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>2009 MT 129, \u00b6\u00b6 23-24, 350 Mont. 272, 207 P.3d 298. In this case, we conclude that Blake was not prejudiced by his absence from the emergency conference; therefore, we do not consider the initial questions of whether the conference constituted a critical stage or whether Blake validly waived his right to be present. <em>See Price, </em>\u00b6 25. We will assume for the purposes of our analysis that the conference constituted a critical stage, and that Blake did not validly waive his right to be present. <em>See Price, </em>\u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">\u00b69  Prejudice to the defendant is presumed if the error is structural in nature. <em>See Charlie, </em>\u00b6 40. \u201cStructural defects are constitutional violations which so infect and contaminate the framework of a trial as to render it fundamentally unfair, requiring automatic reversal.\u201d <em>Charlie, </em>\u00b6 40. In <em>Charlie, </em>the defendant argued that the district court violated his right to be present at a critical stage because he was absent from a telephonic conference in which the parties agreed to continue his trial to allow his counsel time to review a newly-discovered videotape introduced by the State. <em>Charlie, </em>\u00b6 37. We held that, although the conference was a critical stage, the violation of Charlie\u2019s right to be present was not structural. <em>Charlie, </em>\u00b6 41. Similarly, in <em>Price, </em>further discussed below, we held that a defendant\u2019s absence from eleven in-chambers conferences throughout his trial was not structural when \u201c[n]othing that occurred at the conferences concerned or affected the framework within which Price\u2019s trial proceeded or necessarily rendered the trial fundamentally unfair.\u201d <em>Price, </em>\u00b6 33. Here, as in <em>Charlie, </em>the sole purpose of the emergency conference was to discuss scheduling and ensure the parties had sufficient time to prepare for trial given the late-filed discovery. Blake\u2019s absence from the conference was not a structural error because it was not a \u201cconstitutional violation!] which so infect[ed] and contaminate[d] the framework of a trial as to render it fundamentally unfair.\u201d <em>Charlie, </em>\u00b6 40; <em>accord Price, </em>\u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">\u00b610 When the violation of a defendant\u2019s right to be present at a critical stage is not structural, we apply a harmless error analysis under which the State has the burden to demonstrate that there is no \u201creasonable possibility\u201d that the defendant\u2019s absence from the critical stage caused him prejudice. <em>Charlie, </em>\u00b6 41. \u201cWhere the record shows that the defendant was not prejudiced, we have affirmed.\u201d <em>Price, </em>\u00b6 24 (citing <em>State v. Godfrey, </em>2009 MT 60, \u00b6 25, 349 Mont. 335, 203 P.3d 834). In <em>Price, </em>the defendant argued that he was prejudiced by his absence from several conferences in which the district court excluded certain evidence and one conference in which the district court removed a juror. <em>Price, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 21, 34. We held that Price\u2019s absence from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>conference during which the court removed a juror did not cause him prejudice because the juror knew a key defense witness and indicated that she would view that witness\u2019s testimony with skepticism. <em>Price, </em>\u00b6 40. We further held that Price was not prejudiced by his absence at the conferences during which the district court excluded evidence because the evidence was properly excluded, and Price\u2019s presence would not have changed that determination. <em>Price, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 41-43. In <em>Charlie, </em>we held that the defendant was not prejudiced because, \u201c[b]y postponing the trial date in order to ensure that Charlie\u2019s counsel had time to review the videotape, the District Court and all parties were acting to protect Charlie\u2019s right to a fair trial.\u201d <em>Charlie, </em>\u00b6 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">\u00b611 At the time of the conference, Blake\u2019s trial was just four days away. The District Court stated that the purpose of the conference was not to address substantive matters, but rather to ensure the parties had sufficient time to prepare for trial. The Court indicated that it was inclined to continue the trial until late August or early September to allow Blake to complete discovery, but was receptive to comments from both parties. Blake\u2019s counsel responded that, while the District Court\u2019s concerns were legitimate, \u201c[w]e will not waive speedy trial and we did not ask for a continuance of the trial.\u201d The State requested that the District Court give Blake\u2019s case priority if it did continue the trial due to speedy trial concerns and the fact that Blake was incarcerated while awaiting trial. In his motion to dismiss, Blake claimed that having sufficient time to review the new evidence was critical to his case. Blake\u2019s trial was held within the speedy trial deadline, and he has not alleged that his right to a speedy trial was violated. As in <em>Charlie, </em>by postponing the trial date so that Blake\u2019s counsel had time to review the newly-disclosed evidence, all parties were acting to protect Blake\u2019s right to a fair trial. <em>See Charlie, </em>\u00b6 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">\u00b612  Moreover, at no point during the conference did the District Court or any of the parties discuss the substance of the late-filed discovery or its impact on the case; the evidence was discussed only to the extent that it impacted the trial schedule. Although Blake contends that he was denied the opportunity to argue that the late disclosure of evidence impacted his plea negotiations, the District Court did not allow the parties to argue the merits of the evidence or of Blake\u2019s motion to dismiss. As in <em>Price, </em>Blake\u2019s presence would not have changed the District Court\u2019s consideration of that issue. Therefore, there was no reasonable possibility that Blake\u2019s absence from the emergency conference caused him prejudice. Finally, because Blake was not prejudiced by his absence from the conference, his counsel\u2019s waiver of his right to be present could not have prejudiced him.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">f 13 We affirm the District Court\u2019s decision and order.</p>\n<judges id=\"b438-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b438-7\">JUSTICE MCKINNON,</author>\n<p id=\"Avs\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">\u00b614 For the reasons previously set forth in my special concurrence in <em>State v. Northcutt, </em>2015 MT 267, 381 Mont. 81, 358 P.3d 179, 1 cannot agree that a claim alleging a right to be present should be evaluated pursuant to whether it occurred during a \u201ccritical stage\u201d of the trial. This Court borrowed the concept of \u201ccritical stage\u201d of the proceeding from precedent of the United States Supreme Court construing the Sixth Am endment and a criminal defendant\u2019s right to counsel. <em>See Powell v. Alabma, </em>287 U.S. 45, 53 S. Ct. 55, 77 L. Ed. 158 (1932). \u201cCritical stage\u201d <em>of the proceeding, </em>as compared to the trial itself, was the term utilized to extend the right to counsel from trial to proceedings outside the trial \u2014 such as an arraignment or a pre-trial identification. It is an inapt distinction to make to events occurring within the trial itself and for which Defendant clearly has a right to counsel. Indeed, it would be an implausible argument to suggest that <em>any </em>part of the trial was less critical such that no right to counsel attached. Applying this incorrect analysis to a right to presence claim first appeared in our jurisprudence in <em>State v. Matt, </em>2008 MT 444, 347 Mont. 530, 199 P.3d 244, and we have perpetuated the error in <em>Charlie </em>and <em>Price </em>and other subsequent cases. As a result, we have been required to unreasonably conclude that an ex parte conversation between a judge and jury about what the jury would like for dinner constitutes a critical stage of the proceeding. <em>Northcutt, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">\u00b6 15 I would evaluate Blake\u2019s presence claim to determine whether \u201chis presence has a relation, reasonably substantial, to the fullness of his opportunity to defend against the charge.\u201d <em>Snyder v. Massachusetts, </em>291 U.S. 97, 105-06, 54 S. Ct. 330, 332, 78 L. Ed. 674 (1934); <em>State v. Schenk, </em>151 Mont. 493, 499, 444 P.2d 861, 864 (1968). As I believe Blake\u2019s absence from the emergency conference did not have a substantial relationship to his opportunity to defend against the charge, I would affirm the District Court pursuant to this inquiry only.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
