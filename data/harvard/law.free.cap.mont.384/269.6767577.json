We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">ISSUE PRESENTED</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">\u00b62 <em>Did the District Court err in denying Rossbach\u2019s motion to dismiss the revocation of his sentence pursuant to \u00a7 46-23-1012(2), MCA ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">\u00b63 Rossbach pled guilty to a robbery in 2001. The District Court sentenced Rossbach to fifteen years at the Montana State Prison with eleven years suspended, subject to conditions. Since 2001 the District Court has revoked Rossbach\u2019s sentence three times. The latest revocation occurred in May 2015 and is the basis for this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">\u00b64 Rossbach was discharged to probationary supervision from the Crossroads Correctional Center in April 2014. Probation Officer Amy Rehbein (\u201cRehbein\u201d) was familiar with Rossbach and testified to Rossbach\u2019s initial attempts to comply with the conditions of his release. However, after using methamphetamines, Rossbach became unpredictable and violated several conditions of his probation. On March 4, 2015, Rehbein faxed an Authorization to Pick Up and Hold Probationer (also known as a \u201cfield warrant\u201d) to the Lake County Detention Center. The field warrant included statements that detailed Rossbach\u2019s probation violations and an authorization to arrest and hold him. Rossbach was arrested and placed in the Lake County Detention Center on March 6, approximately 36 hours after the field warrant was faxed to the detention center. The Lake County attorney filed a formal petition to revoke in the District Court on March 12, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">\u00b65 Rossbach filed a motion to dismiss the petition on the grounds that the State did not comply with the statutory procedure set forth in \u00a7 46-23-1012(2), MCA. The District Court denied the motion to dismiss at a hearing on May 6, revoked his probation and sentenced Rossbach to the Department of Corrections for four years with credit for time served.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-11\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b296-12\">\u00b66 We review a district court\u2019s interpretation and application of a statute de novo. <em>State v. Triplett, </em>2008 MT 360, \u00b6 13, 346 Mont. 383, 195 P.3d 819. Our review of a conclusion of law is plenary; thus, we determine on appeal whether a district court\u2019s application of the law is correct. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>2001 MT 277, \u00b6 7, 307 Mont. 317, 37 P.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>701.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">\u00b6 7 <em>Did the District Court err in denying Rossbach\u2019s motion to dismiss the revocation of his sentence pursuant to \u00a7 46-23-1012(2), </em>MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">\u00b68 In interpreting a statute this Court looks to the plain meaning of the language included therein. <em>State v. Strong, </em>2015 MT 251, \u00b6 13, 380 Mont. 471, 356 P.3d 1078 (citing <em>Infinity Ins. Co. v. Dodson, </em>2000 MT 287, \u00b6 46, 302 Mont. 209, 14 P.3d 487). We also follow Montana\u2019s maxims of jurisprudence, which oblige us to disregard trifles, interpret the law reasonably, and avoid requiring idle acts. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1-3-223, -224, -233, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">\u00b69 Individuals on probation have diminished liberty interests and are subject to stark sanctions for violations of conditions of probation. <em>See State v. Macker, </em>2014 MT 3, \u00b6 9, 373 Mont. 199, 317 P.3d 150. Accordingly, \u00a7 46-23-1012(2), MCA, authorizes a probation officer to arrest a probationer without a warrant if the probationer has \u201cin the judgment of the probation ... officer, violated the conditions of probation.\u201d Furthermore, \u201c[a] written statement or oral authorization delivered with the probationer by the arresting officer to the official in charge of a detention center is sufficient warrant for the detention of the probationer if the probation and parole officer delivers the written statement within 12 hours of the probationer\u2019s arrest.\u201d Section 46-23-1012(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">\u00b610 In this case, Rehbein faxed a written statement thirty-six hours before Rossbach was arrested and held in the Lake County Detention Center. Rossbach contends on appeal that the State did not follow the statutory procedure as stated in \u00a7 46-23-1012(2), MCA, because the written statement was not delivered to the detention center between the moment of his arrest and twelve hours later. He contends that the State did not comply with the plain meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">\u00b611  Implicit in Rossbach\u2019s appeal is the suggestion that the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion rises to the level of a Due Process violation. A revocation hearing is not a criminal trial, but a civil proceeding in which the \u201coffender is not entitled to the full spectrum of rights and protections that exist in a criminal trial.\u201d <em>State v. Finley, </em>2003 MT 239, \u00b6 31, 317 Mont. 268, 77 P.3d 193. Section 46-23-1012(2), MCA, is written so the \u201cofficial in charge of a detention center\u201d receives, no later than twelve hours after the arrest sufficient cause to hold the probationer. The statute does not require service of the statement on the probationer. Section 46-23-1012(2), MCA. The purpose of the statute is to give the detention center timely written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>authority to hold the probationer, and does not impose an additional due process obligation upon the probation officer for the benefit of the defendant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The early delivery of the notice did not prejudice any of Rossbach\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">\u00b612 While it is accurate that the specific language used in the statute requires delivery of the statement \u201cwithin 12 hours of the probationer\u2019s arrest,\u201d nothing in the statute precludes the probation officer from filing an earlier notice. Section 46-23-1012(2), MCA. Considering the evident purpose of the statute, a reasonable construction of \u201cwithin 12 hours\u201d can accommodate the interpretation that the notice must be delivered no later than twelve hours after arrest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Statutory language should be interpreted so as to carry out its intended purpose. <em>S.L.H. v. State Comp. Mut. Ins. Fund, </em>2000 MT 362, \u00b6 16, 303 Mont. 364, 15 P.3d 948 (citing <em>United States Nat\u2019l Bank v. Indep. Ins. Agents of Am., Inc., </em>508 U.S. 439, 455, 113 S. Ct. 2173, 2182 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">\u00b613 Rossbach\u2019s analysis suggests that if Rehbein had delivered the same field warrant a second time twelve hours after his arrest rather than thirty-six hours before, the State would have complied with the statute. Such an interpretation of \u00a7 46-23-1012(2), MCA, is unreasonable, serves no evident purpose, and would require an idle act which we will not read into to the statute. Sections 1-3-223, -224, -233, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">\u00b614  For the foregoing reasons, we cannot agree that the District Court erred in denying the motion to revoke the petition. The District Court\u2019s Judgment of May 7, 2015, is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b298-9\">JUSTICES BAKER, SHEA, McKINNON and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b298-10\"> If the field warrant is not delivered within twelve hours following the arrest, the detention facility would be free to release the prisoner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b298-11\"> The word \u201cwithin\u201d serves to limit the length of time during which an action is allowable. The term is often used this way in statutes of limitations. <em>See, e.g., Cobb v. Saltiel, </em>2009 MT 171, \u00b6\u00b6 26-27, 350 Mont. 501, 210 P.3d 138; <em>Anderson v. </em>BNSFRy., 2015 MT 240, \u00b6 9, 380 Mont. 319, 354 P.3d 1248; <em>Johnston v. Centennial Log Homes &amp; Furnishings, Inc., </em>2013 MT 179, \u00b6 61, 370 Mont. 529, 305 P.3d 781 (J. McKinnon dissenting). Such statutes require a complaint to be filed no later than the end date provided.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
