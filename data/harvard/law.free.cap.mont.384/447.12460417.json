He was jailed in Roosevelt County for over ten months while he awaited testing results from the State Crime Lab. Finally, at the end of July 2014, a Roosevelt County jury convicted Velasquez of both charges. The trial court rejected Velasquez\u2019s argument that he was denied a speedy trial. We reverse and remand for dismissal of the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">\u00b62 Velasquez was riding in the back seat of a car that was stopped on September 25, 2013, when a law enforcement officer suspected the driver of being under the influence of alcohol or drugs. The arresting officer found crystals in a cigarette pack located on the dashboard between the driver and the front-seat passenger. The crystals field-tested positive for methamphetamine. Velasquez had a methamphetamine pipe in his pocket and admitted to smoking methamphetamine earlier that evening. The driver of the car also was arrested; the front-seat passenger, however, was not. Velasquez was charged with felony possession of a dangerous drug with intent to distribute, in violation of \u00a7 45-9-103, MCA, and with misdemeanor criminal possession of drug paraphernalia, in violation of \u00a7 45-10-103, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-10\">\u00b63 The District Court set trial for January 2014. Several weeks before trial, the State moved to continue the trial because the drug testing results were not yet complete and the State Crime Lab estimated nine months of backlog for drug analysis. Three days later, the District Court ordered the continuance. Velasquez objected to the continuance, asserting his speedy trial right.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-11\">\u00b64 Trial was re-set for March 2014. The State moved for continuance on the same basis as before and the District Court granted its request. The court granted the State\u2019s third motion to continue in May 2014. About two weeks before the July 31 trial date, Velasquez moved to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>dismiss the case for lack of a speedy trial. Velasquez was unable post the $5,000 bail and remained in the Roosevelt County jail until trial. By then, he had been incarcerated for 309 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">\u00b65 At the hearing on Velasquez\u2019s motion to dismiss, the court analyzed the alleged speedy trial violation under the factors articulated in <em>State v. Ariegwe, </em>2007 MT 204, \u00b6\u00b6 106-12, 338 Mont. 442, 167 P.3d 815. The court concluded that the entire delay was institutional delay attributable to the State and that Velasquez had timely asserted his speedy trial right. The court determined, however, that although the question of prejudice was \u201cclose,\u201d it did not tip the balance in Velasquez\u2019s favor. The court orally denied Velasquez\u2019s motion and the case proceeded to trial. The jury found Velasquez guilty of both charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">\u00b66 A speedy trial violation presents a question of constitutional law that we review de novo to determine whether the court correctly interpreted and applied the law. <em>State v. Zimmerman, </em>2014 MT 173, \u00b6 11, 375 Mont. 374, 328 P.3d 1132. We review the court\u2019s underlying factual findings for clear error. <em>Zimmerman, </em>\u00b6 11. A finding is clearly erroneous \u201cif it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if our review of the record convinces us that the court made a mistake.\u201d <em>State v. Brave, </em>2016 MT 178, \u00b6 6, 384 Mont. 169, 376 P.3d 139.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">\u00b67 <em>Did the District Court err in denying Velasquez\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">\u00b68 A criminal defendant has a constitutional right to speedy trial under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 20. When an accused claims that right has been violated, we consider (1) the length of the delay, (2) the reasons for the delay, (3) the accused\u2019s responses to the delay, and (4) prejudice to the accused as a result of the delay. <em>Zimmerman, </em>\u00b6 14. We balance these factors to determine whether the right to a speedy trial has been violated. <em>State v. Stops, </em>2013 MT 131, \u00b6 19, 370 Mont. 226, 301 P.3d 811. No single factor is dispositive; the factors are related and must be considered together with any other relevant circumstances. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 112. \u201c[E]ach factor\u2019s significance will vary from case to case.\u201d <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">\n<em>(1) Length of the Delay</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b476-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>\u00b69 We determine initially whether the length of the delay is at least 200 days, \u201cwhich is the trigger date for conducting the four-factor balancing test.\u201d <em>Zimmerman, </em>\u00b6 13. In this case, the District Court determined\u2014and the parties agree\u2014that the total length of the delay was 307 days, 107 days beyond the trigger date.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The longer the delay stretches beyond the 200-day trigger date, \u201cthe stronger the presumption is under Factor Four that the accused has been prejudiced by the delay, and the heavier the state\u2019s burden is under Factor Two to provide valid justifications for the delay.\u201d <em>Zimmerman, </em>\u00b6 14 (citing <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 49, 61).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">\u00b610 In <em>Zimmerman, </em>we concluded that an 89-day delay beyond the trigger date did not substantially increase the State\u2019s burden or the presumption of prejudice. <em>Zimmerman, </em>\u00b6 14; <em>accord State v. Charlie, </em>2010 MT 195, \u00b6\u00b6 50, 59, 357 Mont. 355, 239 P.3d 934 (holding that a 70-day delay beyond the trigger date was not enough to \u201cshow a particularly compelling justification for the delay\u201d). <em>But see State v. Billman, </em>2008 MT 326, \u00b6 18, 346 Mont. 118, 194 P.3d 58 (concluding that a 78-day delay beyond the trigger date \u201cpresents a considerable amount of delay, and we conclude that the State\u2019s justifications for the delay must be compelling and that it must make a persuasive showing that the delay did not prejudice Billman\u201d). In <em>Ariegwe, </em>a 208-day delay beyond the trigger date required the State to \u201cprovide particularly compelling justifications for the delay under Factor Two; and under Factor Four, the State must make a highly persuasive showing that Ariegwe was not prejudiced by the delay, while the quantum of proof that may be expected of Ariegwe under this factor is correspondingly lower.\u201d <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 123; <em>accord State v. Rose, </em>2009 MT 4, \u00b6 46, 348 Mont. 291, 202 P.3d 749 (holding that a 307-day delay beyond the trigger date \u201csubstantially\u201d increased the State\u2019s burden under Factor Two, \u201cthe presumption that pretrial delay prejudiced Rose is increased, and the quantum of poof expected of Rose under Factor Four is substantially decreased\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">\u00b611 The District Court did not address whether the extent of the delay increased the presumption of prejudice or the State\u2019s burden to justify the delay. Relying on <em>Zimmerman, </em>the State argues that the time elapsed days beyond the trigger date \u201cis not particularly long\u201d and therefore the State\u2019s burden and the presumption of prejudice are \u201crelatively low.\u201d Velasquez contends that presumption of prejudice \u201cis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>intensified\u201d by the delay of more than 100 days beyond the trigger date.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">\u00b612 Based on our case law we conclude that a 109-day delay beyond the trigger date occupies a middle ground between <em>Zimmerman </em>and <em>Ariegwe. </em>In other words, in this case, it increases the State\u2019s burden under Factor Two and Factor Four slightly more than it did in <em>Zimmerman, </em>but less than it did in <em>Ariegwe. </em>Accordingly, the State\u2019s burden to provide justifications for the delay in this case is higher, and the State must make a more persuasive showing that Velasquez was not prejudiced by the delay, \u201cwhile the quantum of proof that may be expected of [Velasquez] under this factor is correspondingly lower.\u201d <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 123.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">\n<em>(2) Reasons for the Delay</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">\u00b613 In considering the reasons for the delay, \u201cwe must identify each period of the delay, attribute the delay to the responsible party, and then assign weight to each period based on the specific cause and motive for the delay.\u201d <em>State v. Couture, </em>2010 MT 201, \u00b6 71, 357 Mont. 398, 240 P.3d 987. \u201cThe prosecution bears the burden of explaining pretrial delays.\u201d <em>Zimmerman, </em>\u00b6 15. Delay caused by the State\u2019s bad faith weighs \u201cheavily\u201d against it. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 67. Delay caused by negligence or lack of diligence occupies a middle ground, but it still \u201c \u2018falls on the wrong side of the divide between acceptable and unacceptable reasons for delaying a criminal prosecution once it has begun.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 69 <em>(quoting Doggett v. United States, </em>505 U.S. 647, 657, 112 S. Ct. 2686, 2693 (1992)). \u201c[T]he more delay in bringing the accused to trial that is due to lack of diligence or other \u2018unacceptable\u2019 reasons, the more likely the accused\u2019s speedy trial right has been violated.\u201d <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 72. Institutional delays are delays \u201cinherent in the criminal justice system and caused by circumstances largely beyond the control of the prosecutor and the accused, such as overcrowded court dockets.\u201d <em>Couture, </em>\u00b6 72. Institutional delay is attributable to the State, \u201cbut weighs less heavily against it than delay caused by bad faith, negligence, or lack of diligence.\u201d <em>Couture, </em>\u00b6 72.</p>\n<p id=\"Aa06\">\u00b614 The District Court concluded that there \u201cwas no basis at all for delay caused by the defense\u201d and that the entire delay was attributable to the State as institutional delay. The court noted, \u201cIt\u2019s the fact that the crime lab ... is slow on getting things.\u201d The court observed also, \u201c[W]hen I look at the way the crime lab is done, I think [the defense\u2019s] argument of negligence and lack of due diligence by the crime lab is a very good argument, but I don\u2019t know that it quite goes far enough for me to pull the trigger saying it\u2019s too far.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">\u00b615 The parties do not dispute that the period of time from Velasquez\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>arrest to the first trial is attributable to the State as institutional delay. The State argues that the period of delay from the first originally scheduled trial date to the actual trial properly was classified by the District Court as institutional delay. Relying on <em>Ariegwe, </em>the State claims that a \u201cdelay from waiting for test results from the Crime Lab is institutional.\u201d Pointing out that the prosecution \u201chad no control over when the Crime Lab would test the substance,\u201d the State faults Velasquez for \u201cwaitfing] until July 28,2014, to suggest in the district court that the State should inquire about the backlog at independent laboratories.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">\u00b616 Velasquez argues that the District Court erred in classifying all of the delay as institutional delay. He contends that \u201cthe 196-day delay between the originally scheduled trial date and the actual trial was caused by the State\u2019s lack of diligence.\u201d Velasquez suggests that as soon as the State learned that the crime lab would take nine months to conduct the drug testing, it should have pursued \u201calternative, timely testing,\u201d and that its failure \u201ceven to consider alternative testing sites\u201d was negligent. \u201cThe State\u2019s choice to do nothing,\u201d Velasquez contends, \u201cwas not a circumstance beyond the prosecutor\u2019s control and is not mere institutional delay.\u201d Additionally, Velasquez argues that he had no duty to suggest the use of independent labs because \u201cit is well settled that a defendant has no duty to advance his own prosecution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Agvf\">\u00b617 In this case, we identify two periods of delay: (1) the 113-day delay between Velasquez\u2019s arrest and the first scheduled trial date and (2) the 196-day delay between the first scheduled trial date and the actual trial date. We agree with the parties that the first period of delay was institutional delay attributable to the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">\u00b618 With respect to the second period of delay, keeping in mind that the State bears a higher burden to provide justifications for the delay, we conclude that the delay should be attributed to the State for lack of diligence. The prosecutor\u2019s constitutional obligation to try the defendant in a timely manner \u201crequires a good faith, diligent effort to bring him to trial quickly.\u201d <em>Zimmerman, </em>\u00b6 18. In <em>Ariegwe, </em>28-day and 56-day periods of delay were the result of the defendant\u2019s motion to continue on grounds that the parties were still waiting for test results from the crime lab. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 132-33. We concluded that such a delay was institutional. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 132-33. Another period of delay in <em>Ariegwe </em>resulted from the prosecution\u2019s motion to continue, which revealed that the motion \u201cwas necessitated by the State\u2019s delay in delivering evidence for testing at the crime lab.\u201d <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 129. That delay, we concluded, was attributable to the State due to lack of diligence. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 129. We observed that the failure to provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>discovery or send evidence to a crime lab in a timely manner \u201creflects a significant lack of diligence.\u201d <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">\u00b619 In the present case the State\u2019s inaction leads us to conclude that it was not diligent. The State was aware of the nine-month backlog at the crime lab by December 2013, when it first moved to continue Velasquez\u2019s trial. In January 2014, Velasquez raised concerns about how the testing delay might affect his speedy trial right. At the evidentiary hearing, a criminal investigator for the Roosevelt County Attorney\u2019s Office who had been working on Velasquez\u2019s case testified that when she emailed the crime lab to see if the drug testing had been initiated, she was \u201crepeatedly told\u201d that it would take nine months. Despite the State\u2019s awareness of the backlog and Velasquez\u2019s concerns, the record reveals no evidence that the State attempted to pursue any possible alternate testing locations after learning of and \u201crepeatedly\u201d confirming the nine-month delay. To be sure, the backlog at the State Crime Lab likely was \u201ccaused by circumstances largely beyond the control of the prosecutor.\u201d <em>Couture, </em>\u00b6 72. But the failure to inquire into the availability of independent labs was squarely in the State\u2019s control. Mere allusion to crime lab backlog is not sufficient justification where the State has not investigated any other options. <em>See State v. Fife, </em>193 Mont. 486, 490, 632 P.2d 712, 715 (1981) (\u201cMere allusion to good faith misunderstanding and crowded court calendars is not sufficient justification where the State has not been diligent.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"AD2\">\u00b620  The State\u2019s inaction in this case is similar to the State\u2019s failure to \u201csend[ ] evidence to the crime lab in a timely manner.\u201d <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 154. By simply accepting the nine-month delay and failing to potentially expedite the process by seeking out independent labs, the State showed dilatory inaction in moving the case toward trial. That Velasquez \u201cwaifled] until July 28,2014, to suggest in the district court that the State should inquire about the backlog at independent laboratories\u201d is immaterial. \u201c[T]he accused is under no obligation to ensure diligent prosecution of the case against him, and has no duty to bring himself to trial.\u201d <em>Zimmerman, </em>\u00b6 24 (internal citations omitted). The State knew for more than seven months that waiting for the results would cause significant delay in bringing Velasquez to trial. Had the prosecution inquired and determined that an alternate testing source was not reasonably available, the delay likely would be considered merely institutional. But its failure to even inquire falls beneath an acceptable threshold of diligence. We thus conclude that the 196-day delay between the first scheduled trial date and the actual trial date is attributable to the State and \u201cfalls on the wrong side of the divide between acceptable and unacceptable reasons for delaying a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>criminal prosecution once it has begun.\u201d <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">\n<em>(3) The Accused\u2019s Responses to the Delay</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ava-dedup-0\">\u00b621 In evaluating the accused\u2019s responses to the delay, we consider the \u201ctotality of the accused\u2019s responses\u201d to ascertain whether the accused \u201cactually wanted\u201d a speedy trial. <em>Zimmerman, </em>\u00b6 22. \u201c[T]he issue is not simply the number of times the accused acquiesced or objected!;] Ir lather, the focus is on the surrounding circumstances.\u201d <em>Zimmerman, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-5\">I There is no magical time for assertion of the right to a speedy trial which should be weighed more favorably to the defendant than some other time. So long as the defendant asserts his or her right to a speedy trial by a motion to dismiss on speedy trial grounds filed prior to the time of trial, we conclude that the defendant has satisfied the third-prong ... and that further analysis of that prong is not only unnecessary, but inappropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6_\"><em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 137 (citation omitted). \u201cThe defendant\u2019s assertion of his speedy trial right ... is entitled to strong evidentiary weight in determining whether the defendant is being deprived of the right.\u201d <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 78 (citing <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514, 531-32, 92 S. Ct. 2182, 2192-93 (1972)). It \u201cserves as a gauge of the weights the court should assign to the other three factors in the balancing.\u201d <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6110.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">\u00b622 Although the District Court concluded that Velasquez had affirmatively asserted his right to a speedy trial, Velasquez argues that the court \u201cerred in not ascribing any weight to this factor.\u201d Velasquez emphasizes that he objected to the State\u2019s motion to continue in January, asserting his right to a speedy trial and \u201cnoting that he [had] already been incarcerated for 104 days.\u201d His objection, Velasquez contends, \u201cput the State on notice, nearly a hundred days <em>before </em>crossing the 200-day speedy trial trigger, that he wanted a speedy trial and that the State\u2019s delaying his trial for the Montana State Crime Lab testing would violate his right to a speedy trial.\u201d Velasquez points out that he \u201cnever asked for a single continuance\u201d and that \u201c[n]one of the State\u2019s three motions to continue stated whether the State had contacted defense counsel concerning the motions or whether the defense agreed or objected to the continuances.\u201d Velasquez argues that his \u201ctimely insistence\u201d on a speedy trial \u201cweighs heavily\u201d in his favor with respect to this factor and \u201cadds weight\u201d in his favor to the other factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">\u00b623 In its response to Velasquez\u2019s motion to dismiss, the State conceded that Velasquez had \u201ctimely asserted his right before the commencement of the trial, as required in <em>Ariegwe.\" </em>For the first time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>on appeal, however, the State argues that \u201c[although he objected to a continuance early on, other circumstances indicate that Velasquez did not actually want to be brought to trial promptly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">\u00b624 It is well established that \u201ca party may not raise new arguments or change its legal theory on appeal because it is fundamentally unfair to fault the trial court for failing to rule on an issue it was never given the opportunity to consider.\u201d <em>State v. Hendershot, </em>2009 MT 292, \u00b6 31, 352 Mont. 271, 216 P.3d 754 (citations and internal quotations omitted). Because the State conceded in the trial court that Velasquez had \u201ctimely asserted his right\u201d under Factor Three, we decline to address its arguments with respect to this factor on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">\u00b625 We conclude that the District Court determined correctly that Velasquez had asserted his speedy trial right. He objected to the State\u2019s first motion to continue and moved to dismiss the charges against him for lack of a speedy trial before proceeding to trial. That Velasquez did not object to the State\u2019s other two motions to continue is not surprising. The record reveals that both motions were filed on a Friday and granted the following Monday. Based on the \u201ctotality of [Velasquez\u2019s] responses,\u201d it is clear that he \u201cactually wanted\u201d a speedy trial. <em>Zimmerman, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">\u00b626 We agree with Velasquez, however, that the court erred in failing to assign any weight to Factor Three. The District Court\u2019s comments on Factor Three were frugal: \u201cAs far as your assertion of your right, you guys asserted your right. I got no argument with that one.\u201d When balancing the factors the court did not consider Factor Three \u201ctogether with the other three factors of the balancing test\u201d as required by <em>Ariegwe. Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 79. The court referred only to Factors Two and Four: \u201c[W]hen we get down, right down to the balancing, you know, the institutional delay doesn\u2019t get weighed very heavily. I don\u2019t know that the prejudices to the defendant outweigh that and make it so that I need to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial, but, boy, it\u2019s getting close.\u201d That Velasquez timely asserted his right, indicating that he actually wanted to be brought to trial, weighs in his favor and \u201cis entitled to strong evidentiary weight in determining whether [he] is being deprived of the right [to a speedy trial].\u201d <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">\n<em>(4) Prejudice to the Accused</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">\u00b627 Under Factor Four, we consider whether the delay prejudiced the accused \u201cin light of the interests that the speedy trial right was designed to protect: (i) preventing oppressive pretrial incarceration, (ii) minimizing anxiety and concern caused by the presence of unresolved criminal charges, and (iii) limiting the possibility that the accused\u2019s ability to present an effective defense will be impaired.\u201d <em>Zimmerman, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>\u00b6 28. The parties in this case dispute each of these interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">i. Oppressive Pretrial Incarceration</p>\n<p id=\"ADA\">\u00b628 Whether pretrial incarceration is oppressive depends on the \u201cparticular circumstances,\u201d including \u201cthe duration of the incarceration, the complexity of the charged offense, any misconduct by the accused directly related to his incarceration, and the conditions of the incarceration, such as overcrowding, recreational opportunities, adequate food, climate control, proper medical care, cleanliness, and legal research capabilities.\u201d <em>Couture, </em>\u00b6 56. \u201c[T]he length of the pretrial incarceration that is \u2018oppressive\u2019 is less for a relatively simple offense than it is for a complex charge.\u201d <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 91; <em>accord Billman, </em>\u00b6 41 (holding that a 278-day incarceration, coupled with the relatively simple charges of felony DUI and two misdemeanor driving offenses, established that the pretrial delay had prejudiced the defendant); <em>Couture, </em>\u00b6 59 (concluding that a longer period of pretrial incarceration was justified due to the complexity of the charged offenses of deliberate homicide and tampering with evidence). When analyzingthe conditions of incarceration, \u201cwe focus on the condition of the facilities and how they impact the accused, rather than solely on the condition of the accused.\u201d <em>Couture, </em>\u00b6 62. \u201cThe question here is one of oppressiveness, not merely occasional unpleasantness.\u201d <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">\u00b629 The District Court concluded that Velasquez\u2019s pretrial incarceration was not oppressive because it was \u201cclear\u201d that he \u201cwould have been incarcerated otherwise [in California]\u201d before the current violation \u201cever came up.\u201d Velasquez counters that it is \u201centirely speculative\u201d whether he would have been incarcerated in California. Although his probation officer \u201cmay have been recommending incarceration,\u201d Velasquez contends that \u201cthere is no evidence in the record what sentence the California court would have actually imposed.\u201d Velasquez points out that he was \u201con the lowest level of supervision in California, and the California system has drug treatment alternatives to incarceration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">\u00b630 Velasquez argues that his 309-day incarceration at the Roosevelt County jail was in any event oppressive in both its duration and conditions. Velasquez emphasizes that \u201c[f]rom October 2013 to April 2014, [he] was not allowed to go outside even once.\u201d Velasquez contends further that he was charged excessive amounts to make phone calls and had trouble sending mail from jail. The jail, Velasquez claims, contained \u201cvisible mold and recirculated air that made [his] lungs hurt.\u201d He claims also that the conditions of his incarceration caused him to develop a skin infection.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">\u00b631 The State argues that the District Court correctly concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>Velasquez otherwise would have been incarcerated in California for violations that occurred \u201ca long time before this case arose.\u201d The State contends that while Velasquez\u2019s allegations about the jails may have been \u201c[olccassionally disagreeable or unpleasant,\u201d they were \u201cnot sufficient to establish oppressive conditions.\u201d While the State acknowledges that Velasquez \u201cdid not go outside in the winter,\u201d it points out that Velasquez \u201cwent outside several times a week when the weather was better.\u201d The State argues further that Velasquez had \u201cdrinkable water from two sources,\u201d and that after seeing a doctor, Velasquez\u2019s skin condition had gotten better.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">\u00b632 Upon review of the record, we conclude that the District Court\u2019s finding that Velasquez would have been incarcerated in California is not supported by substantial evidence. \u201cSubstantial evidence is evidence that a reasonable person might accept as adequate to support a conclusion; it consists of more than a mere scintilla of evidence, but may be somewhat less than a preponderance.\u201d <em>Brave, </em>\u00b6 6. At the hearing, Velsaquez acknowledged that he had received a letter a couple of months before the hearing, notifying him of his alleged California probation violation and advising him of a future hearing date. Velasquez testified that after receiving the letter, he asked one of the guards at the jail to run a National Crime Information Center (NCIC) check and learned that any warrants for him \u201cweren\u2019t extraditable.\u201d When the State questioned Roosevelt County criminal investigator Tierra Erwin, she testified that it was her \u201cunderstanding\u201d that California \u201cdid want [Velasquez] back.\u201d There was no indication, however, that California sought to extradite Velasquez. The State did not introduce evidence of a bench warrant for Velasquez, and Erwin admitted that to her knowledge there exists no judgment from California against Velasquez. Erwin acknowledged that when she searched the NCIC database at the time of Velasquez\u2019s arrest in September 2013, there was no warrant or detainer on Velasquez. The California probation officer\u2019s report of Velasquez\u2019s violation alleged that Velasquez had last reported to probation in January 2012; the probation violation report was filed in California in March 2014, and apparently was the first allegation of violation. The report showed that a March 2014 hearing date for the alleged probation violation had been extended to July 1, 2014\u2014nearly ten months after Velasquez\u2019s arrest in Montana. Although the California probation officer recommended that Velasquez be \u201csentenced to the mid-term and it be served in any penal institution,\u201d Velasquez testified that he had never been actually incarcerated in California but had served house arrest for 174 days. Velasquez testified also that he believed there were other options <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>besides incarceration available to him in California such as rehab.</p>\n<p id=\"Ayqv\">\u00b633 We cannot conclude from our review of the evidence that there is more than a \u201cmere scintilla\u201d to support the District Court\u2019s finding. We conclude that a reasonable mind could not accept such evidence as adequate to support a finding that Velasquez would have been incarcerated in California even if he were not incarcerated in Montana. The court\u2019s factual finding with respect to this issue was clearly erroneous. And, even assuming some likelihood of Velasquez\u2019s imprisonment in California, \u201cwhile the fact of incarceration on a separate charge is relevant [to the issue of oppressiveness], it is not dispositive.\u201d <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 92.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">\u00b634 The hearing evidence showed that Velasquez, jailed for ten months on a non-violent drug possession charge because he was unable to meet a $5,000 bail condition, was not allowed during at least half that time\u2014five months\u2014to step foot outdoors. He instead attempted to exercise within the confines of his jail cell but, with visible black mold inside the jail, Velasquez\u2019s \u201clungs hurt\u201d when he tried to exercise. Jailers, when not busy with other tasks, would bring water to the inmates instead of requiring them to drink the water available in their cells, which Velasquez maintained was \u201cnot drinkable.\u201d Velasquez was unable to maintain consistent contact with his family, either because he could not afford the one-dollar-per-minute phone charges or because jailers had cut off all prisoner phone access when someone misbehaved. (There is no evidence that Velasquez was responsible for any loss of phone privileges.) And mail to his family, and even to his attorney, did not always get delivered.</p>\n<p id=\"A4xN\">\u00b635  We agree with Velasquez that the impact of the facility\u2019s conditions was more than \u201coccasional unpleasantness.\u201d <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 93. We conclude that the duration of Velasquez\u2019s incarceration relative to the offense for which he was charged, combined with the conditions he endured at the Roosevelt County jail, support a finding that the circumstances of his incarceration were oppressive.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">\u00b636 Considering the evidence in light of the intensifying presumption of prejudice created by the 309 days of delay, Velasquez has presented sufficient evidence of oppressive incarceration to meet his lowered quantum of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">ii. The Accused\u2019s Anxiety and Concern</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">\u00b637 In assessing the accused\u2019s anxiety and concern, this Court focuses on \u201cthe ways in which the presence of unresolved charges disrupted the accused\u2019s life,\u201d keeping in mind that \u201c[a] certain amount of anxiety and concern is inherent in being accused of a crime.\u201d <em>Couture, </em>\u00b6 64. \u201c[T]he crucial question here is whether the delay in bringing the accused to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>trial has unduly prolonged the disruption of his or her life or aggravated the anxiety and concern that are inherent in being accused of a crime.\u201d <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">\u00b638 In <em>Zimmerman </em>we concluded that a 289-day delay in bringing Zimmerman to trial unduly prolonged the disruption of his life and aggravated his anxiety and concern. <em>Zimmerman, </em>\u00b6 34. We based our conclusion on the \u201cclear causal connection between the State\u2019s failure to diligently prosecute the charges and Zimmerman\u2019s worsening financial situation, aggravated mental health issues, and increased stress in his family relationships.\u201d <em>Zimmerman, </em>\u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">\u00b639 The District Court found that most of Velasquez\u2019s anxiety and concern related to his absence from his family in California. In light of its finding that Child Protective Services already had taken Velasquez\u2019s son away and that Velasquez had failed to complete the required treatment plan to get his son back, the court concluded that there could not be \u201cthat much anxiety and concern because [Velasquez] didn\u2019t seem to care enough to stay [in California] and get his treatment done.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">\u00b640 Echoing the District Court\u2019s conclusion, the State emphasizes that Velasquez\u2019s son \u201cwas taken from him by Child Protective Services and [Velasquez] did not complete his treatment plan when he left drug rehab early.\u201d The State notes also that Velasquez left his son in California \u201csix months before he was arrested in this case.\u201d The State points out that Velasquez did not lose his job because he was incarcerated in this case but that he had lost his job a month before he was arrested. The State relies on testimony from Velasquez\u2019s sentencing hearing to contend further that Velasquez\u2019s incarceration actually benefitted him.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">\u00b641 Velasquez argues that the State\u2019s delay in bringing him to trial <em>\u201cunduly prolonged </em>the disruption of his life or <em>aggravated </em>his anxiety and concern\u201d because of \u201chis inability to address his many financial, legal, and family matters while incarcerated in Montana.\u201d At the hearing Velasquez testified that his time in jail has been \u201creally stressful\u201d and that he had not been sleeping well. Velasquez explained that he was worried about \u201c[a] lot of things. My [three-and-a-half-year-old] son, my life, getting back on track, just\u2014mainly, my son.\u201d Velasquez admitted that Child Protective Services had taken his son and that he had not completed his treatment plan. He testified that before he left California, he had seen his son every weekend, but that because of his incarceration he has only been able to talk to his son \u201chere and there\u201d when he could afford a phone card. Velasquez takes issue with the State\u2019s reliance on sentencing hearing testimony to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>argue that his right to a speedy trial was not violated. Velasquez points out that the sentencing hearing \u201coccurred nearly two months <em>after </em>the evidentiary hearing\u201d and therefore, the testimony was not before the District Court when it analyzed the speedy trial violation. Accordingly, Velasquez argues that the sentencing testimony \u201cis not properly part of the speedy trial record\u201d and should not be considered by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"ADP6\">\u00b642 We agree with Velasquez that our review must be \u201cconfined to the record made before the district court\u201d at the time of the speedy trial hearing. <em>Whitaker v. Farmhand, Inc., </em>173 Mont. 345, 357, 567 P.2d 916, 923 (1977). As Velasquez correctly points out, the sentencing hearing occurred well after the District Court had ruled on the speedy trial motion. It was certainly not presented to or part of the record made before the District Court. We therefore do not consider the State\u2019s arguments with respect to testimony presented at the sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">\u00b643 While we acknowledge that the pretrial delay may have caused Velasquez anxiety and concern, based on the record before us, we do not conclude that it rose to a level beyond that \u201cinherent in being accused of a crime.\u201d <em>Couture, </em>\u00b6 64. Here, unlike <em>Zimmerman, </em>the record does not reflect a \u201cclear causal connection\u201d between the State\u2019s failure to diligently prosecute the charges and Velasquez\u2019s financial and family issues. <em>Zimmerman, </em>\u00b6 34. As the District Court noted, Velasquez had lost custody of his son and failed to complete his treatment plan well before he left California and became incarcerated in Montana. Likewise, Velasquez\u2019s struggles in obtaining or maintaining employment occurred before his arrest in this case. Velasquez testified that he had lost his job before his arrest because of \u201cmoney that [he] owed in California\u201d and because he had a suspended driver\u2019s license. After losing his job but prior to his arrest, Velasquez testified that he had been looking for jobs \u201ca little bit\u201d but did not have a vehicle or driver\u2019s license in order to look for jobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">\u00b644 We agree with the District Court that Velasquez did not present sufficient evidence to establish that the delay in bringing him to trial in this case caused undue prolonged disruption of his life or aggravated anxiety and concern beyond what any person accused of a crime would suffer.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">iii. Impairment of the Defense</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">\u00b645 Impairment of the defense \u201cconstitutes the most important interest in the prejudice analysis.\u201d <em>Zimmerman, </em>\u00b6 36. It evaluates issues of evidence, witness reliability, and the accused\u2019s ability to present an effective defense. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 98. \u201c[T]ime may erode the accuracy of witness testimony and exculpatory evidence,\u201d <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number><em>Jefferson, </em>2003 MT 90, \u00b6 36, 315 Mont. 146, 69 P.3d 641, and \u201cpretrial delay prejudices an accused if defense witnesses are unable to accurately recall past events,\u201d <em>Billman, </em>\u00b6 47 (citation omitted). Because \u201cexcessive delay presumptively compromises the reliability of trial in ways that neither party can prove,\u201d \u201cconsideration of prejudice is not limited to the specifically demonstrable.\u201d <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 99 (quoting <em>Doggett, </em>505 U.S. at 655, 112 S. Ct. at 2692-93) (internal quotations omitted). \u201c[I]n the absence of affirmative proof that the delay has impaired the accused\u2019s ability to present an effective defense, impairment must be assessed based on other factors in the analysis.\u201d <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 100.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-4\">A speedy trial claim likely would fail if the government had pursued the accused with reasonable diligence and the accused could not show specific prejudice to his or her defense as a result of the delay. Conversely, where the government has been negligent in bringing the accused to trial, such negligence is not automatically tolerable simply because the accused cannot demonstrate exactly how it has prejudiced him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-5\"><em>Zimmerman, </em>\u00b6 36 (citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">\u00b646 The District Court noted that a missing witness\u2014the front-seat passenger from the vehicle in which V elasquez was arrested\u2014had been located very close to the hearing date. The court observed, however, that \u201cnobody really ever said what [the witness] would say or wouldn\u2019t say to me that would make it seem that she was so important or not so important. I have no clue what she would say from everything that I read.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">\u00b647 Although the front-seat passenger was subpoenaed close to his trial date, Velasquez points out that the defense was not in touch with her at the time of the hearing and that she was \u201cmissing or unwilling to appear by the time of trial.\u201d \u201cWhile the record may not directly establish whether [the witness] would have been available at the original trial date,\u201d Velasquez argues that he has made \u201cat least some showing of a missing, exculpatory witness.\u201d Velasquez refers to the defense investigator\u2019s hearing testimony that the front-seat passenger \u201chad previously made allegations to police regarding [the driver\u2019s] actions in the vehicle.\u201d Velasquez argues also that he presented evidence at the evidentiary hearing that other witnesses had experienced diminished memories due to the delay. In any event, Velasquez argues that \u201caffirmative proof of specific defense impairment is not essential to every speedy trial claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">\u00b648 The State argues, \u201cThere was no evidence that Velasquez\u2019s defense was impaired by the delay\u201d because \u201c[n]o evidence was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>presented that if the trial were sooner, [the front-seat passenger] would have been located and would have appeared,\u201d and \u201cno evidence or indication of what [the witness\u2019s] testimony would be.\u201d In addition, the State claims that the District Court found that the delay \u201cworked in Velasquez\u2019s favor because it allowed him more time to try to locate [the witness].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">\u00b649 We disagree that the delay \u201cworked in Velasquez\u2019s favor\u201d and note that the District Court did not draw such a conclusion. The court stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-5\">As far as the limit the possibility the defense has, I kind of want to be a smart alec and say, it looks like now they\u2019ve found the lost witnesses, you\u2019re actually ahead by the delay as opposed to being behind. Although, it\u2019s also [the State\u2019s] witness they found, so <em>I don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s a win or not.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">(Emphasis added.) With respect to a showing of defense impairment, the record reflects that Velasquez made some showing of prejudice at the evidentiary hearing. The investigator for the defense testified that a couple of the police officers who were involved in the case had \u201csome recollection difficulties\u201d when he interviewed them. As Velasquez points out, the investigator testified also that the front-seat passenger witness had made \u201csome specific allegations\u201d against the driver of the vehicle. While such evidence may not be \u201cspecifically demonstrable,\u201d it is part of our consideration of prejudice. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">\u00b650 Finally, even \u201cin the absence of affirmative proof that the delay has impaired [Velasquez\u2019s] ability to present an effective defense,\u201d we look to other speedy trial factors to inform our analysis. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 100. As we determined in Factor One, the State must make a more persuasive showing that Velasquez was not prejudiced by the delay, \u201cwhile the quantum of proof that may be expected of [Velasquez] under this factor is correspondingly lower.\u201d <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 123. In Factor Two, we determined that the 196-day delay between the first scheduled trial date and the actual trial date is attributable to the State\u2019s lack of diligence in failing to consider alternative testing options. Such lack of diligence \u201cis not automatically tolerable simply because the accused cannot demonstrate exactly how it has prejudiced him.\u201d <em>See Zimmerman, </em>\u00b6 36. In considering the evidence of impairment in light of the other factors, we conclude that Velasquez was prejudiced by the delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">\n<em>Balancing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">\u00b651 In balancing the four factors in the analysis, we hold that the delay in this case establishes a constitutional speedy trial violation. The length of the delay intensified the presumption of prejudice to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>Velasquez and increased the State\u2019s burden to prove valid justifications for the delay. The pretrial delay due to the State\u2019s inaction toward obtaining timely drug-testing was an unacceptable reason for postponing Velasquez\u2019s trial, making it \u201cmore likely [that his] speedy trial right has been violated.\u201d <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 72. Velasquez\u2019s response to the delay in timely asserting his speedy trial right weighs further in his favor and should have been considered in the balancing equation. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 110. The District Court found Factor Four to be a close call, but concluded that the prejudice Velasquez suffered did not tip the scales sufficiently to demonstrate a violation of his speedy trial right. But because the District Court gave no weight to Velasquez\u2019s assertion of his right, and because we have determined that the State bears a heavier burden in this case to overcome the presumption of prejudice, we conclude that the scales do tip in Velasquez\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">\u00b652 In the final analysis, the guarantee of a \u201cspeedy\u201d trial rings hollow when a person too poor to afford bail sits in jail for nearly a year on a non-violent, straightforward, relatively minor drug possession charge, confined for half that time without one minute outside, and cut off in large measure from his distant family\u2014all because the State did not attempt to determine more quickly whether the car in which he was riding in fact contained illegal drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"AT8\">\u00b653  Velasquez did not receive protection of his constitutional right to a speedy trial. We therefore reverse the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss and remand for dismissal of the charges.</p>\n<judges id=\"b489-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES SHEA, WHEAT and McKINNON concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b476-6\"> By our calculation, the length of the delay totaled 309 days, 109 days beyond the trigger date.
