We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">\u00b62 We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-10\">\n<em>Issue One: Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it admitted evidence of Sayler\u2019s other crimes or acts under the transaction rule, \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-11\"><em>Issue Two: Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it allowed the State to ask leading questions of Fawna </em>Rainforth?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b524-13\">\u00b63 On October 18, 2013, the State charged Sayler with two counts of Partner or Family Member Assault, Third or Subsequent Offense, both felonies. These charges arise from allegations that on or about September 25, 2013, and on or about September 30, 2013, Sayler purposely or knowingly caused bodily injury to Fawna Rainforth (\u201cFawna\u201d), a partner or family member. The State alleges that during an altercation between Fawna and Sayler, Sayler yelled at Fawna, pushed her down repeatedly, grabbed her throat so tightly she could not breathe, and took her car.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-14\">\u00b64 Fawna is a disabled adult who had a sexual and dating relationship with Sayler. In September 2013, Fawna allowed Sayler to stay at her home and use her car. On September 30, 2013, Fawna and Sayler fought and yelled after she asked him to stop using her car and to give her the keys. Sayler refused to give Fawna the keys and pushed her down, where she fell over some boxes. Fawna got up and again asked for the keys and Sayler pushed Fawna down again. As she got up and asked for her keys a third time, Sayler grabbed her by the throat with his hands so tightly that she could not talk or breathe. Fawna had bruising on her chin, chest and arm as well as a cut on her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>hand. After the assault, Sayler took Fawna\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">\u00b65 Fawna\u2019s friend and neighbor noticed Fawna\u2019s bruising and reported it to the police. During the police interview Fawna also informed the officer that on or about September 25, 2013, Sayler assaulted her by hitting her twice which resulted in some of her bruises.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">\u00b66 When interviewed by the officer, Sayler stated that on September 30,2013, Fawna had been upset and had taken his cell phone; when he asked for it back she came at him, grabbing his arm. Sayler admitted to pushing Fawna in self-defense, which caused her to fall over a set of boxes. Sayler asserted Fawna gave him permission to take her car after the incident. Sayler was charged with two counts of partner or family member assault and arraigned on October 29, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">\u00b67 Prior to trial, Sayler filed a Motion in Limine to exclude his criminal history, including all convictions and all charges excluding the present one; allegations of uncharged criminal or bad acts by Sayler; any other \u2018prior bad acts\u2019 evidence not specifically identified but intended to be introduced by the State; and any evidence not produced in discovery. Sayler argued the evidence of him yelling at Fawna and taking her car was evidence of prior bad acts and therefore barred by M. R. Evid. 404(b). Further, Sayler argued the probative value of the evidence was substantially outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice to him. M. R. Evid. 403. The State argued it was admissible transaction evidence necessary to understand the nature of the parties\u2019 relationship and was inextricably linked to the charged offense. Section 26-1-103, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">\u00b68 On March 10,2014, the District Court concluded Sayler\u2019s criminal history would be excluded unless he opened the door to warrant admission as rebuttal evidence. However, under M. R. Evid. 404(b) and the related \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA (transaction rule), the District Court also held the State could introduce evidence of other or prior bad acts, specifically that Sayler was yelling at Fawna during either assault and that after one of the assaults he took Fawna\u2019s car. The District Court concluded these acts were evidence of motive and intent; thus, they were admissible under M. R. Evid. 404(b) relevant to Sayler\u2019s justifiable use of force defense and admissible under \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA, as transaction evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">\u00b69 At trial, Sayler\u2019s defense counsel objected to the State\u2019s direct questioning of Fawna, asserting the State was leading Fawna regarding how she received bruising on her chin. The District Court overruled the objection indicating that \u201cunder the circumstances, I\u2019m going to permit some mild leading in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>\u00b610 Sayler\u2019s jury trial took place on March 12,2014, and he was found guilty on count one for conduct occurring on September 30, 2013, and not guilty on count two for conduct occurring on September 25, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">\u00b611 \u201cA district court has broad discretion when determining the relevance and admissibility of evidence,\u201d and this Court reviews district court evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Given, </em>2015 MT 273, \u00b6 23, 381 Mont. 115, 359 P.3d 90. A district court \u201cabuses its discretion if it acts arbitrarily or unreasonably, and a substantial injustice results.\u201d <em>City of Kalispell v. Miller, </em>2010 MT 62, \u00b6 9, 355 Mont. 379, 230 P.3d 792. Where the district court\u2019s ruling is based on an interpretation of an evidentiary rule or statute, this Court reviews the ruling de novo. <em>See State v. Lamarr, </em>2014 MT 222, \u00b6 10, 376 Mont. 232, 332 P.3d 258.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">\u00b612 <em>Issue One: Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it admitted evidence of Sayler\u2019s other crimes or acts under the transaction rule, \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">\u00b613 Sayler contends the District Court abused its discretion when it admitted evidence that he yelled at Fawna and took her car after the September 30, 2013 altercation. Generally, \u201call relevant evidence is admissible\u201d unless otherwise provided by law. M. R. Evid. 402. Section 26-1-103, MCA, provides \u201cwhere the declaration, act, or omission forms part of a transaction which is itself the fact in dispute or evidence of that fact, such declaration, act, or omission is evidence as part of the transaction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">\u00b614 This court has held that \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA, allows transaction evidence when acts are inextricably linked and explanatory of the charges. <em>State v. Guill, </em>2010 MT 69, \u00b6 36, 355 Mont. 490, 228 P.3d 1152; <em>see also State v. Bauer, </em>2002 MT 7, \u00b6 22, 308 Mont. 99, 39 P.3d 689 (\u201cIt is well established that evidence which tends to explain circumstances surrounding the charged offense is relevant, probative and competent.\u201d). This Court determined that the transaction rule \u201cis most legitimately used to admit uncharged misconduct when such conduct arises from a continuing series of events.\u201d <em>Guill, </em>\u00b6 45. Moreover, this Court has been careful in limiting the transaction rule\u2019s application and subjecting it to fact-specific balancing under M. R. Evid. 403. <em>See Lamarr, </em>\u00b6 14. M. R. Evid. 403 allows the court to exclude otherwise admissible and relevant evidence when its prejudicial effect substantially outweighs its probative value. <em>Lamarr,</em></p>\n<p id=\"A0Zy\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>\u00b6 14 (citing <em>State v. Hardman, </em>2012 MT 70, \u00b6 16, 364 Mont. 361, 276 P.3d 839). It is within the trial court\u2019s discretion to decide whether the danger of unfair prejudice substantially outweighs the probative value of the evidence. <em>State v. Hicks, </em>2013 MT 50, \u00b6 24, 369 Mont. 165, 296 P.3d 1149.</p>\n<p id=\"A7oP\">\u00b615  In this case, the facts that Sayler was yelling at Fawna and took her car after the altercation are inextricably linked to and explanatory of the facts regarding the nature and power dynamic of the relationship. <em>Guilt, </em>\u00b6 36. Moreover, the altercation which resulted in the charges, and taking the car were all part of a \u201ccontinuing series of events,\u201d which explained the circumstances of the charges. <em>Guilt, \u00b6 </em>45. The District Court properly admitted evidence that Sayler yelled and then took Fawna\u2019s car under the Montana transaction rule.</p>\n<p id=\"Ah89\">\u00b616  Sayler failed to follow the proper procedure for precluding evidence. <em>State v. Eighteenth Jud. Dist., </em>2010 MT 263, \u00b6 49, 358 Mont. 325, 246 P.3d 415. However, the District Court analyzed this evidence and determined it was relevant to Sayler\u2019s justifiable use of force claim and the probative value did not substantially outweigh the danger of unfair prejudice. The District Court did not abuse its discretion when it found that the probative value of the evidence was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">\u00b617 <em>Issue Two: Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it allowed the State to ask leading questions of Fawna </em>Rainforth?</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">\u00b618 Sayler contends the District Court abused its discretion when it allowed the State to ask leading questions of Fawna on direct examination. \u201cLeading questions should not be used on the direct examination of a witness except as may be necessary to develop the witness\u2019 testimony.\u201d M. R. Evid. 611(c); <em>State v. Eiler, </em>234 Mont. 38, 45, 762 P.2d 210, 215 (1988). The well-established exception to using leading questions is within M. R. Evid. 611(c). This exception recognizes the use of leading questions on direct examination with a \u201cchild witness or an adult with communication problems.\u201d Commissions Comments to M. R. Evid. 611, (quoting Advisory Committee\u2019s Note to Federal Rule 611(c), 56 F.R.D. 183, 275 (1972), citing 3 Wingmore on Evidence, \u00a7\u00a7 774-78 (Chadbourn Rev. 1970)). Most importantly, \u201cleading questions may be asked if necessary to develop testimony ... and whether or not they will be allowed is a matter for the trial court\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>Bailey v. Bailey, </em>184 Mont. 418, 421, 603 P.2d 259, 261 (1979); <em>see also State v. Spotted Hawk, </em>22 Mont. 33, 64-65, 55 P. 1026, <em>1035 (1899); Hefferlin v. Karlman, </em>29 Mont. 139, 145, 74 P. 201, 202 (1903) (\u201c[EJxamination of a witness ... is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court, who may, in the exercise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>of that judicial discretion, allow or disallow leading questions.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"anj-dedup-0\">\u00b619  In this case, the District Court properly allowed the State to use leading questions to elicit testimony from Fawna. The exception in M. R. Evid. 611(c) allowed the State to use leading questions because there was ample evidence at trial that Fawna was an adult with communication problems, includingher developmental disability, mild mental handicap, and confusion about time and place. The District Court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"aqx-dedup-1\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">\u00b620 For the foregoing reasons, the defendant\u2019s conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"a0t-dedup-0\">JUSTICES COTTER, SHEA, BAKER and McKINNON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
