We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">\u00b62 We restate the issue on appeal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-6\">\n<em>Did the District Court err in not giving the defendant\u2019s proposed instruction on accomplice liability?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">\u00b63 Riley Charlo-Whitworth (\u201cWhitworth\u201d) and Alexis Paul (\u201cPaul\u201d) were engaged in a romantic relationship. Whitworth was cohabitating with Paul and her 2-year-old child, M.P., in Great Falls. The record shows that on the evening of January 25, 2013, Whitworth drove Paul to her second job at around 7:00 p.m. Whitworth was then the sole caretaker of M.P. He put the child to bed around 8:30 p.m., but M.P. woke up crying around 10:00 p.m. Whitworth admitted during questioning by the police that he was frustrated with M.P. and shoved the child into a wall. Whitworth admitted he spanked the 2-year old child\u2019s genitals and hit him with hammer-fisted blows. M.P. was bleeding so Whitworth gave him a bath.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">\u00b64 Around midnight Whitworth had to pick up Paul from work, so without any prior notice, he brought M.P. to Paul\u2019s uncle and aunt, who lived approximately three miles away. After the child arrived, the aunt and uncle saw M.P.\u2019s injuries, and noticed that M.P. was in pain and unresponsive. Whitworth told them that M.P. had fallen down the stairs. He left M.P. with the aunt and uncle. He returned 20 minutes later with Paul. The aunt and uncle suggested to Paul that the child had been physically abused and that she should take M.P. to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-10\">\u00b65 Paul, Whitworth and M.P. returned to their apartment. After a while Paul realized that M.P. was seriously injured and Whitworth drove them to the hospital, where they arrived at 2:50 a.m.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After examining M.P. the doctor found that the child had suffered severe trauma to his pancreas and several blows to his body and genitals, as well as a serious tear in his mouth. Due to the severity of M.P.\u2019s injuries, he was flown to Harborview Medical Center in Seattle for necessary medical care.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-11\">\u00b66 Whitworth was charged with several counts including Aggravated Assault, Criminal Endangerment and Assault on Minor. Whitworth\u2019s theory of defense was that the injuries were inflicted by Paul, not him. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>At trial the aunt and uncle testified as to the events of that night. Whitworth proposed jury instructions directing the jury to view the aunt and uncle\u2019s testimony with distrust, pursuant to \u00a7 26-1-303(4), MCA, which provides that the \u201ctestimony of a person legally accountable for the acts of the accused ought to be viewed with distrust.\u201d The District Court declined to provide that instruction. Whitworth was convicted of three felony counts and the Court imposed a sentence of 35 years in the Montana State Prison. Whitworth appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">\u00b67 We review jury instructions to assess whether they fairly and fully instruct the jury on the applicable law. <em>State v. Allen, </em>2010 MT 214, \u00b6 22, 357 Mont. 495, 241 P.3d 1045 (citing <em>State v. Dewitz, </em>2009 MT 202, \u00b6 66, 351 Mont. 182, 212 P.3d 1040). A district court has broad discretion in instructing the jury. <em>State v. Courville, </em>2002 MT 330, \u00b6 15, 313 Mont. 218, 61 P.3d 749.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">\u00b68 <em>Did the District Court err in not giving the defendant\u2019s proposed instruction on accomplice liability?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">\u00b69 Montana law specifically states that \u201c[a] person may not be found guilty of an offense on the testimony of one responsible or legally accountable for the same offense ... unless the testimony is corroborated by other evidence that [independently] tends to connect the defendant with the commission of the offense.\u201d Section 46-16-213, MCA. Legal accountability exists when \u201ceither before or during the commission of an offense with the purpose to promote or facilitate the commission, the person solicits, aids, abets, agrees, or attempts to aid the other person in the planning or commission of the offense.\u201d Section 45-2-302(3), MCA. Section 26-1-303(4), MCA, directs the district court to instruct the jury \u201con all proper occasions\u201d that \u201ctestimony of a person legally accountable for the acts of the accused ought to be viewed with distrust.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">\u00b610 In <em>State v. Johnson, </em>we held that the district court should give the accomplice liability instruction on \u201call proper occasions\u201d and that it is within the district court\u2019s discretion to judge whether the case is a \u201cproper occasion.\u201d 257 Mont. 157, 163, 848 P.2d 496, 499 (1993); \u00a7 26-1-303(4), MCA. It is proper to give the instruction if there is significant accomplice testimony and the defendant requested the instruction. <em>Johnson, </em>257 Mont. at 163, 848 P.2d at 499; \u00a7 26-1-303(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>\u00b611 The purpose of the accomplice liability instruction is rooted in common sense. In our criminal justice system, we presume that witnesses will testify truthfully. Section 26-1-302, MCA. Nevertheless, Montana statutes also recognize the principle that if a person can avoid or lessen her punishment by testifying against another, that person will have strong motivations to not speak truthfully. Entitling a jury to view such testimony with disfavor is the specific purpose of the accomplice liability instruction in \u00a7 26-1-303(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">\u00b612 However, the propriety of that instruction presupposes the existence of an accomplice. Section 45-2-302(3), MCA. Accordingly, if the defendant claims at trial that he did not commit the acts for which he is being tried, he cannot then ask the court to instruct the jury that a testifying witness aided the defendant in the commission of those acts. In other words, a person cannot be an accomplice to a person who did not commit the crime. Further, if there is no evidence to suggest that a testifying witness is legally accountable, then it is not proper to give the accomplice liability instruction. <em>State v. Hall, </em>2003 MT 253, \u00b6 30, 317 Mont. 356, 77 P.3d 239.</p>\n<p id=\"Afs\">\u00b613  Our analysis in <em>Hall </em>clearly addressed this principle. If the defendant claims \u201che did not do it, he was not there, and is not culpable or responsible, so be it. But then in such an event, [the testifying witness] is not an accomplice, nor is he legally accountable within the meaning of the instruction. He just did it.\u201d <em>Hall, </em>\u00b6 28 (quoting the district court). Relying on the specific facts of the case, we held in <em>Hall </em>that \u201cit is not proper to give an accountability instruction where it is not supported by the evidence and is inconsistent with the defendant\u2019s claim of innocence.\u201d <em>Hall, </em>\u00b6 30. <em>Hall </em>stands for the proposition that if there is no evidence to establish legal accountability, then it is improper to instruct the jury that they should view the nonexistent accomplice\u2019s testimony with disfavor. <em>Hall, </em>\u00b6 30. There must be a basis to support an accomplice liability instruction either in the facts of the case or in the theory of the defense. <em>See, e.g., State v. Green, </em>2009 MT 114, \u00b6 18, 350 Mont. 141, 205 P.3d 798 (it is proper to not request the accomplice liability instruction if it is inconsistent with theory of the defense), (citing <em>State v. Johnson, </em>257 Mont. 157, 163, 848 P.2d 496, 499 (1993).) <em>See also State v. Higley, </em>190 Mont. 412, 429, 621 P.2d 1043, 1054 (1980), (the propriety of a jury instruction is in part assessed on the defense\u2019s theory of the case). Furthermore, jury instructions must be applicable to the case. <em>Higley, </em>190 Mont. at 429, P.2d at 1054. In other words, there must be some basis in the facts or evidence for presenting the law to the jury. <em>State v. David Hall, </em>1999 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>MT 297, \u00b6 43, 297 Mont. 111, 991 P.2d 929. The rule that jury instructions must fully and fairly instruct the jury on the law applicable to the record is embedded in Montana jurisprudence. <em>State v. Bosch, </em>125 Mont. 566, 574, 242 P.2d 477, 481 (1952); <em>Jeffries Coal Co. v. Mont. State Indus. Accident </em>Bd., 131 Mont. 511, 521, 312 P.2d 128, 134 (1957); <em>State v. Reiner, </em>179 Mont. 239, 244, 587 P.2d 950, 953-54 (1978); <em>Dewitz, </em>\u00b6 66. In Hall\u2019s particular case, the facts did not support an accomplice liability instruction, and such an instruction was inconsistent with his defense of total innocence. <em>See also Allen, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">\u00b614 In this case, Whitworth argues on appeal that the District Court committed reversible error when it declined to instruct the jury pursuant to \u00a7 26-1-303(4), MCA. In support of his argument, Whitworth claims that the aunt and uncle were responsible for the welfare of M.P. after seeing his injuries, and that their testimony was an effort to shift blame from Paul. As such they were at least accomplices to the crime of criminal endangerment.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">\u00b615 Whitworth\u2019s arguments do not survive scrutiny. First of all, to the extent that Whitworth suggests that the aunt and uncle were accomplices to Paul, the instruction is not proper. Statutes are to be interpreted according to the plain meaning of the language used. <em>Mitchell v. State, </em>2015 MT 120, \u00b6 9, 379 Mont. 127, 347 P.3d 1278. Section 26-1-303(4), MCA, clearly limits the use of the instruction to cases where the witness is suggested to be an accomplice \u201cfor the acts of the <em>accused,\u201d </em>in this case Whitworth.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">\u00b616 In order to qualify for an accomplice liability instruction for the assault charges, Whitworth has to present evidence that the aunt and uncle were involved in the physical abuse of M.P. <em>Hall, </em>\u00b6 30. Nothing in the record suggests that the aunt and uncle aided Whitworth in any manner other than watching the child. The evidence indicates that M.P. arrived at their house after sustaining the injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">\u00b617 Moreover, neither was charged with criminal endangerment and nothing in the record indicates they committed that offense. They testified that they were deceived by Whitworth\u2019s story that the child had fallen down the stairs. And significantly, suggesting that the aunt and uncle were accomplices to Whitworth for the offense is inconsistent with his theory of defense. As such, it would not be proper to give the proffered instruction. <em>State v. Root, </em>2015 MT 310, \u00b6 15, 381 Mont. 314, 359 P.3d 1088.</p>\n<p id=\"A_u\">\u00b618  We cannot conclude that the District Court abused its discretion when it declined to instruct the jury that the aunt and uncle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>were accomplices in the actions for which Whitworth was charged. The instruction was not consistent with his theory of defense nor is it supported by any evidence in the record that the aunt and uncle were legally accountable for these crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">\u00b619 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b81-7\">JUSTICES RICE, McKINNON, BAKER and WHEAT concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b77-12\"> Paul subsequently pleaded guilty to Criminal Endangerment in a separate proceeding for failing to promptly provide medical attention to the child.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
