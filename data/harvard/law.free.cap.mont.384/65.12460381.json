(referred to herein simply as \u201cZ\u201d) is the 12-year-old son of Jessica Jeanne Johnson (Jessica), and Daniel William Batey (Daniel). Jessica appeals the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Final Parenting Plan entered by the First Judicial District Court, Lewis and Clark County. The Final Parenting Plan named Daniel as the primary care provider, after Jessica had been Z\u2019s primary provider. We affirm and address the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-10\"><em>1. Did the District Court err by modifying the parenting plan because changed circumstances did not exist to justify modification of the existing parenting plan </em>?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-11\"><em>2. Were the District Court\u2019s findings of fact related to Z\u2019s best interests clearly </em>erroneous?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-12\"><em>3. Did the District Court err in denying Jessica\u2019s request for attorney fees and </em>costs?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b92-14\">\u00b62 Z was born in 2003 to Jessica and Daniel, who were then both in high school. From birth, Jessica was the primary care provider for Z, with assistance from Daniel and their respective families. Jessica and Daniel did not marry and, after their romantic relationship ended, the parties managed to parent Z without significant court intervention. Jessica petitioned for a parenting plan in 2005, and the court adopted a Stipulated Parenting Plan. In 2007, the parents filed a Stipulated First Amended Parenting Plan (referred to herein as the \u201cAmended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>Plan\u201d), which was also adopted by the court. It remained in force until the events described below.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">\u00b63 The Amended Plan provided that Z would reside primarily with Jessica, while spending alternating weekends, designated holidays, and birthdays with Daniel, \u201cregardless if the parents are living in the same community or not.\u201d Both parties acknowledge that, while they adhered more or less to the Amended Plan, they were flexible in the time each would spend with Z.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">\u00b64 After both parties attended Helena College of Technology, Daniel moved to Missoula in 2006. In 2008, shortly after the Amended Plan was adopted, Jessica moved to Butte with Z, who attended school there until 2011. In 2011, Jessica moved to Wise River, and Z attended school there. Jessica moved to the Missoula area in 2012, finding a place to live in Frenchtown. Z attended Target Range Elementary School in Missoula for a time, until Jessica started to homeschool him. The homeschooling period did not last long, and thereafter, Z attended the Frenchtown public schools until October 2014. During the time that both parties lived in the Missoula area, Daniel began exercising more time with Z, in excess of the time provided in the Amended Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"AN1\">\u00b65 By the fall of 2014, Daniel had moved back to Helena, and was working there. Although the parties hotly contest the characterization of the transfer of Z that took place in Helena, a simplified version is as follows: Jessica decided to move back to Helena, and asked Daniel if Z could live with him in anticipation of her relocation to the area. Daniel, taking this request to mean that Z would live with him for the remainder of the school year, agreed, and enrolled Z at Hawthorne Elementary School in the fall of the 2014-2015 academic year. Jessica maintains that both parties understood that Z would live with Daniel only through the end of the current semester, stating: \u201cSo it was my intention that, at winter break, I would retrieve [Z] and put him in school wherever I decided to live at that time.\u201d Upon her move to Helena, Jessica initially lived with her father, who resided within the city limits, while she was looking for employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">\u00b66 An incident occurred on November 18, 2014, at Hawthorne Elementary School. Daniel had set up a meeting with Z\u2019s fifth grade teacher to discuss Z\u2019s progress and needs, and informed Jessica, who declined to attend the meeting because Daniel\u2019s girlfriend was going to be there. Nonetheless, the parties agreed that Jessica could pick up Z early from school that day in order to have dinner with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">\u00b67 Before the scheduled parent-teacher meeting began, Jessica arrived at the school and found Z outside of his classroom with his teacher. Jessica approached the teacher, who asked her some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>identifying questions. Jessica informed the teacher who she was, that she was there to pick up Z, and that she wasn\u2019t sure she wanted Z to continue attending school there. School officials did not recognize Jessica because she was not registered with the principal\u2019s office, and therefore were reluctant to release Z to her care. Jessica became angry, and school officials called law enforcement and Daniel to respond at the school. The situation eventually de-escalated, and Jessica left the school with Z.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">\u00b68 However, Jessica then withdrew Z from enrollment at Hawthorne School, and contacted Rossiter Elementary School and Jim Darcy Elementary School about possible enrollment of Z. Ultimately, Z was not enrolled at either school, because several days later, Jessica moved from Helena to Wolf Creek to live with her mother. The District Court found that \u201cI a liter several days in which [Z] did not attend school and/or was unaware which school he would eventually attend, Jessica enrolled [Z] in the Wolf Creek School....\u201d Jessica admits that she did not consult Daniel about removing Z from Hawthorne School or about enrolling him at the Wolf Creek School, because she felt she was \u201cwithin [her] right in the parenting plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">\u00b69 On November 19, 2014, the day after the incident at Hawthorne School, Daniel filed a pro se emergency Motion to Amend the Amended Plan. After obtaining counsel, he filed a Renewed Motion to Implement Interim Parenting Plan, supported by affidavits, on December 15, 2014. Daniel\u2019s basis for his motion was that the Amended Plan was \u201coutdated and irrelevant to our current circumstancesl,|\u201d and that Jessica\u2019s multiple moves and frequent changes in schools, especially in light of the most recent incident at Hawthorne School, were disruptive to Z\u2019s stability. Daniel\u2019s proposed parenting plan named him as the primary residential parent. The District Court appointed a guardian ad litem for Z on December 19, 2014, and conducted a hearing on August 10, 2015, taking testimony from both parents, the guardian ad litem, Z\u2019s fifth grade teacher at Wolf Creek, and Z\u2019s maternal grandmother. Jessica testified that she had moved into a house she had purchased in Dearborn in May 2015, and was hoping to enroll Z in the Cascade County School. Jessica indicated that she had toured the school with Z, and had given him the impression that he would be attending that school in the upcoming fall as a sixth grader.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">\u00b610 The District Court entered its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Final Parenting Plan on August 14, 2015, naming Daniel as the primary residential parent and providing that Jessica would have parenting time every other weekend and designated holidays, and for alternating three-week periods in the summer. Jessica appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">\u00b611 Jessica argues on appeal that the District Court modified the Amended Plan without first making a finding of changed circumstances, as required by \u00a7 40-4-219(1), MCA. \u201c[WJhere the allegation is that the district court made no such [required] findings in the first place and the issue is whether the court\u2019s action conforms to statutory requirements, we are presented with a question of law, which we review <em>de novo.\u201d Jacobsen v. Thomas, </em>2006 MT 212, \u00b6 13, 333 Mont. 323, 142 P.3d 859 <em>(citing In re T.H., </em>2005 MT 237, \u00b6 35, 328 Mont. 428, 121 P.3d 541).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">\u00b612 Jessica argues on appeal that the District Court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-7\">We review the findings in support of a district[] [court\u2019s] decision to modify a parenting plan under the clearly erroneous standard. Conclusions of law are reviewed for correctness, and we will only reverse a district court\u2019s decision where an abuse of discretion has been clearly demonstrated. In other words, a district court\u2019s decision \u201cwill not be disturbed on appeal unless there is a mistake of law or a finding of fact not supported by substantial credible evidence that would amount to a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d The test for abuse of discretion is whether the trial court acted arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-8\"><em>Guffin v. Plaisted-Harman, </em>2010 MT 100, \u00b6 20, 356 Mont. 218, 232 P.3d 888 (quoting <em>In re S.P., C.P., H.M., J.M., and </em>Y.M., 241 Mont. 190, 194, 786 P.2d 642, 644 (1990)) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">\u00b613 <em>1. Did the District Court err by modifying the parenting plan because changed circumstances did not exist to justify modification of the existing parenting plan </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"b95-11\">\u00b614 Jessica argues that, because the District Court failed to make a specific finding that a change in circumstances had occurred, the court did not have jurisdiction to modify the parenting plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-12\">\u00b615 Section 40-4-219(1), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-13\">The court may in its discretion amend a prior parenting plan if it finds, upon the basis of facts that have arisen since the prior plan or that were unknown to the court at the time of entry of the prior plan, that a change has occurred in the circumstances of the child and that the amendment is necessary to serve the best interest of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>the child....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AxN\">\u00b616  Jessica correctly notes that the District Court did not enter a finding expressly addressing a \u201cchange in circumstances.\u201d While it is preferable that district courts enter such a finding, and we urge courts to do so, we have previously held that this omission does not necessarily constitute reversible error. <em>In re Marriage of Burk, </em>2002 MT 173, \u00b6 11, 310 Mont. 498, 51 P.3d 1149. Here, the District Court made a number of findings demonstrating that a change in circumstances had occurred, including noting the guardian ad litem\u2019s \u201cgreatest and over-riding concern for [Z] is that he has been subjected to numerous disruptions in his social and educational development precipitated by Jessica\u2019s frequent moves.\u201d The District Court also found that \u201c[i]n recent years Daniel grew concerned that [Z] was experiencing difficulty adjusting, as evidenced by his educational performance in the classroom.\u201d Although the District Court did not use the language of the guardian ad litem\u2014that \u201c[s]ix schools, in six towns, in six years is [sic] too much\u201d\u2014the point it made was nonetheless the same. We are satisfied that the District Court sufficiently supported its decision to modify the Amended Plan with findings indicating that changed circumstances existed that required review and consideration of a modification of the parenting plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">\u00b617 Jessica points to language of the Amended Plan that \u201cmakes it clear that the parties anticipated that one or both of them may move and specifically provided for that possibility. Because the [Amended] Plan contemplated that the parties might move when it was adopted by the district court, moving is not a changed circumstance.\u201d She further argues that because the parties agreed on changes in Z\u2019s schooling, such changes do not constitute a change in circumstance.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aps0\">\u00b618 This Court recognizes that parents move and that children need to change schools as a family relocates. These circumstances arise commonly. Parenting plans may even contemplate a future change in schools for a child. <em>See, e.g., In re Whyte, </em>2012 MT 45, 364 Mont. 219, 272 P.3d 102. Such changes do not, by themselves, constitute a change in circumstances necessitating an amendment to an existing parenting plan. <em>See Ramberg v. Massey (In re C.M.R.), </em>2016 MT 120, 383 Mont. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>398, 372 P.3d 1275. However, if moving occurs in a manner that becomes disruptive to the child or to the functioning of the parenting plan, it may constitute a change in circumstances requiring review of the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">\u00b619 Here, the District Court heard testimony outlining Z\u2019s multiple changes in living arrangements and school enrollments over the years. The court heard Daniel\u2019s testimony that \u201cI\u2019ve had these concerns that I\u2019ve talked about for a number of years.... Mainly him moving around and having, you know, difficulties definitely socially. I mean, [Z] has had very few friends in his life.\u201d The guardian ad litem testified that \u201cit\u2019s perplexing to me the number of times that Jessica\u2019s chosen to change his [Z\u2019s] educational environment. That really was my primary concern[,]\u201d and that \u201cI just think the constant moving is so hard on [Z].\u201d Thus, there was evidence to support the District Court\u2019s findings that Z had experienced detrimental effects from the number of moves and changes in schools, necessitating review of the parenting plan.</p>\n<p id=\"Aus\">\u00b620  Finally, Jessica argues that the District Court did not explicitly address whether the Amended Plan was \u201coutdated,\u201d as Daniel alleged in his motion for modification. However, Jessica acknowledged in her pleadings to the District Court that \u201cthe current parenting plan needs to be revised,\u201d consistent with our determination here that there was a sufficient showing of a change in circumstances to consider modifying the parenting plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">\u00b621 2. <em>Were the District Court\u2019s findings of fact related to Z\u2019s best interests clearly </em>erroneous?</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">\u00b622 Jessica argues that the District Court\u2019s findings of fact were clearly erroneous, claiming that \u201cthe record as a whole does not support the [DJistrict [CJourt\u2019s findings.\u201d We address Jessica\u2019s specific contentions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">\n<em>a. Z was experiencing difficulty adjusting to school.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Al8\">\u00b623  Jessica argues that \u201c[tjhere was simply nothing in the record upon which the [DJistrict [C]ourt could have reasonably concluded\u201d that Z\u2019s school performance was suffering due to Jessica\u2019s parenting or living situation. We disagree. The record includes testimony from Z\u2019s fifth grade teacher at Wolf Creek School, who testified that when Z was first enrolled, she gave him an academic assessment. Although acknowledging Z\u2019s reading strength, she testified, \u201cBut in math, I definitely saw he was pretty far behind.\u201d Jessica also testified that Z was experiencing difficulty in math, and had been recommended for extra tutoring \u201cto prepare [him] for 6th grade.\u201d Jessica testified that Z would forget homework tasks and assignments, despite the use of a planner. There was substantial credible evidence to support the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>District Court\u2019s finding that \u201c[Z] was experiencing difficulty adjusting, as evidenced by his educational performance in the classroom.\u201d <em>See Guffin, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">\n<em>b. It was not in Z\u2019s best interest when Jessica removed him without warning from Hawthorne Elementary School.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">\u00b624 F oil owing a detailed discussion of the November 18,2014 incident where Jessica removed Z from Hawthorne School and enrolled him in Wolf Creek School several days later, the court found: \u201cAlthough Jessica is an involved and attentive parent, it was not in the best interest of [Z] to remove him from attending Hawthorne Elementary School without a fixed residence, secure employment, and a school prepared to admit him.\u201d Jessica argues that \u201cItlhere are no facts on the record to support any of these findings.\u201d Again, we disagree. At the hearing, Jessica\u2019s counsel asked her why she didn\u2019t immediately enroll Z at the Wolf Creek School after removing him from Hawthorne School, but rather first contacted two other elementary schools. She answered, \u201cBecause I was still, you know, I was, kind of, temporarily living at my dad\u2019s house.... As well as I was still hunting for a job.\u201d There was substantial credible evidence before the District Court to support its finding. <em>See Guffin, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">c. <em>Daniel is better equipped to provide a stable environment for Z.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Alv\">\u00b625 Jessica argues the District Court erred \u201cin modifying the [Amended] Plan on the basis that Daniel was better equipped to provide a stable environment for Z.\u201d Choosing which parent will provide the healthiest environment for a child is a difficult decision for a court. \u201cWe have specifically recognized the District Court\u2019s broad discretion when considering the parenting of a child. \u2018Child custody cases often present the court with difficult decisions. We must presume that the court carefully considered the evidence and made the correct decision.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Marriage of Tummarello, </em>2012 MT 18, \u00b6 34, 363 Mont. 387, 270 P.3d 28 (citing <em>Hilliard v. Smith (In re Parenting of N.S.), </em>2011 MT 98, \u00b6 18, 360 Mont. 288, 253 P.3d 863). The decision here was no doubt a difficult one for the District Court. However, Jessica fails to account for the evidence offered by the guardian ad litem\u2019s report that when Z was first enrolled at Hawthorne, his teacher reported that he \u201cwas guarded as the new kid in class, but that Danfiel] made several successful efforts to create opportunities for socialization.\u201d The guardian ad litem also noted that she had spent several hours with Z and Daniel, and \u201cobserved a tender, patient relationship.\u201d Jessica\u2019s recent actions causing disruption clearly contrasted with evidence of Daniel\u2019s calming effect. Although Jessica strongly disagrees with the District Court\u2019s findings, the court relied upon this evidence in finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>that Daniel was better equipped at this time to provide a stable environment for Z, and we will defer to its discretion. <em>See Tummarello, </em>\u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"auj-dedup-0\">\u00b626  Jessica also argues generally that the District Court\u2019s August 2015 Final Parenting Plan is not in Z\u2019s best interest. Section 40-4-212(l)(a)-(m), MCA, lists relevant factors for a district court to consider when determining the best interest of a child. The District Court did not address the factors in an itemized fashion, but as we have previously stated, \u201cThe statute lists many factors for the district court to consider in its determination of a child\u2019s best interest, and although it need not make specific findings pertaining to each factor, a district court must consider the guidelines in the statute.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Baer, </em>1998 MT 29, \u00b6 19, 287 Mont. 322, 954 P.2d 1125 (citing <em>In re Marriage of DeWitt, </em>273 Mont. 513, 516, 905 P.2d 1084, 1086 (1995)). The District Court did make detailed findings regarding the difficulty that Z had with adjusting, as evidenced by a struggling academic performance,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the environment and relationship that Daniel fostered while Z was living with him, <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the contrary effect on Z\u2019s best interest when Jessica removed him from Hawthorne and relocated and re-enrolled him in yet another location.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The District Court\u2019s findings of fact were supported by substantial evidence and the court did not abuse its discretion in its analysis of the best interests of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"A4\">\u00b627 <em>3. Did the District Court err in denying Jessica\u2019s request for attorney fees and </em>costs?</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">\u00b628 Jessica\u2019s argument that the District Court erred in denying her attorney fees raises the application of \u00a7 40-4-212(4), MCA, which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-7\">The following are rebuttable presumptions and apply unless contrary to the best interest of the child:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-8\">(a) A parenting plan action brought by a parent within 6 months after a child support action against that parent is vexatious.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-9\">(b) A motion to amend a final parenting plan pursuant to 40-4-219 is vexatious if a parent seeks to amend a final parenting plan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>without making a good faith effort to comply with the provisions of the parenting plan or with dispute resolution provisions of the final parenting plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Jessica further cites to \u00a7 40-4-219(5), MCA, which provides: \u201cAttorney fees and costs must be assessed against a party seeking frivolous or repeated amendment if the court finds that the amendment action is vexatious and constitutes harassment.\u201d Jessica thus argues that because Daniel filed his motion within six months of a child support action, and without offering to mediate as provided in the Amended Plan, the statutory \u201cvexatious presumptions\u201d apply and the District Court was mandated to award her attorney fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">\u00b629 We initially note that it is not clear from the plain language of the statute that the presumption in \u00a7 40-4-212(4)(a), MCA, applies here. That section presumes that \u201ca parenting plan action\u201d brought within six months of a child support action is vexatious. In contrast, the next subsection, \u00a7 40-4-212(4)(b), MCA, presumes that a <em>\u201cmotion to amend </em>a final parenting plan\u201d is vexatious without a good faith effort to comply with the existing parenting plan. If \u00a7 40-4-212(4)(a), MCA, is referring to an original parenting plan, in contrast to the reference in \u00a7 40-4-212(4)(b), MCA, to <em>a motion to amend </em>an existing parenting plan, then Jessica filed the original parenting plan action in 2005, nine years before Daniel\u2019s motion here. However, we need not resolve this issue of statutory interpretation here, for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">\u00b630 Even if the statute is applicable, it makes the presumption rebuttable. The District Court clearly found that Daniel\u2019s motions were not vexatious, but meritorious. The clear implication of the District Court\u2019s order is that Daniel rebutted the vexatious presumptions. The record reveals that Jessica provided slim evidence that a child support action had been initiated within the previous six months, testifying only that she had made a report of Daniel being in arrears. On direct examination, her counsel asked her:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-8\">Q. Okay. Have you ever reported the child support issue to the Child Support Enforcement Division?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-9\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-10\">Q. When did you do that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-11\">A. June of 2014.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-12\">No other evidence of a \u201cchild support action\u201d was introduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-13\">\u00b631 Then, on direct examination, Daniel\u2019s counsel asked him about his motivation for filing his motions to amend the parenting plan:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-14\">Q. And is\u2014was it this incident [at Hawthorne School] that prompted you then to come to the Court and seek a new parenting plan?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>A. I believe that I had filed a motion when things first\u2014when things first arose with the incident at Hawthorne. But I began pursuing a new parenting plan once he had been moved to Wolf Creek.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Daniel also stated, \u201cI really just want some stability for my son. I want him to be able to have a really great social life. I want him to have friends .... And I really want a stable home life that he will be able to focus the way that he needs to.\u201d Daniel\u2019s original pro se motion was filed on November 19, 2014, the day immediately following the November 18, 2014 incident at Hawthorne School, supporting his testimony that his purpose was to provide stability for Z. The District Court ultimately agreed that Daniel had good reason to seek modification of the parenting plan, a conclusion inconsistent with acting vexatiously.</p>\n<p id=\"aps-dedup-0\">\u00b632  The rebuttable presumption provided for in \u00a7 40-4-212(4)(b), MCA, applies to cases involving a \u201cmotion to amend a final parenting plan.\u201d The record likewise rebuts any presumption that Daniel acted vexatiously by failing to act in good faith or to pursue mediation. Jessica\u2019s reckless actions in withdrawing Z from enrollment in Hawthorne School, without notice, and creating uncertainty about Z\u2019s future, justified Daniel\u2019s immediate appeal to the courts for assistance. After his motion was filed, both parties moved to vacate hearing dates so that they could pursue mediation, stating they were pursuing \u201ca mutually agreeable parenting plan.\u201d The record shows that Daniel engaged in multiple efforts to resolve the dispute outside of the courtroom, rebutting any presumption that he had not acted in good faith or had failed to honor the mediation provision of the Amended Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">\u00b633 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b101-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, McKINNON and BAKER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b96-7\"> Jessica argues that \u201cmost of these [school] transfers were agreed to by Daniel,\u201d but her testimony indicates she also initiated changes in Z\u2019s schools without consulting Daniel: \u201cI mean, I\u2019d also enrolled [Z] in schools before that I had informed Daniel this is where I live.
