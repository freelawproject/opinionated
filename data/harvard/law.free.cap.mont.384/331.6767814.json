R. App. P. 14(4). The Petition challenges the constitutionality of Initiative No. 181 (1-181) and seeks an order enjoining the Secretary of State from certifying 1-181 for the November 2016 general election ballot. At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>the Court\u2019s invitation, Respondent Montanans for Research and Cures has submitted its written opposition to the Petition. For the reasons explained below, the Court denies the Petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">\u00b62 1-181 proposes to enact the \u201cMontana Biomedical Research Authority Act\u201d (Act), a law to establish the Montana Biomedical Research Authority (Authority) to review proposals and award grants, funded by state general obligation bonds, to non-profit and for-profit entities for the purpose of promoting the development of therapies and cures for brain diseases and injuries and mental illnesses, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease, brain cancer, dementia, traumatic brain injury, and stroke. The measure would authorize the creation of state bond debt up to $20 million per year for a period of ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">\u00b63 The proposed legislation authorizes the Authority to request issuance of bonds or incurrence of debt, to invest funds not required for immediate use, and to contract in its own name for investment of funds or for any other purposes the Authority considers appropriate to carry out its duties under the Act. 1-181 would authorize creation of state debt up to a cumulative $200 million, establish a biomedical research fund \u201coutside the state treasury,\u201d require the board of examiners to issue and sell bonds of the state upon the Authority\u2019s request, and express to the Legislature the people\u2019s \u201cinten[t] and request\u201d for implementing legislation to appropriate startup costs and to provide for a statutory appropriation of monies in the biomedical research fund.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">\u00b64 The initiative was prepared and sponsored by Montanans for Research and Cures, a Montana registered ballot issue committee. Respondents Randy Gray and Molly Bell are the registered officers of Montanans for Research and Cures. Secretary of State Linda McCulloch determined on July 14, 2016, that sufficient valid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>signatures had been submitted to qualify 1-181 for the November 8, 2016 general election ballot. If passed, the measure would take effect January 1, 2017.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">\u00b65 The 2007 Montana Legislature revised the statutes governing legal challenges to ballot measures, authorizing this Court to exercise original jurisdiction over initiatives and referenda for purposes of reviewing challenges to proposed ballot statements for the measures and to the Attorney General\u2019s legal sufficiency determinations. Section 3-2-202(3)(a), MCA. \u201cThe statute does not confer original jurisdiction for any other purposes.\u201d <em>Hoffman v. State, </em>2014 MT 90, \u00b6 10, 374 Mont. 405, 328 P.3d 604. We confirmed the significance of these amendments in <em>Hoffman </em>when we declined to exercise original jurisdiction to determine the constitutionality of Initiative 171, which would have prohibited expansion of the Montana Medicaid Program and prevented the State of Montana from using funds, personnel, or resources to administer or enforce a federal health care law. <em>Hoffman, </em>\u00b6 2. As we pointed out in <em>Hoffman,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-7\">Prior to the 2007 amendments, the statute provided for this Court\u2019s consideration of a \u201cconstitutional defect in the substance of a proposed ballot issue[.]\u201d Section 3-2-202(3)(a)(ii), MCA (2005). That provision was removed. 2007 Mont. Laws ch. 481, \u00a7 1. ... Further, the Legislature has expressly preserved \u201cthe right to challenge a constitutional defect in the substance of an issue <em>approved by a vote of the </em>people.\u201d Section 13-27-316(6), MCA (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-8\"><em>Hoffman, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">\u00b66 Avoiding reference to these statutes, Petitioners argue that the Court retains authority to entertain a facial constitutional challenge like the one they have brought because the issues are purely ones of law, the case involves a matter of statewide importance, and urgency prevents an adequate remedy through litigation in the district court and the normal appeal process. M. R. App. P. 14(4). Petitioners invoke this Court\u2019s statutory authority to issue an injunction in an original proceeding \u201cwhere the state is a party, the public is interested, or the rights of the public are involved.\u201d Section 3-2-205(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">\u00b67  No doubt, \u201c[i]f a law is repugnant to the Constitution, ... the courts ... \u2018have the power, and it is their duty, so to declare.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019Hoffman, </em>\u00b6 9 (quoting <em>In re Clark\u2019s Estate, </em>105 Mont. 401, 411, 74 P.2d 401, 406 (1937)). But 1-181 is not a \u201claw.\u201d More, \u201c[t]he two recent cases in which ballot measures were stricken from the ballot for substantive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>constitutional infirmity were not original proceedings, but cases that originated in the district courts and were decided by this Court in the ordinary course of appeal.\u201d <em>Hoffman, </em>\u00b6 10 (citing <em>MEA-MFT v. McCulloch, </em>2012 MT 211, 366 Mont. 266, 291 P.3d 1075; <em>Reichert v. State, </em>2012 MT 111, 365 Mont. 92, 278 P.3d 455).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As for the question of urgency, Petitioners filed this action on July 28, 2016, exactly four weeks before the Secretary of State\u2019s deadline for certifying ballot measures to election administrators for printing ballots. Even were there authority to exercise original jurisdiction here, this Court is not eager to rush consideration of constitutional questions of public importance in a hasty pre-election review of an idea that is not, and might never become, a law.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">\u00b68 We express no opinion on the merits of any of Petitioners\u2019 constitutional claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">\u00b69 IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Petitioners\u2019 request that this Court exercise its original jurisdiction to declare 1-181 unconstitutional on its face and enjoin its certification for the November 2016 general election ballot is DENIED without prejudice to the filing of an appropriate civil action should the measure become law.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">\u00b610 The Clerk is directed to provide notice of this Order to all counsel of record and to the Montana Secretary of State.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">DATED this 18th day of August, 2016.</p>\n<judges id=\"b360-8\">JUSTICES WHEAT, COTTER, McKINNON and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b358-8\"> The board of examiners is made up of the governor, the secretary of state, and the attorney general. Section 2-15-1007, MCA. State law empowers the board to issue and sell bonds of the state for purposes authorized by the Legislature, such as coal severance tax bonds (\u00a7 17-5-707, MCA), bonds for the water pollution control and drinking water state revolving fund programs (\u00a7\u00a7 75-5-1121 and 75-6-225, MCA), renewable resource bonds (\u00a7 85-1-617, MCA), and hard-rock mining reclamation bonds (\u00a7 82-4-313, MCA). A statutory appropriation is an appropriation made by permanent law that authorizes spending by a state agency without the need for a biennial legislative appropriation or budget amendment. Section 17-7-502(1), MCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b360-9\"> The other cases Petitioners cite for pre-election review all were decided prior to the 2007 statutory amendments. <em>Burgan &amp; Walker, Inc. v.
