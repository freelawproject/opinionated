After almost seven months, the State refiled the charges in Yellowstone County. The principal dispute in this appeal is whether that time should count in analyzing Butterfly\u2019s speedy trial claim. The District Court ruled that the speedy trial clock did not start running at all until the Yellowstone County charges were filed. Although we count the time somewhat differently, we agree that Butterfly was not denied a speedy trial. We affirm the denial of his motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">\u00b62 On October 10,2013, Butterfly failed to return to the Billings Pre-Release Center as scheduled. He was charged with escape in violation of \u00a7 45-7-306, MCA, the following day in Powell County. Butterfly was arrested in Glacier County and was transferred to Montana State Prison (MSP). Butterfly objected to the Powell County venue, asserting that he should have been charged in Yellowstone County where the alleged offense took place. The State stipulated that venue was proper in Yellowstone County.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">\u00b63 The State then moved to dismiss the escape charge without prejudice based on the parties\u2019 stipulation of proper venue. The Powell County District Court granted the State\u2019s motion and dismissed the case without prejudice on February 11, 2014. Nearly seven months later, on September 8, 2014, the State filed the escape charges in Yellowstone County. Butterfly was transferred from MSP to the Yellowstone County Detention Facility for prosecution. Trial was set for February 9, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">\u00b64 Before trial, Butterfly filed a motion to dismiss the case for lack of speedy trial, arguing that 445 days would have passed by the time he appeared for trial. Butterfly asserted that his right to speedy trial had attached upon his initial appearance on the Powell County charge and continued throughout the charge\u2019s dismissal and its pending refiling in Yellowstone County. Butterfly attributed the excessive delay to the State and claimed that he had suffered prejudice because of it.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqc\">\u00b65 Following an evidentiary hearing, the District Court denied Butterfly\u2019s motion to dismiss. It concluded that Butterfly\u2019s right to a speedy trial had not attached until the charges were re-filed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>Yellowstone County\u2014155 days before trial. The court also analyzed the alleged speedy trial violation under the factors articulated in <em>State v. Ariegwe, </em>2007 MT 204, \u00b6\u00b6 106-112, 338 Mont. 442, 167 P.3d 815, and concluded that there was \u201cinsufficient prejudice\u201d to Butterfly to constitute a speedy trial violation. Butterfly later pleaded guilty to the escape charge, reserving the right to appeal the speedy trial issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">\u00b66 A speedy trial violation presents a question of constitutional law that we review de novo to determine whether the court correctly interpreted and applied the law. <em>State v. Zimmerman, </em>2014 MT 173, \u00b6 11, 375 Mont. 374, 328 P.3d 1132 (citing <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 119). We review the court\u2019s underlying factual findings for clear error. <em>Zimmerman, </em>\u00b611.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">\u00b67 <em>Did the District Court err in denying Butterfly\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">\u00b68 The Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 24, of the Montana Constitution guarantee every accused person the right to a speedy trial. <em>Zimmerman, </em>\u00b6 12. When an accused claims that right has been violated, we consider (1) the length of the delay, (2) the reasons for the delay, (3) the accused\u2019s responses to the delay, and (4) prejudice to the accused as a result of the delay. <em>Zimmerman, </em>\u00b6 12. We balance these factors \u201cwith any other relevant circumstances to determine whether the right to a speedy trial has been violated.\u201d <em>State v. Stops, </em>2013 MT 131, \u00b6 19, 370 Mont. 226, 301 P.3d 811. \u201c[E]ach factor\u2019s significance will vary from case to case,\u201d and \u201ca given factor may outweigh all of the others in one case but be of little consequence in another.\u201d <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">\n<em>(1) Length of the Delay</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b315-11\">\u00b69 We determine initially whether the length of the delay is at least 200 days, \u201cwhich is the trigger date for conducting the four-factor balancing test.\u201d <em>Zimmerman, </em>\u00b6 13. In the present case, the District Court found that Butterfly \u201cfirst became an accused on September 8, 2014, the date [he] was charged with Escape in Yellowstone County.\u201d The interval between the Yellowstone County filing and trial was 155 days. The court concluded, \u201cBecause the interval between the accusation and the trial is less than 200 days it does not trigger any analysis under the four <em>[Ariegwe] </em>factors or the balancing of those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>factors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">\u00b610 Butterfly argues that the District Court erred in determining that his speedy trial right did not attach until he was charged in Yellowstone County. Butterfly contends that \u201cthe length of delay runs from the time of accusation\u201d and \u201cas soon as an individual is subjected to proceedings for an offense.\u201d Butterfly claims that this Court \u201chas not specifically addressed when the speedy trial clock starts running if a charge is filed, dismissed and subsequently re-filed.\u201d He relies on <em>State v. Daniels, </em>248 Mont. 343, 811 P.2d 1286 (1991), in which we concluded that a defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial attached upon a petition charging the defendant for burglary in youth court despite the charge being later transferred to district court. <em>Daniels, </em>248 Mont. at 349, 811 P.2d at 1289. Butterfly argues that, \u201clike <em>Daniels, </em>[he] was subject to criminal proceedings regarding exactly the same charge for exactly the same conduct a full year before the [information] was filed in Yellowstone County.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">\u00b611 The State agrees that the District Court erred in its determination that the speedy trial right attached only when the charges were filed in Yellowstone County. Relying on <em>United States v. MacDonald, </em>456 U.S. 1, 102 S. Ct. 1497 (1982), however, the State argues that \u201cthe speedy trial clock stops running while the charges are dismissed.\u201d The State maintains that the speedy trial clock started running when the charge was filed in Powell County, stopped when the charge was dismissed, and began running again when the charge was re-filed in Yellowstone County. The State contends that <em>Daniels </em>is distinguishable \u201cbecause Daniels was continuously subject to charges in either the youth court or the district court.\u201d Here, in contrast, \u201c[t]here was not a charge pending against Butterfly from the time the charge was dismissed in Powell County until he was charged in Yellowstone County.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">\u00b612 Butterfly attacks the State\u2019s reliance on <em>MacDonald </em>because it dealt with an arrest on a military investigation and \u201cthere is a question whether a military investigation constitutes a formal charging for speedy trial issues.\u201d Butterfly points out the <em>MacDonald </em>Court\u2019s acknowledgment that in <em>United States v. Avalos, </em>541 F.2d 1100 (5th Cir. 1976), the speedy trial clock did not stop between the time charges were dismissed in one district and subsequently re-filed in another district. He contends that the factual scenario in <em>Avalos </em>is more applicable to his case because he was not in the same position he would have been in a pre-filing investigation. Because of the escape charge \u201changing over his head,\u201d Butterfly contends that he \u201cwas not free to go <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>about discharging his other sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">\u00b613 The right to a speedy trial is intended to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-6\">minimize the possibility of lengthy incarceration prior to trial, to reduce the lesser, but nevertheless substantial impairment of liberty imposed on an accused while released on bail, and to shorten the disruption of life caused by arrest and the presence of unresolved criminal charges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-7\"><em>MacDonald, </em>456 U.S. at 8, 102 S. Ct. at 1502.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">\u00b614 In <em>MacDonald, </em>a military physician was accused of committing murder on a military base. The Army charged MacDonald with the murders, but dropped the charges after several months and MacDonald was honorably discharged. <em>MacDonald, </em>456 U.S. at 4-5, 102 S. Ct at 1500. Four years later, the government obtained an indictment in federal district court charging MacDonald with murder. MacDonald claimed that the delay violated his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial and the Fourth Circuit agreed. The United States Supreme Court reversed. <em>MacDonald, </em>456 U.S. at 11, 102 S. Ct. at 1503. The Court concluded that the speedy trial guarantee did not attach to the time period after dismissal of the military charges and before the civil indictment. <em>MacDonald, </em>456 U.S. at 7-8, 102 S. Ct. at 1501-02. The Court reasoned that during that time there was no pretrial incarceration, no impairment of liberty associated with being released on bail, and no \u201cdisruption of life caused by arrest and the presence of unresolved criminal charges.\u2019\u2019 <em>MacDonald, </em>456 U.S. at 8, 102 S. Ct. at 1502. The Court stated, \u201cFollowing dismissal of charges, any restraint on liberty, disruption of employment, strain on financial resources, and exposure to public obloquy, stress and anxiety is no greater than it is upon anyone openly subject to a criminal investigation.\u201d <em>MacDonald, </em>456 U.S. at 9, 102 S. Ct. at 1502.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">\u00b615 As Butterfly points out, the <em>MacDonald </em>Court noted that the Fifth Circuit had \u201creached a seemingly contrary result\u201d in <em>Avalos </em>by counting the time between indictments. <em>MacDonald, </em>456 U.S. at 7 n.7, 102 S. Ct. at 1501 n.7. The Supreme Court noted the \u201cunusual\u201d circumstances in that case, in which \u201cthe Government dismissed charges pending in one district in order to prosecute the defendants on those same charges in another <em>district.\u201d MacDonald, </em>456 U.S. at 7 n.7, 102 S. Ct. at 1501 n.7. The <em>Avalos </em>court concluded that the defendants became \u201caccused persons\u201d when the government issued the original warrants for their arrest. <em>Avalos, </em>541 F.2d at 1108. The Fifth Circuit stated, \u201cThat [one defendant] was never incarcerated and [the other defendant] was imprisoned for a relatively short period does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>expunge the public accusation.\u201d <em>Avalos, </em>541 F.2d at 1108. The court concluded that because the defendants\u2019 initial arrest \u201cformledl the basis of the conviction under review,\u201d the right to a speedy trial attached on the date of the initial arrests. <em>Avalos, </em>541 F.2d at 1109.</p>\n<p id=\"A_zz\">\u00b616 Although not cited by either party, this Court has addressed when the speedy trial clock starts running if a charge is filed, dismissed, and subsequently re-filed. Within nine months of the <em>MacDonald </em>decision, this Court decided <em>State v. Bailey, </em>201 Mont. 473, 655 P.2d 494 (1982). Bailey was arrested and charged with the felony offense of attempted sale of dangerous drugs. The trial court dismissed the charges because the State had not filed the information within thirty days of the defendant\u2019s waiver of a preliminary hearing. <em>Bailey, </em>201 Mont. at 475, 655 P.2d at 495. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-11-203, MCA. After two unsuccessful attempts, the State later filed a new information charging Bailey with the same offense. <em>Bailey, </em>201 Mont. at 475, 655 P.2d at 496. We held that the time between dismissal of the first information and filing of the second should be counted in the speedy trial calculation. <em>Bailey, </em>201 Mont. at 477-78, 655 P.2d at 497. \u201cBeing an accused is all that is required for the right to speedy trial to attach.\u201d <em>Bailey, </em>201 Mont. at 477, 655 P.2d at 497 (citing <em>State v. Larson, </em>191 Mont. 257, 261, 623 P.2d 954, 957 (1981)). We distinguished <em>MacDonald. </em>Unlike MacDonald, we reasoned, \u201cDespite no formal charges pending, it is clear from the record [Bailey] is an accused, because ... he is in a similar position to an arrested person due to the State\u2019s continued efforts to charge him during the interim between the first and second information.\u201d <em>Bailey, </em>201 Mont. at 478, 655 P.2d at 497.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">\u00b617 The Ninth Circuit arrived at a very similar conclusion in <em>United States v. Loud Hawk, </em>741 F.2d 1184 (9th Cir. 1984) (hereafter <em>Loud Hawk I), rev\u2019d by United States v. Loud Hawk, </em>474 U.S. 302, 106 S. Ct. 648 (1986) (hereafter <em>Loud Hawk II). </em>The <em>Loud Hawk </em>trial court dismissed all charges against the defendants on speedy trial grounds because of a seven-and-one-half year delay in bringing them to trial after the government\u2019s interlocutory appeals of orders dismissing the charges. <em>Loud Hawk I, </em>741 F.2d at 1187-88. The Ninth Circuit affirmed. <em>Loud Hawk I, </em>741 F.2d at 1194. The court concluded that <em>MacDonald </em>was distinguishable. It counted the time period between indictments in the speedy trial analysis because \u201cthe government\u2019s appeals after dismissal of the indictment bore the indicia and imposed the disabilities of continued, formal public accusation ... [so that] the defendants remained \u2018accused\u2019 during the periods when the government was appealing the dismissals of their indictment.\u201d <em>Loud </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number><em>Hawk I, </em>741 F.2d at 1190.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">\u00b618 On certiorari, the Supreme Court reversed. The Court concluded that the speedy trial clause was inapplicable to the time during which the indictment was dismissed and the defendants were not subject to \u201cactual restraints\u201d on their liberty. <em>Loud Hawk II, </em>474 U.S. at 312, 106 S. Ct. at 654.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-6\">With no charges outstanding, personal liberty is certainly not impaired to the same degree as it is after arrest while charges are pending. After the charges against him have been dismissed, a citizen suffers no restraints on his liberty and is no longer the subject of public accusation: his situation does not compare with that of a defendant who has been arrested and held to answer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ajn-dedup-0\"><em>Loud Hawk II, </em>474 U.S. at 311, 106 S. Ct. at 654 (citing <em>MacDonald, </em>456 U.S. at 9, 102 S. Ct. at 1502) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court went on to address the defendants\u2019 argument that the speedy trial guarantee should apply to the interim period \u201cbecause the Government\u2019s desire to prosecute them was a matter of public record.\u201d The Court stated, \u201cPublic suspicion ... is not sufficient to justify the delay in favor of a defendant\u2019s speedy trial claim. We find that after the District Court dismissed the indictment against respondents and after respondents were freed without restraint, they were \u2018in the same position as any other subject of a criminal investigation.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019Loud Hawk II, </em>474 U.S. at 311, 106 S. Ct. at 654 (quoting <em>MacDonald, </em>456 U.S. at 8-9, 102 S. Ct. at 1502).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">\u00b619 <em>Loud Hawk II </em>compels us to revisit our decision in <em>Bailey. </em>Our analysis distinguishing <em>MacDonald </em>in <em>Bailey </em>is, for all intents and purposes, identical to the Ninth Circuit\u2019s analysis distinguishing <em>MacDonald </em>in <em>Loud Hawk I. </em>We said that a person who is subject to \u201cpublic accusation\u201d absent charge or actual restraint is afforded speedy trial protection. <em>Bailey, </em>201 Mont. at 477-78, 655 P.2d at 496-97. <em>Loud Hawk II </em>expressly rejected the Ninth Circuit\u2019s identical conclusion in <em>Loud Hawk I. Loud Hawk II, </em>474 U.S. at 312, 317, 106 S. Ct. at 654, 657.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">\u00b620 <em>MacDonald </em>held that \u201c[o]nce charges are dismissed,\u201d as the State did here, \u201cthe speedy trial guarantee is no longer applicable.\u201d <em>MacDonald, </em>456 U.S. at 8, 102 S. Ct. at 1502. <em>Loud Hawk II </em>reaffirmed that, \u201cwhen no indictment is outstanding, only the <em>\u2018actual </em>restraints imposed by arrest and holding to answer a criminal charge ... engage the particular provisions of the speedy trial provision of the Sixth Amendment.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019 Loud Hawk II, </em>474 U.S. at 310-11, 106 S. Ct. at 653-54 (quoting <em>United States v. Marion, </em>404 U.S. 307, 320, 92 S. Ct. 455, 463 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>(1971), and citing <em>MacDonald, </em>456 U.S. at 9, 102 S. Ct. at 1502) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">\u00b621 In reversing the Ninth Circuit, <em>Loud Hawk II </em>held that a public accusation absent formal charges or actual restraint does not engage protection of the speedy trial clause. <em>Loud Hawk II, </em>474 U.S. at 310-11, 106 S. Ct. at 654. \u201cThe holding in <em>Loud Hawk [II] </em>is based on drawing a distinguishing line between a citizen against whom charges have been dismissed and one \u2018who has been arrested and held to answer.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Hayden, </em>860 F.2d 1483, 1486 (9th Cir. 1988) (quoting <em>Loud Hawk II, </em>474 U.S. at 311, 106 S. Ct. at 654). Butterfly\u2019s assertion that he remained \u201can accused\u201d after dismissal of the initial charges is directly contrary to <em>Loud Hawk II. </em>After dismissal, Butterfly was \u201cin the same position as any other subject of a criminal investigation.\u201d <em>MacDonald, </em>456 U.S. at 8-9, 102 S. Ct. at 1502. That it was well-known that the State would eventually re-file charges against Butterfly \u201cis not legally significant\u201d as applied to the speedy trial clause. <em>Hayden, </em>860 F.2d at 1486 n.3 (citing <em>Loud Hawk II, </em>474 U.S. at 311, 106 S. Ct at 654). True, Butterfly was incarcerated in MSP during the time between the dismissal and re-filing. But his incarceration was the result of a prior and wholly separate conviction\u2014not of the escape charge. And, while Butterfly contends that he was adversely affected by the \u201cEscape charge hanging over his head,\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-6\">[t]he Speedy Trial Clause does not purport to protect a defendant from all effects flowing from a delay before trial. The Clause does not, for example, limit the length of a pre-indictment criminal investigation even though the \u201cthe [suspect\u2019s] knowledge of an ongoing criminal investigation will cause stress, discomfort, and perhaps a certain disruption in normal life.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-7\"><em>Loud Hawk II, </em>474 U.S. at 311-12, 106 S. Ct. at 654 (quoting <em>MacDonald, </em>456 U.S. at 9, 102 S. Ct. at 1502).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">\u00b622 The Supreme Court\u2019s unequivocal holding in <em>Loud Hawk II </em>compels us to conclude that <em>Bailey </em>has been abrogated. <em>Bailey\u2019s </em>holding that a speedy trial right attaches during the time period between dismissal and re-filing of subsequent charges when the accused is under no official restraint is overruled. Delay while no charges are pending generally is to be measured by due process standards, similar to pre-indictment delay. <em>MacDonald, </em>456 U.S. at 8, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>102 S. Ct. at 1502.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AW5\">\u00b623  We hold that the time period from the dismissal of the charge initially filed against Butterfly in Powell County to the filing of the charge in Yellowstone County is not counted for purposes of determining the length of the delay. We acknowledge that the <em>MacDonald </em>Court distinguished <em>Avalos </em>because of the \u201cunusual\u201d circumstances in that case. We agree with the First Circuit, however, that \u201c[t]hat distinction ... flies in the face of the opinion itself: <em>MacDonald </em>holds that the speedy trial right simply does not attach to one not formally accused.\u201d <em>United States v. Colombo, </em>852 F.2d 19, 24 (1st Cir. 1988). \u201cMacDonald was as certain of his continuing and public prosecution as is an individual, such as [Butterfly], who believefd] he [would] be indicted in a different district.\u201d <em>Colombo, </em>852 F.2d at 24 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">\u00b624 Of note, we have held that the re-filing of charges between justice court and district court restarts the speedy trial clock. In <em>State v. Topp, </em>2003 MT 209, 317 Mont. 59, 75 P.3d 330, Topp was charged with two misdemeanor offenses in justice court. Those charges were dismissed because the State intended to file charges in district court. <em>Topp, </em>\u00b6 3. A week later, the State charged Topp with a felony, along with the two previously-dismissed misdemeanor charges, in district court. On appeal, Topp argued that the district court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the misdemeanor charges because his speedy trial right had been violated. <em>Topp, </em>\u00b6 10. We concluded that Topp\u2019s argument was \u201ctotally without merit\u201d because \u201c[n]o charges were pending\u201d against him after the justice court charges were dismissed and before the charges were re-filed in district court, and \u201cconsequently, no speedy trial \u2018clock\u2019 was running.\u201d <em>Topp, </em>\u00b6 10. We applied the same principles in <em>State v. Case, </em>2013 MT 192, 371 Mont. 58, 305 P.3d 812. In <em>Case, </em>the facts presented \u201cthe other side of the <em>Topp </em>coin\u2014the charges against Case were dismissed by the District Court and re-filed in Justice Court.\u201d <em>Case, </em>\u00b6 13. \u201cWhen the District Court dismissed Case\u2019s felony [partner or family member assault] charge, there were no charges pending against Case and thus, no speedy trial clock was running.\u201d <em>Case, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>\u00b625 Notwithstanding our decisions in <em>Topp </em>and <em>Case, </em>the State concedes that the speedy trial clock began running when charges first were filed in Powell County. Consistent with <em>MacDonald, </em>we agree. <em>MacDonald, </em>456 U.S. at 7, 102 S. Ct. at 1501. The clock ran until the Powell County charge was dismissed, and started again when the State filed charges in Yellowstone County. The total length of the delay was 277 days\u2014123 days for the time between the first charge and dismissal, plus 154 days for the time between the second charge and trial. The District Court therefore erred in calculating the length of the delay.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">\u00b626 A delay of 277 days is sufficient to trigger further analysis under the four <em>Ariegwe </em>factors. <em>Zimmerman, </em>\u00b6 13. \u201c[T]he further the delay stretches beyond the trigger date, the stronger the presumption is under Factor Four that the accused has been prejudiced by the delay, and the heavier the State\u2019s burden is under Factor Two to provide valid justifications for the delay.\u201d <em>Zimmerman, </em>\u00b6 14 (citing <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 49, 61). Based on our case law, we conclude that a 77-day delay beyond the 200-day trigger date does not impose on the State a heavy burden to justify the delay. <em>See Zimmerman, </em>\u00b6 14 (concluding that an 89-day delay beyond the trigger date is \u201cnot particularly long and, therefore ... the State\u2019s burdens under Factors Two and Four are relatively low\u201d); <em>State v. Charlie, </em>2010 MT 195, \u00b6 50, 357 Mont. 355, 239 P.3d 934 (holding that a 70-day delay beyond the trigger date was not long enough to require the State to \u201cshow a particularly compelling justification for the delay\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">\n<em>(2) Reasons for the Delay</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AUk\">\u00b627 Under Factor Two, a court is required to \u201cidentify each period of delay in bringing the accused to trial, attribute each period of delay to either the State or the defendant, and then assign appropriate weight to each period of delay based on specific cause and culpability.\u201d <em>Charlie, </em>\u00b6 51 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Institutional delay, \u201ccaused by circumstances largely beyond the control of the prosecutor and the accused, such as overcrowded court dockets!,] is attributable to the State, but weighs less heavily against it than delay caused by bad faith, negligence or lack of diligence.\u201d <em>State v. Couture, </em>2010 MT 201, \u00b6 72, 357 Mont. 398, 240 P.3d 987 (citing Ariegwe, \u00b6 68; <em>State v. Billman, </em>2008 MT 326, \u00b6 20, 346 Mont. 118, 194 P.3d 58). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>Because Butterfly\u2019s speedy trial right did not attach during the interval between dismissal and re-filing of the charges, we do not identify it as a \u201cperiod of delay\u201d and will not consider under this factor the State\u2019s alleged lack of diligence in re-filing the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">\u00b628 Despite finding less than 200 days of delay, the District Court considered the remaining factors \u201cfor purposes of argument.\u201d The District Court concluded that the delay between Butterfly\u2019s arrest and his assertion of improper venue was institutional delay. The court attributed to Butterfly the delay between the filing of Butterfly\u2019s motion and the court\u2019s decision to dismiss the case, \u201cas it was triggered by his motion to change venue.\u201d The court concluded that the final delay\u2014the time between the charge in Yellowstone County and the day of trial\u2014was institutional delay. The court specifically found that none of those delays were bad faith delays by the State, but were \u201cdue to either a lack of diligence by Powell County or simple institutional delay as a result of overcrowded court dockets.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">\u00b629 Butterfly argues that the court erred in attributing part of the pre-dismissal delay to him on the basis that he objected to venue. Butterfly contends, \u201cThat the State filed the charges in the wrong venue should not be attributed to Butterfly in any circumstance.\u201d Although he stipulated to Yellowstone County as the proper venue, Butterfly emphasizes that it was the State that filed the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">\u00b630 Taking the position that \u201c[a]ll of the delay in this case was institutional,\u201d the State argues that \u201csome weight should be given to Butterfly because his objection to venue caused a significant amount of delay.\u201d According to the State, had Butterfly not objected to venue in Powell County, he likely \u201ccould have been brought to trial much sooner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">\u00b631 If an offender serving a state prison sentence or commitment to the Department of Corrections is charged with escape, the law expressly allows the State to file the charge in any county in the state, \u201cwithout objection from the person charged.\u201d Section 46-3-110(2), MCA. Because Butterfly had been committed to the Department at the time he walked away from the Billings Pre-Release Center, the State properly charged the case in Powell County. Butterfly, in turn, was within his right under the statute to object to the Powell County venue. Given that both parties followed a procedure expressly contemplated by \u00a7 46-3-110(2), MCA, we conclude that the objection to venue and re-filing of escape charges do not by themselves weigh against either party, but are \u201cinherent in the criminal justice system.\u201d <em>Zimmerman, </em>\u00b6 19. The delay in this case was institutional. As such, it is attributable to the State, \u201cbut weighs less heavily against it than delay caused by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>bad faith, negligence or lack of diligence.\u201d <em>Couture, </em>\u00b6 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">\n<em>(3) The Accused\u2019s Responses to the Delay</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">\u00b632 Under Factor Three, we evaluate the accused\u2019s response to the delay, such as his or her acquiescence in or objection to pretrial delay. <em>Couture, </em>\u00b6 50. \u201c[T]he issue is not simply the number of times the accused acquiesced or objected!;] [rjather the focus is on the surrounding circumstances.\u201d <em>Zimmerman, </em>\u00b6 22. We consider the \u201ctotality of the accused\u2019s responses\u201d to ascertain whether the accused \u201cactually wanted\u201d a speedy trial. <em>Zimmerman, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">\u00b633 The District Court concluded that Butterfly had not waived his constitutional right to a speedy trial at any time during the proceedings. It noted that his objection to venue was \u201chis right\u201d and \u201cin accordance with the Montana statute.\u201d The court concluded further that Butterfly had asserted his speedy trial right by filing his motion to dismiss on December 18, 2014. The record supports the District Court\u2019s conclusion, and we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">\n<em>(4) Prejudice to the Accused</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">\u00b634 Under Factor Four, we consider whether the delay prejudiced the accused \u201cin light of the interests that the speedy trial right was designed to protect: (i) preventing oppressive pretrial incarceration, (ii) minimizing anxiety and concern caused by unresolved criminal charges, and (iii) limiting the possibility that the accused\u2019s ability to present an effective defense will be impaired.\u201d <em>Zimmerman, </em>\u00b6 28. Whether pretrial incarceration is oppressive depends on the \u201cparticular circumstances,\u201d including the duration and conditions of the incarceration. <em>Couture, </em>\u00b6 56. In assessing an accused\u2019s anxiety and concern, this Court focuses on \u201cthe ways in which the presence of unresolved charges disrupted the accused\u2019s life,\u201d keeping in mind that \u201c[a] certain amount of anxiety and concern is inherent in being accused of a crime.\u201d <em>Couture, </em>\u00b6 64. The third interest evaluates issues of evidence, witness reliability, and the accused\u2019s ability to present an effective defense. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 98. \u201c[I]n the absence of affirmative proof that the delay has impaired the accused\u2019s ability to present an effective defense, impairment must be assessed based on other factors in the analysis.\u201d <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">\u00b635 The District Court concluded that Butterfly\u2019s pretrial incarceration was not oppressive. The court explained that when Butterfly walked away from the pre-release center, he violated the rules and conditions of his placement there. According to the court, Butterfly\u2019s transfer to MSP following his arrest was \u201ca result of the administrative findings that he had violated the rules and conditions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>of his transfer to the Pre-Release Center.\u201d The court observed that, during the pretrial delay, Butterfly \u201cwas not in a position to have employment outside of the prison setting [and] was only able to provide child support with his earnings within [MSP].\u201d It reasoned, however, that Butterfly was in MSP as a result of felonies for which he had been convicted that were unrelated to the escape charge. \u201cFor the same reasons,\u201d it concluded, Butterfly\u2019s anxiety and concern were caused \u201cnot by the presence of unresolved criminal charges but by the fact that he continues to be incarcerated at [MSP] for underlying felonies.\u201d The court determined also that Butterfly\u2019s ability to present an effective defense was not impaired by the delay because the allegations in the affidavit and motion for leave to file information are \u201cclear and concise\u201d; Butterfly\u2019s \u201ccircumstances and status\u201d as of the date of his arrest \u201care clear\u201d; and whether he returned to the pre-release center as required \u201cis clear.\u201d In balancing the factors, the court found that there was \u201cinsufficient prejudice\u201d to Butterfly under the \u201ctotality of the circumstances.\u201d It concluded that his constitutional right to a speedy trial was not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">\u00b636 Butterfly maintains that he was prejudiced because he was incarcerated continuously from the time he was arrested to the time he was sentenced. He argues that he was no longer able to work\u2014as he had in pre-release\u2014towards paying \u201cchild support, fines, etc.\u201d He also claims that he \u201cwas saddled with paying the costs of assigned counsel and other court surcharges, [which] could have been avoided\u201d had the State filed the charge in Yellowstone County in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">\u00b637 The State argues that because Butterfly\u2019s pretrial incarceration was not caused by the escape charges, \u201cit does not count as prejudice in the speedy trial analysis.\u201d The State argues also that Butterfly \u201cdid not demonstrate that he had anxiety and concern about the escape charge\u201d because, even without that charge, he \u201cwould have been incarcerated and unable to work outside of the prison.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">\u00b638 We agree that Butterfly\u2019s pretrial incarceration was not oppressive. The District Court correctly concluded that Butterfly\u2019s commitment to the Department of Corrections was the result of previous felonies unrelated to the escape charge. When Butterfly failed to return to the pre-release center as required, he violated its rules and conditions. Butterfly\u2019s transfer to MSP was the result of violating the pre-release center\u2019s rules and conditions, not because of the charge itself. Moreover, Butterfly acknowledges that the conditions he experienced while incarcerated at MSP and the Yellowstone County Detention Facility were those \u201cinherent in jail and prison life.\u201d While Butterfly may have experienced increased anxiety and concern during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>the time between dismissal and re-filing of the escape charge, we reiterate that his right to a speedy trial had not attached at that time, and we do not consider it in our speedy trial analysis. Butterfly has not shown that any concern or anxiety he experienced during the time the speedy trial clock was running was anything more than the \u201ccertain amount of anxiety and concern inherent in being accused of a crime.\u201d <em>Zimmerman, </em>\u00b6 32. Finally, Butterfly does not argue that the delay inhibited his ability to present an effective defense. \u201cThe impairment of the accused\u2019s defense from a speedy trial violation constitutes the most important factor in our prejudice analysis.\u201d <em>State v. Steigelman, </em>2013 MT 153, \u00b6 29, 370 Mont. 352, 302 P.3d 396 (citing <em>Doggett v. United States, </em>505 U.S. 647, 654, 112 S. Ct. 2686, 2692 (1992)). On this record, and considering the lack of evidence of impairment in light of all other factors, <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 100, we conclude that Butterfly was not prejudiced by the delay.</p>\n<p id=\"A4H\">\u00b639  We hold that the delay in this case does not establish a constitutional speedy trial violation. Our conclusion comes after balancing the four factors in the analysis. Although the institutional delay under Factor One weighs against the State, the extent to which the delay went beyond the trigger date in Factor Two weighs in favor of the State. While our analysis under Factor Three establishes that Butterfly appropriately asserted his speedy trial right, our analysis under Factor Four decisively confirms that Butterfly did not suffer prejudice sufficient to constitute a violation of that right.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">\u00b640 We differ with the District Court in calculating the length of the delay. We conclude nonetheless that the District Court properly denied Butterfly\u2019s motion to dismiss for violation of his right to a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"A9MP\">\u00b641 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b326-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b321-7\"> Although the Supreme Court acknowledged that \u201cdelays in bringing the case to trial caused by the Government\u2019s interlocutory appeal [brought in bad faith or for dilatory purpose] may be weighed in determining whether a defendant has suffered a violation of his rights to a speedy trial,\u201d <em>Loud Hawk II, </em>474 U.S. at 316, 106 S.
