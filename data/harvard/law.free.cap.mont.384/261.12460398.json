Kurth died at the age of 82 on January 26, 2000, in a Missoula, Montana, hospital. Prior to his death, Kurth had resided with his niece and her husband, Sinda and Marty Puryer, in Kalispell for several years. On February 19,1998, Marty hand wrote a document entitled \u201cInstructions and Last Will and Testament of Paul L. Kurth.\u201d Marty claims Kurth dictated the contents of this document to him and then signed it in his presence, as well as in the presence of a long term caregiver. The Puryers did not petition to probate this will until March 8, 2013. The will was challenged by Bruce Barstis, Kurth\u2019s nephew. Following lengthy discovery and litigation, the Eleventh Judicial District Court, Flathead County, ruled that Kurth had died intestate. Puryers appeal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b288-11\">\u00b62 Paul Kurth never married nor had children. He was survived by three of his five siblings and nine nieces and nephews. For the last several years of his life, he lived with niece Sinda Puryer and her husband, Marty. According to Marty, approximately two years before Kurth\u2019s death, Kurth instructed him to take down his testamentary instructions leaving everything he owned to Sinda and Marty. Marty and Sinda assert that Kurth signed the handwritten holographic statement and intended it to be his last will and testament.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-12\">\u00b63 During many of the years Kurth lived with Sinda and Marty, Sinda\u2019s parents, Mike and Mary Mattovich (Mary was Kurth\u2019s sister) also lived with them. Mary died in October 1997 and Mike died in June 1998. Mike left Kurth $8,214, distributable after Kurth\u2019s death. Following Kurth\u2019s death in 2000, Sinda hired an attorney in 2001 to administer Kurth\u2019s estate. The attorney collected the funds from the Mattovich estate and distributed them to Kurth\u2019s estate. The attorney collected the personal assets of Kurth\u2019s estate for distribution to the Puryers, pursuant to an affidavit signed by Sinda in which she attested that she was Kurth\u2019s heir under the terms of the holographic will and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>had received these distributions. Thereafter, the Puryers did not probate Kurth\u2019s will. Subsequently, Sinda and her sister and co-representative of their father\u2019s estate signed statements closing the Mattovich Estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">\u00b64 In addition to the personal property Kurth held upon his death, he also held a real property interest in mineral rights in eastern Montana. The attorney hired by Sinda did not pursue probate or effect the transfer of these real property interests to Puryers.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">\u00b65 In February 2013, an oil and gas company wanting to lease minerals in Roosevelt and Sheridan Counties contacted Bruce Barstis, one of Kurth\u2019s nephews. Barstis retained an attorney and notified all of Kurth\u2019s heirs that Kurth\u2019s estate needed to be probated to effect transfer of Kurth\u2019s real property interests. Barstis offered to act as the estate\u2019s personal representative. In response to the notice, on March 8, 2013, Marty filed a Petition for Formal Probate of Will, and Appointment of Personal Representative. Claiming that under \u00a7 72-3-122(1)(e), MCA, the time for probating the will had not expired, Marty attached Kurth\u2019s holographic will to the Petition and asserted that the requested probate was \u201cto establish an instrument to direct or control the ownership of property distributable after decedent\u2019s death, pursuant to the decedent\u2019s Will.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">\u00b66 Barstis challenged the alleged will on multiple grounds, including that the time for probate had passed and no exceptions to the time limitations applied. Discovery and litigation ensued and in April 2015, Barstis moved for partial summary judgment expressly arguing that Marty had waited too long to seek probate of the alleged will and the exceptions set forth in \u00a7 72-3-122(l)(d) and (e), MCA, did not apply. Barstis therefore maintained that as a matter of law, Kurth died intestate.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">\u00b67 On November 24, 2015, the District Court granted Barstis\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment. The court\u2019s dispositive ruling in this case determined that \u00a7 72-3-122(1), MCA, barred probate of Kurth\u2019s alleged will. Section 72-3-122(1), MCA, requires that probate of a will, with some exceptions, must take place within 3 years after the decedent\u2019s death. The court analyzed the two potentially applicable exceptions set forth in \u00a7 72-3-122(1)(d) and (e), MCA, and ruled that neither exception applied. Having so concluded, the District Court held that Kurth died intestate and the Estate must proceed under Montana\u2019s intestacy statutes. The District Court awarded costs to Barstis.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">\u00b68 Puryers appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">\u00b69 A restatement of the dispositive issues on appeal is:</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">\u00b610 Did the District Court err in granting Bruce Barstis\u2019s motion for summary judgment on intestacy?</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">\u00b611 Did the District Court err by awarding litigation costs to Barstis following summary judgment on intestacy?</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">\u00b612 The interpretation of a statute is a question of law which we review de novo for correctness. <em>Kulko v.

If legal authority exists, we review a district court\u2019s order granting or denying attorney fees for abuse of discretion. <em>Mont. Immigrant Justice Alliance v. Bullock, </em>2016 MT 104, \u00b6 15, 383 Mont. 318, 371 P.3d 430.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-13\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b290-14\">\u00b616 <em>Did the District Court err in granting Bruce Barstis\u2019s motion for summary judgment on intestacy </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"b290-15\">\u00b617 Puryers present multiple arguments to support their claim that Kurth\u2019s will is legitimate, valid, and capable of being probated thirteen years after Kurth\u2019s death. We address their claim that the statutory exceptions to the 3-year time bar set forth in \u00a7 72-3-122(1), MCA, are applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-16\">\u00b618 Section 72-3-122(1)(d) and (e), MCA, provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-17\">(1) No informal probate or appointment proceeding or formal testacy or appointment proceeding ... may be commenced more than 3 years after the decedent\u2019s death, except:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAVV\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>\n<img class=\"blockquote\" height=\"36\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAOUAAAAkAQAAAABeBsCqAAAAVUlEQVR4nGP8z4Ab/GTCI8nAMCo7KjtQsn8boNwnMPEJEOr///////+w/w8BB6H0f/b//////0GMySwOUK4STLwDyeR/MAO/wxj3//////8H4wjLRwC1mj+k5uSrVQAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\" width=\"229\"/>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-4\">(d) an informal appointment or a formal testacy or appointment proceeding may be commenced after the time period if no proceedings concerning the succession or estate administration have occurred within the 3-year period after the decedent\u2019s death, but the personal representative has no right to possess estate assets provided in 72-3-606 beyond that necessary to confirm title to the property in the successors to the estate, and claims other than expenses of administration may not be presented against the estate; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-5\">(e) a formal testacy proceeding may be commenced at any time after 3 years from the decedent\u2019s death for the purpose of establishing an instrument to direct or control the ownership of property passing or distributable after the decedent\u2019s death from one other than the decedent when the property is to be appointed by the terms of the decedent\u2019s will or is to pass or be distributed as a part of the decedent\u2019s estate or its transfer is otherwise to be controlled by the terms of the decedent\u2019s will.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">\u00b619 In Marty\u2019s petition to probate Kurth\u2019s will filed in March 2013, he claimed that probate was not time-barred because \u00a7 72-3-122(l)(e), MCA, applied and extended the time allowed for seeking probate. Significantly, Marty did not refer to or rely upon \u00a7 72-3-122(l)(d), MCA. Barstis objected to the proposed probate and to the appointment of Marty as personal representative. The District Court set a December 25,2013 deadline for amending pleadings or joining additional parties.</p>\n<p id=\"A8k\">\u00b620 On February 3, 2014, Barstis moved to amend his objection. Claiming newly discovered evidence revealed in Marty\u2019s January 16, 2014 deposition, Barstis sought to add Sinda as a party and to present new counterclaims against both Marty and Sinda. On April 29, 2014, the District Court granted Barstis\u2019s motion to amend over Puryers\u2019 objection. Following further proceedings, Puryers filed their answer to Barstis\u2019s counterclaims on January 12, 2015, asserting for the first time that the time for formal probate had not expired under the provisions of \u00a7 72-3-122(l)(d), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">\u00b621 In April 2015, Puryers moved for leave to amend their petition to add \u00a7 72-3-122(1)(d), MCA, as a defense. Shortly thereafter, Barstis moved for partial summary judgment arguing Kurth had died intestate. On June 5, 2015, the District Court denied Puryers\u2019 motion to amend their petition noting that Puryers were seeking to change the legal theory upon which their original petition\u2014filed two years earlier\u2014had been based. The court reasoned that the motion was untimely under the deadlines set in the scheduling order and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>Puryers failed to show good cause justifying the amendment. The District Court noted that the couple did not claim newly discovered evidence nor did they assert that the defense available under \u00a7 72-3-122(1)(d), MCA, was neither known nor available to them at the time Marty filed his original petition in March 2013 or prior to the December 25, 2013 deadline for amending pleadings. The court disagreed with the Puryers\u2019 assertion that their original petition was based upon \u00a7 72-3-122(l)(d), MCA, by pointing out several record-based examples that refuted such a claim. Lastly, the District Court ruled that Barstis would be unduly prejudiced by the Puryers\u2019 proposed amendment. Even though the District Court denied Puryers\u2019 motion to amend the probate petition, it nonetheless addressed the applicability of \u00a7 72-3-122(l)(d), MCA, to the case at bar and determined that the statute did not provide the Puryers with an exception to the 3-year filing deadline. Thereafter, it granted Barstis\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">\u00b622 Puryers argue on appeal that the District Court erred in refusing to allow them to amend their petition, given that the court had allowed Barstis to amend his objection to their petition for probate. They maintain that had the court ruled correctly on these motions, genuine issues of fact would have precluded summary judgment in favor of Barstis.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">\u00b623 It is well established that a \u201ccourt should freely give leave [to amend] when justice so requires.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). \u201cAlthough district courts have discretion in granting leave to amend, we have held that Rule 15(a) \u2018favors allowing amendments.\u2019 \u201d <em>Seamster, </em>\u00b6 14. Further, \u201c[w]e have articulated circumstances justifying a court\u2019s denial of a motion to amend. Such situations include when the denial is \u2018for an apparent reason such as undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by allowance of the amendment, futility of the amendment, etc.\u2019 \u201d <em>Seamster, </em>\u00b6 14 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">\u00b624 In reviewing Barstis\u2019s motion for leave to amend, the District Court analyzed the foregoing factors and found no evidence of bad faith, intentional delay, improper purpose, or prejudice. Given that the newly discovered evidence upon which Barstis based his motion to amend had come to light in Marty\u2019s deposition taken two weeks earlier, the court concluded the motion to amend was timely and reasonable. Addressing futility, the District Court stated it was \u201csatisfied that it cannot be said that Mr. Barstis will be unable to develop facts entitling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>him to the relief sought.\u201d We conclude the court did not abuse its discretion in granting Barstis\u2019s motion to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">\u00b625 Conversely, in denying the Puryers\u2019 motion to amend, the District Court set forth facts indicative of both undue delay and undue prejudice, as well as bad faith or a dilatory motive. The court found that Puryers sought to amend their petition in order to assert a defense that was available at the time Marty filed his original petition. The court noted that Marty could have asserted the applicability of \u00a7 72-3-122(1)(d), MCA, at any time between March 8, 2013, and the scheduling order deadline for pleading amendments of December 25, 2013, but failed to do so. The court noted that Puryers\u2019 petition for probate of the Kurth will was not filed until thirteen years after his death, and yet more than two years later, Puryers continued to allege inconsistent facts and shift theories in an effort to secure title to the property at issue. Finally, it concluded that because Barstis had conducted discovery for over two years premised upon \u00a7 72-3-122(1)(e), MCA, he would be unduly prejudiced by such a late change in legal theories. We find the District Court\u2019s analysis reasonable, and conclude it did not abuse its discretion in denying Puryers\u2019 motion to amend their petition. Therefore, we decline to consider \u00a7 72-3-122(1)(d), MCA, as grounds for tolling the 3-year statute of limitations period for the probate of the Kurth will.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">\u00b626 Puryers also argue on appeal that the District Court erred in declining to apply the exception contained in \u00a7 72-3-122(1)(e), MCA, so as to allow late probate of the will. They argued in the District Court that this exception was available to them because Sinda testified in her deposition that the $8,214 left to the Kurth estate by the Mattovich estate still remained to be distributed to the Kurth estate. The District Court acknowledged that this exception would allow late probate of the Kurth estate had such distribution not taken place. However, the court noted that Sinda had filed a sworn statement to close the Mattovich estate in 2001, stating therein that she had received this distribution, and further that Puryers had not pursued recovery of these funds for the ensuing thirteen years. The court concluded that Puryers had failed to establish that genuine issues of material fact precluded summary judgment in favor of Barstis on the application of this statute, citing the multiple inconsistent positions taken by Puryers. \u00b627 We have previously cautioned that parties cannot create a material factual issue by taking a contrary position to an earlier position. In <em>Stott v. Fox, </em>246 Mont. 301, 805 P.2d 1305 (1990), we instructed that Stott\u2019s contradiction between his deposition and his affidavit did not create a genuine issue of material fact. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>While the district courts must exercise extreme care not to take genuine issues of fact away from juries, \u2018[a] party should not be allowed to create issues of credibility by contradicting his own earlier testimony.\u2019 Ambiguities and even conflicts in a deponent\u2019s testimony are generally matters for the jury to sort out, but a district court may grant summary where a party\u2019s sudden and unexplained revision of testimony creates an issue of fact where none existed before. Otherwise, any party could head off a summary judgment motion by supplementing previous depositions ad hoc with a new affidavit, and no case would ever be appropriate for summary judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-5\"><em>Stott, </em>246 Mont. at 309, 805 P.2d at 1309-10 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"AqL\">\u00b628  Based upon the foregoing, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in its disposition of the procedural petitions filed by the parties. We further conclude that the District Court did not err in concluding that because neither of the statutory exceptions set forth in \u00a7 72-3-122, MCA, applied, Barstis was entitled to summary judgment on his contention that the estate must proceed under Montana\u2019s intestacy statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">\u00b629 <em>Did the District Court err by awarding litigation costs to Barstis following summary judgment on intestacy </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">\u00b630 Section 72-12-206, MCA, expressly provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-9\">When the validity or probate of a will is contested through court action, the attorney fees and costs, as provided in 25-10-201, incurred in defending the validity or probate of the will must be paid by the party contesting the validity or probate of the will if the will in probate is confirmed. If the probate is revoked, costs, as provided in 25-10-201, but not attorney fees, must be paid by the party who resisted the revocation or out of the property of the decedent, as the court directs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARO\">\u00b631  The District Court correctly interpreted and applied this statute. We affirm the court\u2019s award of costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-11\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b294-12\">\u00b632 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Kurth died intestate and that Kurth\u2019s estate must be distributed in accordance with Montana\u2019s intestacy statutes. We further affirm the court\u2019s statutory award of costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b294-13\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES McKINNON, WHEAT and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
