We reverse the District Court\u2019s order dismissing Rimrock\u2019s petition for judicial review and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-13\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b103-14\">\u00b63 Lithia Motors, Inc., acquired a Dodge franchise in Billings in 2003. At that time, Dodge was a division of Chrysler, LLC (Old Chrysler). In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>April 2009, Old Chrysler filed for bankruptcy. As part of the bankruptcy restructuring, Old Chrysler rejected 789 existing dealer agreements, including that of Rimrock in May 2009. Most of Old Chrysler\u2019s assets were sold to Chrysler Group, LLC (New Chrysler). In July 2009, New Chrysler awarded a Chrysler-Jeep franchise to Lithia to sell all of the Chrysler line in Billings.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">\u00b64 Rimrock successfully pursued arbitration of its franchise termination under \u00a7 747 of the United States Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2010. Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2010, Pub. L. No. 117, \u00a7 747(d), 123 Stat. 3034, 3220 (2009). In June 2010, Rimrock was awarded the sole remedy provided in \u00a7 747, a \u201ccustomary and usual letter of intent\u201d to enter into a dealer agreement. Section 747(e), 123 Stat. at 3221. Thereafter, New Chrysler filed with the Department, as required by \u00a7 61-4-205(3), MCA, a notice of intent to establish a Chrysler-Jeep dealership at Rimrock.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">\u00b65 Soon after New Chrysler filed its notice of intent, Lithia filed an administrative protest pursuant to \u00a7 61-4-206(1), MCA. Lithia\u2019s protest was based on Lithia being an existing franchise of the same line-make in the same community. <em>See </em>\u00a7 61-4-206(1), MCA. The Department appointed a hearing officer to conduct a contested case hearing pursuant to \u00a7 61-4-206(2), MCA. The hearing officer issued proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law sustaining Lithia\u2019s protest and concluding that New Chrysler was not authorized to establish an additional Chrysler-Jeep dealership at the Rimrock location. Both New Chrysler and Rimrock filed exceptions to the hearing officer\u2019s decision. Following oral argument, the Department issued a final decision adopting the hearing officer\u2019s proposed order.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">\u00b66 Rimrock filed a petition for judicial review before the District Court pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 61-4-206(7) and 2-4-702, MCA, requesting reversal of the Department\u2019s decision. New Chrysler did not join Rimrock\u2019s petition or file its own. Lithia filed a motion to dismiss Rimrock\u2019s petition based on New Chrysler\u2019s failure to request review. The court granted Lithia\u2019s motion on August 25,2014, concluding that because New Chrysler had abandoned any interest in the proceeding, effective relief could not be rendered and the matter was moot. Rimrock appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">\u00b67 In the meantime, New Chrysler had named Rimrock as a defendant in a declaratory judgment action in federal court in Detroit, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>Michigan.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rimrock moved to dismiss itself from the Michigan litigation on the ground that resolution of the issues in the Montana administrative proceeding would \u201cconclusively resolve the issues concerning Rimrock.\u201d Rimrock and New Chrysler entered into a settlement agreement in the Michigan case on May 6, 2011. The Settlement Agreement provided for the dismissal with prejudice of New Chrysler\u2019s claims against Rimrock and of all defenses, claims, and counterclaims that could have been raised by Rimrock. It provided further that \u201cRimrock unequivocally states that it will not assert any argument, in any forum or proceeding, that \u00a7 747 generally preempts Montana state dealer laws or, in particular, precludes a protest of the establishment of Rimrock pursuant to the Arbitration Order.\u201d As provided in the Settlement Agreement, Rimrock and New Chrysler stipulated to dismiss the federal litigation with prejudice, and the Michigan federal court dismissed Rimrock from the litigation on May 10, 2011.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">\u00b68 Before this Court issued a decision in Rimrock\u2019s first appeal, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in the Michigan case that \u00a7 747 preempted state regulation of new dealerships issued under dealership protest laws in Michigan and Nevada. <em>Chrysler Group LLC v. Fox Hills Motor Sales, Inc., </em>776 F.3d 411, 423-24 (6th Cir. 2015). The Sixth Circuit held: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>the power to review the federal arbitral decisions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>Michigan\u2019s and Nevada\u2019s state dealer protest laws, in particular, frustrate Congress\u2019s purpose in enacting \u00a7 747 because they permit state officials to delay and possibly nullify the effect of federal arbitration. Congress intended the federal arbitration to determine whether there is good cause for a terminated dealer to be added to New Chrysler\u2019s dealer networks. To that end, Congress placed within the discretion of the arbitrator the decision of \u201cwhether the franchise agreement at issue is to be renewed, continued, assigned or assumed by the covered manufacturer.\u201d \u00a7 747(d). State dealer protest laws create a process by which a state official subsequently and independently determines whether there is good cause for the new dealerships to have a sales and service agreement. This second, parallel determination of good cause impermissibly grants state officials</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number><em>Chrysler Group LLC, </em>776 F.3d at 424. This Court dismissed Rimrock\u2019s appeal without prejudice and remanded it to the District Court to consider the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision and to rule upon issues of subject matter jurisdiction, federal preemption of state law, and whether \u00a761-4-206(l)(b), MCA, added by the Legislature in 2013, had any effect on the case. <em>Rimrock Chrysler, Inc. v. Mont. Dep\u2019t of Justice, Motor Vehicle Div., </em>No. DA 14-0590, Or. (Mont., June 9, 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">\u00b69 On remand, Rimrock filed a motion to vacate the administrative proceeding and dismiss on the ground that \u00a7 747 preempted Montana dealer protest laws and deprived the State of Montana of subject matter jurisdiction to hear the administrative claim. New Chrysler and Lithia filed briefs in opposition, arguing that the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision was mistaken and that Rimrock had waived its preemption arguments. The District Court denied Rimrock\u2019s motion and dismissed the appeal on the basis of its August 2014 order. The court concluded that it had subj ect matter jurisdiction over the action and that Rimrock had expressly agreed to adjudicate its dispute in the Montana administrative forum. The court held that although \u00a7 747 may preempt Montana law in very \u201cnarrow, and unique circumstance[s]\u201d going forward, it did \u201cnot affect the outcome already reached\u201d in this case, and \u00a7 61-4-206(l)(b), MCA, was not applicable.

Old Chrysler received a $4 billion loan through TARP in exchange for a security interest in all of Old Chrysler\u2019s assets, to be held by the United States Treasury. <em>Chrysler Group LLC, </em>776 F.3d at 415 (citing <em>In re Chrysler LLC, </em>405 B.R. 84, 89-90 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y.2009)). After Old Chrysler and General Motors filed for bankruptcy, resulting in the termination of a significant number of local dealerships across the United States, Congress sought to protect the interests of the rejected auto dealers by enacting \u00a7 747 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2010. <em>Chrysler Group LLC, </em>776 F.3d at 417-18. Section 747 was intended to \u201cestablish a disclosure and arbitration process to determine whether dealers that had their franchise agreements terminated or not assumed by a successor company should be added to dealer networks of automobile manufacturers partially owned by the Federal Government.\u201d <em>Chrysler Group LLC, </em>776 F.3d at 418 (citing H.R. Rep. No. 111-366, at 942) (2009) (Conf. Rep.)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">\u00b614 Section 747 creates an arbitration right for covered dealerships terminated during the franchisor\u2019s bankruptcy. \u201cA covered dealership may elect to pursue the right to binding arbitration with the appropriate covered manufacturer.\u201d Section 747(d), 123 Stat. at 3220. A \u201ccovered dealership\u201d is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-5\">an automobile dealership that had a franchise agreement for the sale and service of vehicles of a brand or brands with a covered manufacturer in effect as of October 3, 2008, and such agreement was terminated, not assigned in the form existing on October 3, 2008, to another covered manufacturer in connection with an acquisition of assets related to the manufacture of that vehicle brand or brands, not renewed, or not continued during the period beginning on October 3, 2008, and ending on December 31, 2010.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMJ\">Section 747(a)(2), 123 Stat. at 3220. A \u201ccovered manufacturer\u201d is \u201can automobile manufacturer in which the United States Government has an ownership interest, or to which the Government has provided financial assistance under [TARP].\u201d Section 747(a)(1)(A), 123 Stat. at 3219. The parties do not dispute that Rimrockis a \u201ccovered dealership\u201d within the scope of \u00a7 747.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">\u00b615 In considering whether a covered dealership should be added to the dealer network of a covered manufacturer, \u00a7 747 commands the arbitrator to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-7\">balance the economic interest of the covered dealership, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>economic interest of the covered manufacturer, and the economic interest of the public at large and ... decide, based on that balancing, whether or not the covered dealership should be added to the dealer network of the covered manufacturer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Section 747(d), 123 Stat. at 3220. If the arbitrator rules in favor of the covered dealership, the covered manufacturer \u201cshall ... provide the dealer a customary and usual letter of intent to enter into a sales and service agreement.\u201d Section 747(e), 123 Stat. at 3221.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">\u00b616 Section 747(f) allows the parties to opt out of the arbitration process and participate in voluntary negotiation: \u201cAny legally binding agreement resulting from a voluntary negotiation between a covered manufacturer and covered dealership(s) shall not be considered inconsistent with this provision and any covered dealership that is a party to such agreement shall forfeit the right to arbitration established by this provision.\u201d Section 747(f), 123 Stat. at 3221.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">\u00b617 Montana\u2019s dealer protest laws, passed in 1977, allow an existing franchisee to object to the establishment of a new or additional motor vehicle dealership of the same line-make by filing a written objection with the Department. Section 61-4-206(l)(a), MCA. Section 61-4-207(3), MCA, provides specific criteria that guide the Department in determining whether good cause exists for entering into an additional franchise of the same line-make.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">\u00b618 The District Court held that Montana\u2019s dealer protest laws were \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to both \u00a7 747 and Michigan\u2019s good cause statutes. The District Court concluded, however, that \u00a7 747 did not preempt Montana\u2019s dealer protest laws in this case because \u201cit was not intended to be applied retroactively,\u201d and because \u201cLithia\u2019s protest, the administrative hearing, and this Court\u2019s dismissal all took place before the Sixth Circuit issued its <em>Chrysler Group </em>decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">\u00b619 The District Court concluded also that Rimrock had waived its opportunity to argue preemption. The court based its waiver decision on the fact that Rimrock had sought to \u201cavoid litigation in Federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>Court in Michigan\u201d by entering into the Settlement Agreement with New Chrysler in which it agreed to proceed in Montana and to not raise the issue of preemption. According to the court, Rimrock \u201cexpressly and conclusively agreed to be bound in several different documents by the decisions in Montana. It cannot now reverse course by abrogating a settlement agreement upon which both Lithia and Chrysler have relied.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">\u00b620 Rimrock argues first that the District Court \u201cconfused the issue of the retroactive application [of] state law under the 2013 Montana amendment with the application of federal preemption under Section 747.\u201d Rimrock contends that the procedural posture of the case and the timing of the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision are \u201cirrelevant to whether subj ect matter jurisdiction existed in 2011\u201d because \u00a7 747 preempted Montana law upon its enactment in 2010. The Sixth Circuit decision, according to Rimrock, \u201cwas merely enforcing federal law on the books since 2010.\u201d Therefore, Rimrock argues, \u201cthis proceeding has been void from the beginning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">\u00b621 Rimrock argues next that the District Court erred by holding that Rimrock waived its ability to contest subject matter jurisdiction by entering into the Settlement Agreement and then participating in the Montana proceeding, \u201cbecause subject matter jurisdiction is never waived.\u201d Rimrock points out that in our July 9, 2015 Order, this Court ruled that subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time and that a party cannot waive or consent to jurisdiction when there is no basis for jurisdiction in law. <em>Thompson v. State, </em>2007 MT 185, \u00b6 28, 338 Mont. 511, 167 P.3d 867. Rimrock argues, \u201cOnce the Sixth Circuit ruled Congress preempted state law, that decision affected the State of Montana and Rimrock had every right to bring that legal development to the attention of the Montana Supreme Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">\u00b622 Finally, Rimrock contends that Lithia\u2019s argument that federal preemption is a waivable affirmative defense \u201cmisstate[s] the law.\u201d Rimrock argues that the case law on which Lithia relies fails to take into consideration the distinction in the law between preemption of law, which may be waived, and preemption of forum, which may not. \u00b623 Lithia argues that the District Court properly held that Montana <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>had subject matter jurisdiction because Rimrock voluntarily chose to waive its preemption defense. Relying on <em>Winslow v. Montana Rail Link, Inc., </em>2005 MT 217, \u00b6\u00b6 37-38, 328 Mont. 260, 121 P.3d 506, Lithia claims that \u201c[w]hen preemption is an affirmative defense, it may be waived.\u201d Lithia argues that Rimrock made a \u201cvoluntary business decision,\u201d upon which Lithia relied, \u201cto proceed under and be bound by Montana state law in connection with the Montana administrative proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">\u00b624 We begin by addressing whether Rimrock waived its ability to argue preemption. Generally, \u201can affirmative defense is waived if not set forth affirmatively.\u201d <em>Winslow, </em>\u00b6 38 (quoting Nitzel <em>v. Wickman, </em>283 Mont. 304, 312, 940 P.2d 451, 456 (1997)) (internal quotation marks omitted). This rule applies to a defense of federal preemption of state law. <em>See Winslow, </em>\u00b6 38 (concluding that ERISA<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> preemption in benefits-due actions \u201cmust be pleaded timely as an affirmative defense\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">\u00b625 The United States Supreme Court has held, however, that where a federal preemption defense affects the choice of forum rather than the choice of law it is a matter of jurisdiction and not waivable. <em>Int\u2019l Longshoremen\u2019s Ass\u2019n v. Davis, </em>476 U.S. 380, 390-91 &amp; n.9, 106 S. Ct. 1904, 1912 &amp; n.9 (1986). In <em>Davis, </em>the Supreme Court considered whether the International Longshoremen\u2019s Association (ILA) had waived its argument that the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 151-169, preempted state law when it failed to comply with state procedural rules governing affirmative defenses. <em>Davis, </em>476 U.S. at 385-86, 106 S. Ct. at 1909. The Court held that the ILA had not waived its preemption argument by noncompliance with state procedural rules and that the state court \u201cerred in declining to address that claim on the merits.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>476 U.S. at 399, 106 S. Ct. at 1916. The Court concluded that \u201cwhen a state proceeding or regulation is claimed to be pre-empted by the NLRA... the issue is a choice-of-forum rather than a choice-of-law question. As such, it is a question whether the State or the [National Labor Relations] Board has jurisdiction over the dispute.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>476 U.S. at 391, 106 S. Ct. at 1912. The Court noted, however, that its decision in <em>Davis </em>\u201cdoes not apply to pre-emption claims generally but only to those pre-emption claims that go to the State\u2019s actual adjudicatory or regulatory power as opposed to the State\u2019s substantive laws <em>.\u2019\u2019Davis, </em>476 U.S. at 391 n.9, 106 S. Ct. at 1912 n.9.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>\u00b626 Accordingly, courts must consider whether a party\u2019s preemption argument \u201cis in the nature of an affirmative defense that must be asserted in the trial court or be considered forever waived or whether it is in the nature of a challenge to a court\u2019s power to adjudicate that may be raised at any time.\u201d <em>Gilchrist v. Jim Slemons </em>Imports, Inc., 803 F.2d 1488, 1496 (9th Cir. 1986) <em>(citing Davis, </em>476 U.S. at 381-82, 106 S. Ct. at 1907). If the latter, a party is not barred from first raising the issue on appeal. <em>Gilchrist, </em>803 F.2d at 1497. <em>See also Wolf v. Reliance Standard Life Ins., </em>71 F.3d 444, 449 (1st Cir. 1995) (holding that \u201cERISA preemption in a benefits-due action is waivable, not jurisdictional, because it concerns the substantive law but does not implicate the power of the forum to adjudicate the dispute\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">\u00b627 Whether the \u201cnature\u201d of a preemption claim is one of choice of law or choice of forum \u201cdepend[s] on congressional intent in enacting the particular pre-empting statute.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>476 U.S. at 391 n.9, 106 S. Ct. at 1912 n.9. The issue is not whether Congress intended to replace state law with a federal regulatory scheme but \u201cwhether jurisdiction provided by state law is itself pre-empted by federal law vesting exclusive jurisdiction over that controversy in another body.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>476 U.S. at 387-88, 106 S. Ct. at 1910. The <em>Davis </em>Court \u201cfound a strong congressional intent to oust the state court as a forum\u201d based on its belief</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-5\">that Congress intended to confide primary interpretation and application of its rules to a <em>specific and specially constituted tribunal, </em>namely, the National Labor Relations Board which would follow a specially constituted procedure, which would develop knowledge of, and expertise in, labor relations, and which would develop and apply nationally uniform labor-relations principles and practice. And, the Court apparently believed that Congress intended this <em>to the point </em>where Congress (sub silentio in the statutes) refused to permit parties to submit such a dispute to the courts even where the parties themselves wished to do so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAV\"><em>Sweeney v. Westvaco Co., </em>926 F.2d 29, 38-39 (1st Cir. 1991) (citing <em>Davis, </em>476 U.S. at 389-91, 106 S. Ct. at 1911-12) (emphasis in original) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). In other words, where Congress has designated another forum for the resolution of a certain class of disputes, such designation deprives the courts of jurisdiction to decide those cases. <em>See Sweeney, </em>926 F.2d at 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">\u00b628 In contrast with the NLRA considered in <em>Davis </em>courts considering choice of law versus choice of forum issues in other acts of Congress have found no intent \u201cto oust the state as a forum.\u201d In <em>Sweeney, </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>First Circuit Court of Appeals held that Section 301(a) of the Labor Management Relations Act (LMRA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185(a), unlike Sections 7 and 8 of the NLRA, concerns what law a decision maker must apply, not what forum decides the dispute. <em>Sweeney, </em>926 F.2d at 39. In that case, a party had argued that LMRA concerns choice-of-forum preemption because it \u201creflects a congressional intent that arbitrators (not courts) develop and explain the meaning of terms in a collective bargaining agreement.\u201d <em>Sweeney, </em>926 F.2d at 38. The court disagreed based on its belief that Congress did not intend to \u201cforeclose parties from submitting such disputes to judicial fora.\u201d <em>Sweeney, </em>926 F.2d at 39 (emphasis omitted). The court observed that the law \u201cclearly permits parties to opt out of arbitration-based dispute-resolving mechanisms, and to have courts decide those disputes instead.\u201d <em>Sweeney, </em>926 F.2d at 39. The court noted further that, because \u201cthe law does not require that collective bargaining agreements provide for grievance and arbitration procedures,\u201d in some cases courts, not arbitrators, must decide disputes arising under the agreement. <em>Sweeney, </em>926 F.2d at 39. Finally, the court observed that, \u201ceven if an agreement does provide for such mechanisms ..., the parties to a dispute may waive the benefit of these procedures.\u201d <em>Sweeney, </em>926 F.2d at 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">\u00b629 In <em>Wolf, </em>the First Circuit held that the argument that a state law claim was preempted by ERISA affected the choice of law, not the choice of forum. <em>Wolf, </em>71 F.3d at 449. The court considered the plain language of ERISA\u2019s jurisdictional provision, which provides, \u201c \u2018State courts of competent jurisdiction and district courts of the United States shall have <em>concurrent jurisdiction of actions.\u2019 \u201d Wolf, </em>71 F.3d at 448 (quoting 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(e)(1)) (emphasis in original). The court concluded that the plain language of the statute \u201ctells us that if a plaintiff brought a \u2018benefits-due\u2019 action in state court and the defendant pleaded ERISA preemption, this would not deprive the court of jurisdiction over the subject matter; rather, ERISA preemption in that situation would dictate the applicable law.\u201d <em>Wolf, </em>71 F.3d at 448. The court considered Congressional intent, concluding that \u201cthe interests in uniformity which Congress hoped to serve in ERISA did not extend to permitting defendant corporations, often more sophisticated about ERISA than individual plaintiffs, to sit on their hands and not claim the defense until the last minute.\u201d <em>Wolf, </em>71 F.3d at 448.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">\u00b630 In this case, although Congress provided an express remedy of federal arbitration for terminated dealers, \u00a7 747 \u201cclearly permits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>parties to opt out of arbitration-based-dispute resolving mechanisms,\u201d <em>Sweeney, </em>926 F.2d at 39, and to allow parties to create legally binding agreements through voluntary negotiations instead, Section 747(f), 123 Stat. at 3221. Section 747(f) expressly provides that <em>\u201c[,ajny </em>legally binding agreement resulting from a voluntary negotiation between a covered manufacturer and covered dealership(s) <em>shall not be considered inconsistent with this provision.\u201d </em>Section 747(f), 123 Stat. at 3221 (emphasis added). The conference report on \u00a7 747 demonstrates further Congress\u2019s intent to afford parties alternate avenues of dispute resolution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-4\">The conference agreement would permit covered manufacturers and dealers to [sic] also, where they both prefer, to use voluntary negotiation outside the arbitration process where possible to resolve issues of possible dispute, including equitable compensation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">H.R. Rep. No. 111-366, at 943 (2009) (Conf. Rep.). Thus, it is evident that Congress did not intend to \u201cvest[ ] exclusive jurisdiction\u201d in the federal arbitration process. <em>Davis, </em>476 U.S. at 388, 106 S. Ct. at 1910. Although it did not provide explicit authority for concurrent state and federal court jurisdiction, Congress permitted covered dealers and covered manufacturers to negotiate outside of federal arbitration if they agreed to do so. Rimrock and New Chrysler unequivocally did agree to do so when they entered a written agreement to be bound by the Department\u2019s proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"AVj\">\u00b631  Based on the foregoing analysis, we conclude that \u00a7 747 preemption is \u201cin the nature of an affirmative defense that must be asserted in the trial court or be considered forever waived.\u201d <em>Gilchrist, </em>803 F.2d at 1496. Consequently, Rimrock waived its \u00a7 747 preemption defense when it entered into the Settlement Agreement and agreed that it would not raise \u00a7 747 preemption as a defense. Accordingly, the District Court concluded correctly, albeit for slightly different reasons, that it \u201cretain[ed] subject matter jurisdiction\u201d over this case. Having determined that Rimrock waived its \u00a7 747 preemption defense, we decline to examine whether \u00a7 747 preemption applies in this case. We affirm the District Court\u2019s November 12, 2015 Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">\u00b632 <em>2. Whether the District Court erred by dismissing Rimrock\u2019s petition for judicial review on the grounds of mootness and lack of a justiciable controversy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">\u00b633 In its August, 25, 2014 Order, the District Court dismissed Rimrock\u2019s petition for judicial review on the grounds of mootness and lack of a justiciable controversy. The court concluded that under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>Montana Dealer Act, New Chrysler bears the burden of proof to establish good cause to add Rimrock as another Chrysler-Jeep franchisee in Billings. Thus, according to the court, \u201cit is impossible for Rimrock to establish itself as a Chrysler-Jeep franchisee without the approval of and action by Chrysler to enter into a dealer agreement.\u201d The court concluded that because New Chrysler decided not to appeal the Department\u2019s final decision, the court \u201chas no jurisdiction to enter a judgment\u201d requiring that New Chrysler \u201ctake any action whatsoever.\u201d The court noted that, without New Chrysler, the issues set forth in Rimrock\u2019s petition for judicial review \u201care merely abstract or hypothetical questions\u201d and would require the court to issue \u201can impermissible advisory opinion.\u201d As such, the court concluded that New Chrysler\u2019s decision not to appeal the Department\u2019s final decision \u201cis an intervening change in the status of the parties that makes it impossible for [the District Court] to render effective relief on appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AIY\">\u00b634 Rimrock has asked this Court to incorporate by reference its opening and reply brief from its appeal of the District Court\u2019s August 2014 Order.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In that appeal, Rimrock argued that the District Court was wrong \u201cin both its premise and conclusion.\u201d Rimrock contended that the court could have granted relief because Rimrock had asked only that the court order the Department to take action \u2014 by reversing its decision and approving New Chrysler\u2019s notice of intent to issue a license to Rimrock. Rimrock contended further that New Chrysler was a party to the case because the court had jurisdiction over it when New Chrysler acknowledged service and filed an answer. Therefore, according to Rimrock, \u201cChrysler will be bound by the Court\u2019s decision whatever that may be.\u201d Finally, Rimrock argued that it had the right to seek judicial review of the administrative decision regardless of New Chrysler\u2019s involvement. Rimrock asserted that the Montana Administrative Procedures Act (MAPA) \u201cdoes not require the original applicant to join in a petition for judicial review. On the contrary, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>MAPA expressly provides that any person who has exhausted all administrative remedies and who is aggrieved by final decision is entitled to judicial review.\u201d Rimrock contends that our jurisprudence is consistent with its interpretation of MAPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">\u00b635 Lithia argued in the first appeal, and argues again here, that the District Court correctly dismissed Rimrock\u2019s petition for judicial review due to mootness and lack of justiciable controversy. Lithia argues that \u201c[i]t is disingenuous for Rimrock to suggest that it is not asking this Court to require Chrysler to take any action\u201d because \u201cany order this Court could issue that would be favorable to Rimrock would either require Chrysler to participate on remand in further administrative proceedings or to comply with the letter of intent to establish the Rimrock dealership.\u201d Lithia argues further that the cases cited by Rimrock in its first appeal brief are \u201cdistinguishable\u201d because they \u201cfail to account for the unique statutory framework of the Montana Dealer Act, which mandates the participation of the manufacturer in an establishment proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">\u00b636 The Montana Dealer Act, found in Title 61, Chapter 4, Part 2, MCA, regulates the distribution of new motor vehicles in the State of Montana. The Act regulates specifically the relationship between franchisors and new motor vehicle dealers. <em>See </em>\u00a7 61-4-203, MCA (\u201cThe department shall supervise and regulate all persons required by this part to be licensed.\u201d). A franchisor may not establish an additional dealership in any community in which the same line-make is represented unless there is good cause and it is in the public interest. Section 61-4-205(2), MCA. An existing same line-make dealer has the right to protest where a franchisor gives notice under \u00a7 61-4-205(4), MCA, that it intends to establish an additional dealership in the community in which the same line-make is represented already. Section 61-4-206(1), MCA. \u201cUpon hearing or upon objection to the establishment of a new motor vehicle dealership, the franchisor bears the burden of proof to establish that good cause exists to terminate, not continue, or not establish the franchise.\u201d Section 61-4-206(3), MCA.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>Section 61-4-206(7), MCA, allows any party to the hearing to appeal the Department\u2019s final decision in accordance with the MAPA procedures for judicial review. <em>Shamrock Motors, Inc. v. Chrysler Corp., </em>1999 MT 39, \u00b6 14, 293 Mont. 317, 974 P.2d 1154.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">\u00b637 MAPA affords an opportunity for judicial review of an administrative decision to \u201c[a] person who has exhausted all administrative remedies available within the agency and who is aggrieved by a final written decision in a contested case.\u201d Section 2-4-702(l)(a), MCA. \u201cCopies of the petition must be promptly served upon the agency and all parties of record.\u201d Section 2-4-702(2)(a), MCA. A petition for judicial review resembles an appeal. <em>Hilands Golf Club v. Ashmore, 211 </em>Mont. 324, 330, 922 P.2d 469, 473 (1996). The parties are required to have \u201cexhausted all administrative remedies available within the agency\u201d before seeking judicial review. Section 2-4-702(l)(a), MCA. \u201cAs a result, the parties already have been defined through their appearance at, and participation in, the administrative proceedings.\u201d <em>Forsythe v. Great Falls Holdings, LLC, </em>2008 MT 384, \u00b6 20, 347 Mont. 67, 196 P.3d 1233 (citing <em>Hilands Golf Club, </em>277 Mont. at 331, 922 P.2d at 474). Thus, the mailing of a copy of the petition upon a party is sufficient to vest the District Court with jurisdiction over that party. <em>Hilands Golf Club, </em>277 Mont. at 332, 922 P.2d at 474. On judicial review, the district court may affirm the agency\u2019s decision, remand the case for further proceedings, or reverse the agency\u2019s decision if the appellant\u2019s substantial rights have been prejudiced. Section 2-4-704(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">\u00b638 \u201c[W]e encourage a liberal interpretation of procedural rules governing judicial review of an administrative decision, rather than taking an overly-technical approach, so as best to serve justice and allow the parties to have their day in court.\u201d <em>Hilands Golf Club, </em>277 Mont. at 330, 922 P.2d at 473. In this case, Rimrock is a party \u201caggrieved by\u201d the Department\u2019s decision. Section 2-4-702(l)(a), MCA. Rimrock served the petition on New Chrysler, Lithia, and the Department by mail. Although New Chrysler filed an answer disavowing participation in the appeal, Rimrock\u2019s mailing of the petition to New Chrysler was \u201csufficient to vest the District Court with jurisdiction\u201d over New Chrysler. <em>Hilands Golf Club, </em>277 Mont. at 332, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>922 P.2d at 474.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">\u00b639 The judicial power of Montana courts \u201cis limited to \u2018justiciable controversies.\u2019 \u201d <em>Plan Helena, Inc. v.

Roosevelt Cnty., </em>2007 MT 44, \u00b6 11, 336 Mont. 118, 154 P.3d 48. Mootness is a category of justiciability. <em>Plan Helena, </em>Inc., \u00b6 8. A matter is moot \u201cif the court is unable due to an intervening event or change in circumstances to grant effective relief or to restore the parties to their original position.\u201d <em>Alexander, </em>\u00b6 28 (citing <em>Progressive Direct Ins.

Jur. 2d <em>Administrative Law </em>\u00a7 573 (1962). \u201cBut intervening events do not render a controversy moot where it is still possible for the reviewing court, if it should decide the case in favor of the party seeking relief, to grant him some effectual relief....\u201d 2 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Administrative Law </em>\u00a7 573.</p>\n<p id=\"AsBn\">\u00b640  New Chrysler\u2019s failure to participate in the judicial review proceeding does not prevent the court from granting Rimrock some effectual relief. Rimrock\u2019s petition requested that the court \u201creview and reverse the [Department\u2019s] decision to disallow the establishment of Rimrock as an additional Chrysler Jeep dealership in [Billings].\u201d In the alternative, Rimrock requested that the court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-6\">remand the matter to the Department with instructions to make findings concerning all existing circumstances relevant to the establishment of Rimrock... [and] to make findings concerning the public interest in the establishment of Rimrock... and, in making such findings, to note the purpose of Section 61-4-205(2), MCA is to protect existing dealers from arbitrary or capricious action by the manufacturer and resulting substantial injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">Contrary to Lithia\u2019s argument, the District Court could grant Rimrock \u201ceffective relief\u2019 on its petition without ordering New Chrysler to do anything. <em>Alexander, </em>\u00b6 28. If the court were to reverse the Department\u2019s decision, it would \u201crestore [Rimrock] to [its] original position.\u201d <em>Alexander, </em>\u00b6 28. That is, Rimrock would be in the same position as it was before Lithia filed its protest \u2014 the recipient of a letter of intent from New Chrysler. If at that point, Rimrock were to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>request that New Chrysler honor the letter of intent and enter into a dealer agreement with Rimrock, such an action would be a matter between Rimrock and New Chrysler, wholly distinct from the current case. Similarly, if the court were to remand the case to the Department, that would not be a judgment enforceable against New Chrysler. It would simply return Lithia\u2019s protest to the Department, at which time New Chrysler may choose whether to contest the protest and attempt to establish good cause. Furthermore, if the District Court were to hold against Rimrock by upholding the Department\u2019s decision, still, New Chrysler would not be compelled to take any action as a result of the District Court\u2019s ruling. Rather, New Chrysler would remain bound by the Department\u2019s decision, issued in a proceeding in which it participated and from which it did not appeal. If the court were to affirm the Department\u2019s decision, it simply would leave New Chrysler in the same position that it was in prior to the appeal. The foregoing analysis establishes that judicial review of and final order on the merits of Rimrock\u2019s petition would \u201ceffectively operate, as distinguished from a dispute invoking a purely political, administrative, philosophical or academic conclusion.\u201d <em>Clark, </em>\u00b6 11. Accordingly, Rimrock\u2019s petition for judicial review involved a justiciable controversy and the court erred in concluding otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">\u00b641 We affirm the District Court\u2019s November 12, 2015 Order denying Rimrock\u2019s motion to vacate the Department\u2019s administrative decision and to dismiss the judicial review proceeding for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
