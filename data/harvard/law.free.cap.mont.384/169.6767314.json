We address:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-7\">\n<em>1. Whether the District Court erred in ordering Brave to pay $25,000 in restitution.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-8\">\n<em>2. Whether the District Court erred in imposing several probation conditions.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">\u00b62 We affirm the District Court\u2019s restitution order. We reverse several of the probation conditions and remand the judgment to the District Court for proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b196-11\">f 3 On July 15,2013, the State of Montana charged Brave with sexual intercourse without consent, a felony in violation of \u00a7 45-5-503, MCA. The State alleged that Brave had sexual intercourse with A.C. and, as a result, A.C. became pregnant and gave birth to twins. At the time of the alleged offense, Brave was eighteen years old and A.C. was fourteen years old. On May 16, 2014, the parties entered into a plea agreement, and Brave pled guilty to an amended charge of criminal endangerment, a felony in violation of \u00a7 45-5-207, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-12\">\u00b64 The District Court held a restitution hearing on September 12, 2014, and a sentencing hearing on November 7, 2014. On November 13, 2014, the District Court issued a restitution order, ordering Brave to pay $35,667.36 in restitution to A.C.\u2019s mother, D.C. The restitution award included $25,000 D.C. claimed as lost wages because of a ten-week Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) leave of absence she took from work to care for A.C. and the twins, three months after the twins were born. On December 9, 2014, the District Court issued its judgment, imposing a six-year deferred sentence, subject to conditions of probation. Brave appeals the restitution order and the judgment, challenging the $25,000 in restitution to D.C. for lost wages and several of the probation conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-13\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b196-14\">\u00b65 If an offender is sentenced to less than one year of actual incarceration, we utilize a two-tiered approach. <em>State v. Herd, </em>2004 MT 85, \u00b6 22, 320 Mont. 490, 87 P.3d 1017. \u201cUpon request, we will review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>such sentences for both legality <em>and </em>abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Herd, </em>\u00b6 22 (emphasis in original). Brave does not argue that his sentence constitutes an abuse of discretion. Therefore, we review Brave\u2019s sentence for legality only. <em>See State v. McCaslin, </em>2011 MT 221, \u00b6 6, 362 Mont. 47, 260 P.3d 403. \u201cA sentence is legal if it falls within statutory parameters.\u201d <em>McCaslin, </em>\u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">\u00b66 \u201cThe appropriate measure of restitution is a question of law, which we review for correctness.\u201d <em>State v. Aragon, </em>2014 MT 89, \u00b6 9, 374 Mont. 391, 321 P.3d 841 (citation omitted). We review for clear error a district court\u2019s finding of fact as to the amount of restitution. <em>Aragon, </em>\u00b6 9. A factual finding is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if our review of the record convinces us that the court made a mistake. <em>Aragon, </em>\u00b6 9. \u201cSubstantial evidence is evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion; it consists of more than a mere scintilla of evidence, but may be somewhat less than a preponderance.\u201d <em>Aragon, </em>\u00b6 9 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">\u00b67 <em>1. Whether the District Court erred in ordering Brave to pay $25,000 in restitution.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">\u00b68 Under Montana law, \u201ca sentencing court shall, as part of the sentence, require an offender to make full restitution to any victim who has sustained a pecuniary loss, including a person suffering an economic loss,\u201d \u00a7 46-18-241(1), MCA, such as loss of income, <em>see </em>\u00a7 46-18-243(l)(a), MCA. \u201cThe extent of the restitution obligation is not limited to the defined elements of the offense and is not limited to losses that arise as a \u2018direct\u2019 result of the offense.\u201d <em>State v. Cerasani, </em>2014 MT 2, \u00b6 13, 373 Mont. 192, 316 P.3d 819 (quoting State <em>v. LaTray, </em>2000 MT 262, \u00b6 14, 302 Mont. 11, 11 P.3d 116). Rather, \u201c[a] condition of a sentence will be upheld as long as there is a nexus either to the offense or to the offender.\u201d <em>Cerasani, </em>\u00b6 12. For example, in <em>State v. Perkins, </em>2009 MT 150, \u00b6\u00b6 5, 6, 350 Mont. 387, 208 P.3d 386, a child was placed into foster care with her aunt, P.M., during Youth in Need of Care proceedings that resulted in the defendant\u2019s conviction of criminal endangerment. We upheld the district court\u2019s restitution award for expenses P.M. incurred that were not covered by the foster care program, including daycare. <em>Perkins, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 9, 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">\u00b69 The victim of a criminal act has a duty to mitigate restitution damages. <em>State v. Kalal, </em>2009 MT 103, \u00b6 9, 350 Mont. 128, 204 P.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>1240. However, this duty is limited; an injured person is not expected to do what is unreasonable or impracticable. <em>Kalal, </em>\u00b6 9. Thus, we consider what a reasonable and prudent person would be expected to do, if capable, under the circumstances. <em>Kalal, </em>\u00b6 9. The District Court found that D.C.\u2019s lost wages for her ten weeks of FMLA leave were necessarily connected to assisting her minor daughter in caring for the twins. Brave does not dispute that D.C. took ten weeks of FMLA leave or that her salary for that time period amounted to $25,000. Rather, he contends that D.C. should have mitigated her damages by hiring a child care provider to care for the twins, which presumably would have cost less than D.C.\u2019s hourly wage of $62.50.</p>\n<p id=\"AQlq\">\u00b610  In her application for FMLA leave, D.C. listed A.C. as the family member for whom she would provide care. She wrote: \u201c[A.C.] is the 15 year old mother of twin girls (now 3 mo. old) and is going through an emotional time. She ran away from home and was hospitalized due to suicidal statements. Now in respite care &amp; therapy. We\u2019re providing temporary legal guardianship for her babies.\u201d At the September 12, 2014 restitution hearing, D.C. testified that she took FMLA leave \u201c[bjecause [A.C.] was not able to care for twins on her own, so I had to help her.\u201d When asked whether there was anyone else who was able to care for the twins, D.C. answered: \u201cNo. Because I\u2019m [A.C.\u2019s] mom and she needed me there.\u201d Although D.C. later stated that she \u201cprobably could have\u201d hired child care to help with the twins, this statement did not negate her need to care for A.C. When D.C. took FMLA leave, A.C. was a minor. Under the circumstances, it was reasonable that D.C. would not want to entrust a stranger with the care and support of her fifteen-year-old daughter, who had previously run away from home, had been hospitalized due to suicidal statements, and was the new mother to infant twins. D.C. was not required to mitigate her damages by hiring a child care provider. The District Court did not err in awarding D.C. $25,000 in lost wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">\u00b611 <em>2. Whether the District Court erred in imposing several probation conditions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AOA\">\u00b612  Brave also alleges that the District Court erred by (1) attaching a sex offender tier designation to Brave; (2) issuing a written judgment that does not conform to its oral pronouncement of Brave\u2019s sentence; and (3) ordering Brave to pay Presentence Investigation Report (PSI) and public defender fees without making a determination of his ability to pay. The State concedes each of these allegations. Therefore, on remand:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-7\">* Condition \u201cee\u201d, which designates Brave as a Level 1 sexual offender, shall be stricken from the District Court\u2019s judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>* Condition \u201cz\u201d, which requires Brave to enter and complete sexual offender treatment, shall be stricken from the District Court\u2019s judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-4\">* Condition \u201cmm\u201d, which requires Brave to submit to annual polygraph testing, shall be stricken from the District Court\u2019s judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-5\">* Condition \u201cbb\u201d of the District Court\u2019s judgment shall be amended to allow the Department of Health and Human Services, Child and Family Services Division (Department), to determine the appropriateness of Brave\u2019s contact with the victim and the victim\u2019s immediate family. In the event that the Departm\u00e9nt is no longer involved, the discretion for determining the appropriateness of any contact will revert to Brave\u2019s probation officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-6\">* The citation to \u00a7 45-5-503, MCA, in the first paragraph of the District Court\u2019s judgment shall be replaced with a citation to \u00a7 45-5-207, MCA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-7\">* Pursuant to \u00a7 46-8-113, MCA, the District Court on remand shall determine Brave\u2019s ability to afford the costs of appointed counsel and PSI preparation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">\u00b613 We affirm the District Court\u2019s restitution order. We reverse several of the probation conditions in the District Court\u2019s judgment and remand for proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b199-10\">JUSTICES COTTER, McKINNON, WHEAT and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
