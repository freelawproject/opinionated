We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-24\">\u00b62 The issue on appeal is whether the District Court properly affirmed the Justice Court\u2019s decision denying Davis\u2019s motion to dismiss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>the criminal charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">\u00b63 On May 12, 2012, Montana Highway Patrol Trooper Fetterhoff stopped Davis\u2019s vehicle on a public highway in Flathead County because she was speeding. Fetterhoff asked Davis for proof of insurance. Davis failed to provide any proof of insurance and stated \u201cI don\u2019t have insurance.\u201d Trooper Fetterhoff gave Davis a citation for violating \u00a7 61-6-301(4), MCA, which prohibits operating a motor vehicle without liability insurance. Davis failed to appear at the Justice Court omnibus hearing and then failed to appear at the Justice Court bench trial on September 4, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">\u00b64 At trial the State presented the testimony of Trooper Fetterhoff who described the traffic stop, Davis\u2019s failure to provide proof of insurance, and her statement that she had no insurance. After the State presented its case, Davis\u2019s attorney moved to dismiss the charge for insufficient evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Justice Court declined to do so and found Davis guilty of the charge. On September 20,2012, Davis appealed the Justice Court conviction to District Court. After briefing the District Court issued the Opinion and Order affirming the conviction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">\u00b65 When a justice court decision is appealed, the district court functions as an intermediate appellate court and its review is confined to the record and issues of law. Sections 3-5-303 and 3-10-115, MCA; <em>State v. Luke, </em>2014 MT 22, \u00b6 9, 373 Mont. 398, 321 P.3d 70. On appeal of the district court\u2019s decision, this Court reviews the record independently, applying the clearly erroneous standard to the justice court\u2019s factual findings and reviewing discretionary rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>Luke, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">\u00b66 This Court reviews a lower court\u2019s ruling on a motion to dismiss in a criminal case de novo, to determine whether the court\u2019s conclusions of law are correct. <em>State v. Kirn, </em>2012 MT 69, \u00b6 8, 364 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>Mont. 356, 274 P.3d 746.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">\u00b67 <em>Issue: Whether the District Court properly affirmed the Justice Court\u2019s decision denying Davis\u2019s motion to dismiss the criminal charge for insufficient evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">\u00b68 The State charged Davis with a violation of \u00a7 61-6-301(4), MCA, which makes it unlawful for a person to operate a motor vehicle \u201cupon the ways of this state open to the public ... without a valid policy of liability insurance....\u201d Davis argues thatthe Justice Court shouldhave dismissed the charge because the State\u2019s only evidence was her statement to Trooper Fetterhoff that \u201cI don\u2019t have insurance.\u201d Davis contends that her statement was a confession that could not be used to convict her because it was not corroborated by any other evidence. Montana law requires that a defendant\u2019s extrajudicial confession may not be admitted unless the prosecution introduces \u201cindependent evidence tending to establish the commission of the crime charged.\u201d Section 46-16-215, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">\u00b69 The District Court determined that Davis\u2019s statement to Trooper Fetterhoff was not a confession, but was an admission that could be considered without corroborating evidence. The District Court relied upon the established distinction that a confession is a statement by the defendant that he committed the crime, while an admission is a statement by the defendant of some specific fact or facts that could tend to establish guilt or some element of the offense. We agree with the District Court. Montana Rule of Evidence 801(a) defines \u201cstatement\u201d as any oral or written assertion. Statements made by a party-opponent and offered against that party are not hearsay and can be allowed into evidence as admissions. M. R. Evid. 801(2); <em>State v. Smith, </em>276 Mont. 434, 441, 916 P.2d 773, 777 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">\u00b610 The distinction between a confession and an admission is consistent with established Montana law. <em>State v. Hallam, </em>175 Mont. 492, 503, 575 P.2d 55, 62 (1978) (a confession is an admission of the crime itself while an admission concerns only some specific fact that tends to establish guilt); <em>State v. Dupre, </em>200 Mont. 165, 172, 650 P.2d 1381, 1384-85 (1982) (a confession is an acknowledgement of guilt after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>an offense, and does not include a mere statement of an independent fact from which guilt may be inferred); <em>State v. Thompson, </em>263 Mont. 17, 25, 865 P.2d 1125, 1130 (1993) (admission is an avowal of a fact or circumstance from which guilt may be inferred); <em>State v. Goltz, </em>197 Mont. 361, 369, 642 P.2d 1079, 1084 (1982) (an admission may include a false exculpatory statement).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">\u00b611 The assertion by Davis that she did not have insurance was an admission and not a confession. The statement pertained to an element of the offense (not having valid insurance) but it did not encompass the entire offense. As the District Court found, the other elements of the offense were operating a motor vehicle, and doing so upon a way of the state open to the public. Section 61-6-301(4), MCA. Since the statement was not a confession the requirements of corroboration applicable to a confession did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">\u00b612  In this case the Justice Court heard Trooper Fetterhoffs testimony that Davis said \u201cI don\u2019t have insurance.\u201d In addition the evidence showed that Davis did not produce evidence of insurance when asked to do so, and that she was operating a motor vehicle upon a way open to the public. These pieces of evidence, taken together, were sufficient to establish that Davis violated \u00a7 61-6-301(4), MCA. Davis\u2019s failure to produce evidence of insurance when asked is circumstantial evidence of guilt, which may be relied upon to prove a violation of the statute. <em>State v. Chaussee, </em>2011 MT 203, \u00b6 16, 361 Mont. 433, 259 P.3d 783.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">\u00b613 There was sufficient evidence to convict Davis of the charged offense and we affirm the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b417-8\">JUSTICES WHEAT, BAKER, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b415-10\"> Defense motions for a directed verdict or for acquittal are \u201cmore appropriately entitled motions to dismiss for insufficient evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Farmer, </em>2008 MT 354, \u00b6 6, 346 Mont. 335, 195 P.3d 800.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b415-11\"> Briefing on Davis\u2019s appeal to the District Court was completed on January 14, 2013. Nothing else transpired in the appeal until the District Court\u2019s Opinion and Order issued July 28, 2015, some two and a half years later.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b416-9\"> We reject the State\u2019s contention that Davis failed to preserve the issue for review by failing to specifically object to Trooper Petterhoffs testimony. Davis preserved the issue on appeal by moving to dismiss for insufficient evidence. <em>State v. McCarvey, </em>2005 MT 308, \u00b6 15, 329 Mont. 439, 124 P.3d 1131.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
