We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-26\">\u00b62 The issue on appeal is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-27\">\n<em>Did the District Court err in imposing a restitution obligation of $2,500?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">\u00b63 In September 2014 Hill stole and wrecked a 1995 Pontiac Bonneville. The car was a total loss and the State charged Hill with felony theft. In January 2015 the State and Hill signed an agreement under which Hill would plead guilty to felony theft and the State would recommend a three-year suspended sentence. The parties agreed that Hill owed restitution to the car\u2019s owner, but could not agree upon the amount. At the change of plea hearing on January 20, 2015, Hill pled guilty to felony theft. As part of the factual basis to support the plea, Hill acknowledged that the vehicle \u201ccould potentially\u201d be worth over $1,500, the threshold value for stolen property to support a charge of felony theft under \u00a7 45-6-301(8)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">\u00b64 The District Court conducted a sentencing and restitution hearing on March 23, 2015. The District Court imposed a suspended sentence pursuant to the plea agreement and moved on to consider restitution. The State filed and relied upon an affidavit of the vehicle\u2019s owner that the \u201creplacement value\u201d of the car was $2,500. The owner\u2019s affidavit was supported by a page from the \u201cNADA Guide\u201d that she relied upon, indicating an original sticker price of $20,804 for the car in 1995; a current \u201clow retail\u201d of $1,975; a current \u201caverage retail\u201d of $3,575; and a current \u201chigh retail\u201d of $5,400. The NADA Guide explained that the values given were \u201cretail consumer value[s] and to be considered as selling prices.\u201d The NADA Guide described a vehicle fitting the \u201caverage retail\u201d category as one in \u201cgood condition overall\u201d: a well-maintained original, completely operable and serviceable. The Guide also contained descriptions of vehicles that would fit the other value categories.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">\u00b65 In response, Hill did not present any testimony. His attorney referenced \u201cKelly Blue Book\u201d material that he had appended to a prior motion to dismiss the charge.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He asserted that the \u201cKelly Blue Book\u201d placed a $1,400 \u201ctop dollar\u201d value on the car because of its high mileage. Hill\u2019s attorney argued that the $2,500 value was \u201cextremely high.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">\u00b66 The District Court noted that Hill had \u201cadmitted the value of the property was over $1,500\u201d by expressly pleading guilty to the offense of felony theft. The District Court elected to not impose a criminal fine on Hill, but to insure that the victim received restitution for the car. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>The District Court stated that if he were \u201cgoing to err\u201d it would be \u201con the side of the victim\u201d and imposed restitution of $2,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">\u00b67 Hill appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">\u00b68 This Court reviews a district court's determination of restitution as an issue of law, to determine whether it is correct. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>2011 MT 116, \u00b6 13, 360 Mont. 443, 254 P.3d 578. This Court reviews a district court\u2019s findings of fact as to the amount of restitution under the clearly erroneous standard. <em>State v. Aragon, </em>2014 MT 89, \u00b6 9, 374 Mont. 391, 321 P.3d 841. A finding of fact is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence; if the district court misapprehends the effect of the evidence; or if this Court\u2019s review of the record convinces us that the district court has committed a mistake. <em>State v. Passwater, </em>2015 MT 159, \u00b6 9, 379 Mont. 372, 350 P.3d 382. Substantial evidence is evidence that a reasonable person might accept as adequate to support a conclusion; it is more than a mere scintilla of evidence but may be less than a preponderance of the evidence. <em>State v. Jent, </em>2013 MT 93, \u00b6 10, 369 Mont. 468, 299 P.3d 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">\u00b69 <em>Issue: Did the District Court err in imposing a restitution obligation of $2,500?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">\u00b6 10 Montana law requires a sentencing court to order restitution when a defendant\u2019s crime results in pecuniary loss to a victim. Section 46-18-201(5), MCA; <em>Aragon, </em>\u00b6 12. The amount of restitution is based upon the special damages that a crime victim could recover in a civil action against the defendant based upon the same facts. Section 46-18-243(1), MCA. The victim is entitled to restitution for \u201cthe full replacement cost of property taken, destroyed, harmed or otherwise devalued as a result of the offender\u2019s criminal conduct.\u201d Section 46-18-243(l)(b), MCA. The rules of evidence do not apply to a determination of restitution, but the defendant has a due process right to explain, argue and dispute any information presented on the issue. <em>State v. McClelland, </em>2015 MT 281, \u00b6 9, 381 Mont. 164, 357 P.3d 906.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-11\">\u00b6 11 A district court may award restitution even though the actual loss may be uncertain as long as the loss was derived by use of reasonable methods and the best evidence available under the circumstances. <em>State v. O\u2019Connor, </em>2009 MT 222, \u00b6 14, 351 Mont. 329, 212 P.3d 276. The district court may rely upon the victim\u2019s estimates of her loss to determine the level of restitution. <em>McClelland, </em>\u00b6 10; <em>Aragon, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"AIK\">\u00b612 As in other cases, the issue here is not whether the car owner is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>entitled to restitution for her loss, but where that loss should be set between competing values. <em>Aragon, </em>\u00b6 13. The choice was a value between $1,500 and $2,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">\u00b613 Here the victim\u2019s request for $2,500 replacement value was well explained. She filed an affidavit to support her request and appended supporting information from the NADA Guide. That Guide set a range of values for vehicles of the same make, model and year, and clearly described the condition of a vehicle that would fit in each of the valuation categories. The owner, who was the person most familiar with her car, affirmed that it should be valued between the low retail and average retail selling prices.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">\u00b614 Hill\u2019s reliance upon \u201cBlue Book\u201d values was not sufficient to displace the victim\u2019s affidavit of loss. The Blue Book sheets appended to Hill\u2019s prior brief did not relate the values given to particular vehicle conditions (except perhaps mileage) and did not specify the context in which those values should be used. By contrast, the NADA Guide described the relevant vehicle condition categories and specifically represented that its values should be \u201cconsidered as selling prices\u201d to the retail consumer. That is exactly the position that the owner here would be in if she were searching for a replacement vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">\u00b6 15  There was substantial evidence of the replacement value of the vehicle that Hill stole and wrecked, and the District Court properly relied upon the evidence to set the restitution obligation. The evidence falls well within a range that a reasonable person might accept as adequate to support a conclusion as to the replacement value for the car. Because the victim presented evidence of valuation in the amount of $2,500, the District Court\u2019s findings were not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">\u00b616 The District Court properly set Hill\u2019s restitution obligation at $2,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">\u00b617 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b515-10\">JUSTICES SHEA, COTTER, BAKER, McKINNON, WHEAT and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b513-8\"> The motion to dismiss was based upon an argument that the stolen vehicle was not worth $1,500, the threshold value for a charge of felony theft. The District Court never ruled on that motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
