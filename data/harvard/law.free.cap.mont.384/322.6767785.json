We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">\u00b62 Kenfield raises several issues on appeal, which we restate as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-11\">\n<em>1. Whether the District Court erred by dismissing Kenfield\u2019s newly discovered evidence claim.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-12\">\n<em>2. Whether the criminal charging process used for Kenfield was consistent with the 1972 Montana Constitution and Montana statutes.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b349-14\">\u00b63 In September 2008, a jury convicted Kenfield of one count of attempted deliberate homicide for engaging in a drive-by shooting at the Liberty County Sheriff s Office in Chester, Montana. The incident involved shots that were fired in the direction of the sheriffs dispatcher seated at her desk. Additionally, a jury convicted Kenfield of three counts of felony criminal mischief and six counts of misdemeanor criminal mischief for shooting at and damaging nine businesses in Chester.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-15\">\u00b64 Following his convictions, Kenfield filed a petition for postconviction relief alleging ineffective assistance of counsel (IAC) by his trial counsel. In the petition, Kenfield asserted numerous instances of his trial counsel\u2019s shortcomings, including alleged failures regarding the analysis of the crime scene. The IAC claim in Kenfield\u2019s original petition centered around his trial counsel\u2019s decision to challenge the State\u2019s expert and his analysis of the bullet-ridden crime scene on cross examination rather than use his own investigator or perform tests for direct examination. Kenfield also challenged his counsel\u2019s decision not to use the defense\u2019s expert analysis of surveillance video of the crime scene and only cross-examine the State\u2019s expert on the video. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>District Court held a hearing on Kenfield\u2019s petition and issued a detailed order denying Kenfield relief. In the order, the District Court concluded that Kenfield\u2019s defense counsel did not render IAC. The court determined that counsel provided an adequate defense and chose to limit the defense\u2019s expert analysis in part because his expert would not look as qualified as the State\u2019s. The court ultimately concluded that defense counsel\u2019s decisions were strategic, after hearing the State\u2019s expert and considering the evidence in the record. Kenfield appealed the decision and we affirmed the District Court on appeal. <em>State v. Kenfield, </em>2011 MT 150N, 2011 Mont. LEXIS 187 <em>(Kenfield I). </em>Kenfield later filed a second petition for postconviction relief, alleging IAC based upon his trial counsel\u2019s suspension from the practice of law, which was unrelated to Kenfield\u2019s case. This Court again affirmed the District Court\u2019s dismissal of his second petition. <em>Kenfield v. State, </em>2014 MT 172N, 2014 Mont. LEXIS 401 <em>(Kenfield II).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">\u00b65 Kenfield filed a third petition for postconviction relief on November 4, 2015. Prior to filing the third petition, Kenfield commissioned and paid for a \u201cnew\u201d analysis of the crime scene, which he now claims qualifies as newly discovered evidence. Skylark Technologies, the same business that analyzed Kenfield\u2019s trial evidence, conducted a reconstruction of the crime scene utilizing the truck Kenfield drove the morning of the shooting. Skylark analyzed three of the ten shots fired at the sheriffs office based on the trajectory calculations originally provided by the Department of Justice\u2019s report on the incident. The Department of Justice\u2019s report was available at trial, and was created at Kenfield\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s request. Kenfield argues that the new truck analysis demonstrates his actual innocence \u2014 that it was not possible that Kenfield fired the bullets from his vehicle based upon the angle of the shots. The \u201cnew\u201d evidence also included an analysis by Skylark of the sheriffs department\u2019s surveillance footage and time records, which Kenfield argues further supports his theory of actual innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">\u00b66 The District Court reviewed the petition and found that Kenfield\u2019s new independent crime scene analysis did not constitute newly discovered evidence that would allow a subsequent petition. The court reasoned that Kenfield knew about alleged problems with the State\u2019s crime scene analysis prior to trial, or at least by the time he filed his first postconviction relief petition where he raised IAC based upon the same reasoning. Ultimately, the court determined that under \u00a7 46-21-102(2), MCA, Kenfield\u2019s new analysis did not constitute \u201cnewly discovered evidence.\u201d Further, the court determined that Kenfield was barred from asserting IAC claims in his third petition pursuant to \u00a7 46-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>21-105(2), MCA. Finally, the District Court found that Kenfield\u2019s constitutional claim lacked merit because it was based on the 1889 Montana Constitution and that the process for filing the Information was legally sound. Under this reasoning, the District Court dismissed the petition on November 18, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">\u00b67 We review a district court\u2019s denial of postconviction relief to determine if the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous, and if its conclusions of law are correct. <em>Stock v. State, </em>2014 MT 46, \u00b6 9, 374 Mont. 80, 318 P.3d 1053.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">\u00b68 <em>1. Whether the District Court erred by dismissing Kenfield\u2019s newly discovered evidence claim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">\u00b69 Kenfield argues in his third petition for postconviction relief that the new crime scene analysis he commissioned, seven years after the shooting, demonstrates that he received IAC when his attorney failed to conduct a reasonable investigation of the case. This petition is untimely, thus Kenfield seeks to avoid the procedural time bar set forth under the postconviction relief statutes by arguing that he has \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d of actual innocence that permits review of the IAC claim. The State responds that Kenfield has filed no new relevant grounds for relief in his petition and that all of his claims have previously been raised or could reasonably have been raised on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">\u00b6 10 Postconviction remedies are governed by specific statutes. Section 46-21-102(2), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-11\">A claim that alleges the existence of newly discovered evidence that, <em>if proved and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole would establish that the petitioner did not engage in the criminal conduct for which the petitioner was convicted, </em>may be raised in a petition filed within 1 year of the date on which the conviction becomes final <em>or the date on which the petitioner discovers, or reasonably should have discovered, the existence of the evidence, whichever is later.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-12\">(Emphasis added). Additionally, because Kenfield has filed two previous petitions for postconviction relief, \u00a7 46-21-105, MCA, applies.</p>\n<p id=\"A9z\">It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-13\">Amendment of petition - waiver of grounds for relief.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-14\">(1) (a) All grounds for relief claimed by a petitioner under 46-21-101 must be raised in the original or amended original petition. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>The original petition may be amended only once. At the request of the state or on its own motion, the court shall set a deadline for the filing of an amended original petition. If a hearing will be held, the deadline must be reasonably in advance of the hearing but may not be less than 30 days prior to the date of the hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-5\">(b) <em>The court shall dismiss a second or subsequent petition by a person who has filed an original petition unless the second or subsequent petition raises grounds for relief that could not reasonably have been raised in the original or an amended original petition.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-6\">(2) When a petitioner has been afforded the opportunity for a direct appeal of the petitioner\u2019s conviction, grounds for relief that were or could reasonably have been raised on direct appeal may not be raised, considered, or decided in a proceeding brought under this chapter. <em>Ineffectiveness or incompetence of counsel in proceedings on an original or an amended original petition under this part may not be raised in a second or subsequent petition under this part.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-7\">(3) For purposes of this section, \u201cgrounds for relief\u2019 includes all legal and factual issues that were or could have been raised in support of the petitioner\u2019s claim for relief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">Section 46-21-105, MCA, (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">\u00b611  Kenfield\u2019s current petition is subject to dismissal under \u00a7 46-21-105(l)(b), MCA, as a second or subsequent petition, unless he raises new grounds for relief that could not have reasonably been raised in his prior two petitions. Kenfield\u2019s first and second petitions demonstrate that he has already raised the claims he now raises in this third petition. Because Kenfield\u2019s claims of I AC and flawed crime scene analysis were raised in the previous petitions, and his remaining claim could have been raised in the original petition, the petition must be dismissed under statute. Sections 46-21-105(l)(b), (2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-10\">\u00b6 12 Kenfield further claims that his current petition is timely because he possesses \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d of actual innocence under \u00a7 46-21-102(2), MCA. However, as the District Court correctly concluded, Kenfield clearly knew about the alleged problems with the crime scene analysis because he addressed the same issues in his original petition, which was affirmed by this Court. <em>Kenfield I, </em>f \u00b6 5-6. Because he has previously presented the evidence, Kenfield\u2019s \u201cnew\u201d independent analysis of the shooting evidence is not \u201cnewly discovered evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-11\">\u00b613 The only \u201cnew\u201d evidence presented by Kenfield is an eleven-page report created by Skylark that analyzes the bullet trajectories. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>analysis evaluates the trajectories of three of the ten bullets fired at the sheriffs office during the incident using Kenfield\u2019s truck to measure the trajectories. The report does not draw out the premise of the analysis, but Kenfield advances the same argument that he made in his original petition for postconviction relief \u2014 that the Department of Justice used a truck not representative of his truck. The truck used in the original reconstruction sat lower than Kenfield\u2019s truck; thus, Kenfield posits, because his truck sits higher there is no way the shots could have been fired from his truck. Skylark concluded that the shot positions, when traced back to Kenfield\u2019s truck, are consistently lower than the rear window, and close to the height of the side window of the truck. Kenfield argues this is evidence of actual innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">\u00b614 Kenfield\u2019s \u201cnewly discovered\u201d evidence analyzes only three of the bullets fired on the evening of the incident, but fails to provide an analysis of significant evidence against Kenfield, including the seven additional shots fired at the sheriffs office. There is no evidence of actual innocence regarding Kenfield\u2019s convictions of the misdemeanor and felony criminal mischief charges pertaining to the other shots fired that night. Those shots include the bullets that hit and damaged several businesses in Chester, including The Roadhouse, Sugar Shack, Moodie Implement, Cenex Harvest States, Fraser Oil, Tiber Tractor, and The Grand Bar. Section 46-21-102(2), MCA, regarding newly discovered evidence includes a qualifier that new evidence may be raised if \u201cproved and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole would establish that the petitioner did not engage in the criminal conduct for which the petitioner was convicted....\u201d Given the extent of his criminal conduct and convictions in the case, we conclude that a re-analysis of three of the ten bullets fired does not overcome evidence of Kenfield\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">\u00b615  In addition, the new report is simply an additional analysis of the same evidence used at trial and in Kenfield\u2019s two previously denied petitions for postconviction relief. Given the extent of the discussion of the crime scene analysis in the court record, there is no question that the bullet trajectory issue is not newly discovered. Because the evidence is not newly discovered, Kenfield\u2019s petition does not meet the requirements set forth in \u00a7 46-21-102(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\"><em>Schlup </em>\u201cGateway\u201d Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">\u00b616 Kenfield\u2019s remaining argument is a <em>Schlup </em>procedural claim, where under federal law Kenfield argues that his new crime scene analysis evidence is sufficient to grant him passage around state and federal statutory time bars, otherwise known as the <em>\u201cSchlup </em>gateway.\u201d <em>Schlup v. Delo, </em>513 U.S. 298, 316, 115 S. Ct. 851, 861 (1995). Kenfield <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>seeks to use <em>Schlup </em>to gain review of his IAC claim through the lens of his \u201cnew\u201d independent crime scene analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">\u00b617 \u201cA <em>Schlup </em>procedural, or \u2018gateway/ innocence claim alleges that newly discovered evidence demonstrates that \u2018a constitutional violation has probably resulted\u2019 in a wrongful conviction.\u201d <em>State v. Beach, </em>2013 MT 130, \u00b6 14, 370 Mont. 163, 302 P.3d 47 (quoting <em>Schlup, </em>513 U.S. at 327, 115 S. Ct. at 867). A <em>Schlup </em>claim accompanies an assertion of trial error, which in this case involves Kenfield\u2019s IAC allegation that his counsel failed to use a proper crime scene analysis at trial. <em>Beach, </em>\u00b6 14 (citing <em>Schlup, </em>513 U.S. 315-16, 115 S. Ct. at 861). To meet the <em>Schlup </em>standard of proof a petitioner need only produce evidence that creates \u201csufficient doubt about his guilt to justify the conclusion that his [criminal sanction] would be a miscarriage of justice <em>unless </em>his conviction was the product of a fair trial.\u201d <em>Beach, </em>\u00b6 14 (citing <em>Schlup, </em>513 U.S. at 316, 115 S. Ct. at 861-62) (emphasis in original). A <em>Schlup </em>gateway petitioner must \u201cshow that it is \u2018likely\u2019 or \u2018probable\u2019 that \u2018no reasonable jury\u2019 would find him guilty.\u201d <em>Beach, </em>\u00b6 16. If the <em>Schlup </em>petitioner makes the required showing, the petitioner passes through the \u201cgateway\u201d that entitles him to present his constitutional claims of trial error, despite the procedural bars that would normally prohibit such claims. <em>Beach, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 14, 16. In <em>Beach, </em>we noted that because this Court respects the finality of a verdict, the reviewing court must determine whether the petitioner has supported his innocence claim \u201cwith new reliable evidence \u2014 whether it be exculpatory scientific evidence, trustworthy eyewitness accounts, or critical physical evidence \u2014 that was not presented at trial.\u201d <em>Beach, </em>\u00b6 8 (citing <em>Schlup, </em>513 U.S. at 324, 115 S. Ct. at 865).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">\u00b618 The pitfall for Kenfield\u2019s <em>Schlup </em>claim is that the evidence is not \u201cnew reliable evidence ... that was not presented at trial.\u201d <em>Beach, </em>\u00b6 8. As we noted above, the record in this case is replete with similar evidence regarding the crime scene analysis at trial, on Kenfield\u2019s original postconviction relief petition with accompanying IAC claim, and once again on his second petition for postconviction relief. Specifically, the evidence that Kenfield brings forward on this third petition can be boiled down to the use of one different factor: Kenfield\u2019s truck. The height of Kenfield\u2019s truck versus the truck in the \u201cflawed\u201d crime scene analysis allegedly demonstrates Kenfield could not possibly have fired the shots from the truck. This is not newly discovered evidence. This same evidence was reviewed and available for Kenfield at trial and his counsel strategically chose not to use the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">\u00b619 We concluded in <em>Kenfield I </em>that it was not IAC when Kenfield\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>counsel chose to rely on the cross examination of the State\u2019s crime scene analysis at trial rather than present an independent analysis of the data. <em>Kenfield I, </em>\u00b6 6. We affirmed the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Kenfield\u2019s defense counsel made a strategic decision, among many, to hold back his expert in part to avoid the risk that the expert would not look as qualified as the State\u2019s expert. Regardless, the evidence contained in Kenfield\u2019s current analysis was available at trial and the \u201cnew\u201d analysis presents nothing new. In the order dismissing Kenfield\u2019s third petition, the District Court concluded that this issue was addressed in the original petition. We agree. We conclude that Kenfield has not presented any evidence that can be considered new or different from what was available at trial or what he has already presented in this case. Because he has failed to provide new evidence, the <em>Schlup </em>gateway Kenfield seeks is not open for him to pass through. Because it was previously addressed, and because the evidence that Kenfield presents is not new, we affirm the District Court\u2019s dismissal of the petition pursuant to \u00a7 46-21-105, MCA. We also conclude that Kenfield\u2019s IAC-related claim similarly fails because Kenfield previously raised it and the District Court properly dismissed the claim as barred under \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">\u00b620 <em>2. Whether the criminal charging process used for Kenfield was consistent with the 1972 Montana Constitution and Montana statutes.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AaTc\">\u00b621  Kenfield argues that the charging process used in his criminal case was unconstitutional because it violates the 1889 Montana Constitution. Petitioner fails to recognize that the State of Montana adopted and ratified a new Constitution in 1972. \u201cMontana\u2019s specific constitutional and statutory provisions define a district court\u2019s jurisdiction and provide for commencing a state prosecution.\u201d <em>State v. Montgomery, </em>2015 MT 151, \u00b6 9, 379 Mont. 353, 350 P.3d 77 (citing Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 20(1) and art. VII, \u00a7 4(1); \u00a7\u00a7 3-5-301(1), - 302(l)(a), and 46-11-101, MCA). We have also concluded that \u201c \u2018[t]he district court has original jurisdiction in all criminal cases amounting to felony ....\u2019 \u201d <em>Montgomery, </em>\u00b6 9 (quoting Mont. Const, art. VII, \u00a7 4(1)). Accordingly, the District Court properly determined that Kenfield\u2019s claims are not valid or sustainable under the Constitution or laws of the State of Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">\u00b622 Additionally, the postconviction relief statutes require that the district court dismiss a second or subsequent petition unless the petitioner raises grounds for relief that \u201ccould not reasonably have been raised in the original or an amended original petition.\u201d Section 46-21-105(l)(b), MCA; <em>State v Osborne, </em>2005 MT 264, \u00b6 14, 329 Mont. 95, 124 P.3d 1085. Kenfield\u2019s claim could reasonably have been raised in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>his original petition. We affirm the District Court\u2019s dismissal of the claim as it was not an abuse of the court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">\u00b623 The District Court made proper factual findings regarding Kenfield\u2019s third petition for postconviction relief, and its conclusions of law are correct. Accordingly, we affirm the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Kenfield\u2019s petition because he failed to present any newly discovered evidence. We also affirm the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the criminal charging process used to charge and prosecute Kenfield was consistent with the 1972 Montana Constitution and Montana statutes.</p>\n<judges id=\"b356-7\">JUSTICES BAKER, SHEA, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
