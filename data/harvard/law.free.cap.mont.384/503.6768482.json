The Act permits certain groundwater appropriations to be exempt from the permitting process. Relevant here, \u00a7 85-2-306(3)(a)(iii), MCA, provides an exemption when a groundwater appropriation does not exceed 35 gallons per minute and 10 acre-feet per year. However, the subsection also provides an \u201cexception]\u201d to the exemption when a \u201ccombined appropriation\u201d from the sam\u00e9 source by two or more wells or developed springs exceeds 10 acre-feet per year, regardless of flow rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-11\">\u00b62 The term \u201ccombined appropriation\u201d is not defined within the Water Use Act. Since the adoption of \u00a7 85-2-306(3)(a)(iii), MCA, the state agency charged with administering the Act, the Department of Natural Resources and Conservation (DNRC), has taken contradictory positions regarding the meaning of the term. Specifically, within a period of six years, the DNRC promulgated consecutive rules with conflicting interpretations as to whether groundwater developments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>must be physically connected to constitute a \u201ccombined appropriation.\u201d Initially, in 1987, three months after the Legislature adopted the \u201ccombined appropriation\u201d language, the DNRC promulgated Admin. R. M. 36.12.101(7) (1987), which provided that \u201c[gjroundwater developments need not be physically connected nor have a common distribution system to be considered a \u2018combined appropriation.\u2019 \u201d However, in 1993, the DNRC reversed its position and adopted the current administrative rule, Admin. R. M. 36.12.101(13), which states that the term \u201ccombined appropriation\u201d means \u201cgroundwater developments, that are physically manifold into the same system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">\u00b63 After an adverse ruling from the DNRC Hearings Examiner, a group of senior water users \u2014 Katrin Chandler, Betty Lannen, Polly Rex, Joseph Miller, and the Clark Fork Coalition (collectively, the Coalition) \u2014 challenged the validity of Admin. R. M. 36.12.101(13) in the First Judicial District Court, Lewis and Clark County. The Coalition maintained that the DNRC\u2019s definition of \u201ccombined appropriation\u201d was inconsistent with the applicable statute arguing that the statute does not require physical connection.' The District Court agreed. The court invalidated Admin. R. M. 36.12.101(13), reinstated Admin. R. M. 36.12.101(7) (1987), and directed the DNRC to formulate a new administrative rule consistent with the court\u2019s order. The Montana Well Drillers Association, the Montana Association of Realtors, and the Montana Building Industry Association (collectively, the Well Drillers) appeal from that order.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">\u00b64 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-6\">\n<em>1.

Whether the District Court erred by directing the DNRC to institute rulemaking consistent with the court\u2019s order.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b532-13\">\u00b65 In 1973, the Montana Legislature instituted the current water rights system by adopting the Montana Water Use Act, \u00a7 85-1-101, MCA, et seq. The Act sets forth the statutory framework under which water rights are obtained, administered, and adjudicated. A critical component of the Act is the permit system administered by the DNRC. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>With certain exceptions, the Act requires those seeking new appropriations of water to apply to the DNRC for a permit. Section 85-2-301, MCA. The primary function of this permit based system is the protection of senior water rights from encroachment by prospective junior appropriators adversely affecting those rights. Section 85-2-101(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">\u00b66 Consistent with this purpose, the Act imposes both substantive and procedural protections for water right users. Substantively, before the issuance of a new water appropriation, the Act requires that a prospective junior appropriator show that water is legally and physically available, the proposed use of water is for a beneficial use, and the new appropriation will not adversely affect existing water rights of senior prior appropriators. Section 85-2-311(l)-(2), MCA. Procedurally, a prospective junior appropriator must provide notice, through the DNRC, to senior users who may be affected by the proposed appropriation and must permit senior users an opportunity to object to the prospective water right. Section 85-2-307, MCA. If objections do arise from senior users, the DNRC must hold a contested hearing on the objections. Section 85-2-309, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">\u00b67 Senior users are afforded even more protection in highly appropriated basins in Montana that have been closed from further surface water appropriations. In these \u201cclosed basins,\u201d where water claims often exceed water availability, the DNRC may not issue new surface water permits. Section 85-2-360(l)-(3), MCA. The DNRC may consider groundwater permits, but the process for obtaining a groundwater permit in a closed basin is demanding. In addition to the general requirements for obtaining a permit, the appropriator must commission a hydrogeological report to determine if the proposed appropriation could result in a net depletion of surface water. Section 85-2-360(2), MCA. If the report indicates a hydrogeological connection, then the appropriator must show that there will be no net depletion of water. Section 85-2-360(3)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">\u00b68 The Act provides certain exemptions to the rigorous permitting process. Section 85-2-306(l)-(9), MCA. If an appropriation qualifies for an exemption, none of the permitting procedures under the Act constrain the proposed appropriation. <em>See generally </em>\u00a7 85-2-306 (l)-(9), MCA. A prospective appropriator need not show that water is legally and physically available; that the new appropriation will not deplete surface flow; or that the water will not be used inconsistently with senior rights. <em>See generally </em>\u00a7 85-2-306(l)-(9), MCA. Nor does the appropriator need to provide notice to senior users or allow senior users an opportunity to object. <em>See generally </em>\u00a7 85-2-306 (l)-(9), MCA. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>Similarly, the more onerous requirements for obtaining an appropriation in a closed basin are inapplicable. <em>See generally </em>\u00a7 85-2-306 (l)-(9), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">\u00b69 Relevant to this case, \u00a7 85-2-306(3)(a)(iii), MCA, provides an exemption for groundwater appropriations considered de minimis; that is, those appropriations that do not exceed 35 gallons a minute and 10 acre-feet per year. In 1987, the Legislature incorporated the term \u201ccombined appropriation\u201d into the de minimis groundwater exemption. Section 85-2-306(3)(a)(iii), MCA (1987), provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-6\">a permit is not required before appropriating groundwater by means of a well or developed spring with a maximum appropriation of less than 100 gallons per minute, except that a combined appropriation from the same source by two or more wells or developed springs exceeding this limitation requires a permit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">Shortly after the incorporation of the \u201ccombined appropriation\u201d language into the statute, the DNRC promulgated Admin. R. M. 36.12.101(7) (1987) (hereinafter, the 1987 rule). The 1987 rule provided that wells or developed springs \u201cneed not be physically connected nor have a common distribution system to be considered a \u2018combined appropriation.\u2019 \u201d Instead, the 1987 rule instructed that two or more groundwater developments constitute a \u201ccombined appropriation\u201d if used together for a single \u201cproject or development.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">\u00b610 In 1991, the Legislature amended the statute. The Legislature reduced the permissible flow rate and imposed a volume limitation on the exemption, but retained the term \u201ccombined appropriation.\u201d Section 85-2-306(3)(a)(iii), MCA, as amended in 1991, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-9\">a permit is not required before appropriating ground water by means of a well or developed spring with a maximum appropriation of 35 gallons a minute or less, not to exceed 10 acre-feet a year, except that a combined appropriation from the same source from two or more wells or developed springs exceeding this limitation requires a permit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">\u00b611 In 1993, the DNRC promulgated Admin. R. M. 36.12.101(13) (hereinafter, the 1993 rule), significantly altering the administrative definition of the term \u201ccombined appropriation.\u201d The 1993 rule defines \u201ccombined appropriation\u201d as \u201ctwo or more groundwater developments, that are physically manifold into the same system.\u201d Under the 1993 rule, appropriations from the same source are exempt from the permitting process as long as the groundwater developments making up the appropriations remain physically unconnected and do not exceed 10 acre-feet per year. Thus, the current rule allows an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>appropriator to avoid the permitting process for an infinite number of appropriations from the same source \u2014 with each appropriation consuming up to 10 acre-feet per year \u2014 so long as the appropriator does not physically connect the groundwater developments.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">\u00b612 In 2013, the Legislature again amended the statute. The Legislature further reduced the permissible flow in stream depletion zones, left the permissible flow rate unaltered outside stream depletion zones, and once again retained the term \u201ccombined appropriation.\u201d Section 85-2-306(3)(a)(iii), MCA, as amended in 2013, provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-5\">a permit is not required before appropriating ground water by means of a well or developed spring:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-6\">(iii) when the appropriation is outside a stream depletion zone, is 35 gallons a minute or less, and does not exceed 10 acre-feet a year, except that a combined appropriation from the same source by two or more wells or developed springs exceeding 10 acre-feet, regardless of the flow rate, requires a permit; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-7\">(iv) when the appropriation is within a stream depletion zone, is 20 gallons a minute or less, and does not exceed 2 acre-feet a year, except that a combined appropriation from the same source by two or more wells or developed springs exceeding this limitation requires a permit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">\u00b613 The Coalition cites data compiled by the DNRC that, since the DNRC\u2019s promulgation of the 1993 rule, exempt appropriations under \u00a7 85-2-306(3)(a)(iii), MCA, have grown steadily by approximately 3,000 each year. The DNRC estimates that there are now 113,000 exempt appropriations in Montana, consuming significant amounts of water. The DNRC anticipates that exempt appropriations will continue to grow rapidly. By the year 2020, the DNRC projects that there could be an additional 78,000 exempt appropriations in Montana. Closed basins have not been immune from this trend. The DNRC estimates that 30,000 new exempt appropriations will be added in the next two decades in closed basins alone, resulting in an additional 20,000 acre-feet per year of water consumed in these already over-appropriated basins. The DNRC has recently acknowledged the concerns of senior users that the cumulative effects of these exempt appropriations are having a significant impact in terms of reducing groundwater levels and surface water flows and that the cumulative impact of the appropriations may be harming senior water users\u2019 existing rights.</p>\n<p id=\"AidC\">\u00b614 On November 30, 2009, the Coalition petitioned the DNRC for a declaratory ruling that the 1993 rule was inconsistent with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>exemption under \u00a7 85-2-306(3)(a)(iii), MCA, asserting that the term \u201ccombined appropriation\u201d as used in the statute does not require physical connectivity between ground water developments. In the petition, the Coalition requested that the court invalidate the 1993 rule, reinstate the 1987 rule, and order the DNRC to conduct further rule making.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">\u00b615 On August 17, 2010, the DNRC Hearings Examiner denied the Coalition\u2019s petition. The examiner concluded that the administrative rule was not in conflict with \u00a7 85-2-306(3)(a)(iii), MCA, reasoning that \u201ca common, perhaps the most common definition, of \u2018combined\u2019 is physically joined together.\u201d The examiner acknowledged, however, that the administrative rule had caused the proliferation of exempt appropriations in a way that was not anticipated by the Legislature. As a result, the examiner ordered the DNRC to initiate proposed rulemaking to repeal the 1993 rule and adopt a new administrative rule that would align more closely with legislative intent. The DNRC thereafter attempted to repeal and replace the 1993 rule, but, for reasons not made entirely clear by the record, failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">\u00b616 On September 14,2010, the Coalition filed a complaint in District Court, challenging the DNRC Hearings Examiner\u2019s denial of its petition. The court invalidated the 1993 rule, reinstated the 1987 rule, and directed the DNRC to formulate a new administrative rule consistent with the court\u2019s order. The court provided three reasons for its decision to invalidate the administrative rule. First, after examining the 1987 legislative debate surrounding the incorporation of the term \u201ccombined appropriation\u201d into the statute, the court explained that clearly, \u201cthe legislature was under the impression that the reference to \u2018combined\u2019 did not require two wells to be physically connected.\u201d Second, the court noted that the DNRC promulgated the 1987 rule, which did not require physical connection, immediately after the incorporation of the term into the statute. Lastly, the court explained that the 1993 rule fails to protect senior water users in accordance with the Act\u2019s express purpose. The court explained through the use of a hypothetical that the administrative rule allows large consumptive water uses to be established, without going through the permitting process, at the expense of senior users:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-6\">The current definition of \u201ccombined appropriation\u201d allows 1,000 new wells as part of a 1,000 lot subdivision to escape review under DNRC permitting... [and] allow[s] up to 10,000 acre feet a year of water to be potentially diverted from senior water rights holders neighboring or near the new 1,000 lot subdivision without any review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>\u00b617 The Well Drillers timely appealed from the District Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">\u00b6 18 \u201cThe interpretation of a statute is a question of law that we review for correctness.\u201d <em>Mont.

M. 36.12.101(13).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">\u00b620 When we assess the validity of an agency rule, we must begin with an examination of the statute itself. Our objective in interpreting a statute is to implement the objectives the Legislature sought to achieve. <em>Montana Wildlife Fed\u2019n v. Sager, </em>190 Mont. 247, 264, 620 P.2d 1189, 1199 (1980). The legislative intent is to be ascertained, in the first instance, from the plain meaning of the words used. <em>Boegli v. Glacier Mountain Cheese Co., </em>238 Mont. 426, 429, 777 P.2d 1303, 1305 (1989). If the intent of the Legislature can be determined from the plain meaning of the words used in the statute, the plain meaning controls and the Court need go no further nor apply any other means of interpretation. <em>Phelps v. Hillhaven Corp., </em>231 Mont. 245, 251, 752 P.2d 737, 741 (1988). In determining the statutory mandate given to a statute by the Legislature, it is important to remember that our role \u201cis simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA. Words and phrases used in a statute are to be construed according to the context in which they are found, and according to their normal usage, unless they have acquired some peculiar or technical meaning. Section 1-2-106, MCA. \u201cWhen the legislature has not defined a statutory term, we consider the term to have its plain and ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Giacometti v. Scottsdale Ins. Co., </em>2009 MT 418, \u00b6 18, 354 Mont. 15, 221 P.3d 666. For the same reason that a contract term is not rendered ambiguous merely because the parties disagree as to its meaning, a statutory term is not rendered ambiguous because of subsequent inconsistent rules implemented by the agency. <em>See, e.g., Scottsdale Ins. Co., </em>\u00b6 32; <em>Dollar Plus Stores, Inc. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number><em>v.

Corp., </em>2007 MT 74, \u00b6 42, 336 Mont. 429, 154 P.3d 1189.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">\u00b621 Section 85-2-306(3)(a)(iii), MCA, is one amongst several statutory exemptions to the water permit process and provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-5\">When the appropriation is outside a stream depletion zone, is 35 gallons a minute or less, and does not exceed 10 acre-feet a year, except that a combined appropriation from the same source by two or more wells or developed springs exceeding 10 acre-feet, regardless of flow rate, requires a permit;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">\u00b622 The statute thus allows an exemption from the permitting process and provides for a lawful appropriation when the amount of appropriation does not exceed 35 gallons per minute and 10 acre-feet per year. However, even if this criterion is satisfied, a combined appropriation from the same source of two or more wells or developed springs is \u201cexcept[edj\u201d from the exemption if the combined appropriation exceeds 10 acre-feet per year, regardless of flow rate. The exception applies when (1) there are two or more wells or developed springs, (2) that are from the same source, (3) where the combined appropriation exceeds 10 acre-feet per year. The exception removes any consideration of flow rate, but adds volume considerations when appropriations are from the same source, thus expressing the Legislature\u2019s intent to limit the impact of the appropriation that would occur on any particular source of water to less than 10 acre-feet per year.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">\u00b623 To \u201cappropriate\u201d means to \u201cdivert, impound, or withdraw ... a <em>quantity </em>of water for a beneficial use ....\u201d Section 85-2-102(1), MCA (emphasis added). An appropriation refers to the amount of water one has the legal right to use as determined through the process sanctioned by the Act. \u201cCombined\u201d means \u201cto bring into such close relationship as to obscure individual characters,\u201d to \u201cmerge,\u201d \u201cintermix,\u201d \u201cblend,\u201d or \u201cunite into a single number or expression.\u201d Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 228 (10th ed. 1993). In \u00a7 85-2-306 (3)(a)(iii), MCA, \u201ccombined\u201d is used as an adjective to modify the noun \u201cappropriation\u201d and therefore refers to the <em>combined quantity </em>of water which an appropriator has the legal right to use. The word \u201ccombined\u201d does not precede \u201cwells\u201d or \u201cdeveloped springs\u201d and therefore does not modify either form of ground development in a manner which would indicate a \u201ccombined well\u201d or \u201ccombined developed spring,\u201d as Well Drillers contend. \u201cIn ascertaining plain meaning, we have \u2018long adhered to ordinary rules of grammar.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bates v. Neva, </em>2014 MT 336, \u00b6 15, 377 Mont. 350, 339 P.3d 1265 <em>(quoting Thompson v. J.C. Billion, Inc., </em>2013 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>MT 20, \u00b6 22 n. 5, 368 Mont. 299, 294 P.3d 397). <em>See also Jay v. Sch. Dist. No. 1 of Cascade Cnty., </em>24 Mont. 219, 225, 61 P. 250, 252 (1900)). Consistent with these common sense meanings and statutory definitions, \u00a7 85-2-306(3)(a)(iii), MCA, provides that a \u201ccombined appropriation\u201d may not exceed the <em>combined quantity </em>of 10 acre-feet per year, when there is more than one well or developed spring. Indeed, the very statutory definitions of \u201cwell,\u201d defined in \u00a7 85-2-102(31), MCA, as \u201can artificial opening dr excavation in the ground...,\u201d and \u201cdeveloped spring,\u201d defined in \u00a7 85-2-102(11), MCA, as \u201cany point where ground water emerges naturally, that has subsequently been physically altered, and from which ground water flows under natural pressures oris artificially withdrawn,\u201d suggest two or more distinct and unconnected things. We accordingly reject the Well Drillers\u2019 interpretation that \u201ccombined\u201d modifies wells or developed springs; combined modifies appropriation, which speaks specifically to the <em>quantity </em>of water which may be withdrawn for a beneficial use.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">\u00b624  Based upon the plain language of the statute, it is evident that the intent of the Legislature in enacting subsection (3)(a)(iii) was to ensure that, when appropriating from the same source, only a de minimus <em>quantity </em>of water, determined by the Legislature to be 10 acre-feet per year, could be lawfully appropriated without going through the rigors of the permitting process. An exception to the exemption for quantities exceeding 10 acre feet per year, regardless of flow rate and number of wells or developed springs utilized for the appropriation, protects other water rights utilizing the same water source. This is consistent with the purpose of the Act as a remedial statute designed to strictly adhere to the prior appropriation doctrine and to provide for the \u201cadministration, control, and regulation of water rights ... and confirm all existing water rights ....\u201d Section 85-2-101(2)(4), MCA. We have explained that \u201cthe Water Use Act was designed to protect senior water rights holders from encroachment by junior appropriators adversely affecting those senior rights.\u201d <em>Mont. Power Co. v. Carey, </em>211 Mont. 91, 98, 685 P.2d 336, 340 (1984). This fundamental purpose is reflected throughout the Act and many of the subsections of the Act begin with a policy declaration stating that the protection of senior water rights and the prior appropriation doctrine is the Act\u2019s core purpose. <em>See, e.g., </em>\u00a7 85-1-101(4), MCA (the Act\u2019s purpose is to \u201cprotect existing uses\u201d); \u00a7 85-2-101(4), MCA (it is \u201ca purpose of this chapter to recognize and confirm all existing rights\u201d); \u00a7 85-2-101(4), MCA (the purpose of permitting is to \u201cprovide enforceable legal protection for existing rights\u201d). Accordingly, based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>upon the plain language of the statute and the stated purpose of the Act, we conclude that \u201ccombined appropriation\u201d refers to the total amount or maximum quantity of water that may be appropriated without a permit and not to the manner in which wells or developed springs may be physically connected.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">\u00b625 Although we have interpreted the plain language of \u00a7 85-2-306(3)(a)(iii), MCA, what remains to be addressed is the validity of the 1993 rule in light of the statute\u2019s plain meaning. When adopting a rule, the agency must comply with the requisites for rule validity codified in \u00a7 2-4-305(6), MCA, of the Montana Administrative Procedure Act. This section provides that \u201c[wjhenever by ... statute a state agency has authority to adopt rules[,]... a rule is not valid or effective unless it is: (a) consistent and not in conflict with the statute; and (b) reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the statute.\u201d Section 2-4-305(6), MCA. In interpreting the statute, we have stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-6\">The courts have uniformly held that administrative regulations are \u201cout ofharmony\u201d with legislative guidelines if they (1) \u201cengraft additional and contradictory requirements on the statute\u201d (citations omitted); or (2) if they engraft additional, noncontradictory requirements on the statute which were not envisioned by the legislature, (citations omitted in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AbX\"><em>Board of Barbers v. Big Sky College, </em>192 Mont. 159, 161, 626 P.2d 1269, 1270 (1981) (citation omitted). We have also held that \u201c[r]ules adopted by administrative agencies which conflict with statutory requirements or exceed authority provided by statute, are invalid.\u201d <em>Haney v. Mahoney, </em>2001 MT 201, \u00b6 6, 306 Mont. 288, 32 P.3d 1254 (internal quotations omitted). <em>See also State ex rel. Swart v. Casne, </em>172 Mont. 302, 564 P.2d 983 (1977) (holding agency rules void because a statute cannot be changed by administrative regulations), overruled on other grounds, <em>Trs. of Ind. Univ. v. Buxbaum, </em>2003 MT 97, 315 Mont. 210, 69 P.3d 663. With these principles in mind, we must decide whether the 1993 rule defining the term \u201ccombined appropriation\u201d is inconsistent with \u00a7 85-2-306(3)(a)(iii), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">\u00b626 The 1993 rule defined \u201ccombined appropriation\u201d as requiring that \u201cthe ground water developments\u201d be \u201cphysically manifold into the same system.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> First, there is no language anywhere in the Act which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>suggests that wells or developed springs must be physically manifold or connected in order to be deemed a \u201ccombined appropriation.\u201d We therefore conclude, without any difficulty, that the 1993 rule engrafted an additional requirement on the statute and must be deemed invalid if: (1) it is contradictory or inconsistent with the statute, or (2) adds a requirement not envisioned by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">\u00b627 As the District Court correctly observed, the 1993 rule allows an unlimited quantity of water to be appropriated from the same source as long as the ground water developments are not physically manifold or connected. The 1993 rule, therefore, unquestionably expands the exemption by limiting the number of appropriations which must be excepted, rendering meaningless the underlying limit on volume or quantity of 10 acre-feet per year from the same source. That portion of \u00a7 85-2-306(3)(a)(iii), MCA, allowing for an exemption \u2014 a well or developed spring appropriating no more than 35 gallons per minute and 10 acre-feet per year \u2014 has no qualifying language relating to the same source. However, the exception to the exemption does; that is, regardless of flow rate and the number of wells or developed springs no combined quantity of water may exceed 10 acre-feet when it is from the same source. The 1993 rule directly contradicts this plain language by adding a connectivity requirement to the wells or developed springs, effectively swallowing up the underlying exception that the Legislature created.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">\u00b628  We conclude that the 1993 rule was inconsistent with the plain language of \u00a7 85-2-306(3)(a)(iii), MCA, and that it engrafted an additional requirement on the exempt well statute that wells or developed springs be \u201cphysically manifold into the same system.\u201d By narrowing the exception to only those wells or developed springs physically connected, the 1993 rule expanded the narrow exemption to the permitting process provided by \u00a7 85-2-306(3)(a)(iii), MCA, and was inconsistent with the stated statutory purpose of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">\u00b629 As a final matter, we think, in light of the several statutory amendments to \u00a7 85-2-306, MCA, it important to address a remaining argument of Well Drillers in relation to the validity of the 1993 rule. Well Drillers argue that the Legislature abrogated the former meaning of \u201ccombined appropriation\u201d when it imposed a volume limitation and lowered the flow rate in 1991 and added subsection (3)(a)(iv) to \u00a7 85-2-306, MCA, in 2013. Citing <em>Grenz v. Mont. Dept. of Natural Res. &amp; Conservation </em>, 2011 MT 17, 359 Mont. 154, 248 P.3d 785, Well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>Drillers maintain that the 1993 rule represents a long-standing rule that has withstood numerous amendments and that this Court presumes the Legislature acts with knowledge of the prior construction of related rules and to have adopted that construction when amending statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">\u00b630 Preliminarily, we note that throughout the amendments, the text of the relevant clause of the statute has remained as originally enacted in 1987 continuing to its final amendment in 2013. Further, Well Drillers acknowledge that the Legislature could not have intended the term \u201ccombined appropriation\u201d to denote physical connectivity when it added the term into the 1987 statute given the legislative debate surrounding incorporation of the term into the statute, that the statute did not contain a volume limitation, and the DNRC\u2019s immediate promulgation of the 1987 rule expressly stating that physical connectivity was not required. As the relevant text of the statute has remained unchanged, our conclusion that its plain language does not require physical connectivity applies for each statutory amendment. This conclusion remains valid even in light of the additional text and subsections to the statute made in 1993 and 2013. Nonetheless, Well Drillers argue legislative intent and <em>Grenz </em>support their interpretation that the statutory amendments incorporated the 1993 rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">\u00b631 The Well Drillers\u2019 position ignores a common canon of statutory construction that \u201c[w]ords and provisions used in the original act or section are presumed to be used in the same sense in the amendment.\u201d 1A Norman J. Singer, <em>Sutherland\u2019s Statutes and Statutory Construction, </em>\u00a7 22:33 (6th ed. 2002). And, in accordance therewith, courts \u201cconstrue words in a new statute that are identical to words in a prior statute as having the same meaning.\u201d <em>Bakersfield Energy Partners, LP v. Comm\u2019r, </em>568 F.3d 767, 775 (9th Cir. 2009). Pursuant to \u00a7 1-2-203, MCA, where \u201ca part of a statute is amended, it is not to be considered as having been repealed and reenacted in the amended form, but the portions which are not altered are to be considered as having been the law from the time when they were enacted.\u201d Consistent with these principles, where a section of a statute has been amended but certain words have been left unchanged, we must accord the untouched provisions the meaning they had when they were originally incorporated into the statute. <em>See State ex rel. Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. v. District Court, </em>115 Mont. 521, 527, 146 P.2d 1012, 1014 (1944) (explaining that where the Legislature amended the statute but left in place the word \u201creturned,\u201d it cannot be explained by new matter added years later, but rather must be interpreted as originally <em>understood); Northern Pacific Railway v. Dunham, </em>108 Mont. 338, 346, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>90 P.2d 506, 510 (1939), (explaining that \u201c[b]y retaining the [particular] clause [in a statute] without any change, we must assume that the legislature intended that the words should be given the same meaning as they had at the time of the passage of [the original act].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Akq\">\u00b632 The parties do not dispute that when the term \u201ccombined appropriation\u201d was first utilized by the Legislature it did not have the meaning the Well Drillers attach to it. Section 85-2-306(1), MCA (1987), provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-4\">a combined appropriation from the same source from two or more wells or developed springs exceeding [100 gpm] requires a permit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARq\">The 1991 amended statute, \u00a7 85-2-306(3)(a)(iii), MCA (1991), provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AyST\">a combined appropriation from the same source by two or more wells or developed springs exceeding [10 acre-feet] requires a permit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Finally, the 2013 amended statute, \u00a7 85-2-306(3)(a)(iii), MCA (2013), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-6\">(iii) when the appropriation is outside a stream depletion zone, is 35 gallons a minute or less, and does not exceed 10 acre-feet a year, except that a combined appropriation from the same source by two or more wells or developed springs exceeding 10 acre-feet, regardless of the flow rate, requires a permit; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-7\">(iv) when the appropriation is within a stream depletion zone, is 20 gallons a minute or less, and does not exceed 2 acre-feet a year, except that a combined appropriation from the same source by two or more wells or developed springs exceeding this limitation requires a permit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">\u00b633 The Legislature retains power to abrogate an existing statutory interpretation. <em>See Langemo v. Mont. Rail Link, Inc., </em>2001 MT 273, \u00b6 24, 307 Mont. 293, 38 P.3d 782. However, there is no indication that the Legislature intended to do so here. By leaving the term \u201ccombined appropriation\u201d untouched, its original meaning was preserved. If the Legislature wished to abrogate that meaning, \u201cit would have employed definite language in doing so, rather than to adopt the circuitous method suggested [by the Well Drillers] here.\u201d <em>Dunham, </em>108 Mont. at 346,90 P.2d at 510. The term \u201ccombined appropriation\u201d utilized in the original 1987 statute has remained intact and unchanged in the subsequent statutory amendments of 1991 and 2013. When the 1987 Legislature incorporated the disputed language into the statute, the 1991 Legislature adopted the former Legislature\u2019s original meaning by leaving the language in place.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">\u00b634 Finally, <em>Grenz </em>does not support the Well Drillers\u2019 argument. In <em>Grenz, </em>we adopted the agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute and, in doing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>so, followed a well-known canon of statutory construction that provides that when the Legislature amends a statute we generally presume that it acts with knowledge of existing administrative rules interpreting the statute and adopts the agency\u2019s interpretation. <em>Grenz, </em>\u00b6 41. Here, however, when the Legislature substantively amended \u00a7 85-2-306, MCA, in 1991, the then applicable administrative rule was the 1987 rule, which did not require physical connection between groundwater developments. Thus, following the above-referenced canon of construction used in <em>Grenz </em>\u2014 that the Legislature adopts an existing agency interpretation when it amends a statute \u2014 counsels against the Well Drillers\u2019 interpretation of the statute, not in favor of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">\u00b635  We reject Well Drillers\u2019 argument that amendments to \u00a7 85-2-306, MCA, incorporated the 1993 rule. Such an argument is inconsistent with the plain language of the statute, the relevant portion of which has remained unchanged since 1987, and is likewise an incorrect application of \u00a7 1-2-203, MCA, and <em>Grenz. </em>The 1993 rule is invalid because it conflicts with the plain language of \u00a7 85-2-306, MCA, and because the Legislature, as is its prerogative, has not abrogated the original meaning it placed on \u201ccombined appropriation\u201d since the legislature first incorporated the term in 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">\u00b636 <em>2. Whether the District Court erred by reinstating Admin. R. M. 36.12.101(7) (1987).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">\u00b637 The Well Drillers argue that the District Court erred by reinstating the 1987 rule after invaliding the 1993 rule, reasoning that the court lacked authority to reinstate the former rule. The Coalition counters that the proper course for the District Court was to reinstate the 1987 rule after invaliding the 1993 rule, reasoning that when an administrative rule is invalidated the effect should be, by default, to reinstate the former rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">\u00b638 The issue of whether a former agency rule is reinstated by the invalidation of the current rule is a question of first impression for this Court. Federal law provides guidance on the subject. Under federal case law, the \u201ceffect of invalidating an agency rule is to reinstate the rule previously in force.\u201d <em>Paulsen v. Daniels, </em>413 F.3d 999, 1008 (9th Cir. 2005). Although the federal Administrative Procedure Act does not expressly state that the prior rule is reinstated, the \u201ccommon rationale\u201d for doing so is \u201cthat the current rule being invalid from its inception, the prior regulation is reinstated until validly rescinded or replaced.\u201d <em>Cumberland Med. Ctr. v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Services, </em>781 F.2d 536, 538 (6th Cir. 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">\u00b639 We find this reasoning persuasive. Like the federal Administrative Procedure Act, the Montana Administrative Procedure Act is silent in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>regard to the effect of the invalidation of the current rule on the former administrative rule. It serves to reason, however, that when a court invalidates the current rule, the effect is to return to the previous status of the law, which necessarily means in most instances that the former rule is reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">\u00b640 We follow this same reasoning in the context of invalidated statutes. We have explained that an invalidated statute \u201cis in reality no law, but is wholly void, and in legal contemplation is as inoperative as if it has never been passed.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Woodahl v. District Court, </em>162 Mont. 283, 290, 511 P.2d 318, 322 (1973). The \u201cnatural effect of this rule is that the invalidity of a statute leaves the law as it stood prior to the enactment of the invalid statute.\u201d <em>Woodahl, </em>162 Mont. at 291, 511 P.2d at 322. Thus, under Montana law, when an amended statute is invalidated the statute is left in the same position that it was in before the amendment was introduced. <em>In re O\u2019Sullivan, </em>117 Mont. 295, 304, 158 P.2d 306, 310 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">\u00b641  We see nothing in the Montana Administrative Procedure Act that would argue against adopting the federal approach and the approach we utilize in the context of invalidated statutes. Therefore, we now hold that where, as here, a court invalidates an administrative rule that has been invalid since its inception, the default remedy is to reinstate the former administrative rule. Accordingly, the District Court did not err by reinstating the 1987 rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">\u00b642 <em>3. Whether the District Court erred by directing the DNRC to institute rulemaking consistent with the court\u2019s order.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">\u00b643 The Well Drillers take issue with the portion of the District Court\u2019s order requiring that the DNRC conduct further rule making \u201cconsistent\u201d with the court\u2019s order. Well Drillers argue that the court lacked authority to order that such rulemaking be \u201cconsistent\u201d with its order because, in doing so, the court was directing the outcome of the rulemaking process.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">\u00b644 We disagree with the Well Drillers that the District Court erred by requiring that any further rulemaking be done consistent with the court\u2019s order. The District Courtis vested with judicial authority as set forth in Article VII, Section I of the Montana Constitution. That authority includes not only the power \u201cto say what the law is,\u201d <em>Marbury v. Madison, </em>5 U.S. 137, 177 (1803), but also the power \u201cto make binding orders or judgments.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Bennett v. Bonner, </em>123 Mont. 414, 425, 214 P.2d 747, 753 (1950). The court must have authority to \u201cpronounce a judgment and carry it into effect between persons and parties who bring a case before it for decision.\u201d <em>Shea v. N.-Butte Mining Co., </em>55 Mont. 522, 537, 179 P. 499, 504 (1919).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>\u00b645  Although, the District Court did not err by requiring that a rule promulgated by the DNRC must be consistent with its order, it is the responsibility of the administrative agency to \u201cadopt rules necessary to implement and carry out the purposes of this chapter.\u201d Section 85-2-113(2), MCA. Such authority includes whether, in the judgment of the DNRC, a rule other than the reinstated 1987 rule should be implemented. Accordingly, we reverse and remand to the District Court for the limited purpose of removing its mandate to the DNRC to initiate rulemaking. It is up to the DNRC to determine whether initiating rulemaking to change the reinstated 1987 rule is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">\u00b646 For the reasons stated, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed, with the exception of the requirement that the DNRC initiate rulemaking. The 1987 rule is reinstated until further action implementing a new rule is initiated by the DNRC.</p>\n<judges id=\"b546-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, BAKER, WHEAT and SHEA concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b532-14\"> The DNRC has chosen not to appeal the District Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b540-8\"> No public hearing on this rule change adding a physical connectivity requirement was held and no public comments were received. The DNRC similarly did not provide a statement as to why the change from the 1987 rule was necessary as the DNRC was required to do pursuant to \u00a7 2-4-305, MCA. The DNRC responded to an inquiry by the Administrative Rules Committee that the 1987 definition of \u201ccombined appropriation\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>was \u201ctoo ambiguous and therefore difficult to administer.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b546-7\">JUSTICE RICE,</author>\n<p id=\"AgG\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">\u00b647 Every judicial officer who has considered the subject statute has recognized the ambiguity inherent in the Legislature\u2019s employment of the term \u201ccombined appropriation\u201d in this context. Addressing the ambiguity, the District Court considered legislative history, purposes of the iterations of the statute, water law commentaries, and the administrative record. The DNRC Hearing Examiner did the same and upheld the challenged administrative rule, concluding that \u201cthe most common definition [] of \u2018combined\u2019 is physically joined together. Therefore, the \u2018physically manifold\u2019 requirement under the administrative rule is not inconsistent or in conflict with the plain language of the statute, and certainly not plainly and palpably inconsistent with the statutory language.\u201d These analyses turned to interpretational guides because \u201c[w]hen the legislative intent cannot be <em>readily derived </em>from the plain language, we review the legislative history and abide by the intentions reflected therein.\u201d <em>Montanans for Justice v. State, </em>2006 MT 277, \u00b6 60, 334 Mont. 237, 146 P.3d 759 (emphasis added). Everyone who has considered the statute \u2014 except the Court \u2014 has agreed: the subject statute is not clear and legislative intent cannot be \u201creadily derived.\u201d However, the Court sweeps away the messy business of considering and analyzing the legislative record and history, preferring instead to employ the <em>ipse dixit </em>canon of statutory construction: the statute is absolutely clear on its face because we say so.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>\u00b648 Perhaps the reason for this is found in \u00b6 13 of the Opinion. While this case is about the validity of an administrative rule, the Court is alarmed about the policy ramifications of the rule: that exempt appropriations \u201chave grown steadily\u201d and are \u201cconsuming significant amounts of water\u201d; that it is anticipated that \u201cappropriations will continue to grow rapidly\u201d; that exempt appropriations will be added in \u201calready over-appropriated basins\u201d; that there are concerns that the \u201ccumulative effects of these exempt appropriations are having a significant impact\u201d on groundwater and surface flow levels; and that these appropriations \u201cmay be harming senior water users\u2019 existing rights.\u201d While it is always tempting to act decisively in response to a perceived policy problem, and to legislate a solution, legislating is neither our duty nor our prerogative. By deciding to solve the problem by simply declaring that the statute is unambiguous, and thus avoid the trouble of considering the troublesome history, the Court is holding that the DNRC inexplicably misinterpreted and misapplied a clear statute for the past 23 years, despite the fact the agency undertook rulemaking in 1993 for the very purpose of more accurately applying the statute and removing ambiguity in the former rule. Nobody has argued or even hinted at such a proposition, because nobody believes it.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">\u00b649 The Well Drillers argue that \u201ccombined appropriation\u201d plainly denotes a \u201cphysical connection\u201d between two or more groundwater developments. The Coalition counters that \u201ccombined appropriation\u201d clearly refers to groundwater developments that are used together for a \u201csingle beneficial use.\u201d The statute simply does not explain what level of commonality between two or more groundwater developments is required before water withdrawn from the developments can fairly be said to be in \u201ca state of unity\u201d \u2014 as the word \u201ccombined\u201d is defined in <em>The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language </em>368 (Joseph P. Pickett ed., 5th ed. 2011) \u2014 for purposes of the statute. The term \u201ccombined appropriation\u201d could reasonably be understood, as the Well Drillers argue, to signify physical unity. Likewise, the term could reasonably be understood, as the Coalition argues, to signify only unity of use.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">\u00b650 Accepting the reality that the statute is ambiguous, I would decide the case by employing the applicable canons of statutory construction. In the context of an ambiguous statute that has been subject to a longstanding interpretation by administrative rule, we apply the canon of deference to the agency\u2019s interpretation. <em>Mont. Trout Unlimited v. Mont. Dep\u2019t of Natural Res. &amp; Conservation, </em>2006 MT 72, \u00b6 37, 331 Mont. 483, 133 P.3d 224. \u201c[I]t is a well-accepted rule of statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>construction that the long and continued contemporaneous and practical interpretation of a statute by the executive officers charged with its administration and enforcement constitutes an invaluable aid in determining the meaning of a doubtful statute.\u201d <em>Mont.

The canon of deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation, rising to one of \u201cgreat importance\u201d when the interpretation is longstanding, yields only upon \u201ccompelling indications\u201d that the construction is wrong. <em>Mont. Power Co., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 23-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">\u00b652 Whether an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute is \u201clongstanding\u201d is not subject to a bright line test, but this case does not present a close call. The 1993 administrative rule has been the law for 23 years now, which is more than sufficient time to be considered \u201ca long and continued course of consistent interpretation.\u201d <em>Mont. Power Co., </em>\u00b6 25. For the same reason that a one-year-old administrative rule is clearly not \u201clongstanding,\u201d <em>Mont. Trout Unlimited, </em>\u00b6 38, a two-c?ecade-old administrative rule clearly is. Thus, unless there are \u201ccompelling indications\u201d that DNRC\u2019s interpretation of the subj ect statute is wrong, the Court should defer to DNRC\u2019s interpretation of \u201ccombined appropriation.\u201d <em>Mont. Power Co., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 23, 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">\u00b653 The genesis of this dispute is the agency\u2019s 1993 rulemaking, which, as explained by the Hearing Examiner, was undertaken to more concisely define the statutory term \u201ccombined appropriation,\u201d and to remove ambiguity from the previous rule that rendered the statute \u201cdifficult to administer.\u201d In the many years that followed, review of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>1993 rule was undertaken by legislative committees, but no objection was made and no action was taken to alter the rule. This inaction corresponds to the purpose of the canon of construction mentioned above: the Legislature can act at any time it believes a rule is improper. Here, minor amendments were made to the statute over the years, but those did not involve the use of the term \u201ccombined appropriation.\u201d However, that changed in 2013, when the Legislature revisited the term.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">\u00b654 Senate Bill 19, discussed below, and Senate Bill 346 were passed during the 2013 Legislative Session. Senate Bill 346 was entitled \u201cAn Act Generally Revising Water Laws Related to Ground Water Appropriations Exempt From Permitting.\u201d 2013 Mont. Laws 1796. Prior to the passage of Senate Bill 346, the relevant portion of the statute provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-5\">(3)(a)(i) Except as provided in subsection (3)(a)(ii), outside the boundaries of a controlled ground water area, a permit is not required before appropriating ground water by means of a well or developed spring:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-6\">(A) with a maximum appropriation of 35 gallons a minute or less, not to exceed 10 acre-feet a year, except that a combined appropriation from the same source from two or more wells or developed springs exceeding this limitation requires a permit;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ay6\">Section 85-2-306(3)(a)(i)(A), MCA (2011).

Laws at 1799-800.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-16\">\u00b655 As part of its expressed intention to generally revise ground water appropriation laws, the 2013 Legislature expanded the use and purpose of the term, \u201ccombined appropriation.\u201d Whereas the term was used only once in pre-2013 law, the term was further employed in entirely new subsections that incorporated the concept of \u201cstream depletion zones.\u201d As argued by the Well Drillers, \u201cwith the creation of \u00a7 85-2-306(3)(a)(iv), MCA, in 2013 and the inclusion of \u2018combined appropriation\u2019 language, it can very well be presumed that pursuant to <em>Grenz </em>[v. <em>Mont. Dep\u2019t of Natural Res. &amp; Conservation, </em>2011 MT 17, \u00b6 41, 359 Mont. 154, 248 P.3d 785], the legislative intent included the use of the 1993 Rule\u2019s definition of the exempt well statute.\u201d This is correct: when the 2013 Legislature generally revised the statute, the applicable administrative rule was the agency\u2019s longstanding 1993 rule, which did not require physical connection between groundwater developments. By then, the 1993 rule had been in place for 20 years, and in accordance with the applicable canon of construction, \u201ca <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>particular meaning [had] been ascribed to [the] statute by an agency through a long and continued course of consistent interpretation, resulting in an identifiable reliance.\u201d <em>Mont. Power Co., </em>\u00b6 25. Thus, the 2013 Legislature, proceeding upon that \u201cidentifiable reliance,\u201d affirmatively employed the longstanding, 20-year agency interpretation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">\u00b656 The Court cites \u00a7 1-2-203, MCA, which provides that when a statute is amended, \u201cthe portions which are not altered are to be considered as having been the law from the time they were enacted, and the new provisions are to be considered as having been enacted at the time of the amendment.\u201d The Court concludes that the 2013 general revision to the statute is an amendment that contains no \u201cnew\u201d provisions. However, I would conclude Senate Bill 346\u2019s title, new language, and new structure demonstrate that, more than a mere amendment, a general revision was intended and enacted that incorporated the longstanding agency interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">\u00b657 Canons of construction can be contradictory, and the particular canon that governs the interpretation of a given statute depends on the context. <em>See, e.g., State v. Liefert, </em>2002 MT 48, \u00b6 26, 309 Mont. 19, 43 P.3d 329 (ambiguous criminal statutes to be interpreted in favor of <em>defendant); Eisenmenger v. Ethicon, Inc., </em>264 Mont. 393, 400, 871 P.2d 1313, 1317 (1994) (ambiguous statute of limitations to be interpreted to allow the longer period in which to prosecute the action); <em>Mont. Bankers Ass\u2019n v. Mont. Dep\u2019t of Revenue, </em>177 Mont. 112, 117, 580 P.2d 909, 912 (1978) (ambiguous tax statutes granting exemptions and deductions strictly construed against taxpayer); <em>see also Chickasaw Nation v. United States, </em>534 U.S. 84, 93-94, 122 S. Ct. 528, 535 (2001) (ambiguous statutes construed in favor of Indian nations). Here, the longstanding agency interpretation, followed by the confirming legislative history, shows that the canon of deference should be applied. \u00b658 Although not necessary to the proper conclusion, the passage of Senate Bill 19 by the 2013 Legislature adds further impetus to accurately determining legislative intent. I find it significant that a bill was passed by both houses contemporaneously with the passage of Senate Bill 346, further defining the term at issue. The Court states the 2013 Legislature would have no reason to pass Senate Bill 19 if it had intended to adopt the 1993 rule within Senate Bill 346, because it would be redundant. However, the Legislature often uses multiple bills in a single session to deal with any given issue, and given that this litigation was pending, the 2013 Legislature\u2019s double-knotting of the issue makes perfect sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>\u00b659 For the Court to insist that the 1991 Legislature\u2019s meaning of the term \u201ccombined appropriation\u201d must be reinstated, regardless what occurred in the intervening years, restricts the power of the Legislature to subsequently amend the term, and grants a monopoly to the 1991 Legislature on this issue. This violates not only the canons of construction, but separation of powers. Further, legislative bodies cannot bind future legislative bodies in this way. <em>Ohio Life Ins. &amp; Trust Co. v. Debolt, </em>57 U.S. (16 How.) 416, 431, 14 L. Ed. 997, 1003 (1854) (\u201c[N]o one legislature can, by its own act, disarm their successors of any of the powers or rights of sovereignty confided by the people to the legislative body, unless they are authorized to do so by the constitution under which they are elected.\u201d); <em>Newton v. Comm\u2019rs, </em>100 U.S. 548, 559, 25 L. Ed. 710, 711 (1879).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">\u00b660 It is really not difficult to determine what the Legislature intends here, even if it is difficult for the Court to accept. The DNRC\u2019s two-decade-old administrative rule is a longstanding interpretation of a statute that is of \u201cgreat importance\u201d and should be given deference absent \u201ccompelling indications\u201d that the interpretation is wrong. Because the 2013 Legislature clearly used the 1993 rule\u2019s definition of \u201ccombined appropriation\u201d when it revised the statute in 2013, there are no compelling indications the 1993 rule is wrong. Indeed, the 1993 rule has been affirmed by the Legislature. Under that rule, many permits have been issued over the past 23 years. Given the ambiguity in the statute and the DNRC\u2019s longstanding interpretation, this Court generally defers to the agency. I would do so, and reverse.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b549-13\"> Section 5-11-205(2), MCA, provides that new parts of existing statutes are to be printed in a session law as italics, and deleted provisions are to be shown as stricken.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
