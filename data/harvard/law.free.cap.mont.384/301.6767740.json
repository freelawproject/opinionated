We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-11\">\n<em>1. Whether the District Court erred by denying Farmers\u2019 motion for judgment as a matter of law because Goldan failed to meet his burden of proving damages for loss of net profits;</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-12\">\n<em>2.

At that time, Farmers and Goldan entered into a standardized Agency Appointment Agreement (Agreement), which defined the parties\u2019 various rights and obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>\u00b64 Under the Agreement, Farmers was obligated to pay Goldan new business and service commissions on each policy he sold and serviced in accordance with Farmers\u2019 commission schedules. In return, Goldan was obligated to provide the facilities necessary to service policyholders and to service policyholders so as to advance their interests and those of Goldan and Farmers. The Agreement could be terminated in three ways: (1) on three months written notice for any reason; (2) on thirty days written notice if any provisions of the Agreement were breached; or (3) immediately for specified causes, including switching insureds to another carrier. If the Agreement was terminated, Farmers was obligated to pay \u201ccontract value\u201d to Goldan.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">\u00b65 Over his 21 years with Farmers, Goldan became a successful agent. In the five years immediately preceding his termination, he averaged over $150,000 per year in commission income. Goldan was considered a \u201ccareer\u201d agent by Farmers, and he planned to continue with Farmers for the rest of his career. For its part, Farmers agreed it almost never terminated an experienced agent without a reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">\u00b66 Goldan\u2019s wife, Linda, assisted him with his business and she eventually became a Farmers\u2019 customer service representative. In the early 2000s, Linda started the Bozeman Independent Insurance Agency (Independent Agency) to sell insurance policies that Farmers did not offer. Goldan and the Independent Agency shared office space and other resources. Farmers\u2019 district manager approved the arrangement and Farmers\u2019 audited the operation to make sure Goldan was complying with the Agreement. Goldan and Linda eventually formed Goldan Agency, Inc., for tax purposes on the advice of their accountant. Goldan Agency did not sell insurance; rather, Goldan and Linda would deposit their respective commissions into a jointly owned account held by Goldan Agency and Goldan Agency would pay the various expenses of both Goldan and the Independent Agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">\u00b67 In December 2009, Farmers terminated the Agreement immediately, alleging that Goldan was switching policies from Farmers to the Independent Agency\u2019s insurance carriers. Pursuant to the Agreement, Farmers paid Goldan the first installment of contract value it owed him. Prior to paying the second installment of contract value in June 2010, Farmers sued Goldan alleging that Goldan breached his contractual duties and fiduciary responsibilities under the Agreement by soliciting and servicing the insurance business of policyholders within a year of his termination. Farmers sought damages and declaratory relief for the partial contract value it paid Goldan. Goldan counterclaimed for breach of contract, alleging that Farmers terminated him without cause and seeking the remainder of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>the contract value and other damages for sums he \u201creasonably anticipated receiving as an agent for\u201d Farmers.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">\u00b68 During pretrial litigation, Farmers moved to compel Goldan\u2019s response to requests for production of financial information. After briefing by the parties and a hearing, the District Court ordered Goldan to produce financial records of Goldan Agency along -with his and Linda\u2019s personal tax returns, which he did. In addition, Farmers filed a number of motions in limine regarding the calculation of damages. Farmers moved to bar admission of any evidence relating to gross commissions, arguing that the measure of damages required evidence of Goldan\u2019s expenses in order to calculate net lost profits, and seeking to limit Goldan\u2019s proof to those damages suffered during the three month notice period specified in the Agreement for terminations without cause. The District Court denied both motions reasoning that evidence of gross commissions is relevant to calculating damages, the question of Goldan\u2019s expenses could be subject to cross-examination, and that limiting damages to the three month notice provision as a matter of law would be improper because calculating the amount of damages is a question of fact for the jury to determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">\u00b69 A three-day trial was held in April 2015. At the close of evidence, Farmers moved for judgment as a matter of law and to strike Goldan\u2019s damage claims because he had not presented evidence of his expenses. The District Court noted that Farmers chose not to ask Goldan or Linda questions regarding expenses during trial and denied the motion reasoning that \u201cthe jury will be able to evaluate\u201d the expenses argument. The jury ruled in favor of Goldan on all issues. It determined that Goldan had not breached the Agreement before or after Farmers\u2019 terminated him. It determined further that Farmers had breached the Agreement by terminating Goldan and awarded him $759,740.45 \u2014 which amounted to five years of the yearly average commissions Goldan had earned over the three years preceding his termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">\u00b610 Farmers moved post-trial for judgment as a matter of law on the same questions on which it had sought judgment preverdict and in its motions in limine. In the alternative, Farmers sought dispositive sanctions as to Goldan\u2019s damages projections because he had not produced documents showing his expenses. The District Court denied the motion on the ground that Farmers had presented \u201cno new legal theories in support of the Motion, but simply request the Court to reverse its prior rulings based on arguments already made.\u201d The District Court entered judgment in Goldan\u2019s favor, which included the $759,740.45jury award with post-judgment interest and $69,422.41 for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>the remaining contract value Farmers owed Goldan, plus $32,248.14 in prejudgment interest. Farmers paid the judgment\u2019s contract value portion in partial satisfaction of the judgment and appeals from the jury\u2019s damage award and judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">\u00b611 'Whether judgment as a matter of law should be granted or denied is a question of law that we review de novo. <em>Johnson v. Costco Wholesale, </em>2007 MT 43, \u00b6 18, 336 Mont. 105, 152 P.3d 727. Judgment as a matter of law may be granted only when there is a complete absence of any evidence which would justify submitting an issue to a jury. All such evidence and any legitimate inferences that might be drawn from the evidence must be considered in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 13. Courts should exercise the greatest self-restraint in interfering with the constitutionally mandated processes of a jury decision; therefore, judgment as a matter of law is not proper if reasonable persons could differ regarding conclusions that could be drawn from the evidence. <em>Johnson, </em>f 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">f 12 We review a district court\u2019s ruling on a request for discovery sanctions for an abuse of discretion. <em>Peterman v. Herbalife Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>2010 MT 142, \u00b6 14, 356 Mont. 542, 234 P.3d 898. A district court abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily, without the employment of conscientious judgment, or exceeds the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice. <em>Menholt v. Dep\u2019t of Revenue, </em>2009 MT 38, \u00b6 6,349 Mont. 239, 203 P.3d 792. The construction and interpretation of a contract is a question of law that we review for correctness. <em>Fenwick v. State, </em>2016 MT 80, \u00b6 11, 383 Mont. 151, 369 P.3d 1011.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">\u00b613 <em>Whether the District Court erred by denying Farmers\u2019 motion for judgment as a matter of law because Goldan failed to meet his burden of proving damages for loss of net profits.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">\u00b614 Farmers asserts that breach of contract damages are limited to net profits, not gross income, and that Goldan\u2019s claim for lost commissions amounts to a claim for gross income because it did not account for Goldan\u2019s expenses. Farmers contends that it was Goldan\u2019s burden to establish his net profits and that he did not meet this burden because he presented no evidence demonstrating his expenses. Farmers argues that the record establishes that Goldan had expenses in the five years since his termination. Furthermore, Farmers claims, Goldan was required to incur expenses under the Agreement because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>he was obligated to provide the facilities necessary to service policyholders. By not establishing his expenses, and therefore not establishing his net profits, Farmers claims that the jury\u2019s damage award puts Goldan in a better position than he would have occupied had there been no breach \u2014 a result that is contrary to Montana law. \u00b615 Farmers next asserts that Goldan\u2019s argument that he was entitled to recover commissions without incurring expenses is unsupported because in the three years prior to his termination \u2014 which were the three years upon which his average commissions figure was based \u2014 Goldan\u2019s commissions steadily decreased. As such, Farmers claims, Goldan would have had to sell more policies in order to reach the three year average commissions figure, which would have required Goldan to have operating expenses. Finally, Farmers contends that Goldan\u2019s average commissions figure is speculative because Goldan offered no evidence that his pre-termination commissions would have remained the same had he not been terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">\u00b616 Goldan counters by asserting that there was substantial credible evidence supporting the jury\u2019s damage award. Goldan argues that his proposed average commissions figure represented net commissions because Farmers would deduct Goldan\u2019s expenses from his gross commissions <em>prior to </em>depositing the commissions into Goldan\u2019s account. Goldan would then put his net commissions into the Goldan Agency account, and Goldan Agency would pay all the additional expenses of both Goldan and the Independent Agency. Goldan asserts that Goldan Agency continued paying these expenses following his termination; therefore, \u201c[t]he jury could reasonably infer Goldan did not save on expenses as a result of the [Agreement] being terminated as those expenses continued to be paid by Goldan Agency.\u201d Goldan contends further that the majority of commissions Goldan received were renewal commissions which required no expenses other than those Farmers deducted. Moreover, Goldan asserts, Farmers had the opportunity at trial to dispute Goldan\u2019s calculation of damages and cross-examine him and Linda regarding expenses, but chose not to do so. In fact, Goldan alleges, Farmers argued that there were no damages resulting from their breach. Goldan accordingly claims that \u201c[n]early all of [his] evidence concerning damages and expenses went substantially unrebutted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">\u00b617 Goldan next claims that because Farmers\u2019 termination of Goldan was wrongful, under Montana statute Goldan is \u201centitled to damages that compensate him for all the detriment proximately caused by Farmers\u2019 breach.\u201d Goldan argues that the average commissions figure Goldan presented to the jury represents the amount of damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>necessary to put him in the position he would have occupied had the Agreement not been breached, and it therefore reflects the amount necessary to compensate him for the detriment caused by Farmers\u2019 breach. Goldan argues further that he offered evidence explaining why his commissions declined during the three years prior to his termination and that that evidence created an inference that Goldan\u2019s commissions would have increased had Farmers not breached the Agreement. Finally, Goldan asserts that his damages were predictable and quantifiable and therefore not founded on speculation because they were based on renewal commissions that he was entitled to receive on the policies in force at the time of the breach. As such, Goldan contends, his damages were reasonably certain.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">\u00b6 18 We have long held that \u201c[f]uture damages need only be reasonably <em>certain.\u201dE.g., Sletteland v. Roberts, </em>2000 MT 382, \u00b6 36, 304 Mont. 21, 16 P.3d 1062; <em>Martinell v. Montana Power Co., </em>268 Mont. 292, 324, 886 P.2d 421, 441 (1994); Kerr <em>v. Gibson\u2019s Prods. Co., </em>226 Mont. 69, 74, 733 P.2d 1292, 1295 (1987). Section 27-1-311, MCA, provides for damages arising from breach of contract and instructs that \u201cthe measure of damages ... is the amount which will compensate the party aggrieved for all the detriment which was proximately caused thereby or in the ordinary course of things would be likely to result therefrom.\u201d Section 27-1-303, MCA, however, provides that \u201c[a] person may not recover a greater amount in damages for the breach of an obligation than the person could have gained by the full performance of the obligation on both sides.\u201d As such, contract damages can properly be awarded \u201cfor a loss of net profits,\u201d but such damages cannot be awarded \u201cfor a loss of anticipated gross income.\u201d <em>Lovely v. Burroughs Corp., </em>165 Mont. 209, 217, 527 P.2d 557, 562 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">\u00b619 It is well established \u201cthat in order for the damages to be recovered, there must be proof of the extent and amount thereof.\u201d <em>Rigney v. Swingley, </em>112 Mont. 104, 110, 113 P.2d 344, 347 (1941). In reviewing the sufficiency of the proof of damages, our junction \u201cis to determine whether there is substantial credible evidence in the record to support the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>Murray v. Whitcraft, </em>2012 MT 298, \u00b6 7, 367 Mont. 364, 291 P.3d 587 <em>(quoting Lauman v. Lee, </em>192 Mont. 84, 88-89, 626 P.2d 830, 833 (1981)) (internal quotations omitted). \u201cSubstantial evidence is that which a reasonable mind may find adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Murray, </em>\u00b6 7. In determining whether there is substantial evidence to support the jury\u2019s award of damages, \u201c[w]e must view the evidence in a light most favorable to ... the prevailing party below, and where the record presents conflicting evidence, resolved by the jury, this Court is precluded from disturbing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>the verdict.\u201d <em>Murray, </em>\u00b6 7 (citations and internal quotations omitted). \u201cThis rule is particularly applicable when the District Court has passed upon the sufficiency of the evidence on motion ... and has upheld its sufficiency.\u201d <em>Lauman, </em>192 Mont. at 89, 626 P.2d at 833 (citing <em>Strong v. Williams, </em>154 Mont. 65, 68-69, 460 P.2d 90, 92 (1969)).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">\u00b620 A review of the jury instructions demonstrates that the jury was properly instructed on the law regarding contract damages. The jury was instructed that damages must be \u201csupported by substantial evidence\u201d and \u201cclearly ascertainable in both their nature and origin.\u201d The jury was instructed further that the measure of contract damages \u201cis the amount which will compensate the party aggrieved for all the detriment which was proximately caused thereby or in the ordinary course of things would be likely to result therefrom.\u201d Furthermore, the jury was instructed that \u201cdamages are the amount which will put the nonbreaching party in as good a position as if the contract had been performed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">\u00b621  Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Goldan, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the jury\u2019s award of damages. Goldan offered proof of the amount and extent of the commissions he had received in the three years prior to his termination and testified that \u201cthe vast majority of the commissions were renewal business.\u201d Goldan testified further that other than the expenses deducted by Farmers \u2014 for which his evidence regarding his average commissions accounted \u2014 he did not have expenses associated with receiving renewal commissions. Farmers did question Goldan briefly regarding his expenses, yet made a seemingly tactical decision not to pursue that line of questioning further. Moreover, Farmers spent little time addressing damages at trial and during its closing argument asserted that Goldan\u2019s \u201cdamages are nothing\u201d because the Goldans were \u201cgetting along fine.\u201d The evidence presented \u201cis that which a reasonable mind may find adequate to support\u201d the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Murray, </em>\u00b6 7. Moreover, the jury \u2014 which was correctly instructed on measuring contract damages \u2014 resolved the conflicting damages evidence and this Court is therefore \u201cprecluded from disturbing the verdict.\u201d <em>Murray, </em>\u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">\u00b622 Accordingly, the District Court did not err by denying Farmers\u2019 motion for judgment as a matter of law on the question of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"AHS\">\u00b623 <em>Whether the District Court erred in denying Farmers\u2019 motion for sanctions based on Goldan\u2019s alleged discovery violations.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">\u00b624 Farmers claims that it sought discovery regarding Goldan\u2019s post-termination activities and income and that Goldan refused to provide that information. Farmers therefore contends that Goldan should not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>have been allowed to seek future lost damages. Moreover, Farmers argues, the jury\u2019s damage award should be stricken because Goldan refused to produce evidence during discovery supporting the damages theory upon which he relied at trial \u2014 which Farmers claims is that he was unable to find other work after Farmers terminated the Agreement. Farmers therefore maintains that it was deprived of an opportunity to refute Goldan\u2019s damages theory at trial. Finally, Farmers asserts that it was Goldan\u2019s duty to supplement discovery by providing further financial information and that because Goldan did not do so, he should not have been allowed to use the non-disclosed information as evidence of damages at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">\u00b625 Goldan counters that he complied with Farmers\u2019 discovery requests and \u201cproduced all information he was required to produce and complied with all Court orders.\u201d The District Court made no finding that he failed to produce information he was required to produce. Goldan next claims that following Farmers\u2019 motion to compel discovery of certain financial information in March 2011, Farmers never again took issue with the information produced by Goldan until weeks before the April 2015 pretrial conference \u2014 and even then Farmers did so in \u201can attempt to limit his damages, not address discovery concerns.\u201d Finally, Goldan argues that <em>\u201cnone </em>of the five years\u2019 worth of financial information produced by Goldan was used by Farmers at trial, conceding its irrelevancy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">\u00b626 We have declared that discovery \u201cenables courts and parties to determine the truth of a given matter so that cases may be resolved justly.\u201d <em>Peterman, </em>\u00b6 17. As such, \u201cwhen a party fails to obey an order to provide discovery, the district court may impose sanctions, including dismissal of the action.\u201d <em>Peterman, </em>\u00b6 18. Although \u201c[w]e have repeatedly articulated a low-tolerance approach toward discovery abuse,\u201d <em>Peterman, </em>\u00b6 17, it is well established that \u201c[district courts are better positioned than we are to evaluate the conduct and good faith of parties during discovery, and as such they enjoy considerable leeway in sanctioning discovery abuses.\u201d <em>Peterman, </em>\u00b6 23 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"AlU6\">\u00b627 Farmers filed a motion to compel discovery in March 2011 in which it sought financial records for Goldan Agency from 2005-2010 and Goldan\u2019s personal income tax returns for the same five years. The District Court granted Farmers\u2019 motion at a hearing in December 2011 and compelled Goldan to produce financial records for Goldan Agency, as well as his and Linda\u2019s unredacted income tax statements. In granting the motion to compel, the court reasoned, \u201cThat should give enough information to establish the damages being claimed, any defenses to the damages claimed, and what routine business expenses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>affected the potential for net profits for both Mr. Goldan personally and what he ran through Goldan Agency, Inc. as his umbrella.\u201d Goldan complied with the District Court\u2019s order and produced the requested financial records in January 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">\u00b628 Although various motions regarding other discovery issues were made by both parties during the course of litigation, Farmers did not file any further motions to compel discovery of Goldan\u2019s or Goldan Agency\u2019s financial records in the ensuing four years prior to trial. While Farmers argued in its motion in limine that the court should bar evidence at trial of gross commissions and asserted in its preverdict motion for judgment as a matter of law that Goldan had not cooperated during discovery and failed to produce relevant documents to demonstrate the damages he claimed, it did not request that the court take any action to compel Goldan\u2019s disclosure of those documents. In denying Farmers\u2019 motion in limine regarding gross commissions, the District Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-5\">The tax returns [that Goldan had previously provided to Farmers] would provide general business expenses for those years in question and any other costs that have not been provided in any more detail than that can be subject to cross-examination if requested. Or if brought up and not produced, then [Farmers\u2019 counsel], I would expect that you could make an objection to information that hasn\u2019t been produced.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">\u00b629 Prior to trial, Farmers filed an objection to any evidence of lost profit or business damages on the ground that Goldan had not supplemented his or Goldan Agency\u2019s financial records. At trial, the court did not rule on the objection because it concluded that it would not be able to determine whether the financial records were relevant or not \u201cwithout hearing the testimony.\u201d The court opined further that Farmers\u2019 counsel should \u201cfeel free to revisit your objection as needed, but at this point, I don\u2019t know that I can make any kind of ruling contrary to what we\u2019ve already done.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">\u00b630 During Goldan\u2019s testimony, Farmers did not interpose any objections to Goldan\u2019s evidence or testimony regarding his damages, nor did it object to his testimony about how he had been unable to work in the five years since his termination. Farmers did object when Goldan offered testimony regarding his and Linda\u2019s shared expenses following his termination on the ground that Farmers had not been supplied with any of that financial information, and this objection was sustained. Farmers\u2019 counsel briefly questioned Goldan about Goldan Agency\u2019s income but ultimately concluded that he was \u201cgoing to reserve those questions for Linda Goldan.\u201d However, Farmers\u2019 counsel never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>questioned Linda about Goldan Agency\u2019s income. Farmers\u2019 counsel then questioned Goldan further about whether he was \u201cgoing to provide any information at all on the expenses of the Goldan Agency that it took for [Goldan] to earn the commissions [he] earned during the years [he] was earning commissions,\u201d to which Goldan responded that he would rely on his counsel to make that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-3\">\u00b631 In its post-verdict motion for judgment as a matter of law, Farmers requested that the court sanction Goldan for his alleged discovery abuses by entering judgment in favor of Farmers on the issue of damages. In denying Farmers\u2019 motion for judgment as a matter of law, the District Court noted that Farmers raised \u201cthe same arguments as those ruled on \u2014 and denied \u2014 by the Court in [Farmers\u2019] pretrial and trial motions,\u201d and presented \u201cno new legal theories in support of the Motion, but simply request the Court to reverse its prior rulings based on arguments already made.\u201d The District Court concluded that Farmers had \u201cpresented nothing which convinces this Court to reassess its prior rulings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">\u00b632  The record demonstrates that Goldan produced the financial records the District Court ordered him to produce. The record demonstrates further that each time Goldan\u2019s alleged discovery abuses were brought to the District Court\u2019s attention, the District Court concluded that Farmers could cross-examine Goldan about his and Goldan Agency\u2019s expenses or object if and when such information was brought up. Farmers made a seemingly tactical decision not to do so. Finally, although Farmers brought Goldan\u2019s alleged discovery abuses to the court\u2019s attention throughout the litigation, it never moved to compel Goldan\u2019s disclosure of any specific financial records beyond those that he produced. Goldan therefore did not \u201cfail[ ] to obey an order to provide discovery.\u201d <em>Peterman, </em>\u00b6 18. Furthermore, the District Court was \u201cbetter positioned than we are to evaluate the conduct and good faith of [the] parties during discovery,\u201d and chose not to sanction Goldan \u2014 a decision concerning which we give district courts \u201cconsiderable leeway.\u201d <em>Peterman, </em>\u00b6 23. The District Court did not act arbitrarily or otherwise exceed the bounds of reason in denying Farmers\u2019 request for discovery sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">\u00b633 Similarly, we are unpersuaded by Farmers\u2019 arguments that Goldan failed to fulfill his continuing duty to supplement discovery. M. R. Civ. P. 26(e)(1) concerns supplementing discovery, and provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-6\">(1) In General. A party who has responded to an interrogatory, request for production, or request for admission must supplement or correct its response:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-9\">(A) in a timely manner if the party learns that in some material <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>respect the response is incomplete or incorrect, and if the additional or corrective information has not otherwise been made known to the other parties during the discovery process or in writing; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-7\">(B) as ordered by the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">In construing M. R. Civ. P. 26(e), we have concluded that \u201c[i]nformation is \u2018incomplete or incorrect\u2019 in \u2018some material respect\u2019 if there is an objectively reasonable likelihood that the additional or corrective information could substantially affect or alter the opposing party\u2019s discovery plan or trial preparation.\u201d <em>Wheaton v. Bradford, </em>2013 MT 121, \u00b6 22, 370 Mont. 93, 300 P.3d 1162 (citation and internal quotations omitted). As such, M. R. Civ. P. 26(e) \u201cserves to minimize the element of unfair surprise, thereby encouraging a trial on the merits. Consequently, when no surprise arises from a violation of this rule, this Court has viewed the violation as hyper-technical.\u201d <em>Massman v. Helena, </em>237 Mont. 234, 241, 773 P.2d 1206, 1210 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">\u00b634 Although Farmers claims that it was \u201cambush[ed], plain and simple\u201d when Goldan asked for damages amounting to five years\u2019 worth of commissions, the record demonstrates that Farmers could not have been unfairly surprised. Farmers knew from the time Goldan filed his answer and counterclaim in July 2010 that he would be seeking damages for \u201call the benefits he received and reasonably anticipated receiving as an agent\u201d for Farmers. Farmers\u2019 March 2011 motion to compel and its July 2014 motions in limine demonstrate further that Farmers understood the basis of Goldan\u2019s damage claims \u2014 the average amount of commissions he would have received had the Agreement not been wrongly terminated. We therefore conclude that Goldan\u2019s failure to provide additional financial information did not violate his duty to supplement the record because there was not \u201can objectively reasonable likelihood that the additional or corrective information could substantially affect or alter [Farmers\u2019] discovery plan or trial preparation.\u201d <em>Wheaton, </em>\u00b6 22. Moreover, Farmers did not object to Goldan\u2019s testimony regarding his damages at trial \u2014 even after the District Court explicitly advised that Farmers could object to any financial information that Goldan had not produced pertaining to his damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">\u00b635 For the foregoing reasons, we conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion in declining to impose discovery sanctions against Goldan. Accordingly, the District Court did not err in denying Farmers\u2019 motion for discovery sanctions based on Goldan\u2019s alleged discovery violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-11\">\u00b636 <em>Whether the District Court erred in concluding that damages </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number><em>should, not be limited to the three month notice period allowed in the contract for terminations without cause.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b339-3\">\u00b637 Farmers\u2019 final contention is that the jury\u2019s award of damages must be reversed to the extent that it exceeds three months of Goldan\u2019s lost profits. Farmers argues that, as a matter of law, Goldan\u2019s damages were limited by the Agreement\u2019s provision that he could be terminated without cause on three months\u2019 notice. Farmers urges this Court to adopt the rule that when an employment contract may be terminated on specified notice, the term for which the terminated employee is due compensation is the notice period. Farmers claims that because the Agreement could be terminated for any reason on three months\u2019 notice, Goldan could not have reasonably anticipated that his damages could exceed that notice period.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">\u00b638 Farmers correctly asserts that the rule in the majority of jurisdictions is that \u201c[wjhere the employee is only guaranteed a specified time period to work after notice, the unexpired term for which compensation is due is the notice period.\u201d 3 Dan B. Dobbs, <em>Dobbs Law of Remedies: Damages-Equity-Restitution </em>\u00a7 12.21(2), 479 (Pract. Treatise Series, 2d. ed., 1993). However, given the manner in which Farmers terminated the Agreement and then pled its case, we decline Farmers\u2019 invitation to apply this rule here.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">\u00b639 As noted above, the Agreement could be terminated in three distinct ways: (1) on 3 months\u2019 written notice for any reason; (2) on thirty days written notice if any of the provisions of the Agreement were breached; or (3) immediately for specified causes, including switching insureds to another carrier. Goldan\u2019s contract was terminated by Farmers immediately for cause, pursuant to (3), after which Farmers filed suit against Goldan seeking declaratory relief and damages for Goldan\u2019s alleged breach of contract. This in turn prompted Goldan to file a counter-claim in which he sought damages for Farmers\u2019 wrongful breach of contract. Notably, Farmers did not assert that it was entitled to apply the three months\u2019 provision so as to limit its damages until filing a motion in limine on the subject in July 2014, nearly five years after it terminated the Agreement with Goldan for cause and four years after it sued Goldan for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">\u00b640 Had Farmers initially given Goldan written notice that it was terminating the Agreement pursuant to (1) above, Farmers could have terminated the Agreement after three months and there would have been no breach of the Agreement or any entitlement to damages. We have upheld such a contract termination without cause when the requisite notice was given. <em>Tvedt v. Farmers Ins. Group of Cos., </em>2004 MT 125, \u00b6\u00b6 21, 29, 321 Mont. 263, 91 P.3d 1. Here, however, Farmers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>gave no such written notice and instead elected to terminate the contract for cause and pursue a claim for damages against Goldan. In <em>Tvedt, </em>we cited with approval our decision in <em>Farris v. Hutchinson, </em>254 Mont. 334, 339, 838 P.2d 374, 377 (1992), in which we said: \u201cIn <em>Prout [Prout v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>236 Mont. 152, 772 P.2d 288 (1989)], we gave effect to the written agreements and said the employer could fire without cause under the agreements, but that if it asserted the termination was for cause, the employee must have an opportunity to prove that the cause stated was false.\u201d <em>Tvedt, </em>\u00b6 29. Because Farmers terminated the Agreement for cause and not on three months\u2019 written notice, Goldan had the right to prove that Farmers\u2019 stated cause was false. Just as Farmers sued him for damages, Goldan also had the right to assert a claim for his damages for breach of the contract, which he successfully did.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">\u00b641 Section 27-1-311, MCA, provides that the measure of damages for a breach of contract is \u201cthe amount which will compensate the party aggrieved for all the detriment which was proximately caused thereby or in the ordinary course of things would be likely to result therefrom.\u201d A career agent with twenty-one years of successful employment with Farmers, Goldan established for the jury his understandable expectation that his contract would continue into the future, as well as the detriment caused by Farmers\u2019 breach of contract. We held in <em>Ehly v. Cady, </em>212 Mont. 82, 97, 687 P.2d 687, 695, that contract damages are those that are reasonably foreseeable or within the contemplation of the parties at the time of entering the contract. At the time the contract was entered, it was reasonable for Goldan to assume that should Farmers give him three months\u2019 written notice of its intention to terminate the contract without cause, he would not be entitled to any damages. Conversely, it was reasonable for him to assume that should Farmers breach the contract by wrongly terminating it for cause, he would be entitled to rebut that cause and recover his full measure of damages resulting from the wrongful breach, as permitted under \u00a7 27-1-311, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">\u00b642  The jury here listened to the evidence and concluded that Farmers breached the contract with Goldan, a finding which Farmers does not contest on appeal. The jury awarded damages accordingly, and in an amount supported by the evidence. While the extra-jurisdictional cases cited by the Dissent may indeed stand for the proposition stated, this is not at present the law in Montana, and we decline to adopt it under the circumstances and procedural posture of this case. Because Farmers unilaterally elected to sue Goldan for breach of contract and damages, we decline to limit its damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>pursuant to a contract provision it did not invoke when it fired Goldan. We therefore conclude that the District Court did not err in concluding that Goldan\u2019s damages should not be limited to the three months\u2019 notice period set forth in the contract for terminations without cause on written notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">\u00b643 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"Ahv\">JUSTICES WHEAT, SHEA and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b328-17\"> Appellants are affiliated insurance entities, and include: Farmers Insurance Exchange, Truck Insurance Exchange, Fire Insurance Exchange, Mid-Century Insurance Company, and Farmers New World Life Insurance Company.

Because the measure of damages for breach of that Agreement is a question of law that the District Court resolved incorrectly, I dissent from the Court\u2019s decision to uphold the jury\u2019s damage award. I would instead reverse on the third issue and remand for the District Court to enter an amended judgment limiting Goldan to recovery of three months\u2019 worth of commissions. I would not address the other two issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">\u00b645 Three points prove pivotal to proper analysis of the issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-9\">1. Farmers undisputedly breached the Agreement by terminating Goldan immediately without cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-10\">2. The Agreement could have been terminated on three months\u2019 notice for any reason, but Farmers did not terminate the Agreement under this provision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-11\">3. Goldan sought damages for breach of contract only.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-12\">Under these facts, the Court improperly determines that the measure of Goldan\u2019s contract damages exceeds what he could have recovered had the contract been performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-13\">\u00b646 First, the Court correctly observes that if one party breaches the contract, as Farmers did here, the measure of damages is \u201cthe amount which will compensate the party aggrieved for all the detriment which was proximately caused thereby or in the ordinary course of things would be likely to result therefrom.\u201d Opinion, f 41; Section 27-1-311, MCA. Although the calculation of the amount of contract damages is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>a question of fact, <em>see, e.g.,Sack v. A.V. Design, </em>211 Mont. 147, 153, 683 P.2d 1311, 1315 (1984), the measure of damages in a breach of contract action is a question of law, <em>Arcadia Fin., Ltd. v. Prestige Toyota, </em>1999 MT 273, \u00b6 23, 296 Mont. 494, 989 P.2d 831 (observing that \u201c[t]he measure of damages for a breach of contract is determined in accordance with \u00a7 27-1-311, MCA.\u201d). <em>See also McEwen v. MCR, LLC, </em>2012 MT 319, \u00b6 85, 368 Mont. 38, 291 P.3d 1253 (Nelson, J., concurring) (stating that \u201cthe choice of the proper measure of damages is a question of law for the court, while the calculation of the amount of damages is a question of fact for the fact-finder\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">\u00b647 Second, the Court appears to recognize that this standard limits recoverable damages for breach of contract to those damages that are reasonably foreseeable or within the contemplation of the parties <em>at the time of contracting. </em>Opinion, \u00b6 41; <em>Ehly, </em>212 Mont. at 97, 687 P.2d at 695 (concluding that \u201c[o]ur court, and courts everywhere, recognize ... recovery for consequential damages within the contemplation of the parties when they entered into the contract\u201d); <em>Mont. Petroleum Tank Release Comp. Bd., </em>2008 MT 2, \u00b6 71, 341 Mont. 33, 174 P.3d 948; <em>Hostetter v. Donlan, </em>221 Mont. 380, 382, 719 P.2d 1243, 1245 (1986). This application of the damages statute accords with the clearly stated rule that courts must interpret a contract so \u201cas to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties as it existed at the time of contracting, so far as the same is ascertainable and lawful.\u201d Section 28-3-301, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"AQe\">\u00b648 Curiously, however, though it mentions \u00a7 27-1-303, MCA, in discussing Farmers\u2019 first contention an appeal (Opinion, \u00b6 18), the Court is silent on the statute\u2019s application to the measure of damages. \u201cA person may not recover a greater amount in damages for the breach of an obligation than the person could have gained by the full performance of the obligation on both sides.\u201d Section 27-1-303, MCA. When a contract is breached, \u201cthe nonbreaching party should receive a sum which will give that party an economic status identical to that which it would have enjoyed had the contract been performed.\"Arcadia <em>Fin., Ltd, </em>\u00b6 23. <em>Accord Arrowhead Sch. Dist. No. 75 v. Klyap, </em>2003 MT 294, \u00b6 20, 318 Mont. 103, 70 P.3d 250 (noting that the nonbreaching party should receive \u201ccompensation equal to what that party would receive if the contract were performed\u201d). \u201cThe [principle] espoused in \u00a7 27-1-303, MCA, supports the well-established \u2018benefit of the bargain rule.\u2019 \u201d <em>Textana, Inc. v. Klabzuba Oil &amp; Gas, </em>2009 MT 401, \u00b6 52, 353 Mont. 442, 222 P.3d 580 (citing <em>Castillo v. Franks, </em>213 Mont. 232, 242, 690 P.2d 425, 430 (1984); \u00a7 27-1-311, MCA). Tied to that concept is the \u201cfundamental tenet\u201d of freedom of contract: \u201cparties are free to mutually agree to terms governing their private -conduct as long as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>those terms do not conflict with public laws.\u201d <em>Arrowhead Sch. Dist. No. 75, </em>\u00b6 20. Among such permissible terms, parties are free to agree \u2014 as Farmers and Goldan did here \u2014 that their Agreement may be terminated for any reason upon the giving of specified notice. <em>Arrowhead Sch. Dist. No. 75, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">\u00b649 The Court recognizes that most courts hold that when one party breaches a contract that may be terminated upon the giving of notice, the nonbreaching party\u2019s damages are limited to the notice period. Opinion, \u00b6 38. The proposition is widely accepted. A representative sample of cases includes the following: <em>Odell v. Humble Oil &amp; Refining Co., </em>201 F.2d 123, 128 (10th Cir. 1953) (concluding that although an employer breached an employment contract by firing employees for testifying against the employer in a criminal case, the employees\u2019 damages were limited to thirty days because \u201c[w]here a contract of employment expressly empowers an employer to terminate the contract upon giving notice, recovery for wrongful breach is limited to the notice period\u201d); <em>Royal\u2019s Reconditioning Corp. v. Royal, </em>689 N.E.2d 237, 241 (Ill. App. Ct. 1st Dist. 1997) (concluding that lost profit damages recoverable by employer for employee\u2019s breach of contract were limited to the notice period, in part, because the \u201cparties did not contemplate several years\u2019 lost profits as damages because the contractual period for notice of termination was only 30 days\u201d); <em>Hentze v. Unverfehrt, </em>604 N.E.2d 536, 612 (Ill. App. Ct. 5th Dist. 1992) (concluding that trial court\u2019s award of nominal damages for breach of an indefinite dealership contract, which was terminable at will on sixty days\u2019 notice, was proper because \u201cclearly five years of lost profits were not within the contemplation of the parties at the time of entering into the contract\u201d); <em>Shivers v. John H. Harland Co., </em>423 S.E.2d 105, 106 (S.C. 1992) (concluding that \u201cwhere a provision in a contract of employment allows the employer to terminate the contract for any reason upon giving fifteen days\u2019 notice, [and] the employer instead discharges the employee for cause under another provision of the contract without giving notice, and a jury finds that the discharge for cause is wrongful,\u201d the employee\u2019s recovery of damages was limited, as a matter of law, to the notice period even when the employee had been employed by the employer for over fourteen years,); <em>Burch v. Lake Forest Property Owners\u2019 Ass\u2019n, </em>565 So. 2d 611, 612 (Ala. 1990) (concluding that an employer\u2019s \u201cviolation of the notice provision does not entitle [the employee] to compensation for the entire contract period\u201d); <em>Pharo Distributing Co. v. Stahl, </em>782 S.W.2d 635, 638-39 (Ky. Ct.

Rather, it is the failure to give reasonable notice before termination that constitutes breach.\u201d Thus, the nonbreaching party\u2019s \u201cdamages may not reflect loss of a contract or discontinuance of the business relationship\u201d when the breaching party breached an on-going distributorship contract.); <em>Martin v. U-Haul Co. of Fresno, </em>204 Cal. App. 3d 396, 409 (Cal. App. 5th Dist. 1988) (concluding that a nonbreaching party\u2019s damages were limited to the notice period because \u201c[p]arties who agree that a contract may be terminated for any reason, or no reason, upon the giving of the specified notice could not reasonably anticipate that damages could exceed that notice period\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">\u00b650 But the Court fails to acknowledge that the rule applies equally in jurisdictions that, like Montana, limit contract damages to those that are reasonably foreseeable and are within the contemplation of the parties at the time of contracting. <em>See, e.g., Martin, </em>204 Cal. App. 3d at 408-09 (analyzing a California statute nearly identical to \u00a7 27-1-311, MCA); <em>Hentze, </em>237 Ill. App. 3d at 612, (stating that the rule in Illinois is that \u201c[rjecovery of lost profits are allowable if... such profits were within the reasonable contemplation of the parties at the time the contract was entered\u201d; therefore, for breach of a contract that could be terminated upon sixty days\u2019 written notice, \u201cdamages for lost profits exceeding these 60 days could not have been contemplated\u201d); <em>Asamoah-Boadu v. State, </em>328 S.W.3d 790, 796-97 (Mo. Ct. App. 2010) (concluding that damages for \u201clost profits must be limited to the termination period,\u201d in part because the rule in Missouri is that \u201c[i]n an action for breach of contract, lost profits are recoverable where the loss is the natural and proximate result of the breach ... and within the contemplation of the parties when the contract was made\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">\u00b651 By emphasizing Farmers\u2019 admittedly wrongful termination without notice, the Court overlooks the fact that all of the above-cited cases are breach of contract cases. The longstanding principle they espouse is that \u201cif a person refuses to perform a contract which is terminable by him upon certain conditions, the amount of money he would have to pay in exercising his election to terminate becomes the measure of damages for his breach.\u201d <em>Martin, </em>204 Cal. App. 3d at 408. The same principle is recognized in the law of contracts and remedies. <em>See </em>1 Robert L. Dunn, <em>Recovery of Damages for Lost Profits </em>\u00a7 6.19 530-31 (6th ed. 2005) (stating that where a contract may be terminated on specified notice but is terminated prematurely, \u201c[mjost of the cases limit damages recoverable to those suffered within the notice period\u201d). Obviously, it applies only when \u201cthe manner in which [the contract is] terminated\u201d does not meet the notice requirements. Opinion, \u00b6 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>\u00b652 It is of no consequence to the measure of damages that Farmers first invoked the agreed-upon limitation in a motion in limine. Opinion, \u00b6 39. As the Agreement long had ceased to exist, the purpose of the motion was not to raise a late defense that the Agreement properly had been terminated without cause, but to assess a maximum limit on Goldan\u2019s recovery should he prove that Farmers\u2019 \u201cwith cause\u201d termination breached the Agreement because the stated cause was false. Goldan undoubtedly had \u201cthe right... to seek damages for breach of the contract.\u201d Opinion, f 40. But that statement alone does not answer the question before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-3\">\u00b653 A party to a contract generally h\u00e1s \u201cthe right to breach and pay damages rather than perform. The non-breaching party, theoretically, is \u2018made whole\u2019 from the damages paid following the breach and thus still receives benefits from the agreement.\u201d <em>Rowland v. Klies, </em>223 Mont. 360, 370, 726 P.2d 310, 317 (1986) (quoting <em>Nicholson v. United Pacific Ins. Co., </em>219 Mont. 32, 41, 710 P.2d 1342, 1348 (1985)). When a party breaches the contract, courts will award \u201ccompensation equal to what [the non-breaching] party would receive if the contract were performed ... rather than additional damages intended to punish the breaching party for failure to perform the contract.\u201d <em>Arrowhead Sch. Dist. No. 75, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">\u00b654 The Court\u2019s reliance on <em>Tvedt </em>misses the mark. Tvedt claimed that Farmers\u2019 termination of the contracts without good cause and on proper notice \u201cconstituted] a breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing implicit in [the written contracts].\u201d <em>Tvedt, </em>\u00b6 20. The covenant arises not from the contract itself, but from the parties\u2019 justifiable expectations. <em>Rowland, </em>223 Mont. at 370, 726 P.2d at 317 <em>(citing Nicholson, </em>219 Mont. at 41, 710 P.2d at 1348). The Court fixates on the wrong question \u2014 whether the termination was \u201cfor cause\u201d or \u201cwithout cause\u201d (Opinion, 1 40) \u2014 when there is no question that the Agreement was breached, and when the only issue is the measure of contract damages. In a common contract action, \u201ctort-type damages are not available for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. They are, however, available for traditional contract-related torts such as fraud, fraudulent inducement, and tortious interference with a contract.\u201d <em>Story v. City of Bozeman, </em>242 Mont. 436, 451, 791 P.2d 767, 776 (1990), <em>overruled in part, Arrowhead Sch. Dist. No. 75,</em></p>\n<p id=\"AOi\">\u00b6 54). Goldan sought none of these remedies. His damages are limited to contractual damages only. Section 27-1-303, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">\u00b655 Had Farmers performed its Agreement, Goldan would have worked another three months following Farmers\u2019 notice and earned three months\u2019 worth of commissions from the business he produced. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>Upon termination, Goldan would be entitled to the \u201ccontract value\u201d as definedbythe Agreement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> By breaching the Agreement, Farmers now must put Goldan in as good a position as if it had performed: by paying him damages equivalent to the three months\u2019 worth of commissions he presumably would have earned with proper notice. The Court fails to honor the law\u2019s presumption that, when he signed the Agreement with Farmers, Goldan was \u201cin the best position to make decisions in [his] own interest.\u201d <em>Arrowhead Sch. Dist. No. 75, </em>\u00b6 20. For Goldan to recover future lost profits as contract damages, they must have been within his reasonable expectation at that time. <em>Ehly, </em>212 Mont. at 97, 687 P.2d at 695. Additional damages, like those Goldan might have claimed in tort, are not implicated. The Court does not explain how Goldan\u2019s \u201cfull measure of damages resulting from [Farmers\u2019] wrongful breach\u201d (Opinion, \u00b6 41) can be something other than Goldan\u2019s contractual expectation.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">\u00b656 It is an understatement to characterize this analysis as the \u201cmajority\u201d rule. Opinion, \u00b6 38. Goldan cites but one case, <em>Chevrolet Motor Co. v. Gladding </em>, 42 F.2d 440 (4th Cir. 1930), to support his argument that damages may not be limited to the contractual notice period. <em>Gladding </em>involved a sales contract that contained three termination provisions, not one of which allowed termination at will, without cause. <em>Gladding, </em>42 F.2d at 441-42. The contract construed in <em>Gladding </em>thus is materially different from the parties\u2019 Agreement here. <em>See Strategic Outsourcing, Inc. v. Cont\u2019l Cas. Co., </em>274 Fed. Appx. 228, 234 (4th Cir. 2008) (concluding that the <em>Gladding </em>court\u2019s reasoning was \u201cinapposite\u201d because \u201cthe cancellation provision [in the contract at issue] did not require specific cause\u201d);<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Ford Motor Co. v. Kirkmeyer Motor Co., </em>65 F.2d 1001, 1004 (4th Cir. 1933) (concluding that \u201cunder the peculiar provisions of [the Gladding] contract... [the contract] might be terminated, not at will, but upon conditions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>specified in the contract\u201d); <em>In re Petroleum Carriers Co., </em>121 F. Supp. 520, 526 (D. Minn. 1954) (distinguishing the <em>Gladding </em>contract \u201cbecause [its] contract provision provided for termination upon the existence of specified conditions which were not met\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-3\">\u00b657 Unlike the <em>Gladding </em>contract, Farmers did not need to prove a specific condition in order to terminate the Agreement \u2014 it could be terminated without cause. The Fourth Circuit has not applied the rule it espoused in <em>Gladding </em>to contracts allowing termination without cause in the more than eighty years since. <em>See Strategic Outsourcing, Inc., </em>274 Fed. Appx. at 235; <em>Trimed, Inc. v. Sherwood Medical </em>Co., 977 F.2d 885, 892 (4th Cir. 1992) (upholding a jury\u2019s damage calculation after concluding that the lower court properly instructed the jury that lost profits would be limited to those incurred during the six months following the breach of a contract that could be terminated \u201cwithout cause at any time with six months\u2019 notice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">\u00b658 In summary, at the time of contracting, when he agreed to termination on three months\u2019 notice, Goldan could not reasonably have anticipated that he would receive five years\u2019 worth of lost profits. He instead is entitled to what he would have received had the Agreement been performed. <em>Arcadia Fin., Ltd., </em>f 23. If Farmers had fully performed its obligation \u2014 that is, if Farmers had not breached the Agreement by terminating Goldan immediately without cause \u2014 it could have terminated the Agreement on three months\u2019 notice for any reason. Goldan therefore cannot recover a greater amount in damages than he could have recovered had Farmers terminated the Agreement with proper notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">\u00b659 The Court does not explain why Montana should stand alone in refusing to enforce the expectations of the parties, except to protest that Farmers treated Goldan unfairly. Opinion, \u00b6 42. That may be true. But it harkens a remedy in tort, which Goldan did not seek. The District Court should have, as a matter of law, limited Goldan\u2019s damages to the three-month notice period provided for in the termination clause. I would reverse the District Court\u2019s judgment on the jury\u2019s award of damages and remand to the District Court for further proceedings to re-calculate the amount of damages.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b341-14\"> Goldan did not raise a claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in his Counterclaim. Although he attempted to raise the issue later in the proceedings, the District Court ruled that he had not done so properly by moving to amend his pleadings. The court advised the parties during the final pretrial conference that an implied covenant claim would not be allowed, and refused Goldan\u2019s proffered jury instructions relating to that theory of recovery. Goldan does not challenge the court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b346-5\"> Under the Agreement, termination for any reason obligated Farmers to pay \u201ccontract value\u201d to Goldan in installment payments. Contract value was based on the amount of service commissions paid to Goldan during either the six-month or twelvemonth period preceding termination, the number of active policies Goldan held, and the number of years Goldan had been an agent for Farmers. Farmers\u2019 only \u201cclaim for damages against Goldan\u201d (Opinion, \u00b6 40) was to seek recovery of the portion of this contract value it already had paid him, on the theory that Goldan had breached the Agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b346-6\"> Fed.
