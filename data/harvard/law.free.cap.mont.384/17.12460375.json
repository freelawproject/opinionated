We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">\u00b62 A restatement of the dispositive issue on appeal is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-8\">\n<em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion by dismissing Hanson\u2019s petition for postconviction relief?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b44-11\">\u00b63 This is a postconviction proceeding. However, the facts underlying Hanson\u2019s convictions are also at issue. Hanson and his neighbor, Emmy Gregg (Gregg) met and began dating in 1990. Gregg and her son Aaron moved into Hanson\u2019s home when Aaron was four years old. Gregg and Aaron moved out in 1992, but the couple continued dating until 1993. Aaron testified that while he, Hanson, and his mother lived together, they would all three shower together, ostensibly to conserve hot water. Aaron testified that sometimes only he and Hanson would shower together. On those occasions, Aaron testified that Hanson would wash Aaron\u2019s genital area and that he was asked to wash Hanson\u2019s in return, which he did. Also, Aaron testified that Hanson would tell Aaron to perform oral sex on him, which Aaron did on several occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-12\">\u00b64 After the couple broke up, Gregg became concerned about her son\u2019s behavior. Aaron had nightmares about Hanson, expressed anger toward him, wet his bed, locked the door when he bathed, and hid when the phone rang or someone came to the door. Gregg asked Aaron several times about any improper contact with Hanson, but Aaron denied it. Gregg contacted Detective Maxine Lamb (Lamb) of the Flathead County Sheriffs Department about her concerns. After speaking with Gregg, Lamb went to Aaron\u2019s school and interviewed him. Aaron described incidents involving Hanson that Lamb believed constituted sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-13\">\u00b65 The State charged Hanson with sexual assault and deviate sexual conduct. On March 9, 1995, a jury found Hanson guilty of sexual assault and deviate sexual conduct, both felonies, in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 45-5-502(1) and 45-5-505(1), MCA. On April 7, 1995, Hanson filed a motion for a new trial. The District Court denied Hanson\u2019s motion on July 21, 1995. On July 24, 1995, the District Court sentenced Hanson to concurrent terms of twenty years in the Montana State Prison for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>the offense of sexual assault and ten years for the offense of deviate sexual conduct. Hanson appealed his convictions. This Court affirmed in <em>State v. Hanson, </em>236 Mont. 316, 940 P.2d 1166 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">\u00b66 Acting pro se, Hanson first petitioned the District Court for postconviction relief on June 30, 1998. The District Court denied his petition as insufficient in form. Hanson appealed the District Court\u2019s denial of his petition. This Court affirmed in <em>State v. Hanson, </em>1999 MT 226, 296 Mont. 82, 988 P.2d 299. Hanson petitioned for habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the District of Montana, which was dismissed as procedurally defaulted. Hanson appealed the dismissal. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed in <em>Hanson v. Mahoney, </em>338 P.3d 964 (9th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">\u00b67 Represented by counsel, Hanson next petitioned for postconviction relief on August 13, 2012. He asked for a \u201chearing for the purpose of producing newly discovered evidence in support of his claim for relief from [his] conviction.\u201d Hanson\u2019s newly discovered evidence was that, before his trial, several potential witnesses contacted Lamb and told her Gregg was lying. According to Hanson\u2019s petition, Lamb told these witnesses \u201cto stay away from the courtroom and the case\u201d and failed to tell Hanson\u2019s attorney about the witnesses. Although not newly discovered, Hanson\u2019s petition also mentioned that a contributor to Hanson\u2019s pre-sentence investigation report commented he was concerned Hanson did not commit the offenses and that it was possible the victim had been \u201ccoached to provide false allegations.\u201d Additionally, the petition claimed several voicemails left by Gregg should have been played for the jury because they indicated she was very angry with Hanson for ending their relationship and contained threats to \u201cget even\u201d with him. Hanson accused Lamb of improper conduct and of withholding information favorable to Hanson\u2019s defense. Five affidavits were filed in support of Hanson\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">\u00b68 The State\u2019s response to Hanson\u2019s petition raised the one year statute of limitations for filing a petition for postconviction relief alleging newly discovered evidence. The State\u2019s response argued that the information set forth by Hanson did not constitute newly discovered evidence and argued that, because Lamb was deceased and had been for several years, it could not specifically respond to the allegations against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">\u00b69 The District Court authorized discovery and set a deadline of May 24,2013, to complete discovery. The State served Hanson with a notice of deposition scheduled for May 17, 2013, to be taken at the Flathead County Attorney\u2019s office. On May 9, 2013, Hanson filed combined motions, in the alternative, requesting either a protective order, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>quash the notice of deposition, or for a telephonic deposition. As grounds, Hanson stated that an active warrant was issued for his arrest and complained that the State refused to stipulate to either deposing Hanson telephonically or agreeing not to arrest him if he appeared for his deposition. Hanson accused the State of setting Hanson\u2019s deposition for an improper purpose to \u201ceffect the arrest and confinement of Mr. Hanson.\u201d In response, the State asked that Hanson\u2019s combined motions be denied because the State wished to obtain information known only by Hanson, was unsure whether Hanson would testify if the case proceeded to trial, and planned to videotape the deposition. The State pointed out that Hanson\u2019s arrest warrant was activated in September of 2009 and denied acting improperly by stating \u201cthe State did not contrive a civil action to compel [Hanson\u2019s] appearance to effect his arrest.\u201d Hanson failed to appear for his deposition scheduled for May 17, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">\u00b610 On May 31, 2013, the District Court denied Hanson\u2019s combined motions. It stated \u201cby engaging the matter and entering into the sometimes shark-infested waters of the litigation process, [Hanson] positioned himself in a manner making him subject to certain appearance requirements, including but not limited to personal attendance at a scheduled deposition.\u201d On June 21,2013, Hanson filed a motion for summary judgment. The State asked the District Court, twice, to expand the time it had to file a response to Hanson\u2019s motion for summary judgment so that it could first depose Hanson. The District Court ordered the State\u2019s response be filed \u201cno later than fifteen days after [Hanson\u2019s] deposition occurs.\u201d The State served Hanson with a second notice of deposition scheduled for July 25, 2013. Hanson failed to appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">\u00b611 On August 9, 2013, the State filed a motion to compel Hanson\u2019s deposition. On August 15,2013, the District Court granted the State\u2019s motion and ordered Hanson to \u201cpersonally attend a deposition scheduled by the State and properly noticed.\u201d The District Court\u2019s order cautioned, \u201cFAILURE TO PERSONALLY ATTEND THE DEPOSITION MAYRESULT IN SANCTIONS AGAINST [HANSON], WHICH MAY INCLUDE AN AWARD OF COSTS OR FEES TO THE STATE, DISMISSAL WITH PREJUDICE OF THIS CAUSE OF ACTION, AND/OR OTHER RELIEF DEEMED JUSTIFIED BY THE COURT.\u201d The State served Hanson with a third notice of deposition scheduled for October 20, 2014. Hanson failed to appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">\u00b612 On October 24,2014, the State filed a motion to dismiss Hanson\u2019s petition with prejudice \u201cdue to his violation of the Rules of Civil Procedure governing discovery and his violation of this Court\u2019s Order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>compelling his deposition issued August 15, 2013.\u201d On April 3, 2015, the District Court granted the State\u2019s motion to dismiss Hanson\u2019s petition as a sanction for his failure to comply with the discovery process, namely by failing to appear at three noticed depositions. Hanson appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">\u00b613 \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s imposition of discovery sanctions for an abuse of discretion. We have consistently deferred to a district court\u2019s imposition of sanctions because \u2018the trial judge is in the best position to know... which parties callously disregard the rights of their opponents and other litigants seeking their day in court. The trial judge is also in the best position to determine which sanction is the most appropriate.\u2019 \u201d <em>Xin Xu v. McLaughlin Inst. for Biomedical Sci., Inc., </em>2005 MT 209, \u00b6 17, 328 Mont. 232, 119 P.3d 100 (quoting <em>Smart v. Molinario, </em>2004 MT 21, \u00b6 8, 319 Mont. 335, 83 P.3d 1284).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">\u00b614 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion by dismissing Hanson\u2019s petition for postconviction relief?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">\u00b615 The Montana Rules of Civil Procedure provide for a party\u2019s failure to make discovery and sanctions. \u201cThe court where the action is pending may, on motion, order sanctions if: a party ... fails, after being served with proper notice, to appear for that person\u2019s deposition.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 37(d)(l)(A)(i). \u201cSanctions may include any of the orders listed in Rule 37(b)(2)(A)(i)-(vi).\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 37(d)(3). The listed sanctions include \u201cdismissing the action or proceeding in whole or in part.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2)(A)(v).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">\u00b616 \u201cI S lince 1981, it has been this Court\u2019s position that dilatory abuse of discovery must no longer be dealt with leniently and that transgressors of discovery abuses should be punished rather than encouraged repeatedly to cooperate.\u201d <em>Smith v. Butte-Silver Bow County, </em>276 Mont. 329, 332, 916 P.2d 91, 92-93 (1996) (citing <em>Owen v. F. A. Buttrey Co., </em>192 Mont. 274, 277, 627 P.2d 1233, 1235 (1981) (\u201c[JJudicial indulgence in abuses of the discovery process has been increasingly replaced by a tougher, less tolerant attitude toward parties who frustrate, rather than facilitate, discovery.\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-11\">\u00b617 We use three criteria to review whether a sanction is an abuse of discretion. Rephrased, the criteria are: 1) whether the consequences imposed by the sanctions relate to the extent and nature of the actual discovery abuse; 2) whether the extent of the prejudice the discovery abuse caused the opposing party was considerable; and 3) whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>court expressly warned the abusing party of the consequences. <em>Xu, </em>\u00b6 26 (citing <em>Butte-Silver Bow, </em>276 Mont. at 339-40, 916 P.2d at 97).</p>\n<p id=\"A_M\">\u00b618  First, the consequences must relate to the extent of the abuse. Hanson\u2019s petition was dismissed with prejudice. This is a harsh, dispositive penalty. Hanson failed to appear at three separately scheduled and properly noticed depositions. He did not appear because he did not want to be arrested on an outstanding warrant issued in 2009 for failure to keep his sex offender registration current, a separate felony. Before the first deposition, Hanson filed combined motions to either avoid the personal appearance requirement or assure that he would not be arrested if he attended his deposition. The District Court denied his motions and reminded Hanson that he filed this lawsuit by petitioning for postconviction relief and subjected himself to certain appearance requirements, including personally appearing at a deposition. After Hanson failed to attend his second deposition, the District Court ordered his appearance. Allowing a litigant to ignore a court order to appear for a deposition because of an outstanding warrant cannot be tolerated. We conclude the severity of the sanction related to the extent and nature of the discovery abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"A02\">\u00b619 Second, the extent of the prejudice to the opposing party must be evaluated. The District Court\u2019s order dismissing Hanson\u2019s petition noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-6\">Throughout this proceeding the [State] has maintained and the Court has agreed that it needed to depose [Hanson] to ascertain when he knew or found out about certain evidentiary matters upon which he bases his petition for post-conviction relief. [The State] in its response to [Hanson\u2019s] petition for post-conviction relief asserts that the petition is barred by the running of the statute of limitations set forth in Section 46-21-102(2), MCA ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9\">Section 46-21-102(2), MCA, requires a petition for postconviction relief based on newly discovered evidence be filed within one year of the date on which the petitioner discovers, or reasonably should have discovered, its existence. Hanson\u2019s memorandum in support of his petition states that \u201cHanson discovered the fact of suppression of witnesses and the details of their testimony in late August 2011.\u201d The State argued that Hanson either discovered, or should have discovered this evidence earlier and therefore, hoped to establish facts supporting its position through deposing Hanson. Hanson\u2019s refusal to be deposed prevented the State from formulating a defense and this case from progressing past the discovery phase. The State expended considerable time, money, and effort in its attempt to depose Hanson by scheduling and serving notice on three separate occasions. Further, as a result of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>Hanson\u2019s failure to appear, the State filed motions to compel Hanson\u2019s deposition and to expand its briefing deadlines in order to respond to Hanson\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The State was considerably prejudiced by Hanson\u2019s failure to attend his depositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">\u00b620 Third, in its order compelling his attendance, Hanson was expressly warned that his failure to attend the third deposition could result in the District Court dismissing his petition with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"ACX\">\u00b621  We conclude that each of the criteria outlined in <em>Butte-Silver Bow, </em>and relied on in <em>Xu, </em>were met in this case. The District Court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing Hanson\u2019s petition for postconviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">\u00b622 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b49-9\">JUSTICES WHEAT, COTTER, BAKER and SHEA concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
