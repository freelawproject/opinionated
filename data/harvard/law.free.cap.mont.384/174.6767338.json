Whether the District Court correctly found that Teton Prairie failed to establish the necessary elements to raise the defense of Futile Call Doctrine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-16\">3. Whether the District Court\u2019s injunction was proper.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-17\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b201-18\">\u00b63 The present dispute involves multiple water right holders on the mainstream of the Teton River, in Teton and Chouteau Counties, Montana. The headwaters of the Teton River are located in west-central Montana, northwest of the town of Choteau, along the Rocky <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>Mountain Front. After leaving the mountains, the river flows east, making southeast and northeast turns through Teton and Chouteau Counties, to its confluence with the Marias River. The river has two main tributaries: Muddy Creek in the north, located near Collins; and Deep Creek in the south, located near the town of Choteau. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) maintains river gauges near the towns of Dutton and Loma.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">\u00b64 The river\u2019s source of early season high flows is spring runoff, and the late season low flows are sustained by melting snowpack. It is common for stretches of the river to be completely dry by late summer. The Teton River does not have an onstream reservoir to stabilize late season flows. The river is located in the Teton River Basin, 410, which has not yet been finally adjudicated and is currently controlled by a Temporary Preliminary Decree. The individual water rights held by the parties to this case have undergone the adjudication process and the extent of each right has been determined, but due to other water users\u2019 outstanding cases in the Basin they await the entry of a final decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">\u00b65 The Teton River has long been used to support farming and ranching. It has also long been the subject of water disputes amongst water users. The upper portion of the Teton River has been administered by a water commissioner under district court decree since 1908. The lower portion, where the parties\u2019 rights are located, is not included in this decree. Each of the Appellees own property in Chouteau County and conduct farming and ranching operations. Teton Prairie owns property in Teton County, upstream from Appellees\u2019 properties. Appellees hold water rights mainly for stockwater purposes, but also for domestic use. Teton Prairie\u2019s water rights are for irrigation, and Teton Prairie\u2019s rights are junior to all of Appellees\u2019 rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">\u00b66 In July 2013, Appellees ascertained, through their own observations and through data available from the USGS-maintained river gauges, that flows had diminished such that they were not receiving the full extent of their water rights. On July 15, 2013, the USGS stream gauge near Loma, which is located downriver from all parties, reported 3.0 cubic-feet-per-second (cfs) of mean stream flow. For the following days the flowrate continued to drop rapidly. On July 18, 2013, the Loma gauge recorded 0.92 mean cfs, which prompted Appellees to instruct their attorney to send call letters to junior upstream users on the middle Teton River. On July 19,2013, the Loma, gauge recorded 0.55 mean cfs, and Appellees\u2019 attorney sent call letters to junior water rights holders on Deep Creek and Muddy Creek. By <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>July 23, 2013, the Loma gauge recorded 0.00 cfs, where the flowrate remained through August 6, 2013. However, on August 5, 2013, the flows at Appellees\u2019 points of diversion returned to a level that rendered the call for water in its original state unnecessary. At the time of the July calls for water Teton Prairie was not diverting water because it was shut down to hay.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">\u00b67 Later, in the month of August 2013, flows decreased again to the point to warrant Appellees to make another call for water. On August 15, 2013, the Loma gauge recorded 3.7 mean cfs. By August 19, 2013, the Loma gauge recorded 1.9 mean cfs. On August 22, 2013, the Loma gauge recorded 0.28 mean cfs, and Appellees\u2019 attorney sent another round of call letters to junior users who had been observed diverting water, including Teton Prairie. Despite the call, Teton Prairie continued to divert water, and in response Appellees filed suit in District Court. They claimed wrongful interference of a water right, wrongful diversion of water by a junior water right holder, and requested injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">\u00b68 The parties filed counter-motions for summary judgment. In its motion, Teton Prairie requested the court determine Appellees\u2019 August call for water was futile, and further Appellees\u2019 call for water was not procedurally proper. On June 22, 2015, the District Court issued an amended order granting Appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment and denying Teton Prairie\u2019s counter-motion for summary judgment. The court found Teton Prairie violated the Prior Appropriation Doctrine by ignoring Appellees\u2019 August 22, 2013, call for water. The court further found Appellees\u2019 call for water was not futile because evidence showed water would have reached Appellees\u2019 points of diversion if Teton Prairie had stopped diverting, and significant material facts exist to preclude determining Appellees failed to make a \u201cvalid\u201d call for water. The court enjoined Teton Prairie from \u201ccontinuing out-of-order diversions of water after receiving call letters from senior appropriators on the Teton River, including those from [Appellees].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">\u00b69 We review a district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment de novo and apply the same criteria found in M. R. Civ. P. 56. <em>Mont. Trout Unlimited v. Mont. Dep\u2019t of Natural Res. &amp; Conservation, </em>2006 MT 72, \u00b6 17, 331 Mont. 483, 133 P.3d 224. We determine whether the court correctly applied the law. <em>Mont. Trout Unlimited, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">\u00b610 <em>1. Whether the District Court correctly applied the Prior </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number><em>Appropriation Doctrine pursuant to \u00a7 85-2-401(1), MCA.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">\u00b611 Historically, a water right could be acquired by taking possession of water on the public domain and putting it to beneficial use. <em>Mettler v. Ames Realty Co., </em>61 Mont. 152, 159-60, 201 P. 702, 703-04 (1921). This customary possessory taking of water developed into a rule referred to as the Prior Appropriation Doctrine, which is longstanding in Montana water law. <em>Mettler, </em>61 Mont. 152, 201 P. 702; <em>Toohey v. Campbell, </em>24 Mont. 13, 17-18, 60 P. 396, 397 (1900). The Montana Water Use Act explicitly recognizes the Prior Appropriation Doctrine, and states \u201c[a]s between appropriators, the first in time is the first in right.\u201d Section 85-2-401(1), MCA. The fundamental underlying precept of the doctrine is timing \u2014 wherein he who first acquires a right to water is entitled to his full appropriation (limited by needs and facilities) before subsequent right holders may maximize their rights. <em>Meine v. Ferris, </em>126 Mont. 210, 216, 247 P.2d 195, 198 (1952) (quoting <em>Mettler, </em>61 Mont. at 159-60, 201 P. at 703); <em>Smith v. Duff, </em>39 Mont. 382, 387-88, 102 P. 984, 985 (1909). If a senior appropriator found he was not receiving his full appropriation under the doctrine he was allowed some measure of self-help in the form of making a call upon a junior appropriator to cease diversions until the senior\u2019s appropriation was maximized. A. Dan Tarlock, <em>Law of Water Rights and Resources, </em>\u00a7 5:33 (2015 ed.). Unless futile, a junior appropriator, who is said to have taken notice of prior conditions upon his subsequent appropriation, must heed the senior\u2019s call. Tarlock, \u00a7 5:33; <em>Quigley v. McIntosh, </em>110 Mont. 495, 505, 103 P.2d 1067, 1072 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">\u00b612 Teton Prairie argues Appellees\u2019 August call for water was invalid because Appellees only made calls to \u201cselective\u201d junior appropriators who were observed actively diverting water. Further, Teton Prairie contends Appellees should have ordered the call in priority of the most recent priority date first, and so forth. It is undisputed that all of Teton Prairie\u2019s water rights are junior to all of Appellees\u2019 rights.</p>\n<p id=\"AMY\">\u00b613  The District Court properly noted there is no statutory or judicial procedure that required Appellees to follow a specific method of making a call. Under the law Appellees are allowed \u2014 as is Teton Prairie \u2014 to maximize their appropriations by requesting injurious junior appropriators cease harming their senior water rights. If a senior\u2019s water right is injured by a junior\u2019s use, any and all juniors injuring the senior are equally answerable for the injury. <em>Helena v. Rogan, </em>26 Mont. 452, 470, 68 P. 798, 800 (1902).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">\u00b614 In essence, Teton Prairie suggests Appellees should have made a call to the most recent priority date, waited to determine if Appellees\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>rights were fully restored, and if not then continued making calls in reverse priority. To require a senior appropriator to make calls upon juniors in such a strict order of reverse priority is contrary to the purpose of the doctrine. From the perspective of the senior all actively injurious juniors are one-and-the-same. Here, the record clearly shows Appellees were actively observing flows at their points of diversion, monitoring available streamflow data throughout the months of July and August, and communicating with various upstream junior users about their water use. In this instance, Appellees followed a reasonable method of making calls for water when they determined their rights were impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">\u00b615 Additionally, although Teton Prairie suggests Appellees should have waited until the river was completely dry to make their calls, it is not disputed that the river\u2019s flowrate was rapidly decreasing, and within days of Appellees\u2019 August call for water the river was completely dry. Whether or not Appellees waited for two days until there was no recordable water flow at the downriver USGS gauge station to notify junior appropriators of their call does not repudiate that senior Appellees were not receiving the full extent of their rights, and junior Teton Prairie ignored a call for water. The crux of this case involves the application of the Prior Appropriation Doctrine, and is not determined by the precise moment in time at which Appellees\u2019 rights were harmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">\u00b616 We further note that while the USGS stream gauge data are helpful metrics to understand and quantify streamflow, they do not definitively show whether Appellees were or were not receiving the full extent of their rights on a given date due to the dynamics of the river and the types of Appellees\u2019 water rights. Even in the event a call is honored an instantaneous increase in flowrate is unlikely to occur. Here, the record indicates it would take several days for water to reach Appellees\u2019 points of diversion after upstream users ceased diverting. Under these facts, with these types of water rights involved, we will not require such a burdensome administration of the Prior Appropriation Doctrine. <em>Raymond v. Wimsette, </em>12 Mont. 551, 560, 31 P. 537, 540 (1892) (stating a senior appropriator \u201cis entitled to insist that ... water remain, in order to carry the flow down to his point of diversion, although a large portion of it would be lost by evaporation and percolation.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"AVv\">\u00b617  We hold that the District Court correctly applied the Prior Appropriation Doctrine when it found junior Teton Prairie improperly ignored a call for water by senior appropriators. Therefore, based on the undisputed facts Appellees were entitled to judgment as a matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>of law that Teton Prairie violated the Prior Appropriation Doctrine when it continued to divert water from the Teton River after receiving Appellees\u2019 call for water.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">\u00b618 <em>2. Whether the District Court correctly found that Teton Prairie failed to establish the necessary elements to raise the defense of Futile Call Doctrine.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">\u00b619 The Futile Call Doctrine is an affirmative defense that a junior water right holder may invoke when the junior elects not to honor a call for water made by a senior appropriator. Tarlock, \u00a7 5:33; <em>Fort v. Dep\u2019t of Ecology, </em>135 P.3d 515, 518 (Wash. 2006). Under the doctrine, a call for water is deemed futile if the amount of water necessary to meet an appropriation will not reach a senior appropriator\u2019s point of diversion because of carriage losses. Tarlock, \u00a7 5:33. The underlying idea behind the Futile Call Doctrine is that the primary purpose of water appropriation is to put water to beneficial use. <em>Power v. Switzer, </em>21 Mont. 523, 529, 55 P. 32, 35 (1898). If a junior is required to respond to a call for water and the outcome will result in no beneficial use by the senior but only in the waste of water, then the junior is excused from responding to the call, and the waste, which is factually and legally undesirable, will be avoided. <em>Fort, </em>135 P.3d at 518; <em>State ex rel. Crowley v. Dist. Court, </em>108 Mont. 89, 103, 88 P.2d 23, 29-30 (1939). \u00b620 [4] While the defense of futile call has not explicitly been adopted in Montana, we have long recognized that the burden is placed on the junior user to show his actions are not injurious to the senior. <em>Donich v. Johnson, </em>77 Mont. 229, 241, 250 P. 963, 966 (1926). Therefore, in this case, Teton Prairie, in seeking to excuse its disregard of Appellees\u2019 call, was required to show no useable water would reach Appellees\u2019 points of diversion. <em>Irion v. Hyde, </em>110 Mont. 570, 581-82, 105 P.2d 666, 673 (1940); <em>Raymond, </em>12 Mont. at 560, 31 P. at 540. Here, testimony revealed Appellees were not receiving the full extent of their water rights. Expert testimony revealed usable water could have traveled to the Appellees\u2019 points of diversion between five to ten days after Teton Prairie ceased diverting. Therefore, the District Court correctly found that Teton Prairie failed to establish the necessary elements to successfully invoke the defense of futile call to defend its failure to respond to Appellees\u2019 call for water.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">\u00b621 <em>3. Whether the District Court\u2019s injunction was proper.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">\u00b622 By statute a district court\u2019s jurisdiction includes the supervision ofwater distribution amongst appropriators. Section 85-2-406(1), MCA. Furthermore, a court has the authority to grant an injunction when it appears the applicant is entitled to the relief sought, and the relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>entails the restraint of the continuance of the complained of act, or when the continuance of the act would produce great or irreparable injury. Section 27-19-201, MCA. The availability of injunctive relief is vested in \u201cthe sound discretion of the district court, ... the exercise of which this [Cjourt will not interfere except in instances of manifest abuse.\u201d <em>Parsons v. Mussigbrod, </em>59 Mont. 336, 340-41, 196 P. 528, 529 (1921) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">\u00b623 The District Court granted injunctive relief that \u201cenjoin[sj [Teton Prairie] from continuing out-of-order water diversions after receiving calls for water from senior appropriators on the Teton River.\u201d Teton Prairie argues that the District Court set the scope of the injunction too broadly to include parties outside of the current action. Further, it argues that the injunction lacks sufficient detail and parameters for Teton Prairie to intelligibly follow.</p>\n<p id=\"AHM\">\u00b624  We find that the District Court was well within its authority and sound discretion to grant an injunction in this matter, and we find no instance of manifest abuse. Furthermore, we find that Teton Prairie\u2019s arguments lack merit. The District Court has ordered Teton Prairie to refrain from no more activity than that which is required of it under the Prior Appropriation Doctrine and Montana law. Therefore, we affirm the District Court\u2019s grant of injunctive relief to Appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">\u00b625 For the foregoing reasons, the District Court\u2019s amended order granting Appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment and denying Teton Prairie\u2019s counter-motion for summary judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b207-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER and SHEA concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b207-10\">JUSTICE RICE,</author>\n<p id=\"Abq\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-11\">\u00b626 I concur with the results reached by the Court and write separately to offer additional observations. This important case addresses water law issues for which we have no prior precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-12\">\u00b627 Under Issue 1, Teton Prairie argues that Appellees were required to make their August 22, 2013 call \u201cin reverse priority to every water right holder,\u201d rather than limiting the call to particular junior appropriators it had observed using water. Teton Prairie labels Appellees\u2019 action a \u201cselective call\u201d that shifts the enforcement burden from senior appropriators to junior appropriators to enforce their relative seniority over other junior appropriators, and that altogether relieves those junior appropriators who were not observed using water from curtailing their use. Teton Prairie calls this a \u201ctrickle down enforcement effect\u201d that conflicts with orderly administration of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>Prior Appropriation Doctrine and that fails to consider the relative priority of junior claims. It quotes a brief statement in an August 30, 2011, memorandum from the Montana Water Policy Interim Committee that \u201c[t]he senior will call each user in the order of the most junior to the most senior until the right is satisfied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">\u00b628 As logically appealing as this argument initially sounds, I find it significant that Teton Prairie cited to no case precedent supporting the proposition that calls must be made rigidly in the order of priority, from most junior to most senior, and my search likewise revealed no such authority. As the District Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-5\">There is no authority for Teton Prairie\u2019s contention that a junior water rights holder may simply not comply with a senior water rights holder\u2019s call for water because every other junior rights holder has not been called. It is possible that best practices would lead to the senior water rights holder calling all junior water rights holders, including groundwater rights holders, but to impose the absolute obligation that these calls must be made before any call is \u201cvalid,\u201d is against the spirit of the prior appropriation doctrine. Any mistake being made by a senior rights holder making a call for water being reason enough for a junior rights holder to ignore the call would unnecessarily restrict the rights of senior water rights holders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-6\">Presumably under Teton Prairie\u2019s interpretation, any junior water rights holder could continue diverting water until they are satisfied that all other junior rights holders have been called, which could mean days or weeks of senior rights holders not having their rights met. In the instant case, the Plaintiffs made calls for water on every junior water rights holder that they observed using water from the Teton River and only Teton Prairie did not comply.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">Given the lack of contrary authority, I believe the practicalities cited here by the District Court demonstrate that the Prior Appropriation Doctrine is best applied by requiring Appellees\u2019 call to Teton Prairie to be honored. Perhaps the future development of technology will make it possible for calls to be efficiently and immediately communicated to junior appropriators in the exact order of priority, or a Water Commissioner will be appointed to provide on-the-ground management of the issue, but, based on the manner in which the system currently operates, I agree with the Court that the District Court correctly decided the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">\u00b629 The other argument made by Teton Prairie under Issue 1 is that the Appellees made an improper \u201cpre-emptive call\u201d because, at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>time of their August 22, 2013 call, it is undisputed that Appellees \u201chad water flowing past their respective diversion points in excess of the amounts adjudicated at the time the call was made.\u201d Citing the principle that \u201ca prior right may be exercised only to the extent of the necessities of the owner of such prior right and when devoted to a beneficial purpose within the limits of the right[,]\u201d <em>Cook v. Hudson, </em>110 Mont. 263, 282-83, 103 P.2d 137, 146 (1940), Teton Prairie contends that Appellees were limited to the water necessary for their beneficial use, and that the District Court, by approving a call made before Appellees\u2019 water fell below their allotted rights, permitted Appellees to \u201cexceed their adjudicated water rights.\u201d Teton Prairie contends that Appellees can now make calls \u201cwith no parameters or limits\u201d and that they have the right to subjectively \u201ccall whenever they believe water may become deficient at some point in the future,\u201d even an \u201cunquantified\u201d and unlimited amount of water.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">\u00b630 Teton Prairie supports its assertion that Appellees had enough water at the time of their call by use of a formula for calculating the flowrate necessary to satisfy an animal unit, referencing a DNRC guideline, up to the maximum number of livestock to be serviced, as adjudicated by the Water Court for Appellees\u2019 stockwater rights. Appellees respond that their stockwater rights were not adjudicated with flowrates by the Water Court, and that Teton Prairie\u2019s use of this formula constitutes a collateral attack on their water rights. Teton Prairie replies that such calculations have been previously used to quantify the flowrate of stockwater rights, citing a Water Master\u2019s Report.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">\u00b631 As Teton Prairie notes, the Water Court has stated that a flowrate measurement for a stockwater right \u201cmay be difficult to make.\u201d <em>In re Jefferson River Basin, </em>Mont. Water Co., 1993 Mont. Water LEXIS 7 (Sept. 21, 1993). While I do not categorically reject efforts to quantify a stockwater right flowrate, as such calculations could be useful in the right context, I find it unnecessary to resort to such a calculation to resolve the issue presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">\u00b632 In its ruling, the District Court accepted that Teton Prairie was factually correct about the status of water available to Appellees when they issued the August 22, 2013 call. However, it determined that Teton Prairie\u2019s objection to the call was practically \u201cuntenable\u201d because the Teton River was rapidly dropping near the Appellees\u2019 properties at the Loma gauge, and expert testimony had agreed it would take days, perhaps 5 to 10, for water at Teton Prairie\u2019s diversion to reach Appellees\u2019 property. The court concluded that Appellees\u2019 need for more water was \u201cclearly obvious\u201d and that they were not obligated \u201cto wait <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>until the river goes dry,\u201d and their rights to become unsatisfied, before making a call. Similarly, Appellees argue on appeal that, based on their \u201csignificant historical experience\u201d with this river system and the \u201cdynamic nature of river systems\u201d generally, \u201cit was reasonable for Appellees to make calls for water when trends in the flows indicated that the river soon would be dry[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">\u00b633 The parties\u2019 properties on this system are some 200 river miles apart. Even the expert witnesses could not state with exactness the timing and the impact of Teton Prairie\u2019s cessation of water use upon Appellees\u2019 properties. The current nature of this science is inexact. However, Appellees\u2019 call was made with reasonable knowledge that the loss of sufficient water to sustain their rights was imminent, or in the words of the District Court, was \u201cclearly obvious.\u201d At such a point, I believe senior appropriative rights may be enforced by making the call. It is important to remember that the burden rests on a senior appropriator to make his needs known, or junior appropriators cannot be faulted when the senior runs dry. <em>See Cook, </em>110 Mont. at 283, 103 P.2d at 146 (\u201cWhen the one holding the prior right does not need the water, such prior right is temporarily suspended and the next right or rights in the order of priority may use the water <em>until such time as the prior appropriator\u2019s needs justify his demanding that the junior appropriator or appropriators give way to his superior claim\u201d) </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">\u00b634 Another reason such a rule is necessary is that requiring the river to run dry at a senior appropriator\u2019s place of use would feed a junior appropriator\u2019s futile call defense. Once carrier water is depleted and the bed is dry, a larger amount of water is needed to satisfy a downstream right, increasing the chances a junior appropriator could sustain a futile call claim. <em>See Irion, </em>110 Mont. at 581-82, 105 P.2d at 673. Senior appropriators should not be forced to delay a call and thereby increase the risk of that they will lose a futile call claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">\u00b635 These reasons also undermine Teton Prairie\u2019s argument that material factual conflicts prevented summary judgment on its futile call claim. Assuming Deep Creek was dry in places, there was also evidence that water was flowing in some places through Deep Creek. The strength of the expert testimony, as noted by the Court, that additional water could have flowed to Appellees\u2019 properties on the Teton River upon Teton Prairie\u2019s cessation, even if the exact timing was in question, demonstrates that Teton Prairie had not satisfied its burden under <em>Irion.
