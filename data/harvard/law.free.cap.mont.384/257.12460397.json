We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-24\">\u00b62 Allen raises the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-25\">\n<em>1. Did the District Court err by denying the motion to dismiss </em>\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>\n<em>multiple charges of violating an order of protection pursuant to \u00a7 46-11-410(2), MCA?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-5\">\n<em>2. Did the District Court err by denying the motion to dismiss multiple charges of violating an order of protection on double jeopardy grounds ?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">\u00b63 Because we conclude that Issue 2 was not preserved for appeal, we address Issue 1 only.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">\u00b64 On September 9, 2014, Allen sent a series of messages by text, Facebook, and phone to his former girlfriend, B.D. B.D. had previously obtained an Order of Protection against Allen prohibiting him from contacting her. Allen sent B.D. a total of 35 individual messages in a two-hour period. B.D. alerted the police to the unwanted messages. The content of Allen\u2019s messages ranged from obscenities, to apologies, to admissions he was drinking, to declarations of love, to indications he knew B.D. had called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">\u00b65 The State charged Allen by Information with 35 counts of violating an Order of Protection under \u00a7 45-5-626, MCA. Allen moved to dismiss 34 of the 35 counts on the grounds that the offenses were \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d rather than a series of individual crimes. The District Court denied the motion. Allen then entered a plea agreement with the State. Pursuant to the plea agreement, the State dropped all charges of violating an Order of Protection and Allen instead entered a guilty plea to one count of felony stalking. In the agreement, Allen reserved his right to appeal the denial of his motion to dismiss. He appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b284-11\">\u00b66 A district court\u2019s denial of a motion to dismiss is reviewed de novo. <em>State v. Zink, </em>2014 MT 48, \u00b6 9, 374 Mont. 102, 319 P.3d 596 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-12\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b284-13\">\u00b67 <em>1. Did the District Court err by denying the motion to dismiss multiple charges of violating an order of protection pursuant to \u00a7 46-11-410(2), MCA?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b284-15\">\u00b68 \u201cWhen the same transaction may establish the commission of more than one offense, a person charged with the conduct may be <em>prosecuted </em>for each offense.\u201d Section 46-11-410(1), MCA (emphasis added). \u201cA defendant may not, however, be <em>convicted </em>of more than one offense if ... the offense is defined to prohibit a continuing course of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>conduct and the defendant\u2019s course of conduct was interrupted, unless the law provides that the specific periods of conduct constitute separate offenses.\u201d Section 46-11-410(2)(e), MCA (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">\u00b69 Allen argues he could only be charged with one offense because his actions formed the same transaction and the crime of violating an order of protection is intended to prohibit a continuing course of conduct. Thus, according to Allen, \u00a7 46-11-410(2)(e), MCA, quoted above, barred the State from charging him with multiple offenses for violating the order of protection. We disagree for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">\u00b610 First, we recently held that the statute criminalizing the violation of an order of protection\u2014\u00a7 45-5-626, MCA\u2014is not \u201cdefined to prohibit a continuing course of conduct.\u201d <em>State v. Strong, </em>2015 MT 251, \u00b6 19, 380 Mont. 471, 356 P.3d 1078. Therefore, \u00a7 45-5-626, MCA, does not come within the multiple conviction prohibition stated in \u00a7 46-11-410(2)(e), MCA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">\u00b611 Second, Allen fails to note the critical distinction between the two subsections of \u00a7 46-11-410, MCA, upon which this case turns. As emphasized in the quotations of the statute above, \u00a7 46-11-410(1), MCA, uses the word \u201cprosecute!],\u201d and, as we have explained, this provision \u201cexpressly allows a person to be charged with and prosecuted for multiple offenses arising out of the same transaction.\u201d <em>State v. Dixon, </em>2000 MT 82, \u00b6 49, 299 Mont. 165, 998 P.2d 544. In contrast, \u00a7 46-11-410(2), MCA, uses the word \u201cconvictfion],\u201d which \u201cprohibits the State from convicting a defendant of more than one offense\u201d if the offense is within the purview of \u00a7 46-11-410(2), MCA. <em>Dixon, </em>\u00b6 49 (emphasis in original). By its plain language, \u00a7 46-11-410(2), MCA, is not implicated by the State\u2019s <em>charging </em>decisions. Rather, it is implicated only after a conviction is obtained, and even then, only when a defendant is convicted of multiple offenses. <em>See Dixon, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 48-50. Thus, even if a charged offense falls within its purview, \u00a7 46-11-410(2), MCA, provides no avenue for Allen to challenge the State\u2019s charging decisions because it does not prohibit the State from charging a defendant with more than one offense. <em>Dixon, </em>\u00b6 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">\u00b612 Although we have previously stated \u201ca defendant may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>prosecuted for more than one offense arising from the \u2018same transaction\u2019 unless the charges are among those described in subsection (2),\u201d <em>Strong, </em>\u00b6 17 (quoting <em>State v. Goodenough, </em>2010 MT 247, \u00b6 16, 358 Mont. 219, 245 P.3d 14), the issue in both <em>Strong </em>and <em>Goodenough </em>was not whether the State could <em>charge </em>multiple offenses, but instead whether a defendant could be <em>convicted </em>of multiple offenses, making it unnecessary in those cases to make this distinction. <em>Strong, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 16-19; <em>Goodenough, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 14-18.</p>\n<p id=\"a9s-dedup-0\">\u00b613  Allen contends that if his argument is not accepted, \u201cthe statute could be used as an unreasonable weapon\u201d because \u201cif the matter is simply one of prosecutorial discretion or largesse, an overly zealous prosecutor could have levied an individual charge against Allen for every character typed into the text message.\u201d Allen raises a viable policy concern, but it is not for the judiciary to undertake review of the State\u2019s charging decisions absent a statutory or constitutional violation. <em>See Strong, </em>\u00b6 23 (\u201cCharging decisions are generally within the prosecutor\u2019s exclusive domain, and the separation of powers [doctrine] mandates judicial respect for the prosecutor\u2019s independence.\u201d) (internal quotations and citation omitted). By its plain language, \u00a7 46-11-410, MCA, is not violated, or even implicated, by the State\u2019s charging decisions, and therefore provides no mechanism for courts to examine those decisions. The District Court correctly denied Allen\u2019s motion to dismiss thirty-four charges of violating an order of protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">\u00b614 <em>2. Did the District Court err when it denied the motion to dismiss multiple charges of violating an order of protection on double jeopardy </em>grounds?</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">\u00b615 Allen made a passing reference to double jeopardy in his briefing before the District Court, but did not develop a constitutional argument. As such, Allen\u2019s constitutional claim is not preserved for our review. <em>See In re G.S., </em>2002 MT 245, \u00b6 48, 312 Mont. 108, 59 P.3d 1063 (general references to constitutional provisions in the district court insufficient to preserve those issues for appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">\u00b616 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b286-9\">JUSTICES SHEA, BAKER, COTTER and WHEAT concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b285-9\"> The State notes that, in contrast to the defendant in <em>Strong, </em>who pled and was sentenced to three counts, Allen pled and was sentenced to only one count under the plea agreement, but does not argue that the issues raised here have been mooted by Allen\u2019s single conviction. Allen states in reply that, upon the denial of his motion to dismiss, he faced a \u201cplethora of charges\u201d that could have been sustained had he proceeded to trial and been convicted, and thus he \u201cresolved this case through a plea agreement to one count of stalking.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
