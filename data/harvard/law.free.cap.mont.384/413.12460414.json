Whether the District Court abused its discretion by granting Guardian\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-12\">\n<em>2.

To protect A.M.M. and her substantial assets, the court appointed Poison attorney Casey Emerson as A.M.M.\u2019s guardian; and son Paul Jr., son Timothy, and Wold as A.M.M.\u2019s joint conservators. On October 7, 2014, the court granted Timothy\u2019s voluntary withdrawal as Co-Conservator.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">\u00b64 On January 2, 2015, Guardian filed a motion for preliminary injunction and temporary restraining order asking the District Court to enjoin Timothy and Genet from engaging in certain activities Guardian believed were detrimental to A.M.M.\u2019s health. On January 7, 2015, the court held a hearing on Guardian\u2019s motion. The morning of the hearing, Genet acted as Timothy\u2019s attorney by filing a pleading on his behalf. However, twelve minutes before the hearing, Timothy filed a \u201cNotice of Withdrawal of Attorney and My Appearance Pro Se.\u201d At the hearing, the court denied Genet leave to withdraw as Timothy\u2019s attorney due to Genet\u2019s failure to comply with the rules governing withdrawals and because \u201c[t]his is the latest in a pattern of conduct in which Tim has attempted to frustrate and delay scheduled hearings, which began with the earliest hearings in this case.\u201d Genet did not appear at the hearing. Timothy was physically present, but the court denied him leave to appear pro se because he had counsel of record, Genet.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">\u00b65 On February 4, 2015, the District Court issued findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a preliminary injunction. The court found A.M.M. \u201csuffers from dementia and other health conditions which are exacerbated by stress, anxiety, and sleep interference\u201d and, according to her treating physician, \u201cIa|ny thing that contributes to a higher stress and anxiety level is detrimental to her physical, mental and emotional well-being.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">\u00b66 The District Court found Timothy and Genet had engaged in activities negatively impacting A.M.M., her caregivers, and Guardian. For example, Timothy and Genet \u201cstrongly objected\u201d to a trip A.M.M. planned to take during winter to visit her daughter Sheila where she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>lived in California. \u201cAlthough they would apparently not object to [A.M.M.] going to Arizona or Hawaii with Tim accompanying her, they contended this trip to California would be detrimental to her health.\u201d They tried to prevent her from going. Evidence in the record showed that they \u201cloudly read the newspaper, within [A.M.M.\u2019s] hearing, about the Air Asia plane crash,\u201d talked about earthquakes in California, and took A.M.M. to a new doctor and \u201ccoached her to be \u2018strong\u2019 and tell this doctor that she did not want to go.\u201d Timothy and Genet \u201chave disparaged and insulted\u201d A.M.M.\u2019s caregivers, called one an obscene name, accused others of stealing towels or glasses, and created an \u201cunpleasant and difficult work environment for these caregivers.\u201d Timothy and Genet \u201chave interfered with and ignored the authority of the Guardian\u201d and \u201chave been inappropriately aggressive and accusatory toward the Guardian.\u201d The court found further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-4\">Two of [A.M.M.\u2019s] children, Tim McCann and Genet McCann, during the pendency of this action, have acted in ways that caused significant stress and anxiety to [A.M.M.]. This situation has continued for a year. It appears that Tim and Genet love their mother, but do not grasp that their actions are harming her. Both are intelligent, educated people. However, despite repeated and clear attempts to communicate this reality to them (that their actions are harming their mother\u2019s health), they appear to either be unable to understand this, or unable or unwilling to modify their behavior. Any judge would be reluctant to restrict adult children\u2019s time with their mother, but this situation should not be allowed to continue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">\u00b67 The District Court\u2019s preliminary injunction restricted Timothy and Genet\u2019s time with A.M.M., but allowed them to attend church with A.M.M. and visit her, at her home, between 9 a.m. and 12 p.m., if she was awake and either a caregiver or Guardian was present. The injunction stated that the restrictions did not apply to family gatherings where other siblings or relatives were present. It also provided that either Timothy or Genet could request a modification of its terms. The preliminary injunction required Timothy and Genet to return their keys to A.M.M.\u2019s home. It also enjoined them from discussing, either with or in front of A.M.M., \u201cfinancial matters, legal proceedings, feuds or difficulties between siblings, or any other matters which will foreseeably cause additional stress and anxiety for [A.M.M.] \u201d or \u201cmake derogatory remarks within [A.M.M.\u2019s] hearing, about the Guardian, Conservators, caregivers, or any relatives\u201d and \u201c[t]hey shall not speak with [A.M.M.] about this Preliminary Injunction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b443-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>\u00b68 On February 13,2015, Co-Conservators filed a motion for Rule 11 sanctions against Genet, but later withdrew it. On March 2, 2015, Genet filed a request for Rule 11 sanctions against Wold and a request that Judge Manley recuse himself. Genet argued she should not be sanctioned, but that Wold should be sanctioned for filing \u201cfrivolous Motions,\u201d and accused Judge Manley of \u201cbias,\u201d being in an \u201cunethical association\u201d with Wold, and employing Wold\u2019s daughter as his judicial assistant. Both \u201crequests\u201d were denied. On May 22, 2015, Genet filed a motion for recusal wherein she reiterated her earlier arguments, accusation of bias, and added felonious accusations against Guardian, alleging she had committed \u201ccriminal tampering with a subpoenaed witness\u201d and \u201cengaging in official criminal misconduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">\u00b69 In its June 24, 2015, order, the District Court noted that during the hearing on May 22, 2015, Genet was \u201ccontrite and apologetic for her words and tone used in her pleadings.\u201d The court noted that Genet cited her lack of legal experience for her conduct and appeared to be sincere. \u201cHowever, three minutes before the hearing began, [Genet] filed a 22 page motion for recusal and brief. This was similar to previous motions for recusal filed herein, except perhaps even more vitriolic.\u201d Genet \u201cfiled this offensive pleading <em>pro se, </em>even though she was represented by two attorneys who were, in fact, personally present in the courtroom across the hall from the clerk\u2019s office.\u201d The court concluded the motion\u2019s \u201callegations of misconduct against Mr. Wold and the Court are without factual or legal basis, and were made without inquiry reasonable under the circumstances.\u201d The court noted \u201c[t]he juxtaposition of [Genet\u2019s] oral contrition and written vitriol is unusual, to say the least, and raises serious question[s about] whether she is capable of conforming her behavior to acceptable standards of practice and civility.\u201d Genet had formed a \u201cpattern of frivolous, incompetent, offensive and unfounded allegations made against numerous attorneys and others in past pleadings.\u201d The District Court found her in violation of Rule 11 and imposed sanctions. Genet was required to pay reasonable attorney fees and costs incurred by Guardian and Co-conservators in connection with the Rule 11 matter and prohibited from filing \u201cany other pleadings in this case, unless such pleading is also signed by a licensed, practicing Montana lawyer.\u201d Genet and Timothy appeal, asserting various constitutional violations and other forms of prejudice suffered at the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">\u00b610 A district court has broad discretion to grant or deny a preliminary injunction and we review the court\u2019s decision for an abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>of that discretion. <em>Cole v.

Whether the District Court abused its discretion by granting Guardian\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction.</em></p>\n<p id=\"ah8-dedup-0\">\u00b612  Timothy and Genet argue the District Court abused its discretion by granting Guardian\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction. First, Timothy and Genet argue the preliminary injunction violated several of A.M.M.\u2019s constitutional rights. However, we have already held that Timothy lacks standing and cannot \u201cassert A.M.M.\u2019s constitutional due-process rights.\u201d <em>A.M.M. I, </em>\u00b6 28. Likewise, Timothy lacks standing to assert any new violations of A.M.M.\u2019s constitutional rights and, for these same reasons, Genet also lacks standing. <em>See A.M.M. I, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 24-29. Timothy and Genet lack standing to present arguments premised upon A.M.M.\u2019s constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"adx-dedup-0\">\u00b613  Next, Timothy and Genet argue the District Court violated each of their constitutional rights to due process and equal protection by granting the preliminary injunction. However, Timothy and Genet do not advance any authority for their proposition that the constitutional rights of adult children are implicated in the guardianship and conservatorship proceedings of an incapacitated parent. The focus of these proceedings is on A.M.M. and her well-being. \u201cGuardianship for an incapacitated person may be used only as is necessary to promote and protect the well-being of the person.\u201d Section 72-5-306, MCA. We have stated that \u201ca petition to appoint a guardian is not an adversarial proceeding, but rather a proceeding to promote the best interests of the person for whom guardianship is sought.\u201d <em>In re Estate of Bayers, </em>1999 MT 154, \u00b6 14, 295 Mont. 89, 983 P.2d 339 (citation omitted). Timothy and Genet have not demonstrated that they have standing to present arguments premised on a violation of their own constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>\u00b614 Timothy and Genet argue \u00a7 27-19-303, MCA, \u201censures a respondent to an injunction order is afforded an opportunity to be heard.\u201d They argue Timothy was denied that opportunity at the show cause hearing when the District Court denied Genet leave to withdraw as Timothy\u2019s attorney and denied Timothy leave to appear pro se.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">\u00b615 \u201cAn injunction is an order requiring a person to refrain from a particular act.\u201d Section 27-19-101, MCA. Before granting an injunction, a hearing is required to show cause \u201cwhy the injunction should not be granted.\u201d Section 27-19-301(2), MCA. \u201cThe injunction order may be granted after the hearing\u201d and at the hearing \u201ceach party may present affidavits or oral testimony.\u201d Section 27-19-303(1), (2), MCA. \u201cThe attorney in an action or special proceeding may be changed at any time before or after judgment\u201d upon consent of both client and attorney or by court order \u201cupon the application of either client or attorney, after notice from one to the other.\u201d Section 37-61-403, MCA. Additionally, the Montana Uniform District Court Rules require that an attorney who withdraws from representing a party to a civil proceeding to \u201cinform the court and all other parties of the full name and address of his/her client.\u201d M.U.D.C.R. 10(a). Then, the opposing party must give the newly unrepresented party notice that the party is required to appoint new counsel within twenty one days or appear pro se in further proceedings. M.U.D.C.R. 10(b). This Court has stated that we require \u201cstrict compliance\u201d with the requirements of Rule 10. <em>Stewart v. Rice, </em>2013 MT 55, \u00b6 32, 369, Mont. 203, 296 P.3d 1174 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"AFsc\">\u00b616 The District Court held a show cause hearing on January 7, 2015. This hearing provided Timothy with an opportunity to show cause \u201cwhy the injunction should not be granted.\u201d However, Timothy initiated a change in representation twelve minutes prior to the beginning of the hearing. Genet acted as Timothy\u2019s attorney, by filing a pleading on his behalf earlier that day, but did not appear at the hearing. There was no indication Genet was unavailable to represent Timothy at the hearing. The District Court denied Genet leave to withdraw and Timothy leave to proceed pro se for their failure to comply with \u00a7 37-61-403, MCA, because doing so would cause delay, and the court recognized that Timothy had a pattern of \u201cfrustratfing] and delaying] scheduled hearings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">\u00b617 Timothy\u2019s attempt to change representation did not meet the requirements of \u00a7 37-61-403, MCA, because his \u201cNotice of Withdrawal of Attorney and My Appearance Pro Se\u201d did not indicate whether Genet had either consented to her withdrawal or been given notice from Timothy. In its order denying Genet leave to withdraw, the District Court stated, \u201cBecause of [M.U.D.C.R. 10], the last-minute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>attempt (or last 12 minute attempt), to change from a represented party to a <em>pro se </em>party would have required immediately vacating the hearing, and the represented parties to give [Timothy] notice of all the information required by Rule 10(b), and a delay of at least 21 days before the hearing could be held pursuant to Rule 10(d).\u201d Reviewing the record prior to the show cause hearing, Timothy was initially represented by the law firm Datsopoulos, MacDonald, and Lind, who then withdrew; Genet, who then withdrew; Wendell B. Dunn, who then withdrew; and then again by Genet. In between being represented by counsel, Timothy proceeded pro se. The District Court could have denied Genet leave to withdraw and Timothy leave to appear pro se for any one of the reasons upon which it relied and did not abuse its discretion by denying both motions.</p>\n<p id=\"A-6\">\u00b618  Evidence showed Timothy and Genet\u2019s behavior was inappropriate, disruptive, and not in A.M.M.\u2019s best interests. The preliminary injunction\u2019s restrictions were reasonable and furthered A.M.M.\u2019s best interests while still allowing Timothy and Genet to maintain a relationship with A.M.M. The District Court followed proper procedures by holding a hearing and providing an opportunity for Timothy and Genet to show why it should not grant Guardian\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction. The District Court did not abuse its discretion by granting the preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">\u00b619 <em>2. Whether the District Court erred by denying Genet\u2019s motion to recuse.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">\u00b620 On March 2,2015, Genet requested Judge Manley recuse himself. Responding to her request, the District Court stated \u201cGenet has not filed a motion for substitution pursuant to MCA 3-1-804, or a motion for disqualification for cause with affidavit of prejudice pursuant to MCA 3-1-805.\u201d The court denied Genet\u2019s request. On May 22, 2015, hours before the hearing set for Rule 11 and contempt proceedings, Genet filed a \u201cMotion for Recusal form DG 14-2; or in the alternative, Motion for Recusal for Rule 11 Contempt Proceedings; Brief in Support.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">\u00b621 A party in a civil action may move to disqualify a judge. Preliminarily, we must note that the issue of whether Genet, daughter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>of the protected person, is a party to these proceedings has not been raised by any of the litigants and is therefore not before us. Further, it is not necessary to decide whether Genet is a \u201cparty\u201d to these proceedings as we resolve the issue based upon the District Court\u2019s reasoning. The procedure for disqualification is set forth in \u00a7 3-1-805, MCA. \u201cWhenever a party to any proceeding in any court shall file an affidavit alleging facts showing personal bias or prejudice of the presiding judge, such judge shall proceed no further in the cause.\u201d Section 3-1-805(1), MCA. The affidavit must be filed more than 30 days before the date set for hearing or trial, must be accompanied by a certificate that it is made in good faith, and, if the affidavit is not proper in form or fails to allege facts showing personal bias or prejudice, the motion maybe set aside as void. Section 3-l-805(l)(a)-(c), MCA. A judge must not sit or act in any action or proceeding to which he is a party, interested, related to a party, related to an attorney, or related to any attorney or member of a firm of attorneys of record for a party. Section 3-1-803, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">\u00b622 Genet failed to file an affidavit alleging bias or prejudice. Instead, on appeal, Genet argues Judge Manley erred by not recusing himself because he violated Montana Rules of Judicial Conduct 2.12 and 2.13 and violated her right to due process. Rule 2.12 governs disqualification. \u201cIDisqualification questions in the Montana state courts are governed by the Montana Code of Judicial Conduct\u201d and, because the Code \u201cprovides more protection than due process requires, most disputes over disqualification will be resolved without resort to the Constitution.\u201d <em>Dunsmore, </em>\u00b6 12 (citations omitted). \u201cA judge shall disqualify himself or herself in any proceeding in which the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned,\u201d including if the judge has a personal bias or personal knowledge of the facts in dispute. M. C. Jud. Cond. Rule 2.12(A). Rule 2.13 governs supervisory duties. \u201cA judge shall require court staff, court officials, and others subject to the judge\u2019s direction and control to act in a manner consistent with the judge\u2019s obligations under this Code.\u201d M. C. Jud. Cond. Rule 2.13.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">\u00b623 Genet argues Judge Manley violated Rule 2.12 because a prior association with Wold created a bias in Wold\u2019s favor and Rule 2.13 because he employed Wold\u2019s daughter as his judicial assistant while she also worked for Wold. The District Court concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-6\">The allegations of misconduct against Mr. Wold and the Court are without factual or legal basis, and were made without inquiry reasonable under the circumstances. [Genet] thereby violated Rule 11. [Genet] offered no evidence to prove the allegations of misconduct were true, or even that she had a reasonable basis for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>repeatedly making those same allegations which had been made in the past, and shown to be without merit. Nor did she offer evidence of reasonable inquiry.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">The District Court proceeded to sanction Genet for her behavior. We agree with the District Court that there is no evidence in the record supporting Genet\u2019s allegation that Judge Manley violated either Rule 2.12 or Rule 2.13. Genet did not file an affidavit alleging bias or prejudice or otherwise comply with \u00a7 3-1-805, MCA. Section 3-1-805, MCA, sets forth a procedure which must be followed when a party believes the presiding judge cannot be fair and impartial in the proceeding. The procedure is designed to provide due process to the aggrieved litigant in a proceeding in which the judge is presumptively fair and impartial. The requirement of an affidavit is therefore not dispensable. We conclude the District Court did not err by denying Genet\u2019s motion to recuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">\u00b624 <em>3. Whether the District Court erred by sanctioning Genet.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">\u00b625 Genet argues the District Court erred by sanctioning her for violating Rule 11 because it was \u201cfundamentally unfair\u201d and her motion to recuse was \u201cwell grounded in fact and law.\u201d \u201cBy presenting to the court a pleading, written motion, or other paper ... an attorney or unrepresented party certifies to the best of the person\u2019s knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances: (1) it is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation\u201d and \u201c(3) the factual contentions have evidentiary support.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 11(b). \u201cIf after notice and a reasonable opportunity to respond, the court determines that Rule 11(b) has been violated, the court may impose an appropriate sanction on any attorney ... responsible for the violation.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 11(c)(1). The court may do this on motion or its own initiative. M. R. Civ. P. 11(c)(2)-(3).</p>\n<p id=\"A4x\">\u00b626  It is apparent from the record that the District Court grew increasingly burdened and frustrated by Timothy and Genet\u2019s behavior. The court warned the parties well before eventually finding Genet in violation of Rule 11 and sanctioning her. The court demonstrated leniency and tolerance, while also urging Timothy and Genet to retain competent counsel. In an order issued February 4, 2015, the court summarized some of the burdens Genet and Timothy\u2019s tactics were placing on it at the time:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-8\">January 7, 2015, Genet McCann caused to be filed a Rule 12(b)(2) Motion to Dismiss Application for TRO and Preliminary Injunction. Both appear to be copies, not originals. Neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>contained a Certificate of Service. She apparently intended to file these on her own behalf, as a party, although at the time she was both denying she is a party, and counsel of record for Timothy McCann, who is a party and her brother.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-4\">Thereafter, on January 12, 2015, Timothy McCann, who by this time was contending he was pro se, filed an \u201cAmended Certificate of Service to [Genet\u2019s] Motion to Quash Application for TRO and Preliminary Injunction\u201d (though not for Genet\u2019s Motion to Dismiss). He may have believed he was acting as Genet\u2019s attorney. On January 13, 2015, Genet filed an \u201cAmended Certificate of Service\u201d for her Rule 12(b) Motion to Dismiss. She did not file an Amended Certificate of Service relating to her defective Motion to Quash. Perhaps she believed Tim had done so as <em>her </em>attorney the day before.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-5\">Simultaneously with these filings, Genet and Tim were filing defective and amended pleadings, (some copies and some originals) for the apparent purpose of asking leave for Genet to withdraw as Tim\u2019s attorney (without actually asking for leave). This frivolous, frothful filing practice is not new. It is a pattern. The Court and parties have had to spend inordinate time on this. [A.M.M.\u2019s] estate is incurring inordinate legal expenses as a result. Tim and Genet have declined to get competent counsel, in favor of this kind of practice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">The court sanctioned Genet on June 24, 2015, based on her May 22, 2015, motion to recuse. In that pleading, Genet repeated accusations that Wold was filing frivolous motions, Judge Manley was biased, and added a new accusation that Guardian committed crimes without providing evidence or providing evidence that she had conducted a reasonable inquiry. The court concluded Genet violated Rule 11 for these reasons. Its conclusion is not clearly erroneous. The District Court did not err by sanctioning Genet.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">\u00b627 The District Court did not abuse its discretion by granting Guardian\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction and did not err by approving the Co-Conservator\u2019s first annual accounting, by denying Genet\u2019s motion to recuse, or by sanctioning Genet.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">\u00b628 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b449-10\">JUSTICES WHEAT, BAKER, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b440-15\"> Timothy and Genet fail to develop several arguments, especially relating to the first annual accounting, or cite relevant, favorable authority to support them. Parties must present a reasoned argument to advance their positions, supported by citations to appropriate authority. M. R. App. P. 12(1)(g). \u201cWhen a party fails to do so, our caselaw is well-settled. We will not consider unsupported issues or arguments.\u201d <em>Griffith v. Butte Sch. Dist. No. 1, </em>2010 MT 246, \u00b6 42, 358 Mont. 193, 244 P.3d 321 (citation omitted). We decline to consider Timothy and Genet\u2019s undeveloped, unsupported arguments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b441-8\"> Additional factual background can be found in Timothy\u2019s first appeal to this Court, <em>In re Guardianship and Conservatorship of A.M.M., </em>2015 MT 250, 380 Mont. 451, 356 P.3d 474 <em>(A.M.M. I).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\" orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"b446-8\"> It is unclear in many pleadings throughout the District Court record and in the briefs on appeal, whether Genet is representing herself, Timothy, or both herself and Timothy. The District Court record shows that Genet argued both that she was not a party to the proceedings and, thus, the District Court lacked jurisdiction over her. Other times she insisted she was a party and her constitutional rights were implicated. Genet\u2019s motion to recuse was, apparently, filed only on her own behalf.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
