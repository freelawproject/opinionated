We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b83-10\">\u00b62 We review the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-11\"><em>Issue One: Did the District court err in denying Kasparek\u2019s motion to suppress evidence obtained pursuant to a search warrant </em>?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3-\"><em>Issue Two: Did the District Court err in denying Kasparek\u2019s motion to suppress his statements while in </em>custody?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b83-13\">\u00b63 On August, 27,2013, Deputy Glacier County Sheriff Justin Stokes (\u201cDeputy Stokes\u201d) responded to a report about a burglary at Judy Como\u2019s (\u201cComo\u201d) residence in Browning, Glacier County, Montana. Como had been working from 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. She told Deputy Stokes that her house had been burglarized during that time. Several items were missing, including several one-hundred dollar bills, a desktop computer, two boxes of jewelry, and ten packs of green Marlboro cigarettes. Como informed Deputy Stokes that her estranged husband Spencer Atchley\u2019s (\u201cAtchley\u201d) drug test results, which were at Como\u2019s residence, were also missing. There were also signs of forced entry on the front door.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-14\">\u00b64 Deputy Stokes then spoke with Como\u2019s neighbor, Doreen Momberg (\u201cMomberg\u201d). Momberg informed the Deputy that she saw a four-door white car with three people inside stop at Como\u2019s residence at 10:30 p.m. These people were later identified as Atchley, Noelle Martin (\u201cMartin\u201d), Atchley\u2019s mother, and Kasparek. Kasparek and Atchley stepped out of the car and entered Como\u2019s residence. Kasparek and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>Atchley then exited the house and left in the white car. Momberg reported that around fifteen minutes later, Kasparek, Atchley, and Martin returned to the house, but that Kasparek re-entered Como\u2019s residence alone. Atchley and Martin left while Kasparek was inside but returned fifteen-twenty minutes later and picked him up.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">\u00b65 Deputy Stokes included all this information in an application for a search warrant for Kasparek\u2019s residence. The District Court issued the warrant. The record shows that upon searching Kasparek\u2019s residence, the police found several of the items missing from Como\u2019s residence. Based on that evidence, Kasparek was arrested and transported to a holding cell. Kasparek was not read his Miranda<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> rights. Captain Tom Seifert of the Glacier County Sheriff s Department (\u201cCaptain Seifert\u201d) testified that around 3:00 p.m., while Kasparek was in the holding cell, Captain Seifert asked Kasparek whether he would like to speak with him, and Kasparek responded that he would \u201crather not.\u201d Captain Seifert left the room and after working for another two hours he went off shift at 5:00 p.m. Captain Seifert went home and then returned to the jail around 8:00 p.m. Upon his return, Captain Seifert again asked Kasparek whether he understood why he was in the holding cell and reminded him that if he wanted to talk, he would have an opportunity do so. Kasparek then suddenly started \u201ctalking very fast\u201d and provided a partial confession. Captain Seifert testified that he immediately stopped Kasparek and read him his <em>Miranda </em>rights, after which Kasparek told Captain Seifert his account of what had happened at the Como residence. Prior to trial, Kasparek made a motion to suppress the evidence found in his residence and the statements he made to Captain Seifert. On July 23, 2014, he pled guilty, reserving his right to appeal the denial of both motions. Kasparek now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">\u00b66 We review a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress evidence to determine whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether the court\u2019s application of the law is correct. <em>State v. Minett, </em>2014 MT 225, \u00b6 7, 376 Mont. 260, 332 P.3d 235.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">\u00b67 <em>Issue One: Did the District Court err in denying Kasparek\u2019s motion to suppress evidence obtained pursuant to a search warrant </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>\u00b68 The Montana Constitution states that \u201c[n]o warrant to search any place, or seize any person or thing shall issue without describing the place to be searched or the person to be seized, or without probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation reduced to writing.\u201d Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 11. Montana\u2019s protections against warrantless searches are consistent with the requirements of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. <em>See State v. Bar-Jonah, </em>2004 MT 344, \u00b6 63, 324 Mont. 278, 102 P.3d 1229. In Montana, a judge shall not issue a warrant unless the application for the search warrant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-5\">(1) states facts sufficient to support probable cause to believe that an offense has been committed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-6\">(2) states facts sufficient to support probable cause to believe that evidence, contraband, or persons connected with the offense may be found;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-7\">(3) particularly describes the place, object, or persons to be searched; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-8\">(4) particularly describes who or what is to be seized.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">Section 46-5-221, MCA. The sufficiency of a warrant is assessed on a case-by-case basis to determine whether any alleged defect in the warrant application is sufficient to affect the substantial rights of the accused. <em>Muir v. Bilderback, </em>2015 MT 180, \u00b6 11, 379 Mont. 459, 353 P.3d 473 (citing <em>State v. West, </em>1998 MT 282, \u00b6 8, 291 Mont. 435, 968 P.2d 289). We have adopted the \u201ctotality of the circumstances test\u201d to evaluate the existence of probable cause in a search warrant application. <em>State v. Reesman, </em>2000 MT 243, \u00b6 24, 301 Mont. 408, 10 P.3d 83. Under that test, we consider if \u201cthe issuing judicial officer [made] a practical, common sense determination, given all the evidence contained in the application for a search warrant, whether a fair probability exists that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.\u201d <em>State v. Barnaby, </em>2006 MT 203, \u00b6 29, 333 Mont. 220, 142 P.3d 809 <em>(citing Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 238, 103 S. Ct. 2317, 2332 (1983)). Furthermore, probable cause must be found within the four corners of the warrant application. <em>Muir, </em>\u00b6 12. The judge\u2019s determination that probable cause exists is entitled to \u201cgreat deference and every reasonable inference possible [must] be drawn to support that determination of probable cause.\u201d <em>Muir, </em>\u00b6 12 (citing <em>State v. Tucker, </em>2008 MT 273, \u00b6 17, 345 Mont. 237, 190 P.3d 1080) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">\u00b69 Kasparek challenges the validity of the search warrant application on the grounds that the application did not contain sufficient facts to support the existence of probable cause, and that the search warrant contained misleading information. First, Kasparek claims that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>search warrant application, as supported by Momberg\u2019s rendition of his activities that night, does not explicitly depict Kasparek burglarizing Como\u2019s home. Kasparek argues that the warrant application only places him at the scene of the crime and mere presence at a crime scene is not sufficient for probable cause. <em>See State v. Nalder, </em>2001 MT 270, \u00b6 15, 307 Mont. 280, 37 P.3d 661.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">\u00b610 However, while it is correct that mere presence at the scene of a crime is not sufficient to exercise a warrantless arrest, that is not the analysis we apply to determine the sufficiency of a search warrant application. <em>Nalder, </em>\u00b6 15. Kasparek conflates the analysis for assessing the legality of an arrest with the existence of probable cause in a search warrant application. In this case, the issuing official had to determine whether \u201ca fair probability exists that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place\u201d based upon the information provided in the warrant application. <em>Barnaby, </em>\u00b6 29. Deputy Stokes investigated the crime scene and after interviewing Como established that the burglary happened between 7:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. Kasparek was identified and seen entering Como\u2019s house twice during that time. The first time Kasparek entered the home he was in the company of Atchley. Atchley and Kasparek entered Como\u2019s house while Como was not there. Fifteen minutes later Kasparek was seen entering the house alone. Although Kasparek was not seen carrying the burglarized items out of the front door, he was seen leaving twenty minutes later. Como also reported that her schedule was known to Atchley. All of this information was included in the application for a search warrant. In sum, the information establishes more than mere presence at the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">\u00b611 Second, Kasparek claims that the search warrant contained misleading information because the application did not include the fact that Atchley had Como\u2019s permission to enter the house or that Momberg did not see Kasparek carry the stolen items out of Como\u2019s residence. In support of his argument, Kasparek cites <em>State v. Worrall, </em>1999 MT 55, \u00b6 33, 293 Mont. 439, 976 P.2d 968. In <em>Worrall, </em>we held that it is the defendant\u2019s burden to show that a search warrant application is deficient and that \u201ca judge or magistrate is required to evaluate only the facts asserted within the four corners of a search warrant application.\u201d <em>Worrall, </em>\u00b6 33 (internal citation omitted). Defendants have long had an opportunity to challenge the legality of searches based primarily on the sufficiency of probable cause in the search warrant application. <em>Tucker, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 <em>17-18; </em>Barnaby, \u00b6 29. However, <em>Worrall </em>has approved assessing information alleged to have been omitted from a search warrant application, and therefore not within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>the four corners of the affidavit. <em>Worrall, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 43-45. <em>Worrall </em>held that the sufficiency of a search warrant can be reviewed by assessing information that was never part of the original application. <em>Worrall, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 45-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">\u00b612 A search warrant is only sufficient if it is based on the existence of the \u201cfair probability... that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.\u201d <em>Barnaby, </em>\u00b6 29. The integrity of the search warrant is essential for protecting the people against unreasonable searches. U.S. Const. amend. IV; Mont. Const. art. II, \u00a7 11. Therefore, we have long held that the determination of the existence of probable cause must be limited to an assessment of information within the four corners of the search warrant application. <em>State v. Rinehart, </em>262 Mont. 204, 211, 864 P.2d 1219, 1223 (1993); <em>State v. Sundberg, </em>235 Mont. 115, 119, 765 P.2d 736, 739 (1988); <em>State v. O\u2019Neill, </em>208 Mont. 386, 393, 679 P.2d 760, 763 (1984); <em>State v. Isom, </em>196 Mont. 330, 341, 641 P.2d 417, 423 (1982). A judge\u2019s assessment of the existence of probable cause must be based solely on the statements and facts included in the application. <em>Tucker, </em>\u00b6 17. This legal principle preserves the reliability of the search process because an application \u201csupported by oath or affirmation [and] reduced to writing,\u201d containing information sworn to as accurate not only creates a firm record for review but also reduces the possibility that probable cause will not be based on elusive and unarticulated grounds. Mont. Const. art. II, \u00a7 11; <em>see also </em>U.S. Const. amend. IV. Allowing a defendant to challenge the sufficiency of probable cause in a search warrant based on information that was not included in the application undermines the constitutional safeguards against unreasonable searches, invites speculation and conjecture into the process and stands in direct contradiction to decades of precedent. To the extent that <em>Worrall </em>approved of retroactively considering omitted information from a search warrant application in order to test the sufficiency of probable cause, it is overruled. We judge the sufficiency of a search warrant application by looking to the statements and facts contained on the face of the application. <em>Tucker, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 16-17; <em>Barnaby, </em>\u00b6 29. We will not review the sufficiency of a warrant application by assessing the effect of facts omitted from the original application.</p>\n<p id=\"ADD\">\u00b613  We are not suggesting that a defendant cannot challenge the validity of the information contained within the application. <em>See Franks v. Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154, 98 S. Ct. 2674 (1978). Kasparek had the burden of making a substantial showing that the warrant application contained misleading or untrue information sufficient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>skew the issuing official\u2019s determination of probable cause. <em>State v. Clifford, </em>2005 MT 219, \u00b6 58, 328 Mont. 300, 121 P.3d 489. He has not met his burden.</p>\n<p id=\"A4I\">\u00b614  Deputy Stokes presented the issuing official with facts that showed that Kasparek had entered Como\u2019s home twice in her absence and without her permission within the same time-span that Como\u2019s house was burglarized. On the second trip he was alone in the house over twenty minutes. Deputy Stokes indicated in his affidavit that he knew from his experience and training that stolen property is usually taken and hidden in the residence of the suspected burglar. Based upon the above facts, the judge had to determine whether there was a fair probability that evidence of the burglary could be found in Kasparek\u2019s residence. Considering that the judge is entitled to \u201cgreat deference and every reasonable inference possible [must] be drawn to support that determination of probable cause,\u201d we cannot conclude that the district court erred in denying Kasparek\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence found in his home pursuant to the search warrant. <em>Muir, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"aa-dedup-0\">\u00b615 <em>Issue Two: Did the District Court err in denying Kasparek\u2019s motion to suppress his statements?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">\u00b616 In Montana \u201c[n]o person shall be compelled to testify against himself in a criminal proceeding.\u201d Mont. Const. art. II, \u00a7 25. This is consistent with the United States Constitution\u2019s Fifth Amendment Clause that applies to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause. <em>Malloy v. Hogan, </em>378 U.S. 1, 6-11, 84 S. Ct. 1489, 1492-95 (1964). \u201cWhen a person is taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom by the authorities in any significant way and is subjected to questioning, he must be adequately and effectively apprised of his rights and the exercise of those rights must be fully honored.\u201d <em>State v. Nixon, </em>2013 MT 81, \u00b6 18, 369 Mont. 359, 298 P.3d 408 (citing <em>State v. Morrisey, </em>2009 MT 201, \u00b6 28, 351 Mont. 144, 214 P.3d 708 (quoting <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 478, 86 S. Ct. at 1630) (internal quotations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">\u00b617 Thus, before a person is subjected to custodial interrogation he must be warned of his rights and if the warnings are not given nor a waiver obtained, the law generally requires an exclusion of any statements made during the interrogation. <em>Nixon, </em>\u00b6 19. If a person in custody invokes his right to remain silent, the police must scrupulously honor that request and cease the interrogation. <em>Morrisey, </em>\u00b6 38. A suspect is not required to use precise language when invoking his right to be silent. If a defendant expresses that he does not wish to speak, that is sufficient to invoke his right to remain silent. <em>Morrisey, </em>\u00b6 40. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>However, we have also held that the person in custody is ultimately in control of his own statements in an interrogation setting. <em>Morrissey, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 42-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">\u00b618 Further, not every statement made during a custodial setting constitutes police interrogation. <em>Rhode Island v. Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 301, 100 S. Ct. 1682, 1689-90, (1980). We have previously held that \u201cinterrogation under <em>Miranda </em>extends only to \u201cwords or actions on the part of the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.\u201d <em>Morrisey, </em>\u00b6 43 (citing Innis, 446 U.S. at 301-02, 100 S. Ct. at 1689-90) (internal quotation omitted). The interrogation \u201cmust reflect a measure of compulsion above and beyond that inherent in custody itself.\u201d <em>Morrisey, </em>\u00b6 43 (citing Innis, 446 U.S. at 301-02, 100 S. Ct. at 1689-90) (internal quotation omitted). Additionally, in Montana we require the electronic recording of custodial interrogations. Section 46-4-408, MCA. However, if the statements were made voluntarily and are reliable, an exception may apply to the requirement of an electronic recording. Section 46-4-409(1), MCA. Notwithstanding those provisions, \u201c[a]ny irregularity in a proceeding specified by this title that does not affect the substantial rights of the accused must be disregarded.\u201d Section 46-1-103(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"AeOy\">\u00b619  The record here shows that Captain Seifert first approached Kasparek while he was in custody and asked him whether he wanted to talk. Kasparek declined. Captain Seifert\u2019s invitation to speak is not, absent any other actions, \u201creasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response\u201d from Kasparek. <em>Morrisey, </em>\u00b6 43. Thus the first interaction between Kasparek and Captain Seifert was not an interrogation because it did not \u201creflect a measure of compulsion above and beyond that inherent in custody itself.\u201d <em>Morrisey, </em>\u00b6 43. The second interaction between Kasparek and Captain Seifert occurred around five hours later, when Captain Seifert asked if he had been told what the charges were against him, and again inquired whether Kasparek was willing to speak to him. The District Court found that the defendant \u201cbegan talking very fast to the point of almost being incomprehensible.\u201d Even if Kasparek had initially invoked his right to remain silent, we cannot agree that a second invitation to communicate five hours after the initial inquiry is a failure to scrupulously honor Kasparek\u2019s constitutional rights. <em>Morrisey, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 42-44. Furthermore, it is uncontroverted that Captain Seifert responded to Kasparek\u2019s sudden outpour by reading him his rights, as is required by law. <em>Nixon, </em>\u00b6 18. Thus we cannot conclude that the District Court committed clear error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>when it found that Captain Seifert did not violate Kasparek\u2019s constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"A8h\">\u00b620  Kasparek also asserts that his statements should be suppressed because his interrogation was not recorded pursuant to \u00a7 46-4-408, MCA. Indeed, Captain Seifert did not record the interrogation that followed after Kasparek was read his rights. However, the record shows that Kasparek\u2019s statements were voluntary and reliable; Kasparek was read his rights immediately after he began to speak and he was not coerced or otherwise induced to speak. <em>State v. Gittens, </em>2008 MT 55, \u00b6 27, 341 Mont. 450, 178 P.3d 91. Furthermore, Captain Seifert testified that he memorialized the interrogation shortly after its conclusion to ensure its accuracy and reliability. The State established by a preponderance of the evidence that Kasparek\u2019s statements were voluntary and reliable; as such they qualify for the exception for the electronic recording of custodial interrogations pursuant to \u00a7 46-4-409, MCA. And, since Kasparek\u2019s interrogation was conducted in a manner consistent with his substantial rights, the lack of a recording will not alone warrant a suppression of his statements. Section 46-1-103(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">\u00b621 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the May 28, 2014 District Court Order Denying Motion to Suppress Physical Evidence and Admissions.
