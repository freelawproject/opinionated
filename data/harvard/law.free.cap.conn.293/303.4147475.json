Cutler, appeals<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from the judgment of conviction, rendered after a jury trial, of unlawful restraint in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-95.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant claims on appeal that the trial court improperly: (1) admitted certain prior misconduct evidence after concluding that its probative value outweighed its prejudicial effect; (2) declined to instruct the jury to apply a preponderance of the evidence standard to determine whether the prior misconduct occurred; and (3) marshaled the evidence in its jury instruction by referencing only the state\u2019s prior misconduct evidence and not the defendant\u2019s countervailing evidence. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. Prior to March, 2005, the defendant and Jill Kolton were involved in a tumultuous romantic relationship that spanned approximately one year. Despite the rocky nature of their relationship, they moved in together in a house in Stamford in December, 2004. Their relationship continued to deteriorate, however, and by the end of March, 2005, it had ended. On March 21, 2005, the defendant signed a lease for a separate property, which became effective April 1, 2005. On March 22, 2005, the defendant and Kolton became engaged in a heated argument, and after the defendant left their house, Kolton changed the locks on all of the doors.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">Around 3 p.m. on March 25,2005, Kolton was working at home engaged in a telephone conference call when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>the defendant appeared unexpectedly at the front door, intending to pack his personal belongings. Because Kolton had changed the locks on all of the doors without informing the defendant, he was unable to enter the house. Kolton went to the door and told the defendant that she would not let him into the house because she was on a telephone conference call. After immediately protesting and demanding that he be let into the house, the defendant left the property. When her conference call ended, Kolton telephoned the defendant and left him a voicemail asking him to call her back. Around 4:10 p.m., the defendant telephoned Kolton and told her that he wanted to come over to pack his belongings. While he was on the telephone with her, the defendant pulled his car into the driveway. Kolton, seeing the defendant outside, acquiesced to his request to enter the house and let him in.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">When he entered the house, the defendant went straight into the kitchen to begin packing boxes, and Kolton went down the hallway to her home office. Shortly thereafter, Kolton entered the kitchen, and she and the defendant began to argue over when the defendant was going to leave. Kolton asked the defendant to leave by 7 p.m., but the defendant replied that he \u201ccould stay until however [late] he wanted\u201d in order to finish packing his belongings. The defendant then started cursing at Kolton and physically moved toward her as if to grab her. Kolton quickly moved out of the kitchen and toward the front door, where she opened the front door and told the defendant that he had to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">The defendant then grabbed Kolton, picked her up, and put her down on the floor in the living room.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>carpeting there was extremely coarse. The defendant held Kolton down on the floor while she was kicking and screaming and acting, in the defendant\u2019s words, \u201chysterical.\u201d He admittedly \u201cpinned her down on the [floor] with [his] knees on her shoulders and [he] held her arms with each one of [his] arms.\u201d The defendant then told Kolton that he simply wanted to pack and remove his belongings from the house. The defendant released Kolton<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and went back into the kitchen in order to continue packing his belongings.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Kolton got up from the floor and went out onto the balcony in order to catch her breath. She then walked back into the house to the home office, where she retrieved a cordless telephone. With the telephone in hand, she walked down the hallway, through the master bedroom, and into the master bathroom, locking both the bedroom and bathroom doors. Kolton then called 911 and told the operator that she had been attacked by the defendant. She stayed on the telephone with the 911 operator until police officers entered the house several minutes later. The officers spoke with both Kolton and the defendant about what had occurred and, thereafter, the defendant was arrested and charged with one count of unlawful restraint in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-95<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and one count of assault in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-61 (a) (1).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>At trial, the state presented the testimony of the police officers who responded to the March 25, 2005 incident, as well as the two written statements that Kolton gave the police. The state also presented the testimony of Kolton herself. In addition to her testimony about the incident for which the defendant was being charged, Kolton also testified, over the defendant\u2019s objection, to three prior acts of uncharged misconduct allegedly committed by the defendant against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">During his case, the defendant testified that he had attempted to end his relationship with Kolton permanently but that she would not concede to the fact that it was over. The defendant also claimed that on the day of the incident for which he was on trial, he had acted in self-defense, that is, that he had pinned Kolton on the floor only after she had run at him hysterically and had hit him on the side of his shoulders.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">After a four day trial, the jury returned a verdict finding the defendant not guilty of assault in the third degree but guilty of unlawful restraint in the first degree. The trial court thereafter denied the defendant\u2019s post-verdict motions for judgment of acquittal and for a new trial and rendered judgment in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdict. This appeal followed. See footnote 1 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">The defendant first claims that the trial court improperly admitted the prior misconduct evidence after concluding that its probative value outweighed its prejudicial effect. Specifically, the defendant asserts that the prior uncharged misconduct evidence had minimal probative value because it consisted of mere uncorroborated allegations by Kolton, the complainant in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>present case. In response, the state claims that the trial court\u2019s admission of the prior misconduct evidence was properly within its broad discretion. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The following undisputed additional facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this claim. Before trial, the state filed a notice of uncharged misconduct, informing the defendant of its intention to rely on prior uncharged misconduct evidence. Specifically, the state sought to introduce evidence of four prior acts of uncharged physical violence by the defendant against Kolton to show that the defendant had intended to act as he did against Kolton, and that no mistake or accident had occurred. The four acts occurred in late August, 2004, late January, 2005, March 12, 2005, and March 22, 2005. The state represented to the trial court that on each of these dates, the following occurred: (1) in late August, 2004, the defendant became angry with Kolton, knocked her to the floor and punched holes in the door of the room they were in; (2) in late January, 2005, the defendant and Kolton were arguing when the defendant grabbed Kolton by the hair, dragged her into the bedroom, covered her face with a pillow and threatened her; (3) on March 12, 2005, the defendant and Kolton were arguing when the defendant pinned Kolton down on the couch, restrained her, threatened her and smashed his palm into her face, cutting the bridge of her nose; and (4) on March 22, 2005, the defendant and Kolton were arguing when the defendant struck Kolton with a suitcase, restrained her on the floor with his legs, covered her face with his hands and threatened her. The state asserted that it intended to rely solely on Kolton\u2019s own testimony for proof of these acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The defendant objected to the admission of this prior misconduct evidence and claimed to be entitled to an evidentiary hearing during which, after the introduction of the state\u2019s evidence as well as countervailing evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>dence from the defendant, the trial court should determine whether the prior acts actually occurred. The defendant also claimed that the trial court would have to make that decision employing the evidentiary standard of clear and convincing evidence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The trial court allowed the defendant to make a proffer as to the evidence he would introduce at an evidentiary hearing to rebut the state\u2019s prior misconduct evidence. The defendant proffered his own testimony and that of his mother, as well as inconsistent statements by Kolton in e-mails and police reports. The defendant also claimed that the prior misconduct evidence was more prejudicial than probative because the prior uncharged acts were not only close in time and dramatically similar to the charged act, but also were not adequately supported by persuasive evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">The trial court disagreed with the defendant and denied his request for an evidentiary hearing. The court concluded that the admissibility of evidence is determined not after such a hearing, but instead after the trial court\u2019s consideration of the following two part test: (1) the evidence must be relevant and material to at least one of the circumstances encompassed by the exceptions to the general rule barring the admission of prior misconduct evidence; and (2) the probative value of the evidence must outweigh any prejudicial effect of the evidence. Because the trial court determined that the evidence was relevant to the defendant\u2019s intent as well as to the absence of mistake or accident,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which are recognized exceptions to the general rule barring the admission of prior misconduct evidence, and because it concluded that the probative value of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>evidence outweighed the prejudicial effect of the evidence, the trial court admitted the state\u2019s evidence regarding three of the four prior misconduct acts. The trial court found that the August, 2004 incident was remote in time and not relevant to the case at hand and, accordingly, it barred the admission of that evidence. Significantly, after admitting the state\u2019s prior misconduct evidence, the court stated its intent to offer a limiting instruction to the jury in order to minimize any prejudicial effect the evidence might have; the instruction would highlight the limited and specific purpose for which the evidence was to be properly considered by the jury.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">We begin our analysis of the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly admitted the state\u2019s prior uncharged misconduct evidence by addressing the well settled standard of review. \u201cEvidence of a defendant\u2019s uncharged misconduct is inadmissible to prove that the defendant committed the charged crime or to show the predisposition of the defendant to commit the charged crime. . . . Exceptions to this rule have been recognized, however, to render misconduct evidence admis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>sible if, for example, the evidence is offered to prove intent, identity, malice, motive, a system of criminal activity or the elements of a crime. ... To determine whether evidence of prior misconduct falls within an exception to the general rule prohibiting its admission, we have adopted a two-pronged analysis. . . . First, the evidence must be relevant and material to at least one of the circumstances encompassed by the exceptions. Second, the probative value of such evidence must outweigh the prejudicial effect of the other crime evidence. . . . Since the admission of uncharged misconduct evidence is a decision within the discretion of the trial court, we will draw every reasonable presumption in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling. . . . We will reverse a trial court\u2019s decision only when it has abused its discretion or an injustice has occurred.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Millan, </em>290 Conn. 816, 830-31, 966 A.2d 699 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Although the defendant contends that the admission of the state\u2019s misconduct evidence was improper and so harmful as to require reversal of his conviction, he does not contend that the evidence was irrelevant.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Instead, the defendant claims that the trial court abused its discretion when it improperly determined that the state\u2019s prior misconduct evidence was more probative than prejudicial. Specifically, the defendant asserts that the probative value of the evidence was slight because it consisted solely of uncorroborated allegations by Kolton. The defendant also asserts that the evidence was extremely prejudicial because it alleged acts that were similar or identical to the charged act. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">\u201cWe consistently have indicated that [t]he primary responsibility for . . . determin[ing] whether [prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>misconduct] evidence is more probative than prejudicial rests with the trial court, and its conclusion will be disturbed only for a manifest abuse of discretion. . . . Moreover, [w]hen the trial court has heard a lengthy offer of proof and arguments of counsel before performing the required balancing test, has specifically found that the evidence was highly probative and material, and that its probative value significantly outweighed the prejudicial effect, and has instructed the jury on the limited use of the evidence in order to safeguard against misuse and to minimize the prejudicial impact . . . we have found no abuse of discretion . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>McKenzie-Adams, </em>281 Conn. 486, 531-32, 915 A.2d 822, cert. denied, 552 U.S. 888, 128 S. Ct. 248, 169 L. Ed. 2d 148 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">We emphasize that \u201cthe care with which the [trial] court weighed the evidence and devised measures for reducing its prejudicial effect militates against a finding of abuse of discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Beavers, </em>290 Conn. 386, 406, 963 A.2d 956 (2009). In the present case, the state presented an offer of proof as to the anticipated testimony of Kolton, and the trial court heard lengthy oral arguments from both the state and the defendant with respect to the probative value versus the prejudicial effect of this testimony. The trial court concluded that the prior misconduct evidence was extremely probative because the prior acts were not remote in time and were similar in nature\u2014that is, the acts began with an argument between the defendant and Kolton and then escalated when the defendant reacted with some form of physical violence. Significantly, in coming to this conclusion, the trial court relied not only on the parties\u2019 oral arguments and offers of proof, but also on well settled case law.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>Moreover, in an attempt to minimize any prejudice that might arise from the admission of the prior misconduct evidence, the trial court gave limiting instructions to the jury regarding the very narrow purpose for which it could consider the evidence. See footnote 10 of this opinion. The trial court instructed the jury during the trial, both between Kolton\u2019s direct and cross-examinations, and again at the close of trial in its final jury charge, that Kolton\u2019s testimony concerning the prior uncharged misconduct acts was admitted \u201csolely to show or establish the existence of the intent of the defendant . . . .\u201d We are mindful that a trial court\u2019s limiting instructions about the restricted purpose for which the jury may consider prior misconduct evidence \u201cserve to minimize any prejudicial effect that such evidence otherwise may have had . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>James G., </em>268 Conn. 382, 397-98, 844 A.2d 810 (2004); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Beavers, </em>supra, 290 Conn. 406-408 (use of limiting instructions by trial court about prior misconduct evidence is significant in concluding that trial court properly determined said evidence to be more probative than prejudicial). \u201c[I]n the absence of evidence to the contrary, we presume that the jury properly followed those instructions.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>James G., </em>supra, 398. Accordingly, because, after a lengthy offer of proof and oral argument by both parties, the trial court specifically found that the evidence was more probative than prejudicial and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>gave the jury limiting instructions as to its proper consideration of the evidence; see <em>State </em>v. <em>McKenzie-Adams, </em>supra, 281 Conn. 532; we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting Kolton\u2019s testimony concerning the defendant\u2019s three incidences of prior uncharged misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly declined to instruct the jury to apply a preponderance of the evidence standard as to its consideration of the prior misconduct evidence. Specifically, the defendant asserts that the trial court\u2019s limiting instruction violated the defendant\u2019s federal and state due process rights to a fair trial because the jury effectively was allowed to draw inferences in support of proof of an essential element of the charged crime\u2014namely, the defendant\u2019s intent\u2014from prior uncharged misconduct, without first having to find by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant had committed the misconduct. In response, the state claims that case law does not require the jury to find the existence of a prior act of misconduct by a preponderance of the evidence before considering it for a proper purpose. Instead, the state asserts that the jury need only reasonably conclude that the prior act of misconduct occurred. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">The following undisputed additional facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this claim. After the trial court ruled that the state\u2019s prior misconduct evidence was admissible to prove the intent of the defendant, or his lack of mistake or accident, with regard to the charge of assault in the third degree, the trial court informed the parties that it would offer a limiting instruction to the jury upon request. See footnote 10 of this opinion. The purpose of this limiting instruction was to minimize any prejudicial effect that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>the admission of the prior misconduct evidence might have. The defendant thereafter submitted a written request to charge wherein he asked that jurors be instructed as to the prior misconduct evidence as follows: \u201cYou may consider such evidence if you believe it and further find it logically, rationally and conclusively supports the issue [s] for which it is being offered by the state, but only as it may bear here on the issue of intent.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Subsequently, however, during the charging conference with the court, the defendant orally requested that the trial court instruct the jury that it was required to make a preliminary finding by a preponderance of the evidence that the prior acts of misconduct in fact had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s oral request to include the preponderance of the evidence standard in the jury instructions, determining that this court\u2019s conclusion in <em>State </em>v. <em>Aaron L., </em>272 Conn. 798, 865 A.2d 1135 (2005), \u201cmilitates against [the defendant\u2019s] argument.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court, consistent with the defendant\u2019s written request to charge, instructed the jury as follows: \u201cYou may consider such evidence if you believe it, and further find that it logically and rationally supports the issue for which it is being offered by the state, but only as it may bear on the issue of intent. On the other hand, if you don\u2019t believe such evidence, or even if you do, if you find that it does not logically and rationally support the issue for which [it] is being offered by the state, namely the defendant\u2019s intent, then you may not consider the testimony for any purpose.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The defendant properly took exception to the trial court\u2019s charge regarding the prior misconduct evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>We begin with the well established standard of review governing the defendant\u2019s challenge to the trial court\u2019s jury instruction. \u201cOur review of the defendant\u2019s claim requires that we examine the [trial] court\u2019s entire charge to determine whether it is reasonably possible that the jury could have been misled by the omission of the requested instruction. . . . While a request to charge that is relevant to the issues in a case and that accurately states the applicable law must be honored, a [trial] court need not tailor its charge to the precise letter of such a request. ... If a requested charge is in substance given, the [trial] court\u2019s failure to give a charge in exact conformance with the words of the request will not constitute a ground for reversal. ... As long as [the instructions] are correct in law, adapted to the issues and sufficient for the guidance of the jury ... we will not view the instructions as improper. . . . Additionally, we have noted that [a]n [impropriety] in instructions in a criminal case is reversible [impropriety] when it is shown that it is reasonably possible for [improprieties] of constitutional dimension or reasonably probable for nonconstitutional [improprieties] that the jury [was] misled.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Aviles, </em>277 Conn. 281, 309-10, 891 A.2d 935, cert. denied, 549 U.S. 840, 127 S. Ct. 108, 166 L. Ed. 2d 69 (2006).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim is guided by our recent opinion in <em>State </em>v. <em>Aaron L., </em>supra, 272 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>819-20, wherein the defendant claimed that because of the highly prejudicial nature of prior misconduct evidence, in cases where a party seeks to introduce such evidence, the trial court should, before admitting such evidence, be required to find, by the clear and convincing evidence standard of proof, that the prior misconduct had in fact occurred. In considering this claim, we found the United States Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Huddleston </em>v. <em>United States, </em>485 U.S. 681, 685, 108 S. Ct. 1496, 99 L. Ed. 2d 771 (1988), to be persuasive. \u201cIn <em>Huddleston, </em>the defendant appealed from his conviction of one count of possessing stolen property in interstate commerce. Id., 682-84. The trial court allowed the jury to hear evidence regarding two prior transactions in which the defendant either had sold or had attempted to sell similar stolen goods. Id., 683. . . . The defendant claimed that the trial court should have been required to make a preliminary finding that the government had proved the prior misconduct by a preponderance of the evidence before it submitted the evidence to the jury. Id., 682.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Aaron L., </em>supra, 821-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">The United States Supreme Court, in considering the defendant\u2019s claim, \u201cexplained that the defendant\u2019s position was inconsistent with the Federal Rules of Evidence because those rules establish the broad principle that relevant evidence\u2014evidence that makes the existence of any fact at issue more or less probable\u2014is admissible unless the [r]ules provide otherwise. . . . [T]he trial judge [can] exclude relevant evidence if, among other things, its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. [The rules] address specific types of evidence that have generated problems. Generally, [the] . . . [r]ules do not flatly prohibit the introduction of such evidence but instead limit the purpose for which it may be introduced. . . . The text contains no intimation, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>that any preliminary showing is necessary before such evidence may be introduced for a proper purpose. If offered for such a proper purpose, the evidence is subject only to general strictures limiting admissibility . . . . <em>[Huddleston </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 485 U.S. 687-88].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Aaron L., </em>supra, 272 Conn. 822-23. Accordingly, the Supreme Court concluded that \u201c[g]iven [the] evidence, [because] the jury <em>reasonably could have concluded </em>that [the prior acts of misconduct had occurred] . . . the trial court . . . properly allowed the evidence to go to the jury.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Huddleston v. United States, </em>supra, 691.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">We acknowledge that in <em>Huddleston, </em>as in <em>Aaron L., </em>the issue before the court was one of admissibility of prior misconduct evidence, whereas in the present case, the issue is one regarding the content of jury instructions concerning properly admitted prior misconduct evidence. The distinction between these two issues is significant because it highlights the difference between the judge\u2019s role as evidentiary gatekeeper and the jury\u2019s role as fact finder.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In dicta, the Supreme Court noted these distinct roles in <em>Huddleston: </em>\u201c[I]n determining whether there is sufficient evidence to introduce an act of prior misconduct, the trial court neither weighs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>credibility nor makes a finding that the [g]ovemment has proved the conditional fact by a preponderance of the evidence. The court simply examines all the evidence in the case and decides whether <em>the jury </em>could reasonably find the conditional fact ... by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Aaron L., </em>supra, 272 Conn. 822, quoting <em>Huddleston </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 485 U.S. 690. We are not persuaded, however, that this distinction prevents us from employing our well reasoned conclusion in <em>Aaron L. </em>as guidance in the present case. Significantly, our rebanee in <em>Aaron L. on Huddles-ton </em>is not stymied by the Supreme Court\u2019s statement, in dicta, regarding whether the jury could find \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence\u201d whether the act had occurred. Like our focus in <em>Aaron L., </em>the Supreme Court\u2019s focus in <em>Huddleston </em>was on the question of admissibility; accordingly, its reference to the jury\u2019s finding was not essential to its conclusion on the admissibility of prior misconduct evidence, and is not binding. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Hafford, </em>252 Conn. 274, 314 n.21, 746 A.2d 150 (\u201c[t]he language . . . was dict[um] and is not binding on us now\u201d), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 855, 121 S. Ct. 136, 148 L. Ed. 2d 89 (2000). We are not persuaded that such a standard is necessary in a jury instruction, and instead look to our consideration in <em>Aaron L. </em>of other factors that supported our conclusion, which are certainly instructive and apply equally as well in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Specifically, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Aaron L., </em>supra, 272 Conn. 823, we examined the ways in which our Code of Evidence already protects parties against any unfair prejudice that might arise from the admission of prior misconduct evidence. In particular, we identified the sections of the Code of Evidence that provide this protection, including, but not limited to, \u00a7 4-5 (b), which requires that prior misconduct evidence be offered for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>a proper purpose, \u00a7 4-1, which requires that prior misconduct evidence be relevant to an element in issue, and \u00a7 4-3, which requires the trial court to determine whether the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by its potential for unfair prejudice. Id. We also found significant \u201cthe limiting instructions the trial court is required to give the jury under \u00a7 1-4 [of the Connecticut Code of Evidence] that the evidence is to be considered only for the proper purpose for which it was admitted.\u201d Id. We concluded that following application of these requirements, \u201cwhatever inferences should be drawn from the defendant\u2019s prior [mis] conduct are for <em>the jury </em>to determine.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 824. Accordingly, \u201cwe declinefd] to adopt a rule requiring that the trial court make a preliminary finding by clear and convincing evidence that prior misconduct occurred before submitting that evidence to the jury. Thus, once a trial court determines that an act of prior misconduct is material and relevant to the charges at trial, and that its probative value outweighs its prejudicial effect, the evidence is admissible.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Thus, our conclusion in <em>State </em>v. <em>Aaron L., </em>supra, 272 Corm. 828, implicitly rejects the notion that any particular standard of proof is necessary in a trial court\u2019s jury instructions regarding prior misconduct evidence, and makes clear that prior misconduct evidence may be considered by the jury for a proper purpose if \u201cthere [is] evidence from which the jury reasonably could . . . [conclude]\u201d that the prior act of misconduct occurred and that the defendant was the actor. Where the admission of prior misconduct evidence depends on the trial court\u2019s determination that there is sufficient evidence from which the juiy reasonably could conclude that the prior acts of misconduct occurred and that the defendant was the actor; see id.; we see no reason to impose on trial courts a jury instruction that requires jurors to consider the properly admissible prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>misconduct evidence at a higher standard. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>200 Conn. 268, 274-75, 511 A.2d 321 (1986) (where prior misconduct evidence is properly admitted, trial court does not have to determine by heightened standard that prior acts actually occurred and jury is properly left to determine \u201ctheir commission and consequent weight\u201d). Accordingly, we conclude that it is not necessary that a trial court instruct the jury that it must find, by a preponderance of the evidence, that prior acts of misconduct actually occurred at the hands of the defendant.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Instead, a jury may consider prior misconduct evidence for the proper purpose for which it is admitted if there is evidence from which the jury reasonably could conclude that the defendant actually committed the misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">In the present case, the trial court instructed the jury that it could consider the state\u2019s prior misconduct evidence if it \u201cbelieve[d]\u201d that evidence and found that it \u201clogically and rationally\u201d supported the issue for which it was being offered. The defendant claims that by using the word \u201cbelieve,\u201d the trial court improperly replaced the preponderance of the evidence standard that is necessary for the consideration of prior misconduct evidence. We disagree. The trial court properly determined that there was evidence from which the jury reasonably could conclude that the defendant actually committed the prior acts of misconduct, and its use of the word \u201cbelieve\u201d comports with the requirement that a jury may consider prior misconduct evidence if there is evidence from which it reasonably could conclude that the defendant committed the acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>In the context of our opinion in <em>Aaron L., </em>it is clear that the trial court\u2019s use of the word \u201cbelieve\u201d is not only correct in law, but also sufficiently guides the jury as to its consideration of the prior misconduct evidence. If the jury believes the prior misconduct evidence, it follows logically that there is evidence from which the jury reasonably could conclude that the defendant committed the prior acts of misconduct.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">The defendant\u2019s final claim on appeal is that the trial court improperly marshaled the evidence in its jury instruction by referring only to the state\u2019s prior misconduct evidence and not the defendant\u2019s countervailing evidence. Specifically, the defendant asserts that the trial court\u2019s instruction violated his constitutional right to a fair trial in this regard. The defendant concedes that he did not take exception to the trial court\u2019s prior misconduct jury instruction on this ground and requests that we review the claim under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), or the plain error doctrine, which is codified at Practice Book \u00a7 60-5.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In response, the state contends that the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>claim is not reviewable under the second prong of <em>Golding </em>because unpreserved claims relating to the trial court\u2019s instructions on prior misconduct evidence are not of constitutional magnitude and this case does not present the \u201c \u2018extraordinary\u2019 situation\u201d required for application of the plain error doctrine. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">In support of his claim, the defendant points to the italicized portions of the following jury charge, which was given by the trial court: \u201cThe evidence <em>offered by the state </em>of the alleged prior misconduct of the defendant has been <em>admitted </em>for a limited purpose. Such evidence has not been <em>admitted </em>to prove that the defendant is guilty of the crimes with which he is charged in the present case. Nor can the evidence be used to suggest that the defendant has a bad character or propensity for criminal behavior. Such evidence has been <em>admitted </em>solely to show or establish the existence of the intent of the defendant . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The defendant further points out that the trial court made no reference in this charge to the evidence that was offered by the defendant to refute the state\u2019s evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">We first address the reviewability under <em>Golding </em>of the defendant\u2019s claim. \u201c[I]f a defendant fails to preserve a claim for appellate review, we will not review the claim unless the defendant is entitled to review under the plain error doctrine or the rule set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>[supra, 213 Conn. 239-40].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Spencer, 275 </em>Conn. 171, 177, 881 A.2d 209 (2005). \u201cA party is obligated . . . affirmatively to request review under these doctrines.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>261 Conn. 156, 171, 801 A.2d 788 (2002); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Waz, </em>240 Conn. 365, 371 n.11, 692 A.2d 1217 (1997) (\u201cdefendants who seek consideration of unpreserved constitutional claims [on appeal] . . . bear the burden of establishing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>their entitlement to such review under the guidelines enumerated in Golding\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">\u201cUnder Golding, a defendant can prevail on an unpreserved claim of constitutional error only if the following conditions are satisfied: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>260 Conn. 466, 472, 797 A.2d 1101 (2002); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Peeler, </em>271 Conn. 338, 359-60, 857 A.2d 808 (2004), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 845, 121 S. Ct. 94, 163 L. Ed. 2d 110 (2005). \u201cThe first two [prongs of <em>Golding] </em>involve a determination of whether the claim is reviewable; the second two . . . involve a determination of whether the defendant may prevail.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>279 Conn. 493, 500, 903 A.2d 169 (2006); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Peeler, </em>supra, 360.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Although we agree with the defendant that the record is adequate for our review of his claim, we are not persuaded that he has established a violation of constitutional magnitude in satisfaction of the second prong of <em>Golding. </em>It is well established that \u201cthe failure of the trial court to give a limiting instruction concerning the use of evidence of prior misconduct is not a matter of constitutional magnitude . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rosario, </em>99 Conn.

Indeed, it would trivialize the constitution to transmute a nonconstitutional claim into a constitutional claim simply because of the label placed on it by a party or because of a strained connection between it and a fundamental constitutional right. . . . Robing garden variety claims of improper jury instructions concerning evidentiary matters in the majestic garb of constitutional claims does not make such claims constitutional in nature.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Schiappa, </em>248 Conn. 132, 165-66, 728 A.2d 466, cert. denied, 528 U.S. 862, 120 S. Ct. 152, 145 L. Ed. 2d 129 (1999). Accordingly, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s unpreserved claim fails to meet the second prong of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">The defendant\u2019s claim also does not warrant review under the plain error doctrine. See Practice Book \u00a7 60-5. The plain error doctrine \u201cis not... a rule of review-ability. It is a rule of reversibility. That is, it is a doctrine that this court <em>invokes </em>in order to rectify a trial court ruling that, although either not properly preserved or never raised at all in the trial court, nonetheless <em>requires reversal of the trial court\u2019s judgment, </em>for reasons of policy. ... In addition, the plain error doctrine is reserved for truly extraordinary situations where the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings. . . . Plain error is a doctrine that should be invoked sparingly. . . . [invocation of the plain error doctrine is reserved for occasions requiring the reversal of the judgment under review.\u201d (Citations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kirk R., </em>271 Conn. 499, 507-508 n.14, 857 A.2d 908 (2004); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Fagan, </em>280 Conn. 69, 87, 905 A.2d 1101 (2006) (plain error review is extraordinary doctrine that should be used sparingly), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1269, 127 S. Ct. 1491, 167 L. Ed. 2d 236 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The defendant has not demonstrated that the impropriety he raises is so clear and so harmful that manifest injustice will result if the judgment is not reversed. Nor has he shown that his claim affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in judicial proceedings. We therefore conclude that this is not an occasion requiring the reversal of the trial court\u2019s judgment under the plain error doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b327-8\"> The defendant appealed from the judgment of conviction to the Appellate Court, and, upon the defendant\u2019s motion, we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b327-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-95 (a) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of unlawful restraint in the first degree when he restrains another person under circumstances which expose such other person to a substantial risk of physical injury.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b328-7\"> Kolton is five feet, one inch tall and weighed ninety-two pounds at the time of the incident.

The evidence is not being admitted to prove that the defendant is guilty of the crimes with which he is charged in the present case. Nor can the evidence be used to suggest that the defendant has a bad character or a propensity for criminal behavior. Such evidence is being admitted solely to show or establish the existence of the intent of the defendant, which is a necessary element of the crimes charged. You may consider such evidence if you believe it, and further find it logically and rationally supports the issue for which it is being offered by the state, but only as it may bear on the issue of intent.
