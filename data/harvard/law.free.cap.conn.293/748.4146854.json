The sole issue on appeal is whether the arbitrator exceeded his authority in declining to award attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to the parties\u2019 arbitration agreement. The plaintiffs, Comprehensive Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Care, LLC (Comprehensive), and certain physician members of Comprehensive,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appeal<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from the judgment of the trial court, which denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to vacate in part the arbitration award pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> because it concluded that the arbitrator did not exceed his authority by determining that Comprehensive did not \u201cprevail\u201d on its underlying restrictive covenant claim. On appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the arbitrator exceeded his authority by declining to award attorney\u2019s fees because Comprehensive \u201cprevailed\u201d under Connecticut law on its underlying claim, and, therefore, the arbitration agreement required the arbitrator to award attorney\u2019s fees. The defendants, Alfredo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>L. Axtmayer (Axtmayer) and Alfredo L. Axtmayer, M.D., P.C., claim that the award was proper because the arbitrator\u2019s determination that Comprehensive did not prevail is not reviewable. We agree with the defendants, and, accordingly, affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\">Axtmayer, a physician, was employed by the plaintiffs pursuant to an employment agreement (agreement). Section 11 of the agreement contains a restrictive covenant that prohibits Axtmayer from competing with Comprehensive or disrupting any of its business relationships for a period of three years subsequent to the termination of Axtmayer\u2019s employment. The restrictive covenant\u2019s terms apply to various towns in the state and, in addition, prohibit Axtmayer from maintaining a business relationship with various Connecticut hospitals outside of the restricted territories.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Section 11 (e) of the agreement requires Axtmayer to pay a liquidated damages award of $150,000 if he violates the terms of the covenant. Section 11 (d) of the agreement, however, provides that \u201c[i]n the event the provisions of [\u00a7] 11 are deemed to exceed the time, geographic, or occupational limitations permitted by applicable law, then such provisions shall be automatically reformed to the maximum time, geographic or occupational limitations permitted by applicable law.\u201d At some point during the employment period, the plaintiffs terminated Axtmayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Subsequently, the parties entered into an arbitration agreement to submit various issues arising from the employment relationship, including the question of whether Axtmayer had violated the terms of the restric<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>tive covenant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In that submission, the parties agreed that \u201c[a]s to [\u00a7] 11 of the . . . [agreement . . . the [arbitrator shall award attorney\u2019s fees and costs only to [Comprehensive] and only if [Comprehensive] prevails in its claims under [\u00a7] 11 of the . . . [agreement.\u201d The parties further agreed that the arbitrator\u2019s award could only be vacated on the basis of the grounds set forth in \u00a7 52-418. After the presentation of testimony and evidence, the arbitrator found that Axtmayer had \u201cestablished his solo, competitive practice within the restrictive territory almost immediately after his ouster.\u201d Moreover, the arbitrator found that Axtmayer had continued to have a business relationship with many of the medical institutions covered by the restrictive covenant. Although the arbitrator found that those facts weighed in favor of enforcing the covenant, the arbitrator concluded that the time, geographical and occupational limitations imposed by the covenant were excessive. Accordingly, pursuant to the automatic reformation provision in the agreement, the arbitrator reformed the covenant\u2019s restrictions<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and reduced the liquidated damages to $75,000 from $150,000. With respect to attorney\u2019s fees, the arbitrator concluded that \u201c[i]n view of the reformation, no attorney\u2019s fees and costs are awarded to [Comprehensive].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">On February 4, 2008, the plaintiffs filed an application with the Superior Court to vacate the award only with respect to the arbitrator\u2019s decision not to award attorney\u2019s fees. The plaintiffs claimed that the arbitrator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>exceeded his authority because the arbitration agreement provided that \u201cthe [arbitrator shall award attorney\u2019s fees and costs ... if [Comprehensive] prevails in its claims under [\u00a7] 11 . . . .\u201d On March 3, 2008, the defendants filed an application to confirm the arbitrator\u2019s decision and award. On March 26, 2008, the trial court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 application to vacate in part. The trial court concluded that the submission to arbitration was unrestricted and that the arbitrator had the authority to fashion any remedy that was rationally related to a plausible interpretation of the agreement. Accordingly, the trial court concluded that, in light of the arbitrator\u2019s reformation of the restrictive covenant, the arbitrator reasonably could have concluded that Comprehensive did not prevail on its claims and, therefore, was not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees. On April 14, 2008, the trial court granted the defendants\u2019 application to confirm the award.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\">\u201cJudicial review of arbitral decisions is narrowly confined. . . . When the parties agree to arbitration and establish the authority of the arbitrator through the terms of their submission, the extent of our judicial review of the award is delineated by the scope of the parties\u2019 agreement. . . . When the scope of the submission is unrestricted, the resulting award is not subject to de novo review even for errors of law so long as the award conforms to the submission. . . . Because we favor arbitration as a means of settling private disputes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>we undertake judicial review of arbitration awards in a manner designed to minimize interference with an efficient and economical system of alternative dispute resolution. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">\u201cWhere the submission does not otherwise state, the arbitrators are empowered to decide factual and legal questions and an award cannot be vacated on the grounds that . . . the interpretation of the agreement by the arbitrators was erroneous. Courts will not review the evidence nor, where the submission is unrestricted, will they review the arbitrators\u2019 decision of the legal questions involved. ... In other words, [u]nder an unrestricted submission, the arbitrators\u2019 decision is considered final and binding; thus the courts will not review the evidence considered by the arbitrators nor will they review the award for errors of law or fact. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">\u201cEven in the case of an unrestricted submission, we have . . . recognized three grounds for vacating an award: (1) the award rules on the constitutionality of a statute ... (2) the award violates clear public policy . . . [and] (3) the award contravenes one or more of the statutory proscriptions of \u00a7 52-418. . . . [Section] 52-418 (a) (4) provides that an arbitration award shall be vacated if the arbitrators have exceeded their powers or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">\u201cIn our construction of \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4), we have, as a general matter, looked to a comparison of the award with the submission to determine whether the arbitrators have exceeded their powers.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Harty </em>v. <em>Cantor Fitzgerald &amp; Co., </em>275 Conn. 72, 80-81, 881 A.2d 139 (2005). The standard for reviewing a claim that the award does not conform to the submission requires what we have termed \u201c \u2018in effect, de novo judicial review.\u2019 \u201d Id., 84. \u201cAlthough we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>have not explained precisely what \u2018in effect, de novo judicial review\u2019 entails as applied to a claim that the award does not conform with the submission . . . [o]ur inquiry generally is limited to a determination as to whether the parties have vested the arbitrators with the authority to decide the issue presented or to award the relief conferred.\u201d Id., 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">\u201cIn determining whether an arbitrator has exceeded the authority granted under the contract, a court cannot base the decision on whether the court would have ordered the same relief, or whether or not the arbitrator correctly interpreted the contract. The court must instead focus on whether the [arbitrator] had authority to reach a certain issue, not whether that issue was correctly decided. Consequently, as long as the arbitrator is even arguably construing or applying the contract and acting within the scope of authority, the award must be enforced. The arbitrator\u2019s decision cannot be overturned even if the court is convinced that the arbitrator committed serious error.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 86 n.7, quoting 1 M. Domke, Commercial Arbitration (3d Ed. 2003) \u00a7 39:6, pp. 39-12 through 39-13. Moreover, \u201c[e]very reasonable presumption and intendment will be made in favor of the award and of the arbitrator\u2019s acts and proceedings. Hence, the burden rests on the party challenging the award to produce evidence sufficient to show that it does not conform to the submission.\u201d <em>Bic Pen Corp. </em>v. <em>Local No. 134, </em>183 Conn. 579, 585, 440 A.2d 774 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>\u201cSuch a limited scope of judicial review is warranted given the fact that the parties voluntarily bargained for the decision of the arbitrator and, as such, the parties are presumed to have assumed the risks of and waived objections to that decision. ... It is clear that a party cannot object to an award which accomplishes precisely what the arbitrators were authorized to do merely because that party dislikes the results.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Industrial Risk Insurers </em>v. <em>Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection &amp; Ins. Co., </em>258 Conn. 101, 110, 779 A.2d 737 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">In the present case, we conclude that the arbitrator\u2019s decision not to award attorney\u2019s fees conformed to the submission, and, accordingly, that the arbitrator did not exceed his authority. At the outset, it is helpful to distinguish this case from cases in which we have vacated an arbitration award on the ground that the arbitrator exceeded his authority. In the leading case of <em>Harty </em>v. <em>Cantor Fitzgerald &amp; Co., </em>supra, 275 Conn. 99-100, we determined that the arbitrator\u2019s award of double damages conformed to the submission, but that his award of attorney\u2019s fees did not conform to the submission, and therefore, that he had exceeded his authority with respect to that award. We reached differing results on the basis of the scope of the submission. In <em>Harty, </em>the submission asserted that \u201c \u2018it is understood and agreed that the arbitrators are not authorized or entitled to include as part of any award rendered by them, special, exemplary or punitive damages or amounts in the nature of special, exemplary or punitive damages regardless of the nature or form of the claim or grievance that has been submitted to arbitration . . . .\u2019 \u201d Id., 76. With respect to double damages, we concluded that because \u201cthe submission\u2019s limitation on an award of \u2018punitive damages,\u2019 or \u2018damages in the nature of punitive damages,\u2019 is ambiguous with respect to whether the contract provision was designed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>exclude . . . double damages\u201d; id., 98; the arbitrator\u2019s award could not be deemed outside the scope of the submission, in effect, because he was \u201c \u2018arguably construing\u2019 \u201d the contract. Id., 99; see also <em>United Paperworkers International Union, AFL-CIO </em>v. <em>Misco, Inc., </em>484 U.S. 29, 38, 108 S. Ct. 364, 98 L. Ed. 2d 286 (1987) (\u201cas long as the arbitrator is even arguably construing or applying the contract and acting within the scope of his authority, that a court is convinced he committed serious error does not suffice to overturn his decision\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\">In contrast, with respect to the award of attorney\u2019s fees, because \u201cattorney\u2019s fees and costs provide the same relief and serve the same function as would be afforded by common-law punitive damages,\u201d that award did not conform to the submission\u2019s express prohibition as to those types of damage awards. <em>Harty </em>v. <em>Cantor Fitzgerald &amp; Co., </em>supra, 275 Conn. 99-100. Likewise, in other cases, our determination that an arbitrator has exceeded his authority has been premised on similar circumstances in which the arbitrator\u2019s award included items that were not submitted to, or outside the scope of, the arbitration. See <em>Office of Labor Relations </em>v. <em>New England Health Care Employees Union, District 1199, AFL-CIO, </em>288 Conn. 223, 232, 951 A.2d 1249 (2008) (award conferred remedy to nonparties); <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>AFSCME, </em>195 Conn. 266, 273, 487 A.2d 553 (1985) (award granted on basis of document outside scope of collective bargaining agreement; submission expressly prohibited such review); <em>Waterbury Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>189 Conn. 560, 563, 457 A.2d 310 (1983) (award determined, in part, on basis of item parties had not submitted to arbitration); <em>Local 63, Textile Workers Union </em>v. <em>Cheney Bros., </em>141 Conn. 606, 616, 109 A.2d 240 (1954) (award included reduction of base pay rates despite fact that issue of base pay rates not submitted to arbitration), cert. denied, 348 U.S. 959, 75 S. Ct. 449, 99 L. Ed. 748 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>In the present case, there were two possible awards with respect to the submission regarding the plaintiffs\u2019 restrictive covenant claim. If the arbitrator determined that Comprehensive had prevailed, then the submission required the award of attorney\u2019s fees. If, on the other hand, the arbitrator determined that Comprehensive did not prevail, the submission did not permit the award of attorney\u2019s fees. So long as the arbitrator rendered one of these two possible awards, we cannot say that the award did not conform to the submission. Whether Comprehensive \u201cprevailed\u201d was a question uniquely for the arbitrator. Although the arbitrator awarded the plaintiffs $75,000 in liquidated damages, he determined that the terms of the original covenant were excessive, and in view of his reformation, the arbitrator declined to award attorney\u2019s fees\u2014implicitly concluding that Comprehensive did not prevail on its claim. It is irrelevant whether we would reach the same conclusion that the arbitrator reached or even whether the arbitrator correctly interpreted the agreement. <em>Harty </em>v. <em>Cantor Fitzgerald &amp; Co., </em>supra, 275 Conn. 86 n.7 (\u201ca court cannot base the decision on whether the court would have ordered the same relief, or whether or not the arbitrator correctly interpreted the contract\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>Bridgeport </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Police Local 1159, </em>183 Conn. 102, 106, 438 A.2d 1171 (1981) (\u201c[i]f a submission is unrestricted, the arbitrators are not required to decide the issues according to law and the award cannot be reviewed for errors of law or fact\u201d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b781-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>In short, the question comes down to whether the arbitrator had the authority to reach the issue, not whether the issue was correctly decided. We reiterate that \u201c[w]here the submission does not otherwise state, the arbitrators are empowered to decide factual and legal questions and an award cannot be vacated on the grounds that . . . the interpretation of the agreement by the arbitrators was erroneous.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Industrial Risk Insurers </em>v. <em>Hartford, Steam Boiler Inspection &amp; Ins. Co., </em>273 Conn. 86, 93, 868 A.2d 47 (2005).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In arguing that the trial court improperly declined to review the arbitrator\u2019s determination de novo, the plaintiffs fail to recognize this distinction. That is, our standard of \u201c \u2018in effect, de novo judicial review\u2019 <em>Harty </em>v. <em>Cantor Fitzgerald &amp; Co., </em>supra, 275 Conn. 84; relates to whether the parties have vested the arbitrator with the <em>authority </em>to decide the issue, not de novo review of whether the arbitrator correctly <em>decided </em>the issue. As we have noted, \u201cas long <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>as the arbitrator is even arguably construing or applying the contract and acting within the scope of authority, the award must be enforced.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 86 n.7. In short, because the award conformed to the submission, the arbitrator did not exceed his authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">The dissent\u2019s focus, like the plaintiffs\u2019, on whether the arbitrator correctly determined that Comprehensive \u201cprevailed\u201d is misplaced. Such a query focuses not on whether the arbitrator exceeded his authority, but on whether the arbitrator was wrong on a legal or factual issue. In attempting to demonstrate the arbitrator\u2019s error, the dissent engages in the expanded scope of judicial review that our law expressly prohibits, namely, review of the arbitrator\u2019s factual and legal conclusions. See, e.g., <em>Bridgeport </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Police Local 1159, </em>supra, 183 Conn. 106 (\u201caward cannot be reviewed for errors of law or fact\u201d); see also <em>Moore </em>v. <em>First Bank of San Luis Obispo, </em>22 Cal. 4th 782, 788, 996 P.2d 706, 94 Cal. Rptr. 2d 603 (2000) (arbitrator\u2019s failure to designate prevailing party constituted error of law and \u201c[e]ven if legally erroneous, such an arbitral decision as to who, if anyone, prevailed . . . [was] not . . . reviewable\u201d). More importantly, expanded judicial review is contrary to our well settled and deferential policy favoring arbitration. See, e.g., <em>Hottle </em>v. <em>BDO Seidman, LLP, </em>268 Conn. 694, 708, 846 A.2d 862 (2004) (Arbitration is \u201cwell recognized as an effective and expeditious means of resolving disputes between willing parties desirous of avoiding the expense and delay frequently attendant to the judicial process .... Thus, [i]t has long been the policy of the law to interfere as little as possible with the freedom of consenting parties to achieve that objective . . . .\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]); <em>Industrial Risk Insurers </em>v. <em>Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection &amp; Ins. Co., </em>supra, 258 Conn. 110 (goal of arbitration is efficient, economical and expeditious res<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>olution of private disputes); <em>Caldor, Inc. </em>v. <em>Thornton, </em>191 Conn. 336, 345 n.6, 464 A.2d 785 (1983) (\u201c[because of the public policy favoring expeditious dispute resolution in the informal context of arbitration rather than in the more formal, time-consuming and expensive context of ordinary litigation, we have always respected the autonomy of the arbitration process and the attendant authority to decide questions of law and fact consistent with the submission\u201d), aff'd, 472 U.S. 703, 105 S. Ct. 2914, 86 L. Ed. 2d 557 (1985); <em>Gores </em>v. <em>Rosenthal, </em>150 Conn. 554, 558, 192 A.2d 210 (1963) (\u201cArbitration may or may not be a desirable substitute for trials in courts . . . [b]ut when [the parties] have adopted it, they must be content with its informalities .... They must content themselves with looser approximations to the enforcement of their rights than those that the law accords them, when they resort to its machinery.\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]), quoting <em>American Almond Products Co. </em>v. <em>Consolidated Pecan Sales Co., </em>144 F.2d 448, 451 (2d Cir. 1944) (L. Hand, J.). If we were to adopt the dissent\u2019s expanded role of judicial review of arbitrators\u2019 conclusions of law or fact, we would eviscerate the very purpose of arbitration\u2014efficient, economical and expeditious resolution of private disputes with limited judicial intrusion\u2014and thereby render arbitration more akin to a full-blown judicial proceeding with its attendant increase in costs and time. See <em>Moncharsh </em>v. <em>Heily &amp; Blase, </em>3 Cal. 4th 1, 28, 832 P.2d 899, 10 Cal. Rptr. 2d 183 (1992) (review of arbitrator\u2019s errors of law or fact \u201cwould permit the exception to swallow the rule of limited judicial review; a litigant could always contend the arbitrator erred and thus exceeded his powers\u201d). We decline to expand our scope of judicial review to an arbitrator\u2019s conclusions of law and fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\">The simple but essential distinction between this case and <em>Harty </em>is as follows. In <em>Harty, </em>the arbitrator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>expressly lacked authority to award attorney\u2019s fees because they were precluded by the submission, which stated \u201cthe arbitrators are not authorized or entitled to include as part of any award . . . punitive damages . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Harty </em>v. <em>Cantor Fitzgerald &amp; Co., </em>supra, 275 Conn. 76. The award included attorney\u2019s fees, which, in Connecticut, are an element of punitive damages. Here, the arbitrator was authorized to award attorney\u2019s fees only if he found that Comprehensive prevailed on its restrictive covenant claim. Of course, implicit in that authorization is another, more fundamental authority granted to the arbitrator. The submission granted him the authority to decide whether Comprehensive prevailed. Regardless of whether his implicit conclusion that Comprehensive did not prevail was legally correct, it is undisputed that he had the authority to make the determination. Moreover, even if that determination was not legally correct, we do not have the authority to review an error of law. Id., 85. Accordingly, the arbitrator did not exceed his authority in concluding that Comprehensive did not prevail, and the award conformed to the submission in this case, whereas in <em>Harty </em>it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">In this opinion NORCOTT, ZARELLA and QUINN, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b772-7\"> In addition to Comprehensive, the plaintiffs include Paul H.

In that memorandum, the court rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 new contention that the submission was restricted and stated that even if the submission was restricted, the arbitrator was within Ids authority to \u201cresolve \u2018any and all claims [the parties] have against each other.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b777-5\"> This directive is distinguishable from a \u201cmanifest disregard\u201d analysis.

In <em>Garrity </em>v. <em>McCaskey, </em>223 Conn. 1, 6, 612 A.2d 742 (1992), we had adopted a three part test to determine whether an arbitrator has manifestly disregarded the law.

See footnote 6 of the dissent. The rationale underpinning those cases was premised on the decision of <em>Agnew </em>v. <em>Lacey Co-Ply, </em>33 Wash. App. 283, 654 P.2d 712 (1982), cert. denied, 99 Wash. 2d 1006 (1983), which the Washington Court of Appeals recently rejected outright in <em>Morrell </em>v. <em>Wedbush Morgan Securities, Inc., </em>143 Wash.

Although the plaintiff argued that the arbitrator implicitly designated him as the prevailing party, the court determined that, at most, the arbitrator\u2019s failure to designate a prevailing party constituted an error of law, and that \u201c[e]ven if legally erroneous, such an arbitral decision as to who, if anyone, prevailed . . . [was] not . . . reviewable . . . .\" See also <em>DiMarco </em>v. <em>Chaney, </em>31 Cal. App. 4th 1809, 1815, 37 Cal.

Of course, if the arbitrator had determined an issue on the basis of New York law, for example, despite the clear choice of law provision, such an act likely would form the basis for a colorable \u201cmanifest disregard\u201d claim.

J., and PALMER, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ABC\">join, dissenting. The majority concludes that the arbitrator\u2019s decision refusing to award attorney\u2019s fees to the named plaintiff, Comprehensive Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Care, LLC,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is unreviewable because, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>as long as the arbitrator rendered one of two possible awards\u2014either awarding attorney\u2019s fees or not awarding attorney\u2019s fees\u2014the award conformed to the submission. The majority reasons that the arbitrator implicitly decided that the named plaintiff had not prevailed, despite being awarded $75,000 in damages on the claim at issue, and that such a decision was within the arbitrator\u2019s sole discretion as a matter of contract interpretation. I respectfully disagree. When parties to an arbitration agreement use terms that have a well settled, universally understood, unambiguous meaning, they have not intended to open up those terms to interpretation by the arbitrator. Thus, when an arbitrator ignores the settled meaning of a term, the arbitrator has not engaged in a plausible interpretation of the contract and, in such a case, has exceeded his authority. In the present case, by ignoring the settled meaning of the term \u201cprevail,\u201d the arbitrator disregarded mandatory language in the arbitration agreement clearly stating that he must award attorney\u2019s fees to a prevailing party and, as such, exceeded his authority. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\">The resolution of the issue in this appeal is informed by our analysis in <em>Harty </em>v. <em>Cantor Fitzgerald &amp; Co., </em>275 Conn. 72, 881 A.2d 139 (2005). The arbitration agreement in <em>Harty </em>expressly precluded the arbitrator from awarding \u201cpunitive damages or amounts in the nature of . . . punitive damages . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 76. The relevant issues in <em>Harty, </em>for puiposes of this appeal, were whether the arbitrator had exceeded his authority by awarding: (1) double damages under the wage collection statute, General Statutes \u00a7 31-72; and (2) attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Harty </em>v. <em>Cantor Fitzgerald &amp; Co., </em>supra, 88. In that case, as in the present case, there was no dispute that the submission was unrestricted, in the sense that it did not condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>tion the award on court review.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Id., 83. We therefore explained that, \u201c[i]In light of that posture . . . the arbitrators\u2019 decision is considered final and binding; thus the courts will not review the evidence considered by the arbitrators nor will they review the award for errors of law or fact. . . . <em>Industrial Risk Insurers </em>v. <em>Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection &amp; Ins. </em>Co., 258 Conn. 101, 110, 779 A.2d 737 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">\u201cEven with an unrestricted submission, however, it is well settled that the award may be reviewed to determine if the arbitrators exceeded their authority, one of the statutory grounds under [General Statutes] \u00a7 52-418 for vacating an award. <em>Industrial Risk Insurers </em>v. <em>Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection &amp; Ins. Co., </em>[273 Conn. 86, 94, 868 A.2d 47 (2005)]. We have explained that, [i]n our construction of \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4), we have, as a general matter, looked to a comparison of the award with the submission to determine whether the arbitrators have exceeded their powers. ... Id. The standard for reviewing a claim that the award does not conform to the submission requires what we have termed in effect, de novo judicial review. <em>State </em>v. <em>New England Health Care Employees Union, District 1199, AFL-CIO, </em>265 Conn. 771, 789, 830 A.2d 729 (2003). . . . Our inquiry generally is limited to a determination as to whether the parties have vested the arbitrators with the authority to decide the issue presented or to award the relief conferred. With respect to the latter, we have explained that, as long as the arbitrator\u2019s remedies were consistent with the agreement they were within the scope of the submission. [Id., 790]; see also <em>In re Matter </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number><em>of Granite Worsted Mills, Inc., </em>25 N.Y.2d 451, 456, 255 N.E.2d 168, 306 N.Y.S.2d 934 (1969) (where it is clear from the face of the award itself . . . that the arbitrator has included an element of damages specifically excluded by the contract pursuant to which he obtained his very authority to act, he exceeds his powers under the contract and the award thus made must be vacated upon proper application). In making this determination, the court may not engage in fact-finding by providing an independent interpretation of the contract, but simply is charged with determining if the arbitrators have ignored their obligation to interpret and to apply the contract as written. See <em>Metropolitan District Commission </em>v. <em>AFSCME, Council 4, Local 3713, </em>35 Conn. App. 804, 811, 647 A.2d 755 (1994) (concluding that trial court improperly granted plaintiffs application to vacate arbitration award because, in determining whether award conformed to submission, it provided an independent interpretation of contract and thus engaged in fact-finding beyond scope of trial court\u2019s powers of review); <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Local 818, Council 4, AFSCME, AFL-CIO, </em>5 Conn. App. 636, 640, 502 A.2d 426 (1985) ([w]here one party claims that the award, as issued, is inherently inconsistent with the underlying collective bargaining agreement, the court will compare the agreement with the award to determine whether the arbitrator has ignored his obligation to interpret and apply that agreement as written), citing <em>Hudson Wire Co. </em>v. <em>Winsted Brass Workers Union, </em>150 Conn. 546, 553, 191 A.2d 557 (1963).\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Harty </em>v. <em>Cantor Fitzgerald &amp; Co., </em>supra, 275 Conn. 83-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\">In <em>Harty, </em>in deciding whether the arbitrator had exceeded his authority, we applied the following analytical framework. We first compared the award to the submission and noted the absence of any express reference in the award to \u201cpunitive\u201d damages. Id., 91. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>therefore considered whether either double damages under \u00a7 31-72 or attorney\u2019s fees were, <em>as a matter of law, </em>punitive damages or in the nature of punitive damages, and, therefore, were outside the scope of the submission. Id., 92. We noted that, \u201c[t]o justify vacating an award ... we must determine that the award <em>necessarily </em>falls outside the scope of the submission.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 98. To make that determination, we examined, inter alia, case law from this and other jurisdictions addressing the meaning of the term punitive damages generally and the specific question of whether statutory multiple damages are punitive. Id., 92-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">That examination yielded different results. With respect to the award of double damages under \u00a7 31-72, because the case law was ambiguous as to whether such damages are punitive, we concluded that the arbitrator was acting within the scope of his authority by interpreting the contract to permit an award of such damages. Id., 98. By contrast, the case law demonstrated that \u201cattorney\u2019s fees and costs provide the same relief and serve the same function as would be afforded by common-law punitive damages. See <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Loiseau, </em>[223 Conn. 786, 827, 614 A.2d 414 (1992)] (attorney\u2019s fees are element of punitive damages); <em>Tedesco </em>v. <em>Maryland Casualty Co., </em>[127 Conn. 533, 538, 18 A.2d 357 (1941)] (same).\u201d <em>Harty v. Cantor Fitzgerald &amp; Co., </em>supra, 275 Conn. 99-100. Therefore, we concluded that the law clearly demonstrated that the fees were punitive in nature, and, accordingly, the arbitrator had exceeded his authority by including those in the award. Id., 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">The present case is the converse of <em>Harty. </em>Rather than <em>precluding </em>the arbitrator from including certain compensation in the award, the agreement <em>mandates </em>that the arbitrator include certain compensation in the award if a factual predicate is met, namely, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>named plaintiff has prevailed on a specific claim. Applying the same analytical framework that we did in <em>Harty </em>to the present case yields the conclusion that the arbitrator exceeded his authority by declining to award attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\">I begin by comparing the arbitration agreement and the submission to the award. See <em>Administrative &amp; Residual Employees Union </em>v. <em>State, </em>200 Conn. 345, 348, 510 A.2d 989 (1986) (\u201c[t]he arbitration agreement and the submission constitute the charter of the entire arbitration proceedings . . . and define the powers of the arbitrator and the issues to be decided\u201d [citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted]). In the arbitration agreement, the parties agreed to submit to binding arbitration \u201cany and all issues or claims that they have against each other\u201d and that \u201c[t]he [arbitrator shall apply the laws of the [s]tate of Connecticut wherever applicable and relevant.\u201d In the section of the agreement titled \u201cExpenses,\u201d the parties agreed as follows: \u201cAs to [\u00a7] 11 of the [employment [agreement [titled \u2018Restrictive Covenant\u2019] . . . the [arbitrator shall award attorney\u2019s fees and costs only to [the named plaintiff] and only if [the named plaintiff] <em>prevails </em>in its claims under [\u00a7] 11 of the [e]mployment [agreement.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The parties submitted the following issues to be decided by the arbitrator. The plaintiffs asked the arbitrator to decide: \u201cDid [the named defendant, Alfredo L. Axtmayer<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] violate [\u00a7] 11 of his \u2018[e]mployment [agreement\u2019?\u201d If the arbitrator decided that issue in the affirmative, the plaintiffs requested enforcement of the $150,000 liquidated damages clause in that section, as well as attorney\u2019s fees and costs. The named defendant asserted in his submission: \u201cThe [plaintiffs] are not entitled to payment under the restric<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>tive covenant.\u201d The arbitration award provides: \u201c[The named defendant] is indebted to the [plaintiffs] for the following: [Restrictive [c]ovenant and [liquidated [d]amages: $75,000. ... No additional interest, costs or attorney\u2019s fees are awarded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">A comparison between the award and the submission reflects that, as in <em>Harty, </em>the arbitrator did not use the precise term at issue. In other words, the arbitrator did not state expressly that the named plaintiff had \u201cprevailed\u201d or \u201cnot prevailed\u201d on its claims under \u00a7 11 of the employment agreement. As in <em>Harty, </em>therefore, we turn to our case law to determine whether a party that is awarded damages on a claim, even in an amount less than requested, has \u201cprevailed\u201d on that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">The Appellate Court aptly has summarized the law on this question in the context of discretionary awards of attorney\u2019s fees to prevailing parties: \u201cOur Supreme Court and this court, in construing various statutory fee shifting provisions, <em>repeatedly </em>have cited favorably the following definition of a prevailing party: [A] party in whose favor a judgment is rendered, regardless of the amount of damages awarded . . . . <em>Frillici </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>264 Conn. 266, 285, 823 A.2d 1172 (2003); <em>Wallerstein </em>v. <em>Stew Leonard\u2019s Dairy, </em>[258 Conn. 299, 303, 780 A.2d 916 (2001)]; <em>Right </em>v. <em>Breen, </em>88 Conn. App. 583, 591, 870 A.2d 1131 [(2005), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 277 Conn. 364, 890 A.2d 1287 (2006)]; see also <em>Wallerstein </em>v. <em>Stew Leonard\u2019s Dairy, </em>supra, 304 (prevailing party is a legal term of art . . . [referring to] one who has been awarded some relief by the court. . .). Generally, costs may be awarded to a successful party-plaintiff as the prevailing party where there is success on the merits of the case although not to the extent of the plaintiff\u2019s original contention, or where the plaintiff is not awarded the entire claim. A party need not prevail on all issues to justify a full award of costs, and it has been held that if the prevailing party obtains judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>on even a fraction of the claims advanced, or is awarded only nominal damages, the party may nevertheless be regarded as the prevailing party and thus entitled to an award of costs. 20 Am. Jur. 2d, Costs \u00a7 14 (1995).\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>91 Conn. App. 619, 630-31, 882 A.2d 98, certs. denied, 276 Conn. 924, 925, 888 A.2d 92 (2005). This case law is wholly in accord both with the common meaning of the term \u201cprevail\u201d; see Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (defining \u201cprevail\u201d as \u201cto gain victory by virtue of strength or superiority\u201d and \u201cto urge one successfully: succeed in persuading or inducing one\u201d); and with the legal definition; see Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (7th Ed. 1999) (defining \u201cprevailing party\u201d as \u201c[a] party in whose favor a judgment is rendered, regardless of the amount of damages awarded . . . [a]lso termed \u2018successful party\u2019 \u201d); Ballentine\u2019s Law Dictionary (3d Ed. 1969) (defining prevailing party as \u201c[t]he party who is successful or partially successful in an action, so as to be entitled to costs\u201d). As this foregoing discussion clearly demonstrates, whether one looks to the common meaning of a prevailing party to an action, or to the legal definition, treatises or case law, an award of damages to a party on a claim, even if only nominal, means that he has prevailed on that claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\">The parties in this case undoubtedly vested the arbitrator with authority to decide whether the named defendant had violated the restrictive covenant and, if so, the amount of damages the plaintiffs were entitled to recover for that breach. Indeed, the defendants had asked the arbitrator to conclude that the plaintiffs were entitled to <em>no </em>payment. Accordingly, the arbitrator\u2019s legal and interpretive functions, consistent with the parties\u2019 submissions, were completed upon reaching those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>conclusions. The parties had set forth the conditions for payment of attorney\u2019s fees by using terms they undoubtedly understood consistently with their common, well established meaning. Thus, in this case, the arbitrator, a fortiori, by virtue of its order for the defendants to pay damages to the plaintiffs, determined that the named plaintiff had prevailed on its claim that the named defendant had violated the restrictive covenant included in \u00a7 11 of the employment agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">Although the trial court concluded that the arbitrator could have viewed the term prevail as ambiguous because, by virtue of receiving only 50 percent of the liquidated damages sought, the plaintiffs\u2019 proverbial glass was either \u201chalf full\u201d or \u201chalf empty,\u201d neither the defendants nor the trial court has cited a single source to support that interpretation. In light of the clearly contrary meaning of prevailing party, that interpretation is not merely an incorrect one; it is implausible that the parties intended such an interpretation. See <em>Kashner Davidson Securities Corp. </em>v. <em>Mscisz, </em>531 F.3d 68, 78 (1st Cir. 2008) (\u201cWith respect to the authority to interpret, the [arbitration] [p]anel\u2019s disregard of the unambiguous text of a [National Association of Securities Dealers] [c]ode provision cannot be deemed a mere interpretation. To find otherwise and expand the concept of \u2018interpretation\u2019 to include the [p]anel\u2019s dismissal decision in this case would be tantamount to giving . . . arbitration panels a blank check to [act] in contravention of an explicit provision of the [c]ode. Our deference to the decisions of arbitrators does not extend that far.\u201d). It is a well settled principle of arbitration law that, \u201c[a]n arbitrator is confined to interpretation and application of the collective bargaining agreement; he does not sit to dispense his own brand of industrial justice. He may of course look for guidance from many sources, yet his award is legitimate only so long as it draws its essence from the collective bargaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>agreement. When the arbitrator\u2019s words manifest an infidelity to this obligation, courts have no choice but to refuse enforcement of the award. <em>United Steelworkers of America </em>v. <em>Enterprise Wheel &amp; Car Corporation, </em>363 U.S. 593, 597, 80 S.

It leaves no discretion to the arbitrator to deny attorney fees to the prevailing party. In ruling on [the plaintiffs] motion to modify, the arbitrator ignored the parties\u2019 agreement and fashioned his own rule that no prevailing party attorney fees will be awarded if any fault is attributable to each of the parties.

Co., </em>273 Conn. 86, 89 n.3, 868 A.2d 47 (2005) (\u201c[a] submission is unrestricted when, as in the present case, the parties\u2019 arbitration agreement contains no language restricting the breadth of issues, reserving explicit rights, or conditioning the award on court review\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b789-5\"> Alfredo L. Axtmayer, M.D., P.C., also was named as a defendant in the present case. We refer to Axtmayer individually as the named defendant, and to him and his professional corporation jointly as the defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b791-5\"> It is wholly irrelevant that the arbitrator reformed the agreement to reduce the liquidated damages provision. The arbitrator did not strike either the restrictive covenant or the liquidated damages clause as unenforceable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b794-4\"> The agreement at issue in <em>Sooner Builders &amp; Investments, Inc. </em>v. <em>Nolan Hatcher Construction Services, LLC, </em>supra, 164 P.3d 1068, provided: \u201cShould either party employ an attorney to institute suit or demand arbitration to enforce any of the provisions hereof . . . the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, costs, charges and expenses expended or incurred therein.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b794-5\"> The agreement at issue in <em>Bernard, </em>v. <em>Kuhn, </em>supra, 65 Md. App. 560, provided: \u201cThe cost of said arbitration, including all reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and other proper expenses incident thereto incurred by the winning party, will be borne by the losing party relative to said arbitration, and this fact will be reflected in the arbitrator\u2019s decision.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) In that case, the Maryland Court of Special Appeals relied on the reasoning of the Washington Court of Appeals decision in <em>Agnew </em>v. <em>Lacey Co-Ply, </em>33 Wash. App. 283, 654 P.2d 712 (1982), cert. denied, 99 Wash. 2d 1006 (1983). See <em>Bernard </em>v. <em>Kuhn, </em>supra, 565. Although, the Washington Court of Appeals recently has questioned the reasoning <em>in Agnew; </em>see <em>Morrell </em>v. <em>Wedbush Morgan Securities, Inc., </em>143 Wash. App. 473, 178 P.3d 387 (2008); the Maryland courts have reiterated their view that an arbitrator acts outside the scope of his authority by failing to comply with a mandatory provision for attorney\u2019s fees to a prevailing party. See <em>Marsh </em>v. <em>Loffler Housing Corp., </em>102 Md. App. 116, 132, 648 A.2d 1081 (1994) (stating that \u201c[t]he issue of [attorney\u2019s] fees . . . was not disputed, and therefore not arbitrable\u201d and citing in support thereof <em>Bernard </em>and <em>Agnew).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b795-6\"> <em>In re Matter of Application of Shapiro </em>does not indicate the language of the attorney\u2019s fees clause at issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
