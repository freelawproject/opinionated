App. 105, 106-107, 925 A.2d 385 (2007) (en banc) <em>(Flanagan II). </em>On appeal, the defendant claims: (1) that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that he had not clearly and unequivocally invoked his right to self-representation under the sixth amendment<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to the United States constitution;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and (2) in response to an alternate ground for affirmance proffered by the state, that the trial court improperly applied an \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d test in ruling on the timeliness of his request to represent himself. We agree with both of the defendant\u2019s claims and, accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">The record and the Appellate Court decision reveal the following relevant facts and procedural history. In connection with a gang related drive-by shooting in New Britain in 1994, the state charged the defendant with two counts of murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-54a (a) and 53a-8, two counts of criminal attempt to commit murder in violation of General Stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>utes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-54a (a), 53a-8 and 53a-49 (a) (2), one count of conspiracy to commit murder in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-54a (a) and 53a-48 (a), and one count of conspiracy to commit assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1) and 53a-48 (a). \u201cAt trial, the defendant was represented by a special public defender. On several occasions during the trial, the defendant expressed his dissatisfaction with his attorney\u2019s performance. Prior to jury selection, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss his attorney. The defendant claimed that his attorney was not investigating the case adequately. The defendant\u2019s attorney acknowledged the existence of problems with investigating matters related to the case and made representations to the court concerning his investigative efforts. The court thereafter denied the defendant\u2019s motion, noting that the defendant\u2019s attorney had been a \u2018great advocate\u2019 for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">\u201cOn March 18, 2003, just before the state rested its case, the court conducted an in-chambers conference with the prosecutor and the defendant\u2019s attorney. The defendant\u2019s attorney informed the court that he did not intend to call any witnesses and that the defendant disagreed with this aspect of his trial strategy. The court subsequently stated to the defendant in open court that it was aware of the proposed strategy of the defendant\u2019s attorney as well as the defendant\u2019s dissatisfaction with it. The court stated: \u2018Did you want to tell me anything about that? You don\u2019t need to tell me anything about it, but I just wanted to give you an opportunity, if you did, to be heard yourself. It\u2019s [your attorney\u2019s] decision, but I understand sometimes that counsel and their clients can have different points of view, and [your attorney] told me that you and he do have a different point of view. I just want to give you an opportunity, if you wish to, to make me aware of what your point of view is. Did you want to say anything?\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>\u201cThe defendant replied that he viewed his attorney\u2019s strategy as being \u2018too narrow\u2019 and that he believed that, if the defense called witnesses to testify, the jury would be able to evaluate the case \u2018from a different angle.\u2019 The defendant expressed his view that for the defense not to present any evidence would afford the jury only \u2018one option,\u2019 which would lead to a finding of guilt. The defendant analogized his attorney\u2019s strategy to one used in the game of chess and opined that it was inappropriate. The defendant also recalled that, in a prior trial, the jury found him guilty after the attorney representing him in that case did not present any evidence in his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">\u201cThe court informed the defendant that \u2018these kind of tactical decisions\u2019 were for his attorney to make after consulting with the defendant. The court asked the defendant\u2019s attorney if he had discussed this strategy with the defendant; the defendant\u2019s attorney represented that he had done so. The defendant\u2019s attorney added that, after additional consideration, he had become \u2018even more solid in [his] position\u2019 to forgo the presentation of any evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">\u201cThe court then addressed the defendant as follows: 1 can\u2019t fully appreciate your feelings because I\u2019m not in your place. I certainly understand, I think, your reservations, having gone through this experience once. At the same time, these are [your attorney\u2019s] decisions. He\u2019s a very experienced attorney. He has tried many cases. I\u2019ve had the opportunity to observe his performance in this case from . . . January 8, 2003, when we had some hearings on motions. As far as I\u2019m concerned, his performance has been beyond competent and [has] been superior. If these are his decisions, I\u2019m sure he has given them ample consideration. I\u2019m sure he has taken into consideration your feelings about it, and those are decisions that are left to the attorney for good reason, sir.\u2019 . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>\u201cAfter the court discussed other matters with the prosecutor, it canvassed the defendant concerning his decision to waive his right to testify. The court thereafter informed the defendant\u2019s attorney and the prosecutor that, absent a request to the contrary from the defendant\u2019s attorney, it would deliver the standard instruction informing the jury that it could draw no adverse inference from the defendant\u2019s decision not to testify. The following colloquy between the defendant and the court then took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-5\">\u201c \u2018[The Defendant]: Excuse me, Your Honor. Don\u2019t I have the right to finish this case myself without him there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-6\">\u201c \u2018The Court: In a word, no. But are you making that request to represent yourself in the remainder of the case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-7\">\u201c \u2018[The Defendant]: I mean, if he\u2019s not going to do what I feel is in my best interest, I don\u2019t think that he should be my attorney. I mean, this is my life. Like I explained to him, when this is over, if I lose, he just goes on to another case. I\u2019m the one who has to go to jail. And he\u2019s not doing what I feel is in my best interest. He\u2019s doing what he feels is in his best interest, not mine. So, I don\u2019t understand how his interest comes before my interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-8\">\u201c \u2018The Court: Well, it doesn\u2019t appear to me, Mr. Flanagan, based on my observations of [your attorney\u2019s] performance from January 8,2003, to today, which is March 18, 2003, that his decisions and his actions have been in his interest as opposed to yours. So, I\u2019m\u2014and I can\u2019t imagine why he\u2019d be changing courses now. I mean, [your attorney\u2019s] decisions, as best as I have observed, have been solely in your interest. And his performance has been beyond competent and, in my view, superior over the last two and one-half months. So, while you may disapprove of his trial tactics, and I understand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>your feelings, his obligation is to consult with you and then to make his best professional decisions. The fact that you disagree with him over trial tactics does not, at this stage of the case where the state is about to rest, after we have been on trial essentially for about two and one-half months, does not constitute the kind of exceptional circumstances that I would have to find in order for me to allow you either to have a new lawyer or to represent yourself at this point in time. So, if you\u2019re making a request of me that you be allowed to represent yourself or that you be allowed to retain or have new counsel appointed for you, that request is denied.\u2019 The defendant did not address the court further, the defendant\u2019s attorney did not address the court with regard to the defendant\u2019s statements and the court thereafter turned its attention to other matters. The defendant\u2019s attorney did not present any evidence on the defendant\u2019s behalf.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-5\">\u201cAt the commencement of court proceedings two days later, on March 20, 2003, the court addressed the defendant\u2019s attorney with regard to whether it should continue to permit the defendant to remain unshackled in the courtroom during the proceedings. The court explained that it asked the defendant\u2019s attorney to speak to him with regard to this issue, as follows: T asked [your attorney] to do that, Mr. Flanagan, because I know you\u2019re angry and disappointed the other day at the turn things took about resting and my not permitting you to represent yourself.\u2019 The defendant\u2019s attorney related to the court that \u2018strategic differences\u2019 between himself and the defendant continued to exist. After the court addressed other matters before it, the defendant\u2019s attorney informed the court that the defendant desired to state something \u2018on the record for his own sake at [that] point because we do have the disagreement.\u2019 With the court\u2019s permission, the defendant stated, T just want to put it on the record that I wanted to call witnesses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>and that I feel that this is being done against my will and it\u2019s not what I want.\u2019 The court noted that the defendant\u2019s comments were reflected in the record.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Flanagan, </em>supra, 102 Conn. App. 107-11. The jury subsequently returned a verdict finding the defendant guilty of conspiracy to commit assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1) and 53a-48 (a), and not guilty of the other charges. The trial court rendered a judgment of conviction in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdict and sentenced the defendant to a term of twenty years incarceration, execution suspended after thirteen years, and five years of probation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">The defendant appealed from the judgment of conviction to the Appellate Court, claiming, inter alia, that the trial court had violated his light to self-representation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Flanagan, </em>93 Conn. App. 458, 468, 890 A.2d 123 (2006) <em>(Flanagan I). </em>In a divided opinion, a three judge panel of the Appellate Court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, concluding that the trial court\u2019s failure to canvass the defendant in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 44-3<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> was not improper because the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>had not made a clear and unequivocal assertion of his right to self-representation. Id., 474. In addition, the Appellate Court majority concluded that the trial court had not abused its discretion in determining that the defendant\u2019s request to proceed pro se, which was made at the conclusion of the state\u2019s case, was untimely because no \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d existed to permit the defendant to discharge his counsel midtrial. Id., 478-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">Thereafter, the Appellate Court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for reconsideration and reargument en banc. <em>State </em>v. <em>Flanagan, </em>supra, 102 Conn. App. 107. At reargument, the defendant claimed that \u201che [had] \u2018requested to waive counsel and proceed pro se\u2019 and that the court, in the manner that it responded to and analyzed his request, violated his right to self-representation afforded by the federal constitution.\u201d Id., 112. The defendant also claimed that, once he had requested to proceed pro se, \u201cthe court should have canvassed him in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 44-3 and then, on the basis of such canvass, exercised only limited discretion in ruling on his request\u201d; id.; rather than applying the \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d test to determine the propriety of his request. Id. The Appellate Court affirmed the judgment of the trial court by a vote of five to four,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> concluding that the trial court had not improperly failed to canvass the defendant in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 44-3 because the defendant had not clearly and unequivocally asserted his right to self-representation. Id., 132. In light of that conclusion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>the Appellate Court did not address the state\u2019s claim that the defendant\u2019s request was untimely and, therefore, was properly denied.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Id., 113 n.4. This certified appeal followed. See footnote 1 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">On appeal to this court, the defendant claims that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that he had not clearly and unequivocally requested to proceed pro <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>se. In response, the state contends otherwise, and also claims that the trial court properly applied an \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d test in concluding that the defendant\u2019s request was both untimely and prejudicial to the state and, therefore, was improper. We address each claim in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">As a preliminary matter, we set forth several well settled principles regarding the constitutional right of a criminal defendant to represent himself. The sixth amendment to the United States constitution provides in relevant part: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to have the assistance of counsel for his defense.\u201d The sixth amendment right to counsel is made applicable to state prosecutions through the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment. See, e.g., <em>Gideon </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>372 U.S. 335, 342, 83 S. Ct. 792, 9 L. Ed. 2d 799 (1963). <em>In Faretta </em>v. <em>California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 807, 95 S. Ct. 2525, 45 L. Ed. 2d 562 (1975), the United States Supreme Court concluded that the sixth amendment embodies a right to self-representation and that \u201ca defendant in a state criminal trial has a constitutional right to proceed <em>without </em>counsel when he voluntarily and intelligently elects to do so.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) See also <em>Adams </em>v. <em>United States ex rel. McCann, </em>317 U.S. 269, 279, 63 S. Ct. 236, 87 L. Ed. 268 (1942) (\u201c[T]he [constitution does not force a lawyer upon a defendant. He may waive his [constitutional right to assistance of counsel if he knows what he is doing and his choice is made with eyes open.\u201d). The Supreme Court has further stated that \u201c[w]e confront here a nearly universal conviction, on the part of our people as well as our courts, that forcing a lawyer upon an unwilling defendant is contrary to his basic right to defend himself if he truly wants to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>\u201cThis consensus is soundly premised. The right of self-representation finds support in the structure of the [s]ixth [a]mendment, as well as in the English and colonial jurisprudence from which the [a]mendment emerged.\u201d <em>Faretta </em>v. <em>California, </em>supra, 422 U.S. 817-18. Moreover, the court noted that unwanted counsel represents the defendant \u201conly through a tenuous and unacceptable legal fiction. Unless the accused has acquiesced in such representation, the defense presented is not the defense guaranteed him by the [cjonstitution, for, in a very real sense, it is not <em>his </em>defense.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 821.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">This court consistently has recognized \u201cthe inviolability of the right of self-representation\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>256 Conn. 291, 302, 772 A.2d 1107, cert. denied, 534 U.S. 1068, 122 S. Ct. 670, 151 L. Ed. 2d 584 (2001); and that the right \u201cis also consistent with the ideal of due process as an expression of fundamental fairness. To force a lawyer on a defendant can only lead him to believe that the law contrives against him.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. \u201cThe right to counsel and the right to self-representation present mutually exclusive alternatives. A criminal defendant has a constitutionally protected interest in each, but since the two rights cannot be exercised simultaneously, a defendant must choose between them. When the right to have competent counsel ceases as the result of a sufficient waiver, the right of self-representation begins. . . . Put another way, a defendant properly exercises his right to self-representation by knowingly and intelligently waiving his right to representation by counsel.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>T.R.D., </em>286 Conn. 191, 202, 942 A.2d 1000 (2008). Furthermore, \u201c[w]hen an accused manages his own defense, he relinquishes, as a purely factual matter, many of the traditional benefits associated with the right to counsel. For this reason, in order to represent himself, the accused must knowingly and intelli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>gently [forgo] those relinquished benefits.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 202-203. Although a defendant need not have the skill and expertise of an attorney to competently and intelligently choose to proceed pro se, \u201ca record that affirmatively shows that [he] was literate, competent, and understanding, and that he was voluntarily exercising his informed free will sufficiently supports a waiver.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Wolff, </em>237 Conn. 633, 654-55, 678 A.2d 1369 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">With these principles in mind, Practice Book \u00a7 44-3; see footnote 5 of this opinion; \u201cwas adopted in order to implement the right of a defendant in a criminal case to act as his own attorney .... Before a trial court may accept a defendant\u2019s waiver of counsel, it must conduct an inquiry in accordance with \u00a7 [44-3], in order to satisfy itself that the defendant\u2019s decision to waive counsel is knowingly and intelligently made. . . . Because the \u00a7 [44-3] inquiry simultaneously triggers the constitutional right of a defendant to represent himself and enables the waiver of the constitutional right of a defendant to counsel, the provision of \u00a7 [44-3] cannot be construed to require anything more than is constitutionally mandated.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>T.R.D., </em>supra, 286 Conn. 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Finally, we begin our analysis of the defendant\u2019s claims<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> by setting forth the applicable standard of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>review. We ordinarily review for abuse of discretion a trial court\u2019s determination, made after a canvass pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 44-3, that a defendant has knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to counsel. See, e.g., id., 202. In the present case, however, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly failed to exercise that discretion by canvassing him after he clearly and unequivocally invoked his right to represent himself. Accordingly, whether the defendant\u2019s request was clear and unequivocal presents a mixed question of law and fact, over which, as the Appellate Court recognized, our review is plenary.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>200 Conn. 607, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>611, 614, 513 A.2d 47 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Flanagan, </em>supra, 102 Conn. App. 123-24; see also <em>Gateway Co. </em>v. <em>DiNoia, </em>232 Conn. 223, 239, 654 A.2d 342 (1995) (failure to exercise discretion is improper as matter of law); <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>201 Conn. 74, 88, 513 A.2d 116 (1986) (\u201c[w]hile it is normally true that this court will refrain from interfering with a trial court\u2019s exercise of its discretion . . . this presupposes that the trial court did in fact <em>exercise </em>its discretion\u201d [citation omitted; emphasis in original]). Finally, whether the trial court improperly applied the \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d test to the timeliness of the defendant\u2019s request presents a question of law, over which our review is plenary. See <em>Fish </em>v. <em>Fish, </em>285 Conn. 24, 37, 939 A.2d 1040 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">We first address whether the defendant\u2019s request to proceed pro se was sufficiently clear and unequivocal such that the trial court was required to canvass him pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 44-3. The defendant claims that the Appellate Court misconstrued the record when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>it determined that he had not clearly and unequivocally requested to proceed pro se. Contrary to the Appellate Court\u2019s conclusion, the defendant asserts that the explicit ruling of the trial court categorically denying that request clearly demonstrates that the trial court understood that the request had been made.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In response, the state contends that the Appellate Court properly concluded that the trial court had not violated the defendant\u2019s right to self-representation because the defendant\u2019s request to proceed pro se was not clear and unequivocal. Specifically, relying on the majority opinion of the Appellate Court in <em>Flanagan II, </em>the state contends that the defendant merely inquired about\u2014 but did not assert\u2014his right to waive counsel and proceed pro se. The state also claims that the trial court\u2019s acknowledgment of the issue of substitute counsel, as well as the fact that the defendant never made any other request on the record to proceed pro se, weighs against a finding of a clear and unequivocal waiver of counsel. Accordingly, because it asserts that the Appellate Court properly determined that the defendant\u2019s request was not clear and unequivocal, the state further contends that the trial court was not required, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 44-3, to canvass the defendant regarding his waiver. We agree with the defendant and conclude that the defendant\u2019s request for self-representation was sufficiently clear and unequivocal to trigger the trial court\u2019s obligation to canvass him in accordance with \u00a7 44-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">State and federal courts \u201cconsistently have discussed the right to self-representation in terms of invoking or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>asserting it\u201d; <em>Munkus </em>v. <em>Furlong, </em>170 F.3d 980, 983 (10th Cir. 1999); and have concluded that there can be no infringement of the right to self-representation in the absence of a defendant\u2019s proper assertion of that right. See <em>Daniels </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>316 F.3d 477, 490 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 851, 124 S. Ct. 137, 157 L. Ed. 2d 93 (2003). The threshold requirement that the defendant clearly and unequivocally invoke his right to proceed pro se is one of many safeguards of the fundamental right to counsel. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Frazier-El, </em>204 F.3d 553, 558 (4th Cir.) (\u201c[t]he particular requirement that a request for self-representation be clear and unequivocal is necessary to protect against an inadvertent waiver of the right to counsel by a defendant\u2019s occasional musings on the benefits of self-representation\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 994, 121 S. Ct. 487, 148 L. Ed. 2d 459 (2000). Indeed, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>supra, 200 Conn. 612-14, we stated that \u201c[t]he constitutional right of self-representation depends . . . upon its invocation by the defendant in a clear and unequivocal manner. ... In the absence of a clear and unequivocal assertion of the right to self-representation, a trial court has no independent obligation to inquire into the defendant\u2019s interest in representing himself .... [Instead] recognition of the right becomes a matter entrusted to the exercise of discretion by the trial court.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Conversely, \u201conce there has been an unequivocal request for self-representation, a court must undertake an inquiry [pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 44-3], on the record, to inform the defendant of the risks of self-representation and to permit him to make a knowing and intelligent waiver of his right to counsel.\u201d Id., 613 n.9.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">\u201cTo invoke his [s]ixth [ajmendment right [to self-representation] under <em>Faretta </em>[v. <em>California, </em>supra, 422 U.S. 806] a defendant does not need to recite some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>talismanic formula hoping to open the eyes and ears of the court to his request. Insofar as the desire to proceed pro se is concerned, [a defendant] must do no more than state his request, either orally or in writing, unambiguously to the court so that no reasonable person can say that the request was not made.\u201d <em>Dorman </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>798 F.2d 1358, 1366 (11th Cir. 1986), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Dugger </em>v. <em>Dorman, </em>480 U.S. 951, 107 S. Ct. 1616, 94 L. Ed. 2d 801 (1987). Moreover, \u201cit is generally incumbent upon the courts to elicit that elevated degree of clarity through a detailed inquiry. That is, the triggering statement in a defendant\u2019s attempt to waive his right to counsel need not be punctilious; rather, the dialogue between the court and the defendant must <em>result in </em>a clear and unequivocal statement.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Proctor, </em>166 F.3d 396, 403 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">The decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in <em>United States ex rel.

As in the present case, in which the trial court based its ruling largely on defense counsel\u2019s \u201cbeyond competent and . . . superior\u201d performance at trial, in <em>Denno, </em>the Second Circuit concluded that the trial court improperly had restricted a defendant\u2019s right to self-representation when it answered the defendant\u2019s request that it \u201cgive [him] that permission [to act as his own attorney]\u201d by stating, in relevant part, \u201c[n]o, [n]o. . . . You have got a lawyer, a good lawyer, and he is going to try your case.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 15 n.1. Similarly persuasive is <em>People </em>v. <em>Dent, </em>30 Cal. 4th 213, 65 P.3d 1286, 132 Cal. Rptr. 2d 527 (2003), wherein the Supreme Court of California addressed the issue of a request for self-representation that categorically was denied by the trial court. In <em>Dent, </em>after the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>had appointed new counsel for him, the defendant stated that he wished to proceed with one of his former attorneys orto represent himself. Id., 217. The trial court summarily denied the request for self-representation, stating, \u201c \u2018[n]ot in a death penalty murder trial.\u2019 \u201d Id. The defendant never renewed his request for self-representation. Id. The court in <em>Dent </em>concluded that the trial court had denied the defendant\u2019s request for self-representation and that the record did not otherwise support the denial. Id., 218. Notably, the court rejected the notion that the defendant\u2019s failure to renew his request was evidence of equivocation, stating that the trial court\u2019s denial of the request \u201cmay well have convinced [the] defendant the self-representation option was simply unavailable, and [that] making the request again would be futile.\u201d Id., 219.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Applying these principles to the facts of the present case, we conclude that the defendant clearly and unequivocally invoked his right to self-representation. The fact that the trial court recognized and ruled on the defendant\u2019s request when it stated \u201c[i]n a word, no\u201d in response to the defendant\u2019s request, \u201c[d]on\u2019t I have the right to finish this case myself without [defense counsel] there\u201d and, more tellingly, when the court stated that \u201cif you\u2019re making a request of me that you be allowed to represent yourself or that you be allowed to retain or have a new counsel appointed for you, <em>that request is </em>denied,\u201d compels the conclusion that the defendant communicated his request adequately. (Emphasis added.) Moreover, on the next day of trial, the trial court confirmed on the record that it had denied the defendant\u2019s earlier request to represent himself,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> which was tantamount to a sua sponte articulation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>its previous ruling.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The trial court also gave an explicit reason for its denial of the defendant\u2019s request, that is, that the requisite \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d were wanting, not that the request was equivocal.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Thus, regardless of whether the defendant\u2019s statements were sufficient standing alone, the fact that the trial court ruled on the request clearly demonstrates its acknowledgment that the request had been made. Rather than eliciting more information from the defendant to clarify his request, however, the trial court peremptorily denied the request and thereby effectively foreclosed any possibility that the defendant would renew his inquiries thereafter.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s failure to renew his request was not evidence of equivocation but, rather, reflects his recognition that the trial court had denied his request. See <em>United States </em>v. Hernandez, 203 F.3d 614, 622 (9th Cir. 2000) (\u201cIt is true that [the defendant] did not renew his request in later proceedings. This fact does not diminish the clarity of his request, however, or render it equivocal. ... In circumstances such as these, where it is reasonable for a defendant to believe that a further request would be pointless, we have rejected any suggestion that a defendant must renew his request to represent himself.\u201d), overruled in part on other grounds by <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em>560 F.3d 1060 (9th Cir. 2009); <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>44 F.3d 95, 101 (2d Cir. 1994) (\u201c[t]he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>defendant\u2019s acquiescence [after the trial court\u2019s categorical denial of his request to proceed pro se] cannot be read to signify waiver of a constitutionally protected right . . . [and] even a lawyer could not be faulted for failing to renew a motion under those circumstances\u201d [citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">The state nevertheless contends that the trial court\u2019s statement to the defendant that, \u201cif you\u2019re making a request of me that you be allowed to represent yourself or that you be allowed to retain or have a new counsel appointed for you, that request is denied,\u201d indicates that the defendant\u2019s request was not clear and unequivocal. Specifically, the state claims that, because the trial court mentioned the possibility of alternate rulings\u2014either new counsel or pro se status\u2014the request was equivocal. The possibility of alternate rulings does not, however, preclude a finding of a clear and unequivocal request for self-representation. As the Second Circuit has noted, \u201c[t]o the extent one may view [a request] as conditional ... a defendant is not deemed to have equivocated in his desire for self-representation merely because he expresses that view in the alternative, simultaneously requests the appointment of new counsel, or uses it as a threat to obtain private counsel.\u201d <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>supra, 44 F.3d 100; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hernandez, </em>supra, 203 F.3d 621-22 (\u201c[t]he fact that [the defendant\u2019s] request may have been conditional\u2014 that is, the fact that he requested to represent himself only because the court was unwilling to grant his request for new counsel\u2014is not evidence that the request was equivocal\u201d). Accordingly, we conclude that the record demonstrates that the defendant\u2019s request for self-representation was clear and unequivocal.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">As an alternate ground for affirming the judgment of the Appellate Court upholding the defendant\u2019s convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>tion, the state claims that, even if the defendant\u2019s request for self-representation was clear and unequivocal, the \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d test that the trial court used properly balanced the defendant\u2019s desire to proceed pro se against the resulting prejudice to the state.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In response, the defendant claims that the clause in Practice Book \u00a7 44-3 providing that a defendant shall be permitted to represent himself \u201cat any stage of the proceedings\u201d negates any timeliness requirement and, therefore, that his midtrial request to proceed pro se was proper. We conclude that the balancing test employed by the Second Circuit<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> applies to criminal defendants\u2019 midtrial requests to proceed pro se.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">This court previously has discussed the use of an \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d test when a defendant seeks to discharge his counsel and have new counsel appointed, particularly on the eve of trial or midtrial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>238 Conn. 389, 423-24, 680 A.2d 147 (1996), aff'd after remand, 252 Conn. 128, 750 A.2d 448, cert. denied, 531 U.S. 835, 121 S. Ct. 93, 148 L. Ed. 2d 53 (2000). We have noted a distinction \u201cbetween a substantial and timely request for new counsel pursued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>in good faith, and one made for insufficient cause on the eve or in the middle of trial.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Drakeford, </em>202 Conn. 75, 82, 519 A.2d 1194 (1987). We also have stated that \u201c [t]here is no unlimited opportunity to obtain alternate counsel. ... It is within the trial court\u2019s discretion to determine whether a factual basis exists for appointing new counsel. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">\u201cA request for substitution of counsel requires support by a substantial reason, and may not be used to achieve delay. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">\u201cIn order to work a delay by a last minute discharge of counsel there must exist exceptional circumstances.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted). Id., 83-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">Our research, however, does not reveal any case law applying the stringent \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d test to a defendant\u2019s untimely request to proceed pro se. Indeed, although we were not expressly called upon to determine what test should be applied to that issue, our conclusions in <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>supra, 238 Conn. 424-26, indicate that a less burdensome standard may apply to an untimely request to proceed pro se, than to an untimely request to substitute counsel. See id. (concluding that no exceptional circumstances existed to justify defendant\u2019s untimely request to substitute counsel, but proceeding to analyze whether trial court properly canvassed defendant on his request to proceed pro se, made at same time as request to substitute counsel). Such a conclusion is consistent with the fact that a defendant\u2019s right to self-representation raises distinctly different, and more compelling, concerns than does his right to replace competent counsel on the eve of trial. Compare, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Drakeford, </em>supra, 202 Conn. 83 (\u201cThere is no unlimited opportunity to obtain alternate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>counsel. ... It is within the trial court\u2019s discretion to determine whether a factual basis exists for appointing new counsel.\u201d [Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.]), with <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 302 (recognizing \u201cthe inviolability of the right of self-representation\u201d), and <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>supra, 44 F.3d 99 (\u201c[t]he right of a defendant in a criminal case to act as his own lawyer is <em>unqualified </em>if invoked prior to the start of the trial\u201d [emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted]). Accordingly, we are not persuaded that the \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d test applies to a defendant\u2019s untimely request to proceed pro se.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">We also, however, disagree with the defendant\u2019s claim that no timeliness requirement applies at all because the provision, \u201cat any stage of the trial proceedings,\u201d in Practice Book \u00a7 44-3 negates any such requirement. Rather, we agree with Judge Rogers who stated, in her dissenting opinion, that this provision in \u00a7 44-3 does not operate to eliminate considerations of timeliness from the court\u2019s assessment of whether a defendant should be permitted to proceed pro se because, to interpret the rule in that way \u201camounts to holding that a rule of practice enlarges the substantive right of self-representation beyond its bounds as currently established by the text of the relevant constitutional provisions and the cases interpreting them.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Flanagan, </em>supra, 102 Conn. App. 152; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>D'Antonio, </em>274 Conn. 658, 710, 877 A.2d 696 (2005) (\u201cthe provisions of \u00a7 [44-3] cannot be construed to require anything more than is constitutionally mandated\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>State </em>v. <em>Wolff, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 653-54 (\u201c[\u00a7 44-3] and the constitutional requirements for permitting a defendant to waive his right to counsel and, thereby, assert his constitutional right to represent himself, are synonymous\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>Indeed, the United States Supreme Court recognized in <em>Faretta </em>v. <em>California, </em>supra, 422 U.S. 806, that there are three grounds for denying a defendant his right to self-representation: \u201c(1) <em>he makes the request in untimely fashion such that granting it would disrupt the proceedings; </em>[id., 807]; (2) the defendant engages in serious obstructionist misconduct; id., 834 n.46; and (3) the defendant has not knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel.

Assuming, however, that a defendant\u2019s request to proceed pro se is informed, voluntary and unequivocal, [t]he right of a defendant in a criminal case to act as his own lawyer is <em>unqualified </em>if invoked prior to the start of the trial. . . .

In exercising this discretion, the appropriate criteria for a trial judge to consider are [1] the defendant\u2019s reasons for the self-representation request, [2] the quality of counsel representing the [defendant], and [3] the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>[defendant\u2019s] prior proclivity to substitute counsel.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>supra, 99-100 n.1.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">We conclude that this balancing test employed by the Second Circuit represents an appropriate inquiry in evaluating the first ground for denying a defendant his right to self-representation suggested by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Faretta </em>v. <em>California, </em>supra, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>422 U.S. 807, namely, whether the defendant made his request \u201cin untimely fashion such that granting it would disrupt the proceedings . . . (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Townsend, </em>supra, 211 Conn. 221 n.4. Accordingly, we conclude that, when a defendant clearly and unequivocally has invoked his right to self-representation after the trial has begun, the trial court must consider: (1) the defendant\u2019s reasons for the self-representation request; (2) the quality of the defendant\u2019s counsel; and (3) the defendant\u2019s prior proclivity to substitute counsel. If, after a thorough consideration of these factors, the trial court determines, in its discretion, that the balance weighs in favor of the defendant\u2019s interest in self-representation, the court must then proceed to canvass the defendant in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 44-3 to ensure that the defendant\u2019s choice to proceed pro se has been made in a knowing and intelligent fashion. If, on the other hand, the court determines, on the basis of those criteria, that the potential disruption of the proceedings already in progress outweighs the defendant\u2019s interest in self-representation, then the court should deny the defendant\u2019s request and need not engage in a \u00a7 44-3 canvass.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">In the present case, our review of the record demonstrates that the trial court did not apply this balancing test when it denied the defendant\u2019s request to proceed pro se<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and instead improperly applied the \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d test employed for untimely requests to substitute counsel. Accordingly, we remand the case to the trial court to apply the appropriate criteria, as set forth in this opinion, to the defendant\u2019s request, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>determine if it would have been required to canvass the defendant in accordance with \u00a7 44-3.

In addition, because the improper denial of a request for self-representation is structural error;<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> see, e.g., <em>McKaskle </em>v. <em>Wiggins, </em>465 U.S. 168, 177 n.8, 104 S.

Flanagan, supra, 102 Conn. App. 134-35, 137-38. Chief Judge Flynn also concluded that the trial court improperly applied the \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d test when it ruled on the timeliness of the defendant\u2019s request. Id., 141-42. Chief Judge Flynn determined that, if the case was reviewed only under the federal constitution, the federal balancing test employed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit was the appropriate test, under which the trial court weighs the defendant\u2019s right to self-representation against the potential for disruption of the proceedings already in progress. Id., 143. Additionally, Chief Judge Flynn concluded that the majority should have reviewed the defendant\u2019s claim under the state constitution, because the defendant had contended on appeal that the trial court had violated Practice Book \u00a7 44-3 and that this court had ruled, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Wolff, </em>237 Conn. 633, 653-54, 678 A.2d 1369 (1996), that the requirements of Practice Book \u00a7 44-3 are coextensive with the constitutional requirements. <em>State </em>v. <em>Flanagan, </em>supra, 148 n.13. Chief Judge Flynn further contended that the provision of Practice Book \u00a7 44-3 providing that a defendant shall be permitted to represent himself \u201cat any stage of the proceedings\u201d negates any timeliness requirement and, therefore, that the defendant\u2019s midtrial request to proceed pro se was not untimely. Id., 148-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">In the second dissent, then Judge Rogers, joined by Judge DiPentima and then Judge McLachlan, concluded that the fact that the trial court had denied the defendant\u2019s request to proceed pro se \u201ccompels the conclusion that the request was communicated adequately.\u201d Id., 150. As to the timeliness issue, Judge Rogers agreed with Chief Judge Flynn that the trial court should have conducted the federal balancing test employed by the Second Circuit and that the trial court, therefore, improperly applied the \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d test to the defendant\u2019s request. Id., 151. Judge Rogers disagreed, however, with Chief Judge Flynn on his assertion that Practice Book \u00a7 44-3 eliminates any timeliness consideration. Id., 152. Instead, Judge Rogers concluded that our case law requires the conclusion that Practice Book \u00a7 44-3 be interpreted so as not to enlarge the right to self-representation but, rather, \u201cto mirror its scope as established by the jurisprudence concerning that right.\u201d Id., 153. Judge Rogers concluded, therefore, that \u201ctimeliness is an appropriate consideration for a court in determining whether [a request to proceed pro se] ought to be permitted.\u201d Id., 154.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b441-7\"> Thus, a defendant \u201cdoes not possess a constitutional right to a specifically formulated canvass [with respect to this inquiry]. His constitutional right is not violated as long as the court\u2019s canvass, whatever its form, is sufficient to establish that the defendant\u2019s waiver was voluntary and knowing. . . . In other words, the court may accept a waiver of the right to counsel without specifically questioning a defendant on each of the factors listed in . . . \u00a7 [44-3] if the record is sufficient to establish that the waiver is voluntary and knowing.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>274 Conn. 818, 831, 878 A.2d 1078 (2005); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>D\u2019Antonio, </em>274 Conn. 658, 709, 877 A.2d 696 (2005) (\u201cwe do not review the proceedings for strict compliance with the prophylactic rule of . . . \u00a7 44-3, but rather for evidence that the waiver of counsel was made knowledgeably and voluntarily\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b441-8\"> The defendant asserts that his claims are preserved for review, but to the extent that we do not find his claims preserved, he requests review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), and the plain error doctrine. See Practice Book \u00a7 60-5. We conclude, however, that the defendant\u2019s claims are preserved for review and we need not consider the claims under either doctrine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b442-6\"> Relying on <em>In re Tyqwane V., </em>85 Conn. App. 528, 857 A.2d 963 (2004), the defendant challenges the plenary standard of review applied by the Appellate Court, and claims that it cannot withstand due process scrutiny under <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 96 S. Ct. 893, 47 L. Ed. 2d 18 (1976). Specifically, rather than the Appellate Court reviewing the whole record on appeal, the defendant advocates a per se rule: if the trial court ruled on a request to proceed pro se, then such a request was per se clear and unequivocal. Further, if a trial court has not ruled on such a request, then the Appellate Court is to determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in not recognizing the existence of such a request. The state contends that the defendant\u2019s claim is unreviewable because he did not raise it in his petition for certification to appeal and because it is outside the scope of the certified issue. Even if the issue is reviewable, the state asserts that the proper standard of review is de novo review, the standard employed by the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">Although we conclude that the issue of whether the Appellate Court applied the proper standard of review necessarily is within the scope of the certified question, we also conclude that the Appellate Court properly engaged in de novo review on the issue of whether the defendant clearly and unequivocally had requested to proceed pro se. Our courts consistently have applied an independent and, in effect, de novo review in determining this same issue. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>200 Conn. 607, 611, 614, 513 A.2d 47 (1986) (conducting independent review of record to determine if request was clear and unequivocal); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gethers, </em>197 Conn. 369, 378, 497 A.2d 408 (1985) (same); <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>64 Conn. App. 512, 530-31, 781 A.2d 325 (same), cert. granted, 258 Conn. 911, 782 A.2d 1251 (2001) (appeal dismissed April 24, 2003). Moreover, courts from other jurisdictions have engaged in de novo review of this issue, particularly on direct appeal. See, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cano, </em>519 F.3d 512, 515-16 (5th Cir. 2008) (applying de novo review to determine whether request was clear and unequivocal); <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>203 F.3d 614, 621-23 (9th Cir. 2000) (conducting independent review of record to determine if request was clear and unequivocal), overruled in part on other grounds by <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em>560 F.3d 1060 (9th Cir. 2009); <em>Raulerson </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>732 F.2d 803, 808-809 (11th Cir.)

Furthermore, <em>In re Tyqwane V. </em>does not support the defendant\u2019s argument, in that the court in that case did not address whether due process was implicated by the application of a particular appellate standard of review, and did not cite any case law supporting such a conclusion.
