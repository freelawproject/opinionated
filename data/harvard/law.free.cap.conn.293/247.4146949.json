The intervening three judge panel (panel) appealed from the judgment of the Appellate Court, which concluded that the panel is required to hold a hearing to determine whether the petitioner, Robert Lawlor, is entitled to disclosure of the state\u2019s application for, and the panel\u2019s order authorizing, a grand jury investigation pursuant to the grand jury statutes. The panel asserts that General Statutes \u00a7 54-47e<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is nondiscretionary in that it provides that the application and order \u201cshall be sealed,\u201d without recourse through appellate review.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The petitioner, on the other hand, joined in this appeal by the state,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> claims that \u00a7 54-47g (a)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> controls the disposition of the documents at issue and requires that the panel hold a hearing to consider whether disclosure of the application and order would be in the public interest. The petitioner further argues that the proper application of \u00a7 54-47g precludes this court from asserting jurisdiction over this appeal. Because we agree with the panel that the grand jury statutes do not contemplate the disclosure of the sealed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>application and order, we conclude that the hearing that the Appellate Court ordered is contrary to the grand jury statutes. Therefore, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court and remand the case to that court with direction to deny the relief requested in the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">The following facts and procedural history, which are set forth in the Appellate Court\u2019s opinion, are undisputed. \u201cIn the fall of 2005, John A. Connelly, [the] state\u2019s attorney for the judicial district of Waterbury, filed with the panel an application for an investigation into the commission of a crime [or crimes] stemming from the shooting death of Jashon Bryant on May 7, 2005. The panel approved the application, and the Honorable George N. Thim, a judge of the Superior Court, was appointed as an investigatory grand jury. Pursuant to ... \u00a7 54-47e, both the application for the investigatory grand jury and a copy of the panel\u2019s order thereon were sealed. In addition, the original order and a copy of the application were transmitted to the investigatory grand jury, as required by General Statutes \u00a7 54-47d (b). Judge Thim thereafter conducted an investigation, at the conclusion of which he issued a report that concluded that there was probable cause to believe that the petitioner ... [a police officer with] the Hartford police department, committed [one or more] crime[s].<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On that basis, an arrest warrant signed by the court, <em>Damiani, J., </em>subsequently was issued, charging the petitioner with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>manslaughter in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3) and assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (5). The petitioner was arrested on June 22, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">\u201cOn June 14, 2007, the state filed with the panel a request for disclosure of \u2018a copy of the application for the appointment of a grand [jury] filed by [Connelly] and a copy of the order issued by the [panel] appointing the [investigatory grand jury].\u2019 That filing concluded that \u2018it is requested that for the purpose of full and fair discovery, such material be ordered unsealed for viewing by [the] office [of the state\u2019s attorney] and [by] the [petitioner].\u2019 In denying that request, the . . . panel stated: \u2018[The] request for disclosure is denied, pursuant to \u00a7 54-47e, which specifically requires that any application filed with the panel and any order authorizing the investigation \u201cshall be sealed.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>In re Judicial Inquiry No. </em>2005-02, 104 Conn. App. 398, 400-401, 934 A.2d 248 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">The petitioner, who sought to challenge the panel\u2019s decision, filed a petition for review with the Appellate Court, which the Appellate Court granted.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Appellate Court determined that the requested documents, i.e., the application and order, are part of the \u201crecord\u201d under \u00a7 54-47g; id., 406; and thus concluded that the panel was statutorily required to conduct a hearing on the request for disclosure of these documents in order to determine whether such disclosure is in the public interest. Id., 415-16. The Appellate Court\u2019s conclusion was based primarily on dictionary definitions of the word \u201crecord,\u201d as well as an unrelated reference in Practice Book \u00a7 61-10 to the scope of the phrase \u201cadequate record for review.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>In re Judicial Inquiry No. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number><em>2005-02, </em>supra, 104 Conn. App. 404-405. The Appellate Court also placed weight on the fact that the panel was required to file the application and order with the grand jury once the grand jury was appointed. Id., 405. This certified appeal followed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">As a threshold matter, we must address the issue of this court\u2019s jurisdiction to consider the panel\u2019s appeal. The petitioner argues that this court lacks jurisdiction to consider a petition for certification from a decision of the Appellate Court on a petition for review filed pursuant to \u00a7 54-47g (a). The petitioner claims that our decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Ayala, </em>222 Conn. 331, 610 A.2d 1162 (1992), supports this position. We conclude that <em>Ayala </em>is distinguishable from the present case and that the principles expressed in that case do not deprive this court of jurisdiction to consider this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">Consideration of the petitioner\u2019s jurisdictional claims requires adherence to several well established principles. First among these principles is that \u201c[a] court lacks discretion to consider the merits of a case over which it is without jurisdiction . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Soracco </em>v. <em>Williams Scotsman, Inc., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>292 Conn. 86, 91, 971 A.2d 1 (2009). \u201cSubject matter jurisdiction is the power [of the court] to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in question belong.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>MBNA America Bank, N.A. </em>v. <em>Boata, </em>283 Conn. 381, 389, 926 A.2d 1035 (2007). Although it is a critical prerequisite to any court\u2019s involvement in a case, we repeatedly have held that, when \u201ca decision as to whether a court has subject matter jurisdiction is required, every presumption favoring jurisdiction should be indulged.\u201d <em>Demar </em>v. <em>Open Space &amp; Conservation Commission, </em>211 Conn. 416, 425, 559 A.2d 1103 (1989); see also <em>Seebeck </em>v. <em>State, </em>246 Conn. 514, 533, 717 A.2d 1161 (1998) (noting \u201cthe long recognized presumption in favor of appellate jurisdiction\u201d). With these principles in mind, we examine our decision in <em>Ayala.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">In <em>Ayala, </em>the defendant, Enrique Ayala, filed a petition for review with the Appellate Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-63g,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> challenging the trial court\u2019s revocation of his bail. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ayala, </em>supra, 222 Conn. 334. Critical to our conclusion that this court lacked jurisdiction to consider the merits of Ayala\u2019s appeal was our determination that, \u201c[i]n th[at] case, the Appellate Court did not undertake finally to determine <em>an appeal. </em>Instead, in accordance with \u00a7 54-63g, the Appellate Court granted [Ayala\u2019s] petition for review of the revocation of his bail but denied the relief that he had requested. That decision was neither the determination of \u2018an appeal\u2019 nor action that constituted a final judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) Id., 338-39. We further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>noted that \u201c[t]he legislature . . . has the authority to make interlocutory orders immediately renewable, in summary fashion, by authorizing petitions for review, usually within a limited time period, and often specifically to the Appellate Court.\u201d Id., 340. Thus, our conclusion in <em>Ayala </em>that we lacked jurisdiction<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> apparently was based on two subsidiary determinations, namely, that (1) the Appellate Court had not finally determined an appeal and that, (2) because the trial court\u2019s revocation of Ayala\u2019s bail was an interlocutory order, the petition for review was not an \u201cappeal\u201d to the Appellate Court for purposes of General Statutes \u00a7 51-197f.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See id., 338-39. We now conclude, however, that the former determination was incorrect.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Although it is true that, \u201c[i]n a criminal proceeding, there is no final judgment until the imposition of a sentence\u201d; id., 339; the fact that there remained an unresolved, underlying criminal case in <em>Ayala </em>is not determinative of whether the <em>Appellate Court\u2019s </em>decision to uphold the trial court\u2019s revocation of bail was a \u201cfinal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>determination\u201d of the petition for review for purposes of \u00a7 51-197f. The authors of one prominent treatise on Connecticut appellate procedure, in commenting on the distinction between the final judgment rule and the requirement of a \u201cfinal determination\u201d under \u00a7 51-197f, have noted that, \u201cthe final determination of an appeal rule looks at the finality of the appeal, not at the finality of the underlying judgment. Thus, even though a remand by the Appellate Court may vitiate the finality of the trial court\u2019s judgment, the appeal to the Appellate Court has been finally determined because that court has completed its work. As stated by the Supreme Court in the context of the finality of a Superior Court remand in an administrative appeal: Nothing further remained to be decided by the court. The appeal was terminated. The issues which it presented were all resolved.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) C. Tait &amp; E. Prescott, Connecticut Appellate Procedure (3d Ed. 2000) \u00a7 7.2, pp. 265-66, quoting <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>138 Conn. 464, 468, 86 A.2d 67 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">We agree with the foregoing formulation and believe that our case law supports this understanding of what constitutes a \u201cfinal determination\u201d of the Appellate Court. For instance, in <em>Gold </em>v. <em>East Haddam, </em>290 Conn. 668, 966 A.2d 684 (2009), we recently held that the Appellate Court\u2019s reversal of the trial court\u2019s summary judgment was, indeed, a final determination over which this court could exercise jurisdiction pursuant to \u00a7 51-197f even though \u201cthe judgment of the Appellate Court amounted to a denial of the motion for summary judgment and put [the] case in the same procedural posture that it would have been in if the trial court had denied the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment . . . .\u201d Id., 676.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The procedural circumstances present in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number><em>Ayala </em>are similar to those that were present in <em>Gold. </em>In <em>Ayala, </em>the Appellate Court granted the petition for review, considered it on the merits and denied the relief requested therein. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ayala, </em>supra, 222 Conn. 334. Nothing further remained for the Appellate Court to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">We conclude that a final determination exists, for purposes of exercising our jurisdiction under \u00a7 51-197f, once the Appellate Court conclusively resolves the issue or issues before it and disposes of the cause such that no further action is necessary on <em>its </em>part. In other words, the critical factor in determining whether this court has jurisdiction is whether the decision of the <em>Appellate Court </em>represents a final determination. In order for jurisdiction to lie with this court, the statute merely requires that there be a \u201cfinal determination of any appeal by the Appellate Court . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 51-197f. Thus, the sole proper basis for our decision in <em>Ayala </em>was our determination that the petition for review was not an appeal, due to the interlocutory nature of the trial court\u2019s action, and the specific and limited nature of the petition for review authorized by \u00a7 54-63g.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Although the Appellate Court\u2019s judgment in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number><em>Ayala </em>may have represented a final determination of that court for purposes of \u00a7 51-197f, there was no \u201cappeal\u201d to the Appellate Court within the meaning of \u00a7 51-197f because the underlying Superior Court order was interlocutory, and, therefore, no appeal was statutorily authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">With this background in mind, we have no difficulty concluding that, in the present case, the petition for review of the panel\u2019s determination that it had no statutory authorization to disclose the application and order was tantamount to an \u201cappeal\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 51-197f.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The operative statute, namely, General Statutes \u00a7 54-47g (a), provides that \u201c[a]ny person aggrieved by an order of the panel shall have <em>the right to appeal </em>such order by filing a petition for review with the Appellate Court . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The use of the term \u201cappeal\u201d in \u00a7 54-47g (a), in contrast to the language used in the bail revocation statute at issue in <em>Ayala,</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em> </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>is a strong indication that the legislature did not intend for the Appellate Court to be the court of last resort with respect to the review of grand jury panel orders.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> See <em>Asylum Hill Problem Solving Revitalization Assn. </em>v. <em>King, </em>277 Conn. 238, 256, 890 A.2d 522 (2006) (when \u201ca statute, with reference to one subject contains a given provision, the omission of such provision from a similar statute concerning a related subject ... is significant to show that a different intention existed\u201d).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">Furthermore, it is clear that the Appellate Court\u2019s directive that the panel hold a hearing to determine whether disclosure of the application and order is in the public interest represents a final determination of that court. The issues that were presented to the Appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>late Court were all conclusively resolved. We conclude, therefore, that the decision of the Appellate Court was a final determination of an appeal and, as such, was the proper subject of a petition for certification to appeal to this court pursuant to \u00a7 51-197f.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">We now turn to the panel\u2019s claim that the Appellate Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider the petitioner\u2019s petition for review of the panel\u2019s denial of his request to disclose the documents sealed pursuant to \u00a7 54-47e. The panel claims that the grand jury statutes do not provide for appellate review of its nondiscretionary sealing of the application and order, thus depriving the Appellate Court of jurisdiction over the petition for review. The panel also argues that, because \u00a7 54-47e does not vest it with discretion to disclose the application and order, the petitioner\u2019s appeal does not present a justiciable controversy. Finally, the panel claims that the Appellate Court lacked jurisdiction because the petitioner cannot challenge the empanelment of the grand jury and thus cannot obtain any practical relief by disclosure of the application and order. The petitioner, on the other hand, contends that the Appellate Court has exclusive jurisdiction over his petition for review of the panel\u2019s denial of his request for disclosure of the application and order. He argues that the Appellate Court properly concluded that the application and order are part of the record of the investigation and that that court had jurisdiction to consider his petition for review pursuant to \u00a7 54-47g.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">We conclude that the Appellate Court properly exercised jurisdiction over the petition for review. The subject matter jurisdiction of the Appellate Court is governed by statute. See, e.g., <em>Brown &amp; Brown, Inc. </em>v. <em>Blumenthal, </em>288 Conn. 646, 652, 954 A.2d 816 (2008); <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27, 30, 463 A.2d 566 (1983). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-47g (a), \u201c[a]ny person aggrieved by an order of the panel shall have the right to appeal such order by filing a petition for review with the Appellate Court . . . .\u201d Although we ultimately disagree with the Appellate Court\u2019s interpretation of the statutory scheme and conclude that the petitioner is not entitled to disclosure of the application and order, we believe that a colorable claim of aggrievement is sufficient to satisfy the review provision of \u00a7 54-47g (a) and vest the Appellate Court with jurisdiction to consider the merits of the petition for review. See <em>In re Shaquanna M., </em>61 Conn. App. 592, 598, 767 A.2d 155 (2001) (\u201c[a]n individual establishes classical aggrievement if there is a <em>possibility, </em>not necessarily a certainty, that a legally protected interest is adversely affected\u201d [emphasis added]). The state filed a request for disclosure with the panel in accordance with the procedure set forth in \u00a7 54-47g (a), which the panel denied. The state had filed this request in response to the petitioner\u2019s request that the state disclose a copy of the application and order in the course of discovery in the petitioner\u2019s criminal case. The panel\u2019s denial of the request for disclosure caused the petitioner to be sufficiently aggrieved so as to allow the Appellate Court to exercise jurisdiction over the petition for review, regardless of its ultimate decision on the merits. Thus, we proceed to consider whether the Appellate Court correctly construed the grand jury statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">Resolving this case requires us to interpret the grand jury statutes, a task that is subject to our plenary review. See, e.g., <em>Dept. of Transportation </em>v. <em>White Oak Corp., </em>287 Conn. 1, 7, 946 A.2d 1219 (2008). Through our established approach to statutory construction, we strive \u201cto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature.\u201d <em>Friezo </em>v. <em>Friezo, </em>281 Conn. 166, 181, 914 A.2d 533 (2007). General Statutes \u00a7 1-2z governs our statutory analysis, directing us first to examine the text of the statute we seek to construe and to consider its relationship to related statutes. If this inquiry reveals a plain and unambiguous meaning that does not yield absurd or unworkable results, our inquiry is at an end. General Statutes \u00a7 1-2z. If this approach does not reveal a plain and unambiguous meaning or does yield absurd or unworkable results, then our resort to extratextual sources is warranted so that we may arrive at an interpretation of the statutory language most consistent with the legislature\u2019s intent. See General Statutes \u00a7 1-2z. We are further guided in this inquiry by the presumption that the legislature, in amending or enacting statutes, \u201calways [is] presumed to have created a harmonious and consistent body of law . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re William D., </em>284 Conn. 305, 313, 933 A.2d 1147 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Textual Analysis of Statutory Scheme</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">To determine whether the Appellate Court properly disposed of the petitioner\u2019s appeal, we first must determine whether the meaning of the term \u201crecord of the investigation\u201d set forth in \u00a7 54-47g encompasses the \u201corder\u201d and \u201capplication\u201d referred to in \u00a7 54-47e. We begin by noting that neither the term \u201crecord of the investigation\u201d nor the more general term \u201crecord\u201d is defined in \u00a7 54-47b.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We begin our analysis by focusing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>on \u00a7 54-47e.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> This statute, more than any other in the grand jury statutes, illustrates the carefully drawn distinctions among the key terms. There are essentially three main parts to \u00a7 54-47e, all contained within a single paragraph. The first part expressly declares that the application and order \u201cshall be sealed\u201d by the panel. General Statutes \u00a7 54-47e. Next, the statute directs the panel to submit, among other things, a summary of the scope of the investigation, which \u201cshall be public unless the panel determines, by majority vote, that such summary be sealed . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 54-47e. The final part provides that \u201c [a]ny investigation by the investigatory grand jury shall be conducted in private, provided the panel, by a majority vote, may order the investigation or any portion thereof to be public when such disclosure or order is deemed by the panel to be in the public interest.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 54-47e. Thus, the legislature clearly distinguished the \u201capplication\u201d and \u201corder,\u201d on the one hand, from the \u201cfinding and record of the investigation,\u201d on the other. By sealing the application and order, and making the summary public, \u00a7 54-47e strikes an explicit and careful balance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>between the need for confidentiality in the grand jury process and the public\u2019s right to scrutinize the endeavors of state law enforcement officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">The juxtaposition of the three parts of \u00a7 54-47e is instructive. Unlike the summary and investigation itself, the provision requiring the sealing of the application and order does not contain any exception allowing disclosure of these documents, nor does it contain any standard that would serve to guide such a decision. This fact suggests that the sealing of the application and order is absolute. Moreover, we fail to discern the purpose of the separate summary of the scope of the investigation, which is presumptively public, if in fact the legislature intended that the application and order could be publicly disclosed at the discretion of either the panel or the grand jury, or by the request of a third party pursuant to the disclosure provisions of \u00a7 54-47g.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">In light of the foregoing, the existence of the final portion of \u00a7 54-47e, which allows the panel to open the entire investigation to the public from the outset, also strongly indicates that the grand jury statutes consistently treat the application and order as distinct from the investigation itself. Under \u00a7 54-47e, the investigation itself is presumptively private from its inception, and the panel must determine that opening any part of the ongoing investigation to the public is in the public interest for that presumption to be overcome. It is revealing that the application and order are specifically and expressly exempted from the panel\u2019s discretion to disclose under the public interest exception. It appears that the presumptively public summary of the scope of the investigation was intended as a compromise, mitigating any consequences of the mandatory sealing of the application and order.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">A review of the other relevant provisions in the grand jury statutes that address the key terms also demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>strates that the legislature intended to treat the application and order as separate and distinct from the actual conduct of the \u201cinvestigation\u201d and any record thereof. This consistent approach supports the panel\u2019s claim that the disclosure provisions in \u00a7 54-47g relating to the \u201crecord of the investigation\u201d could not have been intended to apply to the application and order. Indeed, at each stage of the process, the application and order are treated as distinct from the investigation itself. For instance, General Statutes \u00a7 54-47c sets forth, in detail, the procedure that must be followed to apply for an investigatory grand jury.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Next, General Statutes \u00a7 54-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>47d (a) provides: <em>\u201cIf the </em>panel approves the application and orders an investigation into the commission of a crime or crimes, the Chief Court Administrator shall (1) appoint an investigatory grand jury to conduct the investigation, and (2) designate the court location in the judicial district where . . . any findings and records of the investigation shall be filed.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This language clearly indicates that a \u201c[record] of the investigation\u201d exists <em>only if </em>the application is approved and an investigation ordered. General Statutes \u00a7 54-47d (a); see also General Statutes \u00a7 54-47c (d) (\u201c[t]he panel <em>may </em>approve the application and order an investigation\u201d [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">In fact, in the statutes dealing with the application for, and appointment of, an investigatory grand jury, the phrase \u201crecord of the investigation\u201d or \u201crecords of the investigation\u201d always is used conditionally and discussed in the future tense. For instance, General Statutes \u00a7 54-47d (a) provides that, <em>in the event </em>that an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>application is approved, the chief court administrator shall designate the court in which \u201cany . . . records of the investigation shall be filed.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 54-47e similarly directs the panel to provide a recommendation about where the \u201crecord of the investigation\u201d is to be filed. This language can be read sensibly only when it includes the implicit caveat, \u201conce the investigation is completed.\u201d Importantly, General Statutes \u00a7 54-47e mandates that \u201cany application filed with the panel . . . shall be sealed\u201d without regard to the ultimate disposition of such application. It is difficult to fathom how an <em>unapproved </em>application can be considered a part of the record of an investigation that is never conducted, and there is no provision in the grand jury statutes providing for the public disclosure of any preliminary documents if the panel ultimately decides <em>not </em>to order an investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">On the other hand, the two grand jury statutes that directly concern the conduct and conclusion of the grand jury\u2019s investigation, namely, General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 54-47f and 54-47g, refer to the record of the investigation as if it were created contemporaneously with the investigation itself. First, General Statutes \u00a7 54-47f (g) provides: \u201cAn official stenographer of the Superior Court or his assistant shall <em>record </em>any testimony taken at <em>the </em>investigation.\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 54-47g (a) further directs that \u201c[t]he stenographer shall file any <em>record of the investigation </em>with the [designated] court . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) It is unlikely that the stenographer would have access to the sealed order and application during the normal course of performing his ministerial duties, or that his duties would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>require the filing of such documents. Moreover, General Statutes \u00a7 54-47g (b) provides that \u201c[t]he finding [of the investigation] may include all or such part of the record as the investigatory grand jury may determine\u201d and that \u201c [t]he finding of the investigation shall be open to public inspection and copying\u201d unless the chief state\u2019s attorney or a state\u2019s attorney files a timely objection with the grand jury. It seems incongruous with the grand jury statutes as a whole that the application and order, sealed by the panel from the outset by statutory directive, could be made public at the discretion of the grand jury and without input from the panel merely by virtue of their inclusion in the finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Indeed, this highlights a flaw in the Appellate Court\u2019s reasoning. The Appellate Court first concluded that \u201cthe application and order transmitted by the panel pursuant to \u00a7 54-47d (b) are part of the record of the investigatory grand jury.\u201d <em>In re Judicial Inquiry No. 2005-02, </em>supra, 104 Conn. App. 406. The Appellate Court subsequently declared \u201cthat the application for the investigatory grand jury and the panel\u2019s order thereon <em>must be sealed at the outset of the investigation and remain so unless, </em>following the conclusion of the investigation and the filing of the finding and record of the investigatory grand jury, <em>a majority of the panel deem[s] their disclosure to be in the public </em>interest.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 413. These conclusions are clearly inconsistent. If the application and order are included in the record of the investigation, then they may be disclosed \u201cas the investigatory grand jury may determine,\u201d without the panel\u2019s approval. General Statutes \u00a7 54-47g (b). If, on the other hand, the application and order are <em>not </em>within the scope of the record of the investigation, they cannot be disclosed at the grand jury\u2019s discretion, as subsections (a)<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and (d)<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> of \u00a7 54-47g provide only a means <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>for requesting that a part of the record of the investigation be unsealed. Thus, contrary to the Appellate Court\u2019s conclusion, the application and order cannot be a part of the record of the investigation and simultaneously \u201cbe sealed at the outset of the investigation and remain so unless ... a majority of the panel deem[s] their disclosure to be in the public interest.\u201d <em>In re Judicial Inquiry No. 2005-02, </em>supra, 413.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Finally, we note that the grand jury statutes include two separate sealing directives, which would make little sense unless the legislature intended the application and order to be treated differently from the record produced as a result of the grand jury\u2019s investigation. As we previously discussed, General Statutes \u00a7 54-47e provides in relevant part that the application and order \u201cshall be sealed. ...\u201d The grand jury statutes do not thereafter expressly provide for the possibility of unsealing or disclosing the application and order. General Statutes \u00a7 54-47g (b) provides in relevant part that \u201c [t]he finding of the investigation shall be open to public inspection . . . [and it] may include all or such part of the record as the investigatory grand jury may determine . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 54-47g (a) provides in relevant part that \u201cany part of the record of the investigation not disclosed with the finding pursuant to subsection (b) of this section <em>shall be sealed, </em>provided any person may file an application with the panel for disclosure of any such part of the record. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) It is unclear why, if the application and order are part of the record of the investigation, there is a need for those documents to be sealed under \u00a7 54-47e, and then sealed again under \u00a7 54-47g (a), assuming they are not disclosed by the grand jury with its finding. This apparent duplication further bolsters our under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>standing that the application and order are distinct from the record of the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Despite this strong structural and textual evidence in support of a restrictive construction of the term \u201crecord of the investigation,\u201d there is one element of the statutory scheme that the Appellate Court found to be particularly troubling. General Statutes \u00a7 54-47d (b) provides in relevant part that, at the time the grand jury is appointed, \u201c[t]he panel shall retain a copy of the order and the original application and shall transmit to the investigatory grand jury, appointed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the original order and a copy of the application filed with the panel.\u201d The Appellate Court found this to be persuasive evidence for its conclusion that \u201c[these] materials constitute part of the record of the investigatory grand jury.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> <em>In re Judicial Inquiry No. 2005-02, </em>supra, 104 Conn. App. 405. The petitioner also relies heavily on this reasoning, arguing that, \u201c[o]nce transmitted, the order and the application necessarily, and as a matter of common sense, become part of the documents contained in the file of the clerk of the court [where] the grand jury investigation has been assigned.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Although we are not persuaded that such a formulation is in any way necessary or \u201ca matter of common sense,\u201d we do agree that there is more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>one reasonable manner in which this specific language of \u00a7 54-47d (b) may be read.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Once appointed, the grand jury receives the panel\u2019s original order and a copy of the application. In our view, this fact does not <em>necessarily </em>imply that these items become a part of the record of the yet to be conducted investigation, as the petitioner asserts. The petitioner\u2019s position, however, is not an entirely unreasonable interpretation of the effect of \u00a7 54-47d (b) on the status of the application and order. Because we conclude that it is unclear, at this point in the grand jury process, how the legislature intended for the application and order to be treated, we believe that an examination of relevant extratextual evidence is appropriate to clarify our understanding of the key statutory terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">Legislative History</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">We proceed, therefore, to consider any legislative history that might reveal how the legislature intended these terms to be interpreted. The petitioner, quoting <em>In re Judicial Inquiry No. 2005-02, </em>supra, 104 Conn. App. 405 n.6, declares that \u201cthe Appellate Court was correct when it stated that the \u2018legislative histoiy of the [grand jury statutes] sheds no light on whether the term \u201crecord,\u201d as it is used therein, encompasses the application for the investigatory grand jury and the panel\u2019s order thereon.\u2019 \u201d The state, in its brief to this court, expresses a similar sentiment, declaring that the legislative history is, \u201cat best, inconclusive.\u201d The panel, on the other hand, relies heavily on the legislative history in support of the interpretation of the statutes that it advances. In our view, the extensive recorded discussions and debates surrounding the enactment of the grand jury statutes in 1985, as well as their evolution through subsequent amendments in 1987 and 1988, are particularly illuminating.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>As the Appellate Court noted, the investigatory grand jury \u201cis entirely a creature of statute.\u201d <em>In re Judicial Inquiry No. 2005-02, </em>supra, 104 Conn. App. 408, citing <em>Connelly </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>213 Conn. 66, 70, 566 A.2d 426 (1989). This creature was bom of a single statute in 1941, which provided simply that \u201cthe superior court in any county\u201d had the authority to order an investigation \u201cto determine whether or not there is probable cause to believe that a crime or crimes have been committed within the county . . . .\u201d General Statutes (Cum. Sup. 1941) \u00a7 889f. Such an inquiry could be initiated whenever the court believed that the \u201cdue administration of justice\u201d so required. General Statutes (Cum. Sup. 1941) \u00a7 889f. The investigation was to be conducted \u201cbefore any judge of said court or a state referee\u201d and was to be \u201cpublic or private as said court shall order.\u201d General Statutes (Cum. Sup. 1941) \u00a7 889f. \u201cAt the conclusion of [the] inquiry the judge or referee conducting the same shall file with the court a report and the court shall direct whether, and to what extent, such report shall be made available to the public or interested parties; and any transcript of testimony taken at such inquiry shall likewise be filed with the court and it shall have the same powers with reference to it as it has with reference to the report . . . .\u201d General Statutes (Cum. Sup. 1941) \u00a7 889f. There was no mechanism provided in the statute for making a disclosure request, no standard that guided the court\u2019s discretion over such disclosure, and no provision for a hearing on such a request or for appellate review of the decision regarding disclosure of any documents pertaining to the inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Seeing a need to reform this process, the legislature, with significant input from the judicial branch and the chief state\u2019s attorney, substantially rewrote the statute in 1985, giving rise to the investigatory grand jury statutory scheme in its modem form. See generally Public Acts 1985, No. 85-611 (P.A. 85-611). Public Act 85-611 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>substantially altered the procedures governing the investigatory grand jury system in Connecticut. The new procedures interposed a panel of three Superior Court judges between the official seeking a grand jury investigation and the commencement of such an investigation. The party seeking to instigate a grand jury investigation was required by the new statute to make a detailed application to the panel \u201cwhenever such applicant has reasonable belief that the administration of justice requires an investigation to determine whether or not there is probable cause to believe that a crime or crimes have been committed.\u201d P.A. 85-611, \u00a7 2, codified at General Statutes \u00a7 54-47c (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">If the panel approved the application, it was to issue an order authorizing an investigation, at which point the chief court administrator would appoint the investigatory grand jury. P.A. 85-611, \u00a7 3, codified at General Statutes \u00a7 54-47d (a). Public Act 85-611 contained a detailed description of what had to be specified in the panel\u2019s order, including \u201cthe scope of the investigation\u201d and the panel\u2019s \u201creasons for finding that the administration of justice requires an investigation . . . .\u201d P.A. 85-611, \u00a7 3, codified as amended at General Statutes \u00a7 54-47d (b). The original order and a copy of the application were to be transmitted to the investigatory grand jury appointed by the chief court administrator. P.A. 85-611, \u00a7 3, codified at General Statutes \u00a7 54-47d (b). Otherwise, P.A. 85-611 provided that any application filed with the panel and any order authorizing an investigation <em>\u201cshall be </em>sealed.\u201d (Emphasis added.) P.A. 85-611, \u00a7 4, codified at General Statutes \u00a7 54-47e. Public Act 85-611 further provided that \u201c[a]ny investigation by the investigatory grand jury shall be conducted in private, provided the panel, by a majority vote, may disclose the fact that any matter has been referred for an investigation by a grand jury and may order the investigation or any portion thereof to be public when such disclosure or order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>is deemed by the panel to be in the public interest.\u201d P.A. 85-611, \u00a7 4, codified as amended at General Statutes \u00a7 54-47e. Finally, P.A. 85-611 mandated that, once the investigation was complete, \u201cthe investigatory grand jury conducting such investigation shall file its finding, and the stenographer shall file any record of the investigation, with the court of the [designated] judicial district .... Such finding shall state whether or not there is probable cause to believe that a crime or crimes have been committed. The finding and record of the investigation <em>shall be sealed, </em>provided the panel, by a majority vote, may disclose such finding and record when such disclosure is deemed by the panel to be in the public interest.\u201d (Emphasis added.) P.A. 85-611, \u00a7 6, codified as amended at General Statutes \u00a7 54-47g (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Public Act 85-611 contained no provision for requesting public disclosure of the finding, no hearing before the panel on the request for such disclosure and no avenue of appellate review of the panel\u2019s decision on the request for disclosure. The finding was to include only a statement as to \u201cwhether or not there is probable cause to believe that a crime or crimes have been committed,\u201d and the grand jury was not afforded any discretion to disclose the finding or any part of the record of the investigation to the public. P.A. 85-611, \u00a7 6. In this context, it is revealing that the legislature nonetheless felt compelled to include two distinct sealing directives in P.A. 85-611. At the outset, the order and application were to be sealed, and no provision for their disclosure was included, yet the provision subsequent to that sealing directive authorized the panel to \u201cdisclose the fact that any matter has been referred for an investigation by a grand jury . . . .\u201d P.A. 85-611, \u00a7 4. Public Act 85-611 also provided that, at the close of the investigation, the finding and record of the investigation were to be sealed, and the panel was given authority to disclose the finding and record of the investigation when it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>deemed to be in the public interest. P.A 85-611, \u00a7 6. The separate sealing directives make little sense if the record of the investigation includes the application and order, as it would be redundant to seal the same information twice. Moreover, in light of the legislature\u2019s demonstrated ability to provide a mechanism for disclosure, it is significant that no such mechanism was included for the application and order.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">The testimony of several key witnesses before the judiciary committee offers insight into the legislators\u2019 understanding of the meaning of the critical statutory terms and offers further support for the panel\u2019s proffered interpretation of the grand jury statutes. The testimony of Judge Aaron Ment, the chief court administrator in 1985, who was actively involved in drafting the proposed legislation, is particularly helpful. Representative Joseph D. Nardini asked Judge Ment whether it would improve the openness and accountability of the grand jury process to make the release of the \u201crecords\u201d mandatory whenever the \u201creport\u201d is publicly released. Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 3, 1985 Sess., p. 939. The following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-5\">\u201cJudge Ment: The report may be released independent and for other reasons than the records might be released. <em>When we talk about records we are talking about transcripts I assume^?]</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-6\">\u201c[Representative] Nardini: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-7\">\u201cJudge Ment: The bill now indicates that one and or both may be released within the discretion of the judge as limited by the guidelines. It would appear to me that in some instances the report could very well be made public, but the testimony of specific witnesses may not be.\u201d Id.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">C. Robert Satti, Sr., then the state\u2019s attorney for the judicial district of New London, also expressed an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>understanding that the proposed legislation divided the grand jury process into distinct phases: \u201cI am absolutely and definitely . . . opposed to [the] presumption of openness, in the initiation of a process and the conduct and the report.\u201d Id., p. 1038. Although Satti\u2019s terminology differs from the language eventually used in the statutes, it is apparent that he is objecting to the public disclosure of the order and application, or, in his words, the \u201cinitiation of a process,\u201d as well as the finding and record of the investigation or, in his words, the \u201creport\u201d and the \u201cconduct . . . .\u2019\u2019Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Satti was not the only individual who viewed the order and application as distinct from the record of the investigation. Indeed, Senator Richard B. Johnston proposed an amendment that would have provided far greater public disclosure, which ultimately was not adopted. Senator Johnston explained his proposal as follows: \u201cThe investigations under the investigatory grand jury proceedings would be public and all <em>applications, orders, reports and records </em>would all be public information unless a decision were made that it be closed for three delineated [reasons].\u201d (Emphasis added.) 28 S. Proc., Pt. 16, 1985 Sess., p. 5376. Clearly, if the term \u201crecord\u201d was intended to include the application and order, Senator Johnston\u2019s distinct enumeration of these various documents would have been unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">The legislature amended the grand jury statutes in 1987. See generally Public Acts 1987, No. 87-350 (P.A. 87-350). All of the changes relevant to this appeal are found in \u00a7 5 of P.A. 87-350. First, the legislature directed that the investigatory grand jury not only must file its finding with the court in the appropriate judicial district but also must \u201cfile a copy of its finding with the panel and with the Chief State\u2019s Attorney or a state\u2019s attorney if such Chief State\u2019s Attorney or state\u2019s attorney made application for the investigation.\u201d P.A. 87-350, \u00a7 5, codi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>fled at General Statutes \u00a7 54-47g (a). Public Act 87-350 then addressed the disposition of the record of the investigation: \u201cThe stenographer shall file any record of the investigation with the [designated] court . . . and the panel and the Chief State\u2019s Attorney or a state\u2019s attorney, if such Chief State\u2019s Attorney or state\u2019s attorney made application for the investigation, shall have access to such record upon request made to the clerk of the court without a hearing.\u201d P.A. 87-350, \u00a7 5, codified at General Statutes \u00a7 54-47g (a). This change was significant in that it granted the prosecuting authority access to the finding and record of the investigation, and removed any exercise of discretion by the panel with respect to the disclosure of these documents to the state officials who initiate the investigation. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>250 Conn. 188, 205, 736 A.2d 790 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">The legislative history of P.A. 87-350 adds more support for the interpretation that the panel urges in the present case. One of the primary goals of P.A. 87-350 was to increase the availability of and ease of access to the finding and record of the investigation for state\u2019s attorneys involved in the grand jury investigation. See id. Commenting on the effect of such a change before the judiciary committee, John J. Kelly, then the chief state\u2019s attorney, stated: \u201c[The amendment] would read . . . [that] the [c]hief [s]tate\u2019s [attorney or [s]tate\u2019s [attorney shall be provided within a reasonable time <em>the record of the testimony of all witnesses before the grand jury and the findings of the [g]rand [j]ury </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 3, 1987 Sess., pp. 944-45. Clearly, it was Kelly\u2019s understanding of the amendment that the state\u2019s attorneys, in gaining access to the record of the investigation, were gaining access to transcripts of testimony obtained as a result of the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">The remarks of Representative Jay B. Levin, who summarized the proposed legislation prior to its adop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>tion by the House of Representatives in 1987, make clear that the legislature understood that the legislation, in granting the state\u2019s attorneys access to the \u201crecord of the investigation,\u201d was referring to the transcripts and perhaps other evidence gathered by the grand jury dining the course of its investigation: \u201c[The proposed legislation] . . . makes clear what is presently unclear, that the [s]tate\u2019s [a]ttomey, if the [s]tate\u2019s [a]ttomey is the applicant for the grand jury investigation may receive copies of the transcripts and reports of that investigation.\u201d 30 H.R. Proc., Pt. 19, 1987 Sess., p. 6922.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Section 5 of P.A. 87-350 was substantively amended once again in 1988. See generally Public Acts 1988, No. 88-345 (P.A. 88-345). Public Act 88-345 provided an expanded right of access to interested individuals beyond those state officials directly involved in the investigation.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> See P.A. 88-345, \u00a7 1, codified at General Statutes \u00a7 54-47g (a) and (b). In P.A. 88-345, \u00a7 1, the legislature added much of what is now \u00a7 54-47g. In addition to adding the provisions making the grand jury\u2019s finding presumptively public, P.A. 88-345, \u00a7 1, also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>allowed the grand jury to include as much of the record in the finding as it deemed appropriate. See General Statutes \u00a7 54-47g (b). Public Act 88-345, \u00a7 1, also added the provision, which is particularly relevant in this case, that allows any person to file an application with the panel requesting disclosure of any part of the record not disclosed with the finding, and to file a petition with the Appellate Court for review of the panel\u2019s decision on such an application. See General Statutes \u00a7 54-47g (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">Speaking in opposition of the proposed 1988 amendment before the judiciary committee, Chief State\u2019s Attorney Kelly made the following remarks: \u201cRight now, findings and records are presumed to be private, are presumed to be secret.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">\u201cThis would make them presumptively public. Please note the language is the finding and record. That means the file report issued by the [g]rand [jury]. <em>The record has to mean, it can only [be] read [to mean] all of the transcripts of testimony and exhibits.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 5, 1988 Sess., p. 1380. Later in that same hearing, the following exchange took place between Kelly and Senator Howard T. Owens, Jr.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-6\">\u201c[Kelly]: . . . [T]he language is very clear. You speak of the \u2018finding and record of the grand jury\u2019. That can only be interpreted to be the final report issued by the grand [jury].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-7\">\u201c[Senator] Owens: And the transcripts]?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-8\">\u201c[Kelly]: And the transcripts of testimony and exhibits.\u201d Id., p. 1393.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">Thus, Senator Owens, a key supporter of the 1988 amendment, and Kelly, who testified in opposition of the increased transparency engendered by it, each expressed his common understanding of the term \u201crecord\u201d in \u00a7 54-47g (b) as referring only to transcripts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>and exhibits produced in the course of the investigation itself. During Judge Ment\u2019s testimony on the same day, Senator Owens once again revealed his understanding that the 1988 amendment, in allowing the grand jury to disclose the record, or portions thereof, as part of its finding, was referring to the disclosure of the transcripts: \u201c[A]s long as the transcripts are not provided as part of the statement that is issued or the report of the [g]rand [jury], there are ways that the [g]rand [jury] can obviously prepare [its] report ... so that the rights of . . . the informants . . . can be protected.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Id., pp. 1336-37. Senator Owens expressed a similar sentiment in addressing the Senate during a floor debate in support of the amendment: \u201cThe finding may include all or such part of the <em>record </em>as the investigative grand jury may determine so that [it] may want to include <em>transcripts </em>with it, [it] may want to include <em>exhibits </em>with it or not include any of that at all in the finding.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 31 S. Proc., Pt. 7, 1988 Sess., p. 2244. Again, the repeated juxtaposition of the term \u201crecord\u201d with the terms \u201ctranscripts\u201d and \u201cexhibits\u201d in this context strongly suggests a legislative understanding of the term \u201crecord\u201d that is narrower and more specific than that urged by the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Public Policy</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">From a public policy perspective, the debates of the legislature reveal an underlying tension between the need for secrecy in order for grand jury investigations to be effective and sensitive to the concerns and safety of witnesses, on the one hand, and the desire for openness and transparency of the grand jury as an institu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>tion, on the other.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> In our view, however, these public policy concerns actually <em>favor </em>a construction of the grand jury statutes that excludes the order and application from the term \u201crecord of the investigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">First, the sealing of the order and application ensures the protection and cooperation of witnesses who initiate complaints with the prosecuting authority only on the understanding or condition that they will not be involved in the investigation or be required to testify before a grand jury. Of course, the state\u2019s attorney who seeks to open a grand jury investigation on the basis of such a complaint likely would note the witness\u2019 identity and statement in the application; see General Statutes \u00a7 54-47c (b) and (c); and that information potentially could be made a part of the panel\u2019s order. See General Statutes \u00a7 54-47d (b). If the application and order are made public, the witness\u2019 safety could be placed in jeopardy. Satti, a former state\u2019s attorney, expressed this concern in testimony before the judiciary committee: \u201cWe are not trying to hide things, we are trying to do our job to carry out the prosecution of criminals. I think of the neighbor [who] wants to complain [about his] next door neighbor who is sexually assaulting his daughter, or [his] next door neighbor who is in fact using drugs and [whose] children are using drugs. But that neighbor never wants it known that he or she made that complaint because if [it were known] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>there would be cans and dead cats and broken windows and fires started and everything else. And those people have got to feel that they can . . . make a complaint and have that complaint somehow sounded out or at least have it used to start an investigation without feeling that they themselves might be subject to retribution. That is just a minor example.\u201d Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 3, 1985 Sess., p. 1038.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Indeed, even if the complaining witness would be willing to testify in response to the compulsion of a subpoena, he may be unwilling to approach law enforcement authorities with vital information if there is a possibility that his initiation of that contact could become public, thus subjecting him to potential retribution. The risk of retribution should such involvement become public would likely dissuade fearful witnesses from contacting authorities, thus hampering law enforcement efforts, particularly in those criminal contexts in which the use of the investigative grand jury is most critical, i.e., political corruption, public fraud and organized crime. See General Statutes \u00a7 54-47b (2). This danger is equally prevalent in a case in which the grand jury declares that <em>no </em>probable cause exists to believe that the individual under suspicion committed the crime or crimes alleged in the application. If the term \u201crecord\u201d is read to include the application and order, then the individual subject to investigation may gain access to the application pursuant to \u00a7 54-47g (b). There is little doubt that the application would reveal, directly or indirectly, the identify of the initial accuser or accusers, thus subjecting even the honest complainant to potential retribution, legal or otherwise, should the investigation fail to bear fruit. We are confident that the potential public disclosure of this information would dissuade many prospective witnesses from becoming involved in the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>On the other hand, construing the grand jury statutes in this manner in no way compromises the defendant\u2019s right to present a defense because a state\u2019s attorney has a duty, grounded in the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to due process, to disclose any exculpatory evidence that may be contained in the sealed order or application. See <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963) (\u201cthe suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process [when] the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution\u201d); accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>214 Conn. 122, 126, 571 A.2d 686 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">In the normal course, the state\u2019s attorney who prosecutes a criminal case resulting from a grand jury\u2019s finding of probable cause also will be in possession of the application and under a duty to divulge to the defendant any exculpatory information contained therein.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Moreover, General Statutes \u00a7 54-47f (f) provides: \u201cAny attorney appointed to assist in conducting the investigation shall disclose to the investigatory grand jury any exculpatory information or material in his possession, custody or control concerning any person who is a target of the investigation.\u201d In this way, any exculpatory information in the hands of the prosecuting authority would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>become part of the record and thus eligible for disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">In this somewhat unusual case, however, Connelly, the state\u2019s attorney who filed the application, will not be the prosecutor at the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial. We see no reason, however, why the state\u2019s constitutional duty to disclose exculpatory evidence to a criminal defendant upon request should be dependent on the identity of the prosecuting attorney. Indeed, federal precedent suggests otherwise. See <em>Giglio </em>v. <em>United States, </em>405 U.S. 150, 154-55, 92 S. Ct. 763, 31 L. Ed. 2d 104 (1972) (prosecuting attorney charged with knowledge of, and duty to disclose, exculpatory information known only to attorney who presented government\u2019s case to grand jury but who was not involved in criminal prosecution); see also <em>Kyles </em>v. <em>Whitley, </em>514 U.S. 419, 438, 115 S. Ct. 1555, 131 L. Ed. 2d 490 (1995) (knowledge of <em>Brady </em>materials imputed to prosecutor when only police investigators actually were aware of exculpatory information); cf. <em>Drake </em>v. <em>Portuondo, </em>553 F.3d 230, 240 (2d Cir. 2009). Indeed, Connelly clearly is under a constitutional obligation to turn over any <em>Brady </em>materials of which he has knowledge to the prosecuting state\u2019s attorney, who, in turn, must turn over such materials to the petitioner.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> See Practice Book \u00a7 40-11. Thus, the state\u2019s fear that, in the present case, the prosecuting attorney\u2019s \u201cability to state, with any certainty, that everything discoverable under <em>Brady </em>[has] been disclosed to the [petitioner] was compromised\u201d is misplaced. In fact, the state acknowledges in its brief that it was able to determine and to prove to the satisfaction of the trial court in the pending criminal case against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>petitioner that all of the factual information contained in the application had been disclosed to the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">To the extent that the public has an interest in the disclosure of what little relevant information might be contained <em>exclusively </em>in the application or order, we believe that that interest is outweighed by the policy of protecting witnesses who come forward to provide information leading to the initiation of a grand jury investigation. Although we recognize that the legislature has vested the grand jury and the panel with the discretion to disclose evidence gathered as a result of a grand jury investigation, our careful review of the grand jury statutes leads us to conclude that the legislature, by virtue of \u00a7 54-47e, intended to remove that discretion with respect to the application and order. In our view, the legislature struck this careful balance between disclosure and confidentiality in order to encourage individuals with knowledge of serious crimes to communicate such knowledge to law enforcement officials without fear that their participation might someday be publicly revealed. In the absence of an express statement by the legislature to the contrary, we decline to upset this delicate balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Finally, we do not believe that our decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>supra, 250 Conn. 188, a case in which this court closely considered the statutes at the heart of the present controversy, and which strongly informed the Appellate Court\u2019s decision; see <em>In re Judicial Inquiry No. 2005-02, </em>supra, 104 Conn. App. 410-12, 415; is apposite to our resolution of the issue in the present case. In <em>Rivera, </em>the defendant, Matthew Rivera, was subpoenaed to testify before an investigatory grand jury, and the state sought to introduce his testimony as evidence in a subsequent criminal trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>supra, 189. The trial court granted Rivera\u2019s motion to preclude the state from using his grand jury testimony against him in its case-in-chief at the criminal trial; id., 194, 197; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>and the state appealed. Id., 197. The trial court reasoned that, although the state was free to use Rivera\u2019s grand jury testimony for \u201cthe development of evidence from other sources\u201d; id., 195; the grand jury statutes prohibited such testimony from being used against him in the state\u2019s case-in-chief. Id., 194-97. On appeal, we determined that the trial court incorrectly concluded that the state could not use Rivera\u2019s grand jury testimony in its case-in-chief. See id., 198.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">We proceeded to analyze the grand jury statutes, noting that \u201cthe relevant statutory provisions do not explicitly address the question of whether the state may use the grand jury testimony of a witness in its case-in-chief in a subsequent criminal proceeding in which that witness is the defendant. Those statutory provisions, however, contain no express bar to such use of grand jury testimony by the state.\u201d Id., 199. We emphasized that \u201c\u00a7 54-47g (a) affords prosecutors \u2018access\u2019 to the grand jury record upon request and without a hearing.\u201d Id. We reasoned that it would be unwieldy, if not absurd, to allow the state access to a defendant\u2019s grand jury testimony for any other purpose but nevertheless require it to seek the court\u2019s permission to use it in its case-in-chief. Id., 200, 208.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">We also addressed Rivera\u2019s argument that, \u201cbecause the common law favored secrecy and confidentiality in grand jury proceedings, we necessarily must resolve any claim under our statutory scheme in favor of secrecy unless those statutory provisions explicitly have abrogated the requirement of secrecy.\u201d Id., 202. We noted the purposes behind the common-law tradition of grand jury secrecy, including securing the safety and willingness of witnesses to testify and minimizing the risk that a suspect about to be indicted would flee. Id. We further declared, however, that \u201c[t]he secrecy of grand jury proceedings . . . never has had as a goal the protection of grand jury witnesses who, without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>immunity, voluntarily incriminate themselves during their sworn testimony.\u201d Id., 203. Thus, <em>Rivera </em>was concerned with the use to which testimony obtained during the course of the investigation could be put by prosecutors to whom that testimony already had been disclosed. There simply was no consideration in <em>Rivera </em>of the issue with which we are faced in the present case. In light of this distinct factual and legal context, we conclude that <em>Rivera </em>is not particularly helpful and does not control our resolution of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">We conclude that the order and application are not a part of the record of the grand jury investigation and thusmustbe sealed pursuant to \u00a7 54-47e. The legislature did not vest the panel with discretion to make public disclosure of the order and application. We conclude, therefore, that the Appellate Court improperly ordered the panel to conduct a hearing on the request for disclosure of the application and order.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the matter is remanded to that court with direction to render judgment denying the relief requested in the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b272-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-47e provides in relevant part: \u201cAny order authorizing the investigation into the commission of a crime or crimes and any application filed with the panel pursuant to section 54-47c or subsection (c) of section 54-47d shall be sealed. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b272-6\"> The panel also asserts that, even if \u00a7 54-47g (a) is interpreted so as to provide the petitioner with appellate review, the express directive of \u00a7 54-47e that \u201c[a]ny order authorizing the investigation into the commission of a crime or crimes and any application\u201d related thereto \u201cshall be sealed\u201d renders the case nonjusticiable.

The remainder of the court\u2019s jurisdictional analysis focused on the interlocutory nature of the trial court\u2019s bail revocation order, and the apparent basis for its determination that it lacked jurisdiction under \u00a7 51-197f to consider the appeal was that the limited petition for review authorized by \u00a7 54-63g did not constitute an \u201cappeal\u201d to the Appellate Court. See id., 339-40. Thus, because this court\u2019s statement in <em>Ayala </em>that the Appellate Court\u2019s decision was not action that constituted a final judgment arguably was \u201cunnecessary to the resolution of [that] case\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Haight, </em>279 Conn. 546, 557, 903 A.2d 217 (2006); we could consider it to be dictum of limited precedential value.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b278-6\"> On the other hand, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>224 Conn. 711, 721, 621 A.2d 250 (1993), we concluded that this court lacked jurisdiction under \u00a7 51-197f to consider the defendant\u2019s motion for review of the Appellate Court\u2019s decision to strike an issue from his brief because that decision was not a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d of that court within the meaning of the statute. In <em>Ellis, </em>it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>clear that the Appellate Court had not conclusively resolved the merits of the defendant\u2019s appeal but, rather, had simply struck an issue from a party\u2019s brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b279-7\"> We recognize that some of the more expansive language in <em>Ayala, </em>when taken out of context, may leave the impression that the mere invocation of the term \u201cpetition for review\u201d automatically deprives this court of jurisdiction to review a decision of the Appellate Court. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Ayala, </em>supra, 222 Conn. 340 (\u201c[statutory permission to file a petition for review does not authorize the filing of a full-fledged appeal, either in the Appellate Court or in this court\u201d). We take this opportunity to clarify that it is not the terminology used to describe the mechanism by which a party may gain access to appellate review that determines this court\u2019s jurisdiction under \u00a7 51-197f but, rather, whether the issue is one that is properly characterized as an \u201cappeal\u201d that has been determined conclusively by the Appellate Court. It may be that, in most cases, a petition for review, particularly of an interlocutory order, may fail the test of \u00a7 51-197\u00cd. But it will not fail that test merely because the legislature uses the phrase \u201cpetition for review.\u201d Thus, although <em>Ayala, </em>does not provide a bright line rule apart from its own context, we do not suggest that the principle on which it was based is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>We further recognize that we stated in <em>Ayala </em>that, \u201c[w]ith respect to the petition for review authorized in [that] case by \u00a7 54-63g, as with regard to [General Statutes] \u00a7\u00a7 51-164x and 54-47g (a), the legislature has designated the Appellate Court, and not this court, as the appropriate forum for the disposition of such petitions.\u201d Id., 340.

Thus, the policy of judicial efficiency is not implicated in the present, case, as it is in the bail revocation context of <em>Ayala </em>or in other cases involving petitions for review of interlocutory orders. See, e.g., <em>Waterbury Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>230 Conn. 441, 450, 645 A.2d 978 (1994) (\u201c[o]ur concern for the efficient operation of the judicial system ... is the practical consideration behind the policy against piecemeal litigation inherent in the final judgment rule\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27, 30, 463 A.2d 566 (1983) (\u201cthe delays and disruptions attendant upon intermediate appeal, which the [final judgment] rule is designed to avoid, are especially inimical to the effective and fair administration of the criminal law\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Furthermore, because of the significant liberty interest implicated in the context of a bail revocation order, General Statutes \u00a7 54-63g expressly requires that \u201c[a]ny such petition [for review] shall have precedence over any other matter before [the] Appellate Court and any hearing shall be heard expeditiously with reasonable notice.\u201d This expedited review procedure is critical in light of the importance of the interest at stake. No such interest is present in the present case, and, accordingly, \u00a7 54-47g (a) contains no such expedited procedure for challenging orders of the grand jury panel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b284-8\"> We note that, at first blush, the specific term \u201crecord of the investigation,\u201d which is used in \u00a7\u00a7 54-47d, 54-47e and 54-47g, appears to be more limited and less inclusive than the more general term \u201crecord,\u201d on which the Appellate Court\u2019s analysis focused. See <em>In re Judicial Inquiry No. 2005-02, </em>supra, 104 Conn. App. 404-405 (defining term \u201crecord\u201d and concluding that \u201cthe term generally has an expansive meaning\u201d). As a matter of common sense, the phrase \u201crecord of the investigation\u201d seemingly connotes only such transcripts and other evidence gathered <em>as a result </em>o/the grand jury investigation, and thus would not include within its purview the order and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>application. Thus, we believe the Appellate Court\u2019s emphasis on the term \u201crecord\u201d is misplaced and of limited value in answering the question before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b285-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-47e provides: \u201cAny order authorizing the investigation into the commission of a crime or crimes and any application filed with the panel pursuant to section 54-47c or subsection (c) of section 54-47d shall be sealed.

Recognizing the purposes behind the common-law presumption regarding the confidentiality and secrecy of grand jury proceedings, the statute favors disclosure after the grand jury has completed its investigation.\u201d Although the evolution of the grand jury statutes does indicate that the general trend has favored more disclosure, this liberalization has not been implemented without limitations, primarily because of legitimate concerns regarding the potentially highly sensitive nature of grand jury proceedings.
