The commission also claims that the trial court improperly concluded that four of the requested records were exempt from disclosure pursuant to \u00a7 60.13 (a) of title 45 of the Code of Federal Regulations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because we conclude that \u00a7 19a-17b is inapplicable to commission proceedings, and, therefore, that 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 60.13 is also inapplicable, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">The final decision of the commission sets forth the following relevant facts and procedure. The complainant, Louis J. Russo, a former patient of Jacob Zamstein, a physician, requested in writing records pertaining to the plaintiffs decision not to renew Zamstein\u2019s clinical privileges. In response, the plaintiff produced minutes of four meetings of the clinical affairs subcommittee of the University of Connecticut Health Center board of directors, but declined to produce the remainder of the requested records, which the plaintiff claimed comprised the credentialing file created by the clinical affairs subcommittee and the credentials committee. The complainant then filed a complaint with the commission seeking disclosure of the records pursuant to the act. Following a hearing on the matter, the commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>sion concluded that the plaintiff is a public agency within the meaning of \u00a7 1-200 (1) (A); the requested records are public records within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 1-210 (a) and 1-212 (a);<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the clinical affairs subcommittee and the credentials committee are medical review committees within the meaning of \u00a7 19a-17b (a) (4); and the requested records concern peer review.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The commission also concluded, however, that \u00a7 19a-17b (d) is applicable only to \u201ccivil actions\u201d and not to proceedings before the commission seeking disclosure pursuant to the act. Therefore, the commission concluded that \u00a7 19a-17b (d) does not provide an exemption to mandatory disclosure pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 1-210 (a) and 1-212 (a). The commission also rejected the plaintiffs claim that four of the requested records\u2014 labeled IC-2006-098-20 through IC-2006-098-23 and IC-2006-098-33\u2014were exempt from disclosure pursuant to 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 60.13 (a). In rejecting the plaintiffs claim, the commission relied on the last sentence of 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 60.13 (a), which provides: \u201cNothing in this paragraph shall prevent the disclosure of information by a party which is authorized under applicable [s]tate law to make such disclosure.\u201d Reasoning that the act authorized the plaintiff to make the disclosure, the commission concluded that 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 60.13 (a) did not provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>an. exemption to the act.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Accordingly, the commission ordered the plaintiff to provide the complainant with copies of the requested records, with the exception of three records that the commission had determined were exempt from disclosure under \u00a7 1-210 (b) (10) because those records constituted requests for legal advice and responses thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">The plaintiff appealed from the decision of the commission to the trial court, which sustained the appeal, concluding that \u00a7 19a-17b (d) constituted an exemption to disclosure under the act. In its analysis, the trial court relied heavily on the public policy reasons underlying the peer review privilege,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> namely, \u201cto encourage frank, uninhibited discussion, debate and criticism by the peers of a health care provider\u201d during peer review proceedings, and, by encouraging that level of candor, to improve the quality of patient care. <em>Commissioner of Health Services </em>v. <em>Kadish, </em>17 Conn. App. 577, 582, 554 A.2d 1097 <em>(O\u2019Connell, J., </em>dissenting), cert. denied, 212 Conn. 806, 563 A.2d 1355 (1989). That purpose, according to the trial court, would be undermined by the disclosure of the records to the complainant. The court also focused on the provision in \u00a7 19a-17b (d) that peer review material \u201c \u2018shall not be subject to discovery,\u2019 \u201d and concluded that allowing discovery of such material in the context of the act would have a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>chilling effect on the peer review process. Finally, the court concluded that proceedings of the commission pursuant to the act constitute civil actions for purposes of \u00a7 19a-17b (d). The court based its conclusion on the fact that proceedings pursuant to the act are instituted by the filing of a complaint; the commission is authorized to conduct hearings and hear testimony; and the proceedings are governed by various \u201cprocedural formalities commonly associated with an action in court.\u201d The trial court also concluded that the four records determined by the commission to pertain to information from the national practitioner data bank (data bank) were exempt from disclosure. The trial court reasoned that the information from the data bank was provided solely for the purpose of peer review, and that disclosure to the complainant would violate the requirement of 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 60.13 (a) that entities that receive information from the data bank must \u201cuse it solely with respect to the purpose for which it was provided.\u201d Accordingly, the court rendered judgment sustaining the plaintiffs appeal. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">The plaintiff claims that \u00a7 19a-17b (d) provides a statutory exemption to mandatory disclosure under the act. The commission contends that \u00a7 19a-17b (d) is inapplicable to the act because proceedings pursuant to the act do not constitute civil actions within the meaning of \u00a7 19a-17b (d). We agree with the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Section 19a-17b (d) provides in relevant part: \u201cThe proceedings of a medical review committee conducting a peer review shall not be subject to discovery or introduction into evidence in any civil action for or against a health care provider arising out of the matters which are subject to evaluation and review by such committee, and no person who was in attendance at a meeting of such committee shall be permitted or required to testify in any such civil action as to the content of such proceedings . . . .\u201d In order to interpret this language to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>mean that the peer review privilege bars disclosure pursuant to the act, we would have to conclude that the legislature intended the phrase \u201cshall not be subject to discovery ... in any civil action,\u201d to include in its meaning \u201cshall not be subject to <em>disclosure </em>... in <em>any action before the commission.\" </em>This presents two closely related questions: whether the legislature, in enacting \u00a7 19a-17b (d), intended for the term \u201cdiscovery\u201d to include disclosure pursuant to the act, and intended for the phrase \u201cin any civil action\u201d to include actions before the commission. Both of these are questions of statutory construction and therefore are subject to plenary review. <em>Barton </em>v. <em>Bristol, </em>291 Conn. 84, 97, 967 A.2d 482 (2009). \u201cGeneral Statutes \u00a7 l-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 97-98. We interpret the words of the statute \u201caccording to their ordinary meaning unless their context dictates otherwise.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Mattioli, </em>210 Conn. 573, 576, 556 A.2d 584 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">We address each of these questions of statutory interpretation in turn, beginning with the question of whether \u201cdiscovery\u201d properly may be understood to include disclosure under the act, and taking our starting point, as \u00a7 1-2z directs, with the text of the statute. In enacting \u00a7 19a-17b (d), the legislature defined its scope in terms of rendering the proceedings of a medical review committee \u201cnot . . . subject to discovery or introduction into evidence . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The meaning of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>\u201cdiscovery\u201d must be understood as it is employed in the statute, as one of the <em>two </em>circumstances within a civil action in which the privilege comes into play\u2014in other words, \u201cdiscovery\u201d is best understood in conjunction with the concept of \u201cevidence.\u201d Reading these two terms together, the most reasonable understanding of their meaning is that \u201cdiscovery\u201d refers to the pretrial procedures by which parties attempt to gain access to information held by the opposing party,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and \u201cintroduction into evidence\u201d refers to the means by which the parties attempt to use the information that they have available to them at the time of trial. This understanding of discoveiy is consistent with its dictionary definition as including \u201c[t]he pre-trial devices that can be used by one party to obtain facts and information about the case from the other party in order to assist the party\u2019s preparation for trial.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990). In other words, discovery is a tool by which a party may <em>acquire </em>information, which the party then may <em>use </em>at trial if the information is admissible as evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">In contrast, the concept of \u201cdisclosure\u201d is related to \u201c[t]he overarching legislative policy of the [act]\u201d which favors \u201cthe open conduct of government and free public access to government records.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number><em>Commission, </em>228 Conn. 158, 166, 635 A.2d 783 (1993). We have recognized that \u201cthe act does not confer upon the public an absolute right to all government information.\u201d <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>181 Conn. 324, 328, 435 A.2d 353 (1980). Instead, the act represents \u201ca legislative intention to balance the public\u2019s right to know what its agencies are doing, with the governmental and private needs for confidentiality. . . . The general rule, under the act, however, is disclosure.\u201d Id., 328-29. The concrete form that disclosure takes is set forth in \u00a7 1-210 (a), which provides in relevant part: \u201cExcept as otherwise provided by any federal law or state statute, all records maintained or kept on file by any public agency, whether or not such records are required by any law or by any rule or regulation, shall be public records and every person shall have the right to (1) inspect such records promptly during regular office or business hours, (2) copy such records in accordance with subsection (g) of section 1-212, or (3) receive a copy of such records in accordance with section 1-212. . . .\u201d See also General Statutes \u00a7 1-211 (disclosure of computer-stored public records).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Certainly, disclosure under the act and discovery share an essential characteristic\u2014both are designed to obtain information that is in the possession of another and otherwise may be unavailable to the seeker. We have concluded, however, that the rules of discovery and the provisions of the act operate \u201cseparately and independently\u201d of each other. <em>Chief of Police </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>252 Conn. 377, 396, 746 A.2d 1264 (2000). In <em>Chief of Police, </em>we addressed the \u201cscope of General Statutes \u00a7 1-213 (b), which provides in relevant part: \u2018Nothing in the . . . [a]ct shall be deemed in any manner to: (1) . . . limit the rights of litigants, including parties to administrative proceedings, under the laws of discovery of this state . . . .\u2019\u201d Id., 379. In that case, the plaintiff, the chief of police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>of the Hartford police department, claimed that certain requested records were exempt from disclosure under the act because the same records were the subject of a discovery request in a pending federal action. Id., 380, 383. We rejected the plaintiffs argument, concluding that \u201ceach determination\u2014disclosure under the act, and disclosure under discovery rules\u2014is made solely by the body charged with that responsibility: the [commission] or the court applying the act; and the court applying its discovery rules.\u201d Id., 397. We expressly acknowledged that \u201cthe practical effect of our interpretation is that a member of the public might be able to secure under the act documents from an agency that he is suing or intends to sue that he might not be able to secure through discovery in the litigation.\u201d Id. We noted, however, that \u201cthe act and judicial discovery rules are designed with different aims and limitations in mind.\u201d Id. For that reason, \u201c[t]he fact that a member of the public might also be an adversary of the agency . . . does not by itself strip him of his rights under the act.\u201d Id. Our decision in <em>Chief of Police </em>supports our initial reading of the term \u201cdiscovery\u201d in \u00a7 19a-17b (d) as being confined to discovery in a court action in a civil matter. Our conclusion in <em>Chief of Police </em>that the rules of discovery and the provisions of the act operate separately and independently is irreconcilable with the notion that the term \u201cdiscovery\u201d in \u00a7 19a-17b (d) may be interpreted to include disclosure pursuant to the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Moreover, the phrase \u201ccivil action\u201d in \u00a7 19a-17b (d) must be understood in relation to the other terms in the statute. Our conclusion that \u201cdiscovery\u201d as used in \u00a7 19a-17b (d) refers solely to discovery in the context of a court action in a civil matter makes it unlikely that the phrase \u201ccivil action\u201d reasonably may be interpreted to include proceedings before the commission. Also, just as our understanding of \u201cdiscovery\u201d is informed by the use of that term in conjunction with the phrase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>\u201cintroduction into evidence\u201d in \u00a7 19a-17b (d), so is our understanding of the phrase \u201ccivil action.\u201d That is, \u00a7 19a-17b (d) defines the scope of the privilege as exempting peer review proceedings from being \u201csubject to discovery or introduction into evidence in any civil action . . . As we already have noted, the use of the terms \u201cdiscovery\u201d and \u201cintroduction into evidence,\u201d together with the term \u201ccivil action\u201d signify that the legislature intended that the privilege apply within the context of a court action in a civil matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">This interpretation is supported both by our case law interpreting the statutory definition of civil action in title 52 of the General Statutes, and by the statutory language employed by the legislature in defining the scope of other privileges to extend both to civil actions and proceedings before administrative agencies. Although there is no definition of \u201ccivil action\u201d in \u00a7 19a-17b, it is defined in title 52 of the General Statutes, which governs civil actions. Specifically, General Statutes \u00a7 52-91 provides in relevant part that \u201c[t]here shall be one form of civil action. The first pleading on the part of the plaintiff shall be known as the complaint and shall contain a statement of the facts constituting the cause of action and, on a separate page of the complaint, a demand for the relief, which shall be a statement of the remedy or remedies sought.\u201d Additionally, General Statutes \u00a7 52-45a sets forth the procedures governing the commencement of a civil action: \u201cCivil actions shall be commenced by legal process consisting of a writ of summons or attachment, describing the parties, the court to which it is returnable, the return day, the date and place for the filing of an appearance and information required by the Office of the Chief Court Administrator. The writ shall be accompanied by the plaintiffs complaint. The writ may run into any judicial district and shall be signed by a commissioner of the Superior Court or a judge or clerk of the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>to which it is returnable.\u201d In applying \u00a7\u00a7 52-91 and 52-45a to determine whether a statutory proceeding constitutes a civil action, we have considered whether the action was commenced by the filing of a complaint, as well as whether it was commenced by service of process or controlled by rules of pleading. <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Tavares Pediatric Center, </em>276 Conn. 544, 558, 888 A.2d 65 (2006) (Rhode Island administrative proceeding not civil action); see also <em>Waterbury </em>v. <em>Waterbury Police Union, </em>176 Conn. 401, 407-408, 407 A.2d 1013 (1979) (statutory proceeding to confirm, modify or vacate arbitration award not civil action because not initiated by filing complaint); <em>Chieppo </em>v. <em>Robert E. McMichael, Inc., </em>169 Conn. 646, 652, 363 A.2d 1085 (1975) (appeal from finding and award of workers\u2019 compensation commissioner not civil action); <em>Slattery </em>v. <em>Woodin, </em>90 Conn. 48, 50, 96 A. 178 (1915) (appeals from probate not civil actions).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">Moreover, we have never concluded that a proceeding before an administrative agency necessarily is a civil action. Although the question of whether such a proceeding could under <em>no </em>circumstances constitute a civil action is not before us today\u2014and we expressly do not decide that issue\u2014we note that administrative appeals, which are heard in the first instance in the Superior Court, are deemed to be civil actions only under <em>some </em>circumstances. See Practice Book \u00a7 14-6 (administrative appeals civil actions for purposes of rules of practice, but not for purposes of certain enumerated statutes);<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> see also <em>Commissioner of Health </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number><em>Services </em>v. <em>Kadish, </em>supra, 17 Conn. App. 580-81 (investigation by commissioner of health services was purely administrative investigatory proceeding, not proceeding in court, and thus not civil action for purposes of \u00a7 19a-17b [then codified at General Statutes \u00a7 38-19a]). Certainly, then, the underlying proceeding before an administrative agency\u2014rather than a court\u2014may be deemed a civil action only if the evidence of such legislative intent is strong. That evidence is lacking in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Proceedings pursuant to the act are not commenced by service of process, but by filing a notice of appeal pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 1-206 (b) (1), which provides in relevant part that \u201c[a]ny person denied the right to inspect or copy records under [\u00a7] 1-210 . . . may appeal therefrom to the Freedom of Information Commission, by filing a notice of appeal with said commission. . . .\u201d Although appeals to the commission often are referred to as complaints, the regulations adopted by the commission define \u201c \u2018[c]omplainf \u201d as \u201can appeal to the commission under [\u00a7 1-206] of the general statutes.\u201d Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 1-21j-1 (b) (4). The commission, upon receipt of the notice of appeal, then \u201cshall serve upon all parties, by certified or registered mail, a copy of such notice together with any other notice or order of such commission.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 1-206 (b) (1). Moreover, actions before the commission are not governed by the rules of pleading. Certainly, proceedings before the commission are governed by formal rules of procedure. See Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 1-21J-1 et seq. Procedural formality alone, however, does not convert an administrative proceeding conducted by an agency of the executive branch into a civil action conducted in a court of law. Any superficial similarities between the procedural rules governing proceedings before the commission and court actions in a civil case cannot overcome the obvious difference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>that the two proceedings take place within two distinct and separate branches of government.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">Reference to other privilege statutes confirms that the legislature did not intend to use the phrase \u201ccivil action\u201d to include proceedings before the commission. Virtually all of the privilege statutes list civil actions and administrative proceedings as separate contexts in which the privilege applies. An illustrative example appears in the very same chapter as \u00a7 19a-17b. General Statutes \u00a7 19a-25 provides that the information procured by the department of public health \u201cfor the purpose of reducing the morbidity or mortality from any cause or condition, shall be confidential and shall be used solely for the purposes of medical or scientific research . . . .\u201d Section 19a-25 specifies that \u201c[s]uch information . . . shall not be admissible as evidence in <em>any action of any kind </em>in any court or <em>before any other </em>tribunal, board, <em>agency </em>or person, nor shall it be exhibited or its contents disclosed in any way, in whole or in part, by any officer or representative of the [department of [p]ublic [h]eaith or of any such facility, by any person participating in such a research project or by any other person, except as may be necessary for the purpose of furthering the research project to which it relates.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The legislature evinced a clear intent in \u00a7 19a-25 that the information at issue is not to be disclosed \u201cin any action of any kind,\u201d and specifies actions in court and before agencies as separate contexts in which the privilege applies. See also General Statutes \u00a7 52-146b (communications made to clergymen not disclosable absent waiver \u201cin any civil or criminal case or proceedings preliminary thereto, or in any legislative or administrative proceeding\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 52-146c (b) (communications between psychologist and patient privileged absent waiver \u201cin civil and criminal actions, in juvenile, probate, commitment and arbitration proceedings, in proceedings pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>liminary to such actions or proceedings, and in legislative and administrative proceedings\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 52-146k (b) (confidential communications between battered women\u2019s counselor or sexual assault counselor and victim not disclosable absent waiver \u201cin any civil or criminal case or proceeding or in any legislative or administrative proceeding\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 52-146n(b) (communications between judicial branch employee and employee assistance program counselor not disclosable absent waiver \u201cin any civil or criminal case or proceeding or in any legislative or administrative proceeding\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 52-146o (a) (physician or surgeon may not disclose patient communications or information obtained by personal examination of patient, absent consent, \u201cin any civil action or any proceeding preliminary thereto or in any probate, legislative or administrative proceeding\u201d). It is difficult to reconcile the legislature\u2019s practice, in the case of all of these privileges, of specifying separately that the privilege extends both in the context of civil actions and administrative proceedings, with the proposition that \u201ccivil action\u201d as used in \u00a7 19a-17b encompasses both court actions and proceedings before the commission.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">When the legislature has not enumerated the specific contexts in which a privilege applies, it has in other ways defined the scope of the privilege to preclude disclosure under the act. For example, the legislature has extended certain privileges both to civil actions and to administrative proceedings by defining the privilege in very broad terms stating that the subject information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>is \u201cconfidential\u201d generally. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 51-51l (governing investigations by judicial review council of judge, compensation commissioner or family support magistrate, and providing that \u201c[a]ny investigation to determine whether or not there is probable cause that conduct under [General Statutes \u00a7] 51-51i has occurred shall be confidential and any individual called by the council for the purpose of providing information shall not disclose his knowledge of such investigation to a third party prior to the decision of the council on whether probable cause exists, unless the respondent requests that such investigation and disclosure be open\u201d). Such a blanket statement of confidentiality covers any and all venues. Yet another approach the legislature has taken in other contexts is to incorporate a privilege expressly in the act, such as the attorney-client privilege. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 1-210 (b) (\u201cnothing in the [act] shall be construed to require disclosure of . . . [10] . . . communications privileged by the attorney-client relationship\u201d). The legislature could have, but did not, similarly broadened the scope of the peer review privilege by expanding its applicability beyond the context of civil actions, either by providing a blanket protection of general confidentiality, or by expressly incorporating the privilege into the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">We conclude, on the basis of the foregoing, that the term \u201ccivil action\u201d as used in \u00a7 19a-17b (d) plainly and unambiguously does not include proceedings before the commission. See General Statutes \u00a7 1-2z. Section 19a-17b (d) prevents the proceedings of a medical review committee engaged in the process of peer review from being subject to discovery or introduction into evidence in a civil action, but does not bar the disclosure of such information pursuant to the act. Therefore, because it is undisputed that the plaintiff is a public agency subject to the mandatory disclosure requirement of the act; see General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 1-210 (a) and 1-212 (a); and that the requested records are public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>records under the act, the commission properly ordered disclosure of the requested records, with the exception of those that fell under an applicable exemption.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">We do not reach this conclusion lightly. We, like the dissent, are mindful of the significant public policy purpose underlying the peer review privilege, namely, to promote public health and safety by encouraging \u201ccommittee members to take positions that they might not otherwise take if they thought they were going to be subpoenaed in the middle of a malpractice case.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Babcock </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Hospital, </em>251 Conn. 790, 825, 742 A.2d 322 (1999). The privilege is grounded on the belief that \u201cphysicians . . . would not feel free to openly discuss the performance of other doctors practicing in the hospital, without assurance that their discussions in committee would be confidential and privileged . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Thus, preventing a malpractice litigant from acquiring, in a civil action, peer review records through discovery and use of those records by introducing them into evidence furthers this purpose by protecting participants in the peer review process from being hauled into court to testify regarding the peer review records or proceedings.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>We recognize the possibility that the purpose of the peer review privilege may be undermined by allowing disclosure under the act of peer review proceedings. As the plaintiff contends, the cat, so to speak, is \u201cout of the bag\u201d once disclosure is permitted. <em>Commissioner of Health Services </em>v. <em>Kadish, </em>supra, 17 Conn. App. 585 (O\u2019Connell, J., dissenting). It is therefore possible that disclosure under the act may have the same chilling effect that the legislature sought to avoid by enacting \u00a7 19a-17b. That possibility, however, cannot convert \u201cdiscovery\u201d to \u201cdisclosure\u201d; nor can it make the administrative proceeding at issue in the present case a civil action. Indeed, extending the definition of the term \u201ccivil action\u201d to include proceedings before the commission would, in our opinion, be a greater evil than interpreting the law as written even though we acknowledge that the public policy of \u00a7 19a-17b is not being served. We do not believe that in interpreting the law, we have authority to rewrite it. It is possible that, in drafting \u00a7 19a-17b, the legislature did not foresee that certain peer review proceedings might become the subject of a freedom of information request because the vast majority of hospitals are not public agencies and are not, therefore, subject to the provisions of the act. We emphasize, however, that records that are subject to disclosure under the act are not subject to discovery or introduction into evidence in a civil action for or against a health care provider, if those records constitute peer review material and not \u201cdocuments that were independently \u2018recorded\u2019 or \u2018acquired.\u2019 \u201d <em>Babcock </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Hospital, </em>supra, 251 Conn. 822. Thus, although a malpractice litigant may succeed under the act in obtaining disclosure of records that are exempt from discovery, the privilege nevertheless prevents the use of such records in a civil action. Furthermore, pursuant to \u00a7 19a-17b (d), \u201cno person who was in attendance at a meeting of such committee shall be permitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>or required to testify in any such civil action as to the content of such proceedings . . . .\u2019\u2019In any case, the task of changing the law lies with the legislature, and not with the judiciary. \u201cIn construing a statute, the cardinal principle of construction is to ascertain the intent of the legislature. If an act passed by the legislature is within its constitutional power, it is not the business of the court to attempt to twist the interpretation of the law to conform to the ideas of the judges as to what the law ought to be or to attempt to make the law coincide with their ideas of social justice. The judicial function should not invade the province of the legislature.\u201d <em>Tileston </em>v. <em>Ullman, </em>129 Conn. 84, 97, 26 A.2d 582 (1942) <em>(Avery, J., </em>dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to dismiss the plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">In this opinion PALMER, VERTEFEUILLE and ZARELLA, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b187-8\"> At various points in the proceedings underlying this appeal, both the director of health affairs policy planning and the University of Connecticut Health Center were identified as the plaintiff.

In my view, however, the meaning of those terms is ambiguous, and when the clear purpose of the peer review statute is considered, I conclude that the legislature intended \u00a7 19a-17b (d) also to preclude the disclosure of peer review proceedings in an action before the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">\u201cWhen construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. ... In seeking to determine that meaning, General Statutes \u00a7 1-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered. . . . The test to determine ambiguity is whether the statute, when read in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>context, is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hees </em>v. <em>Burke Construction, Inc., </em>290 Conn. 1, 10, 961 A.2d 373 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">It is well settled that, \u201c[i]n the construction of the statutes, words and phrases shall be construed according to the commonly approved usage of the language . . . .

With respect to the term \u201cdiscovery,\u201d the majority concludes that, when read in conjunction with the statute\u2019s prohibition on \u201cintroduction into evidence,\u201d that term was intended to refer to its dictionary definition, under the heading \u201c[t]riai practice,\u201d as \u201c[t]he pre-trial devices that can be used by one party to obtain facts and information about the case from the other party in order to assist the party\u2019s preparation for trial.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990). A subsequent edition of that same dictionary, however, also defines the term \u201cdiscovery\u201d as, in relevant part, \u201c[t]he act or process of finding or learning something that was previously unknown\u201d; Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (7th Ed. 1999); a definition that is virtually identical to that for the term \u201cdisclosure\u201d which, as the majority notes, typically is associated with proceedings under the act. See id. (defining \u201cdisclosure\u201d as, in relevant part, \u201c[t]he act or process of making known something that was previously unknown\u201d). In my view, each of these readings of the term \u201cdiscovery\u201d is perfectly reasonable in the context of \u00a7 19a-17b and, accordingly, I conclude that the legislature\u2019s use of that term is, at the very least, ambiguous.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See, <em>e.g., Hees v.Burke Construction, Inc., </em>supra, 290 Conn. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>The meaning of \u201ccivil action\u201d similarly is unclear based on the language of \u00a7 19a-17b, which does not define that term for the purposes of disclosure of peer review proceedings. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (7th Ed. 1999), however, defines the term broadly as \u201c[a]n action brought to enforce, redress, or protect a private or civil right; a noncriminal litigation.\u201d That definition does not specify that the action must be a court proceeding in order to be classified as a civil action, and there is no clear indication, either in the statutes or in our case law, that that is the case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, I conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>an interpretation of the term \u201ccivil action\u201d that includes an action brought before the commission by a private individual seeking to enforce his or her right to public information under the act falls squarely within the common dictionary definition of the term, and is a reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>able reading of the statutory language. In light of the majority\u2019s equally reasonable reading of the statute, I conclude that the term \u201ccivil action,\u201d as used in the context of \u00a7 19a-17b, also is ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">When the statutory language is ambiguous, \u201cwe look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Fredette </em>v. <em>Connecticut Air National Guard, </em>283 Conn. 813, 821-22, 930 A.2d 666 (2007).

Thus, we are bound to construe the statute in a manner that will reflect and achieve the purpose for which it was enacted; see <em>McGaffin </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>193 Conn. 393, 407, 479 A.2d 176 (1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1050, 105 S.

Peer review proceedings \u201care essential to the continued improvement in the care and treatment of patients. Candid and conscientious evaluation of clinical practices is a sine qua non of adequate health care.\u201d <em>Bredice </em>v. <em>Doctors Hospital, Inc., </em>50 F.R.D. 249, 250, (D.D.C. 1970), aff'd, 479 F.2d 920 (D.C. Cir. 1973). \u201cThe purpose of [peer review] is the improvement, through self-analysis, of the efficiency of medical procedures and techniques.\u201d Id. To that end, health care facilities throughout the United States have, in some form or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>another, created peer review mechanisms \u201cwith projected goals of, inter alia, continuing professional education, evaluation of the quality of patient care, renewal of privileges, complaint investigation and malpractice review.\u201d <em>Commissioner of Health Services </em>v. <em>Kadish, </em>17 Conn. App. 577, 582, 554 A.2d 1097 <em>(O\u2019Connell, J., </em>dissenting), cert. denied, 212 Conn. 806, 563 A.2d 1355 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Courts and scholars consistently have recognized, however, that the efficacy of peer review is threatened by a reluctance on the part of many physicians and other health care providers to participate in that process. This reluctance generally stems from a number of factors, including \u201cfear of exposure to liability, entanglement in malpractice litigation, [and] loss of referrals from other doctors . . . .\u201d C.

Although these statutes differ with regard to the scope of the privilege and the materials protected by it, with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>out exception they are founded on the strong public policy in favor of peer review proceedings, and are intended primarily to encourage and facilitate participation in such proceedings. The principal means of achieving that goal consist of immunizing participants from civil liability and precluding the materials used and the statements made in such proceedings from being introduced into evidence in a subsequent action for damages; see G. Gosfield, comment, \u201cMedical Peer Review Protection in the Health Care Industry,\u201d 52 Temp. L.Q. 552, 553 (1979); and also by maintaining the confidentiality of such proceedings by prohibiting disclosure to the public.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Morse </em>v. <em>Gerity, </em>520 F. Sup. 470, 472 (D. Conn. 1981) (\u201c[I]f the purpose of the statute is to encourage doctors to evaluate their peers without fear of disclosure, that purpose would be hampered by public release of any proceedings, not just those involving the patient who has sued. The danger of inhibiting candid professional peer review exists by the mere potential for disclosure. . . . The overriding importance of these review committees to the medical profession and the public requires that doctors have unfettered freedom to evaluate their peers in an atmosphere of complete confidentiality. No chilling effect can be tolerated if the committees are to function effectively.\u201d); <em>Cruger </em>v. <em>Love, </em>599 So. 2d 111, 114\u201415 (Fla. 1992) (\u201c[t]he privilege afforded to peer review committees is intended to prohibit the chilling effect of the potential public disclosure of statements made to or information prepared for and used by the [medical review] committee in carrying out its peer review function\u201d); <em>HCA Health Services of Virginia, Inc. </em>v. <em>Levin, </em>260 Va. 215, 221, 530 S.E.2d 417 (2000) (\u201cThe obvious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>legislative intent is to promote open and frank discussion during the peer review process among health care providers in furtherance of the overall goal of improvement of the health care system.

See id., 825 (\u201c[o]nly where . . . peer review committees . . . are assured of confidentiality [will they] feel free to enter into uninhibited discussions of their peers\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>Pisel </em>v. <em>Stamford Hospital, </em>180 Conn. 314, 326, 430 A.2d 1 (1980) (\u201c[t]he purpose of [\u00a7 19a-17b] is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>keep peer review studies, discussions and deliberations confidential\u201d); <em>Commissioner of Health Services </em>v. <em>Kadish, </em>supra, 17 Conn.

First, to the extent that \u00a7 19a-17b is intended to prevent litigants in a court action from obtaining peer review materials to assist in their preparation for trial\u2014 which I agree with the majority that, in large part, it is\u2014 the majority\u2019s interpretation of the statutory language effectively reads that protection out of the statute with respect to all public health care facilities throughout the state.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Specifically, although the prohibition remains on obtaining such materials through the formal discovery process, hereafter a litigant will be able to circumvent that safeguard simply by filing a request under the act for the exact same information, thereby eviscerating any protection that the discovery prohibition was intended to provide. It would be illogical and meaningless for the legislature to have enacted the discovery provision at all if it intended for a litigant against a public hospital to be able to obtain the same privileged information through disclosure under the act.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>bound to avoid an interpretation of the statutory language that leads to such an unworkable result. See <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>New Haven, 275 </em>Conn. 580, 616, 881 A.2d 978 (2005) (\u201cIt is axiomatic that we construe a statute in a manner that will not thwart its intended purpose or lead to absurd results. . . . We must avoid a construction that fails to attain a rational and sensible result that bears directly on the purpose the legislature sought to achieve.\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">From a practical standpoint, moreover, having obtained such materials pursuant to the act, a litigant will be able to use what was said and done during the peer review proceedings to determine what questions to ask, and of whom to ask them, during the formal discovery process in order to discover evidence that <em>would be </em>admissible at trial, thereby essentially providing litigants with the blueprint for an effective trial strategy. See <em>Yuma Regional Medical Center </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>supra, 175 Ariz. 76 (\u201cInherent in [the] plaintiffs\u2019 ability to obtain information from another source is the knowledge on [the] plaintiffs\u2019 part that such information exists. . . . Herein lies the real benefit to [the] plaintiffs of [obtaining peer review materials that are not themselves admissible in evidence]: it informs [the] plaintiffs what the peer review participants consider to be relevant information to [the] plaintiffs\u2019 case\u2014 information of which [the] plaintiffs might be unaware.\u201d). As a consequence, public health care providers will be reluctant to participate in the peer review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>process in the knowledge that what they say and do during such proceedings may, albeit indirectly, be used in an ongoing or subsequent malpractice action against themselves or one of their peers. This is precisely the result that the legislature sought to avoid when it enacted \u00a7 19a-17b.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">Second, as a result of the majority\u2019s conclusions in this case, all peer review proceedings in public health care institutions potentially will be subject to disclosure beyond the litigation context. The ensuing public scrutiny of the comments made and documents submitted in such proceedings undeniably will have a chilling effect on peer review and will discourage health care providers\u2014who risk their relationships with their peers, their reputation within the profession and the continued success of their practice through referrals\u2014 from participating in the process. Such a result defeats the clear purpose for which \u00a7 19a-17b was enacted, and we are bound to avoid such an interpretation. See <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 275 Conn. 616.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Accordingly, I conclude that the only permissible interpretation of the ambiguous language of \u00a7 19a-17b is that the legislature intended the language \u201cshall not be subject to discovery ... in any civil action\u201d to include an action before the commission seeking disclosure of medical peer review information under the act. Because I would affirm the judgment of the trial court to that effect, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b206-6\"> In concluding that the term \u201cdiscovery\u201d refers only to the pretrial process of obtaining information for subsequent use at trial, the majority states: \u201cThe meaning of \u2018discovery\u2019 must be understood as it is employed in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>statute, as one of the <em>two </em>circumstances within a civil action in which the privilege comes into play\u2014in other words, \u2018discovery\u2019 is best understood in conjunction with the concept of \u2018evidence.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis in original.) In my view, however, it does not follow from the fact that the legislature deemed peer review proceedings to be inadmissible evidence, that it intended the term \u201cdiscovery\u201d to apply only in the limited evidentiary sense of the term. If the legislature\u2019s intent in enacting \u00a7 19a-17b simply was to prevent peer review proceedings from being introduced into evidence at trial, then its use of the term \u201cdiscovery,\u201d understood exclusively as a pretrial device designed to achieve that ultimate goal, essentially would be redundant because such concerns likely would be adequately addressed by the statute\u2019s explicit prohibition on \u201cintroduction into evidence . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 19a-17b (d). Thus, it is reasonable to interpret the legislature\u2019s use of the term \u201cdiscovery\u201d as an indication that it had more than mere evidentiary concerns in mind, and that it intended more broadly to prevent the release, or \u201cdisclosure,\u201d of such information regardless of whether it was sought for a specific evidentiary purpose. Put differently, the legislature\u2019s inclusion of the term \u201cdiscovery,\u201d <em>in addition to </em>the prohibition on \u201cintroduction into evidence, \u201d indicates that a third party\u2019s mere knowledge of such information was something that the legislature sought to avoid, a view that accords with the disclosure oriented definition of the word \u201cdiscovery.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b207-5\"> I acknowledge that the rules governing the commencement of a civil action are set forth in part, elsewhere in the statutes; see General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-45a and 52-91; and that our cases have, as a factor in determining whether an administrative proceeding properly may be classified as a civil action, examined the procedure for commencing that proceeding to determine whether it is sufficiently similar to the requirements set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 52-45a and 52-91. See, e.g., <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Tavares Pediatric Center, </em>276 Conn. 544, 557-58, 888 A.2d 65 (2006); <em>Waterbury </em>v. <em>Waterbury Police Union, </em>176 Conn. 401, 407, 407 A.2d 1013 (1979); <em>Chieppo </em>v. <em>Robert E. McMichael, Inc., </em>169 Conn. 646, 652, 363 A.2d 1085 (1975). As the majority notes, however, the process for filing an appeal before the commission <em>is </em>strikingly similar, although not identical, to the requirements set forth in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 52-45a and 52-91. Compare, e.g., Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 1-21J-23 (requiring complaint and other documents submitted to commission to be signed), Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 1-21j-26 (requiring complaint and other documents to be served in same manner as permitted by Superior Court), and Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 1-21j-28 (commencement of action occurs upon filing of complaint with commission, which must include complainant\u2019s name, address, and telephone and fax numbers and concise statement of relevant facts, including nature of relief sought), with General Statutes \u00a7 52-45a (commencement of civil action requires writ of summons describing parties, return date and place and date for filing appearance, accompanied by complaint), and General Statutes \u00a7 52-91 (requiring first pleading in civil action to be \u201ccomplaint . . . contain[ing] a statement of the facts constituting the cause of action and ... a demand for the relief, which shall be a statement of the remedy . . . sought\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">Moreover, our prior cases have not categorically stated that such similarity is the <em>only </em>relevant factor in classifying an administrative proceeding as a civil action. To the contrary, we have recognized on several occasions that the purpose for which a statute containing a term such as \u201ccivil action\u201d was enacted is an important factor in determining whether a proceeding falls with the scope of that term as it is used in the specific context of that particular statute. See <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Costle, </em>179 Conn. 415, 423, 426 A.2d 1324 (1980) (\u201cthe scope of proceedings which will be included within a term, whose precise reach is uncertain, depends upon the nature and purpose of the particular statute in question\u201d); <em>Chieppo </em>v. <em>Robert E. McMichael, Inc., </em>supra, 169 Conn. 653-54 (examining purpose of statute as factor in determining whether legislature intended administrative proceeding to constitute civil action); <em>Carbone </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>126 Conn. 602, 605, 13 A.2d 462 (1940) (\u201cthe scope of proceedings which will be included within the term as used in the statutes depends upon the nature and purpose of the particular statute in question\u201d); <em>Fishman </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>4 Conn. App. 339, 344, 494 A.2d 606 (\u201c[w]hat the legislature may have intended to be a civil action for some purposes may not be a civil action for others\u201d), certs. denied, 197 Conn. 806, 807, 499 A.2d 57 (1985). Our prior case law, therefore, does not foreclose the possibility that the legislature intended an action before the commission to be considered a civil action in the specific context of protecting peer review proceedings from disclosure under \u00a7 19a-17b, and it is appropriate for us to examine the purpose behind \u00a7 19a-17b in order to determine if the legislature did so intend. See, e.g., <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Costle, </em>supra, 423-24.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b210-7\"> Indeed, \u201c[a] physician\u2019s qualifications, competence, and ethics all are called into question when a medical staff committee is requested to review his application for staff privileges, to determine the extent of his clinical privileges, or to assess the quality of his work.
