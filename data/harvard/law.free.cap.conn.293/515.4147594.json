(Adco), and Barbur Associates, LLC (Barbur),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in which the plaintiff, a former employee of Adco and a member and 50 percent interest holder in Barbur, sought to recover unpaid wages and double damages from Adco under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-71 c<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and 31-72,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and a judicial dissolution and winding up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>of Barbur pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 34-207<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and 34-208.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The trial court found in favor of the plaintiff on his unpaid wages claim, awarded the plaintiff double damages pursuant to \u00a7 31-72 and ordered a dissolution and winding up of Barbur pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 34-207 and 34-208. On appeal, the defendants claim that the trial court improperly (1) invoked \u00a7 31-72 in awarding wages to the plaintiff because the plaintiff was not an \u201cemployee\u201d of Adco within the meaning of \u00a7 31-72, (2) calculated the amount of wages awarded to the plaintiff for 2004 by failing to prorate the plaintiffs salary on the basis of the number of months that he had worked in that year, (3) awarded double damages to the plaintiff pursuant to \u00a7 31-72, and (4) ordered the dissolution of Barbur. The plaintiff responds that the trial court properly (1) found that the plaintiff was an employee of Adco and that the defendants\u2019 argument to the contrary stems from their misinterpretation of \u00a7 31-72, (2) calculated the wages awarded to the plaintiff on the basis of the evidence adduced at trial, (3) awarded double <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>damages on the basis of its findings of fact, and (4) ordered the dissolution of Barbur because it was not reasonably practicable for the parties to carry on the business together. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">The trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision and the record reveal the following relevant facts and procedural history. The plaintiff and Firtel began a profitable business relationship and a strong personal friendship in the mid-1980s. Prior to Firtel\u2019s involvement with the plaintiff, Firtel had formed Adco, a pharmaceutical sales company, as a Connecticut corporation in or about 1970. Firtel was the sole owner of Adco. Prior to the plaintiffs involvement with Firtel, the plaintiff had been employed as a sales representative for a medical supply company known as General Medical Corporation, where he had obtained extensive training and sales experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">In 1986, following a successful initial joint venture, the plaintiff and Firtel sought to formalize their business relationship. The plaintiff joined Adco and obtained a 49 percent shareholder interest in the company, and Firtel retained a controlling 51 percent interest. In September, 1986, the plaintiff and Firtel executed a document entitled \u201cOperational Agreement Regarding Adco Corporation,\u201d which was signed by Firtel as president of Adco and by Firtel and the plaintiff, individually. The agreement provided that the plaintiff \u201cdesire[d]\u201d to become a stockholder of Adco, \u201cand to be employed by [Adco]</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Paragraph eight of the agreement set forth the respective duties of the parties and the compensation that they would receive. That paragraph provides in relevant part: \u201cThe parties agree that they shall each devote such of their time and efforts to the business of [Adco] as shall be reasonably necessary. [The plaintiff] acknowl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>edges, understands and agrees that Firtel may and shall spend considerable time and often for extended periods away and apart from the business of [Adco], and hereby waives any objections thereto. Each of Firtel and [the plaintiff] shall receive an equal combination of compensation and fringe benefits as the [b]oard of [directors shall from time to time determine. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">The agreement also assigned control of the board of directors to Firtel, through an appointment process, which provided: \u201cThere shall be a [b]oard of [directors initially consisting of Firtel and [the plaintiff]. PROVIDED, HOWEVER, the parties agree that Firtel may elect to increase the number of directors to three . . . in which event two ... of said [directors shall be selected by Firtel and one ... of said [directors shall be selected by [the plaintiff].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Following the execution of the agreement, Firtel continued to hold the position of president of Adco, and the plaintiff was appointed vice president and secretary.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> From 1986 through July, 2004, the plaintiff was \u201cin charge of virtually all of Adco\u2019s day-to-day operations.\u201d During each of the years between 1986 and 2003, Adco paid expenses incurred by both Firtel and the plaintiff, in addition to their salaries.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> These expenses included medical and health expenses, automobile expenses, professional services and other related expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">Sometime after 2000, the plaintiff became disenchanted with the business arrangement. In March, 2003, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>the plaintiff sought a change in the operational agreement stemming from his perception that he was performing most of the work necessary to guarantee a profit for Adco but was dividing compensation and fringe benefits equally with Firtel. The plaintiff submitted a proposal, suggesting that he be paid 50 percent of the income for running the business and that the next 50 percent be equally divided between the shareholders. Firtel did not engage in any meaningful discussions concerning this suggested change because, apparently, he was satisfied with the status quo.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">On May 19, 2004, the plaintiff, through his attorney, formally advised Firtel that operating Adco in accordance with the 1986 agreement no longer was acceptable. The plaintiff offered to submit the dispute to arbitration and indicated an intention to file an action seeking to terminate the business relationship if an agreement could not be reached. Two months later, Firtel, acting in his capacity as president and majority stockholder of Adco, responded by terminating the plaintiffs employment via a July 23, 2004 memorandum. The plaintiff did not perform any work for Adco after July, 2004. He received no salary from Adco in 2004, and since the July 23, 2004 memorandum, the plaintiff has not been compensated by Adco either in the form of salary or most fringe benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Meanwhile, in July, 1999, during what the trial court referred to as their \u201cera of good feeling,\u201d the plaintiff and Firtel had formed Barbur, a limited liability company in which each owns a 50 percent interest. Barbur owns certain real estate located in Hamden, where Adco conducts its business. Barbur leases its property to Adco pursuant to an oral month-to-month lease. Prior to 2004, Adco paid Barbur an annual rent of $18,000. The lease obligated Adco to pay taxes, insurance and maintenance on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>After July, 2004, when Firtel terminated the plaintiffs employment with Adco, Firtel reduced the rental payments without consulting the plaintiff. In addition, Firtel unilaterally authorized the repair of the floor of the premises at a cost of $8480 and arranged for a $5000 loan from Barbur to Adco. Firtel continues to manage Barbur and to maintain Barbur\u2019s finances. In the aftermath of the May 19, 2004 and July 23, 2004 exchanges between the parties, any business or personal relationship that formerly had existed between them ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">Following the plaintiffs termination from Adco, he initiated the three actions that later were consolidated for trial. The first action included, inter alia, his statutory claim for unpaid wages.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The second action sought the judicial dissolution of Barbur<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and the third action, which is not at issue in this appeal, consisted of a summary process action commenced by the plaintiff on behalf of Barbur against Adco. The trial court found in favor of the plaintiff on his unpaid wages claim, awarded him double damages pursuant to \u00a7 31-72 and ordered a dissolution and winding up of Barbur pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 34-207 and 34-208. This appeal followed. See footnote 1 of this opinion. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">The defendants first claim that the trial court improperly awarded wages to the plaintiff pursuant to \u00a7 31-72. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>The defendants make three arguments with respect to this claim. First, the defendants argue that the trial court improperly invoked \u00a7 31-72 in awarding wages to the plaintiff because the plaintiff was not an \u201cemployee\u201d of Adco within the meaning of \u00a7 31-72. Second, the defendants contend that the trial court improperly calculated the base amount of wages awarded to the plaintiff for 2004 by failing to prorate the plaintiffs award on the basis of the number of months that he had worked in that year. Finally, the defendants assert that the trial court\u2019s award of double damages to the plaintiff pursuant to \u00a7 31-72 was improper because that court did not make a specific finding of bad faith on the part of Adco.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We disagree with the defendants\u2019 first two arguments and decline to reach the third argument because the record is inadequate for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">The defendants first claim that General Statutes \u00a7 31-58 (f)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> provides the applicable definition of the term \u201cemployee\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7 31-72, and that the plaintiff does not come within that definition. Specifically, the defendants contend that, because the plaintiff was an officer of Adco and was \u201crunning the company,\u201d the plaintiff was \u201can individual employed in a bona fide executive, administrative or professional capacity,\u201d and, therefore, he is excluded from the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d contained in \u00a7 31-58 (f). On the basis of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>this reasoning, the defendants argue that the trial court improperly invoked \u00a7 31-72 in awarding wages to the plaintiff. The plaintiff responds that General Statutes \u00a7 31-71a, and not \u00a7 31-58 (f), provides the applicable definition of \u201c \u2018[e]mployee\u2019 \u201d as that term is used in \u00a7 31-72, and that he squarely falls within this definition. We agree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">This claim \u201craises a question of statutory construction, which is a [question] of law, over which we exercise plenary review.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Weems </em>v. <em>Citigroup, Inc., </em>289 Conn. 769, 778, 961 A.2d 349 (2008); see also <em>R.C. Equity Group, LLC </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>285 Conn. 240, 248, 939 A.2d 1122 (2008) (\u201c[b]ecause the interpretation of a statute, as well as its applicability to a given set of facts and circumstances, involves a question of law . . . our review ... is plenary\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). \u201cThe process of statutory interpretation involves the determination of the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of the case, including the question of whether the language does so apply. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">\u201cWhen construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to determine [the] meaning [of a statute], General Statutes \u00a7 1-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered. . . . The test to determine ambiguity is whether the statute, when read in context, is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Weems </em>v. <em>Citigroup, Inc., </em>supra, 289 Conn. 778-79; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Marsh &amp; McLennan Cos., </em>286 Conn. 454, 464-65, 944 A.2d 315 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>The statutory provisions relevant to this claim are set forth in chapter 558 of the General Statutes. Section 31-72 is contained in part II of chapter 558 and provides in relevant part that, \u201c[w]hen any employer fails to pay an employee wages in accordance with the provisions of sections 31-71a to 31-71i, inclusive, or fails to compensate an employee in accordance with section 31-76k . . . such employee . . . may recover, in a civil action, twice the full amount of such wages, with costs and such reasonable attorney\u2019s fees as may be allowed by the court . . . .\u201d Although the term \u201cemployee\u201d is not defined in \u00a7 31-72, the statute specifically references \u00a7 31-71a, which also is contained in part II of chapter 558 and defines \u201cemployee\u201d as \u201cany person suffered or permitted to work by an employer . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The defendants claim that, even though \u00a7 31-72 explicitly references \u00a7 31-71a, the applicable definition of \u201cemployee\u201d is found in \u00a7 31-58 (f). Section 31-58 is contained in part I of chapter 558, which is entitled \u201cMinimum Wages\u201d and provides in relevant part: \u201cAs used <em>in this part </em>. . . (f) \u2018[e]mployee\u2019 means any individual employed or permitted to work by an employer but shall not include ... an individual employed in a bona fide executive, administrative or professional capacity as defined in the regulations of the Labor Commissioner . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">After comparing the statutory language and the chapters in which the statutory provisions are located, we conclude that \u00a7 31-72 unambiguously indicates that the definitions contained in \u00a7 31-71a should be applied when construing \u00a7 31-72. Further, \u00a7 31-58 specifically limits the applicability of its definitions to terms \u201cused in this part . . . .\u201d Therefore, the definitions contained in \u00a7 31-58 apply only to part I of chapter 558 and not to \u00a7 31-72, which is found in part II. Finally, in comparing the broad language in the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d in \u00a7 31-71a with the more restrictive language in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>definition of \u201cemployee\u201d in \u00a7 31-58, it is evident that the legislature included limiting language to narrow the definition of an \u201cemployee\u201d in \u00a7 31-58 but chose not to do so when defining an \u201cemployee\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 31-71a (2). As we often have stated, when \u201ca statute, with reference to one subject contains a given provision, the omission of such provision from a similar statute concerning a related subject ... is significant to show that a different intention existed. . . . That tenet of statutory construction is well grounded because [t]he General Assembly is always presumed to know all the existing statutes and the effect that its action or [nonaction] will have upon any one of them.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Asylum Hill Problem Solving Revitalization Assn. </em>v. <em>King, </em>277 Conn. 238, 256-57, 890 A.2d 522 (2006). We therefore reject the defendants\u2019 argument that \u00a7 31-58 provides the applicable definition of \u201cemployee\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7 31-72 and conclude that, under the broad definition of \u201cemployee\u201d set forth in \u00a7 31-71a, the plaintiff was an employee of Adco. Accordingly, the trial court properly invoked \u00a7 31-72 in awarding wages to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">The defendants next claim that the trial court improperly calculated the amount of wages awarded to the plaintiff for 2004 by failing to prorate the plaintiffs award on the basis of the number of months that he had worked in that year. The plaintiff responds that the trial court\u2019s calculation of wages was properly supported by the evidence adduced at trial. We agree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">The following additional facts are necessary to our resolution of this claim. The trial court found that both the plaintiffs employment with Adco and the 1986 agreement were terminated on July 23, 2004, as a consequence of Firtel\u2019s memorandum to the plaintiff. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>court further found that the plaintiffs claim to receive compensation stemmed from the 1986 agreement and, therefore, that he could not claim compensation pursuant to the agreement for the period of time that he was not an Adco employee. The plaintiff received no compensation for the work that he had performed for Adco during 2004. Firtel, on the other hand, was paid $50,126 as compensation in 2004. The compensation paid to Firtel was not prorated but, rather, was disbursed in one lump sum at the end of the year. On the basis of these findings, the trial court concluded that the plaintiff \u201cshould ... be compensated pursuant to [the agreement], for the year 2004\u201d and awarded him $50,126 \u201cfor wages due for calendar year 2004.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">We begin by setting forth our standard of review of a trial court\u2019s assessment of damages. \u201c[A] trial court is vested with broad discretion in determining whether damages are appropriate. ... Its decision will not be disturbed . . . absent a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Snyder, </em>267 Conn. 456, 466, 839 A.2d 589 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">With this deferential standard in mind, we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in awarding the plaintiff wages in the amount of $50,126. The court based its calculation of damages on the agreement between the parties, which provided for equal compensation for Firtel and the plaintiff. The agreement did not provide for the proration of compensation; rather, the evidence revealed that, historically, Adco had paid Firtel and the plaintiff on an annual basis, at the end of each year. Moreover, the trial court had no basis on which it could determine how or if this annual salary could or should be prorated, as no evidence on this issue was presented at trial. Nevertheless, the trial court was cognizant that the plaintiff should not receive compensation \u201cfor the period of time during which he was not an Adco employee.\u201d In light <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>of the trial court\u2019s awareness of this limitation and its qualification that its award was for wages \u201cdue\u201d for calendar year 2004, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding the plaintiff $50,126, as the award was supported by the evidence. See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Snyder, </em>supra, 267 Conn. 467 (holding that trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding compensatory damages when evidence, even though vague, supported award); <em>Metcalfe </em>v. <em>Talarski, </em>213 Conn. 145, 156-57, 567 A.2d 1148 (1989) (holding that trial court\u2019s award of damages was not erroneous when supported by evidence and pleadings).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The defendants also claim that the trial court improperly awarded the plaintiff double damages pursuant to \u00a7 31-72. The defendants assert that double damages under \u00a7 31-72 may be awarded only upon a finding of bad faith, arbitrariness or unreasonableness, and that such a finding \u201cmust be made by actual words\u201d by the trial court. The defendants argue that, because the trial court did not make this explicit finding but, rather, found that the refusal of Adco to pay the plaintiff wages was \u201cwilful,\u201d the trial court\u2019s award of double damages was improper. The plaintiff responds that the trial court\u2019s finding of wilfulness is equivalent to a finding of bad faith, and if the trial court\u2019s finding was not clear, the defendants had a responsibility to request an articulation. We conclude that the record is inadequate for our review and, therefore, decline to review this claim.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Section 31-72 \u201cprovides for \u2018a discretionary award of double damages, with costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, to employees who are successful in actions against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>their employers for wages due.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ravetto </em>v. <em>Triton Thalassic Technologies, Inc., </em>285 Conn. 716, 724, 941 A.2d 309 (2008); see also <em>Crowther v. Gerber Garment Technology, Inc., </em>8 Conn. App. 254, 265-66, 513 A.2d 144 (1986) (affirming judgment of trial court awarding double damages and attorney\u2019s fees when employer unilaterally reduced employee\u2019s commission rate despite employment agreement). \u201cAlthough \u00a7 31-72 does not set forth a standard by which to determine whether double damages should be awarded in particular cases, it is well established . . . that it is appropriate for a plaintiff to recover attorney\u2019s fees, and double damages under [\u00a7 31-72], only when the trial court has found that the defendant acted with bad faith, arbitrariness or unreasonableness.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ravetto </em>v. <em>Triton Thalassic Technologies, Inc., </em>supra, 724; see also <em>Schoonmaker </em>v. <em>Lawrence Brunoli, Inc., </em>265 Conn. 210, 269, 828 A.2d 64 (2003); <em>Sansone </em>v. <em>Clifford, </em>219 Conn. 217, 229, 592 A.2d 931 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">In the present case, the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision is silent with respect to whether Adco acted with \u201cbad faith, arbitrariness or unreasonableness\u201d; <em>Ravetto </em>v. <em>Triton Thalassic Technologies, Inc., </em>supra, 285 Conn. 724; in refusing to pay the wages due to the plaintiff. The court simply found that Adco\u2019s refusal was \u201cwilful\u201d and that the plaintiff should recover double damages under \u00a7 31-72. Whether a party\u2019s conduct is wilful is a question of fact. See <em>Bauer </em>v. <em>Waste Management of Connecticut, Inc., </em>239 Conn. 515, 527, 686 A.2d 481 (1996) (\u201c[w]hat constitutes willfulness is a question of fact\u201d). The term has many and varied definitions, with the applicable definition often \u201cturn[ing] on the specific facts of the case and the context in which it is used.\u201d <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Marselle, </em>236 Conn. 845, 851, 675 A.2d 835 (1996); <em>Screws </em>v. <em>United States, </em>325 U.S. 91, 101, 65 S. Ct. 1031, 89 L. Ed. 1495 (1945). As we previously have observed, \u201cBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>demonstrates the varied ways that wilful has been defined ranging from \u2018voluntary; knowingly; deliberate . . . [i]ntending the result which actually comes to pass; designed; intentional; purposeful; not accidental or involuntary\u2019 to \u2018[p]remeditated; malicious; done with evil intent, or with a bad motive or purpose, or with indifference to the natural consequences.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">\u201cAdditionally, we have defined the term differently depending on the context. See, e.g., <em>Dubay </em>v. <em>Irish, </em>207 Conn. 518, 533, 542 A.2d 711 (1988) (wilful misconduct requires design to injure); <em>DeMilo </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>189 Conn. 671, 678-79, 458 A.2d 362 (1983) (wilful destruction of bridge means intentional destruction of bridge and intent to cause injury); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gotsch, </em>23 Conn. Sup. 395, 398-99, 184 A.2d 56 (1962) (wilful commonly means intentional, as opposed to accidental, but in penal statute it means with evil intent); <em>Guest </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>22 Conn.

The term wilful also has been described as including \u201cnot only the mere exercise of the will in failing to comply with the statute [in question], but also an intention to do an act that he knows, or ought to know, is wrongful or forbidden by law . . . .\u201d Ballentine\u2019s Law Dictionary (3d Ed. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Correspondingly, the term wilful has been used to describe conduct deemed highly unreasonable or indicative of bad faith. See <em>CFM of Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>Chowdhury, </em>239 Conn. 375, 395, 685 A.2d 1108 (1996) (\u201c[t]o determine whether the bad faith exception applies, the court must assess whether there has been substantive bad faith as exhibited by, for example, a party\u2019s . . . wilful violations of court orders\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]), overruled in part on other grounds by <em>State </em>v. <em>Salmon, </em>250 Conn. 147, 154-55, 735 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>A.2d 333 (1999); <em>ACMAT Corp. </em>v. <em>Greater New York Mutual Ins.

Reviewing some of the court\u2019s explicit findings, we conclude that it is likely that the court used the term to mean highly unreasonable, but it also is possible that it used the term in a more benign sense. We can state, however, that the trial court did not articulate a legal standard when it made the factual finding that Adco\u2019s failure to pay wages was \u201cwilful.\u201d It is unclear, therefore, from the court\u2019s memorandum of decision, whether the court implicitly found bad faith, arbitrariness or unreasonableness in awarding the plaintiff double damages<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> or whether the court incorrectly applied a different standard in making its award.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>\u201cOur role is not to guess at possibilities . . . but to review claims based on a complete factual record developed by a trial court. . . .

The crux of the defendants\u2019 argument is that the factual circumstances in the present case do not justify the trial court\u2019s implicit factual finding that it was not reasonably practicable for the plaintiff and Firtel to carry on the business of Barbur. In support of this argument, the defendants claim that \u201cBarbur continues to function\u201d and that the parties have each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>received equal distributions from Barbur since 2004.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The plaintiff contends that the trial court made a plethora of factual findings that support the court\u2019s decision to order the dissolution of Barbur. We agree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">We begin with our standard of review. \u201c[When] the factual basis of the court\u2019s decision is challenged we must determine whether the facts set out in the memorandum of decision are supported by the evidence or whether, in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the whole record, those facts are clearly erroneous. . . . We also must determine whether those facts correctly found are, as a matter of law, sufficient to support the judgment. . . . Although we give great deference to the findings of the trial court because of its function to weigh and interpret the evidence before it and to pass upon the credibility of witnesses . . . we will not uphold a factual determination if we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. ... In applying the clearly erroneous standard of review, [a]ppellate courts do not examine the record to determine whether the trier of fact could have reached a different conclusion. Instead, we examine the trial court\u2019s conclusion in order to determine whether it was legally correct and factually supported. . . . This distinction accords with our duty as an appellate tribunal to review, and not to retry, the proceedings of the trial court.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wyszomierski </em>v.

The trial court made the following relevant factual findings in its memorandum of decision, all of which support the conclusion that it was not reasonably practicable to carry on the business of Barbur in conformity with its 1986 agreement: (1) the plaintiff and Firtel each own 50 percent of Barbur; (2) Firtel unilaterally lowered the rental payments for the property owned by Barbur in 2004 and the years following the plaintiffs termination from Adco; (3) during this period, Firtel unilaterally arranged for a $5000 loan from Barbur to Adco, a company which he controls; (4) Firtel, acting alone, authorized the repair of the floor of the premises located on Barbur\u2019s property at a cost of $8480; (5) Firtel did not equally compensate the plaintiff for distributions made on behalf of Barbur until December, 2007, after the trial of this action had commenced; and (6) since July 23, 2004, the plaintiff and Firtel have ceased to have any business or personal relationship.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">After reviewing the evidence in the present case, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s findings are not clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>erroneous and support its determination that it was not reasonably practicable to carry on the business of Barbur. We therefore affirm the court\u2019s order of dissolution of Barbur. See, e.g., <em>Chance </em>v. <em>Norwalk Fast Oil, Inc., </em>55 Conn.

Thus, the court was making a finding of fact and not stating a legal standard. We cannot conclude that the trial court applied an incorrect legal standard when it was the <em>conduct </em>of Adco that the court was describing. As we have noted in this opinion, it is the description of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>this conduct that requires articulation because of the multiple meanings ascribed to the word wilful in our case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">Furthermore, the concurrence and dissent\u2019s suggestion that the trial court applied the wrong legal standard is belied by the next sentence in the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision, in which that court stated: \u201cThe award of double damage[s], or attorney\u2019s fees is a matter of discretion. <em>Commissioner of Labor </em>v. <em>Wall, </em>69 Conn.

Thus, in order to preserve an adequate record for review, the defendants should have included this issue in their motion to reargue or should have filed a motion for articulation. In failing to do so and by raising this argument for the first time on appeal, the defendants denied the trial court the opportunity to act and correct any potential errors with respect to this issue.

The plaintiff responds that the bad faith standard proposed by the defendants is the equivalent of the wilfulness standard used by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">The majority concludes that the defendants\u2019 claim is not reviewable because the record is inadequate to demonstrate which standard the trial court actually used. In reaching its conclusion, the majority declares that the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision is ambiguous because the definition of the term \u201cwilful\u201d varies according to the context in which it is used, and, therefore, the trial court could have made a finding of bad faith despite using the term wilful.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">This court, however, has stated explicitly that, in the context of \u00a7 31-72, the bad faith standard necessary to support an award of double damages is separate and distinct from the wilfulness standard used in the context of common-law punitive damages.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Harty </em>v. <em>Cantor Fitzgerald &amp; Co., </em>275 Conn. 72, 93 n.12, 881 A.2d 139 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>(2005). In light of that distinction in our case law, and the trial court\u2019s use of only the term wilful in its decision, the trial court must have measured Adco\u2019s conduct by an incorrect legal standard that does not support its award of double damages pursuant to \u00a7 31-72.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Because the trial court, in awarding double damages to the plaintiff, unambiguously found that Adco wilfully refused to pay the plaintiffs wages, but failed to decide whether Adco had acted in bad faith, I would reverse the judgment of the trial court only as to its award of statutory double damages, and remand the case to that court for a determination of whether Adco\u2019s conduct demonstrated bad faith and, if so, whether statutory double damages may be awarded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b559-9\"> See footnote 3 of the majority opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b559-10\"> In addition to Adco, the defendants include Burton Firtel and Barbur Associates, LLC (Barbur).

Bic Corp., </em>270 Conn. 433, 440, 854 A.2d 1057 (2004) (whether Appellate Court correctly concluded that workers\u2019 compensation commissioner had employed relevant legal standard, even though he had not expressed standard used, presents question of law subject to plenary review). Accordingly, the majority\u2019s observation that the record in this case might support a finding of either wilfulness or bad faith, or both, lends no insight into which of those standards the trial court actually applied to the evidence in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b560-8\"> I agree that, in other contexts not involving \u00a7 31-72, we have suggested that bad faith conduct could include wilful behavior.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b561-10\"> The majority states that \u201c[w]e cannot conclude that the trial court applied an incorrect legal standard when it was the conduct of the defendant that the court, was describing . . . because of the multiple meanings ascribed to the word wilful in our case law.\u201d Because the trial court necessarily applied some legal standard to Adco\u2019s conduct and because the court describes that conduct only as wilful, it is clear to me that the standard chosen by the trial court was a wilfulness standard. Further, because this court\u2019s opinion <em>in Harty v. Cantor Fitzgerald &amp; Co., </em>supra, 275 Conn. 93 n.12, clearly limits the number of definitions attributable to the term wilful in the context of \u00a7 31-72 claims for double damages, the trial court applied an incorrect, standard to Adco\u2019s conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
