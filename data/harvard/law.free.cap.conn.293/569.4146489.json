The defendant filed a motion to dismiss the action on the ground that it was barred by the statute of limitations set forth in \u00a7 49-42 (b). The trial court granted the motion to dismiss. The plaintiff appeals<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> from the judgment of the trial court, claiming that \u00a7 49-42 (b) does not apply to this action because the plaintiff had not brought the action pursuant to \u00a7 49-42 but, rather, had brought a common-law action on the bond, and the parties had entered into a tolling agreement whereby they had agreed to extend the statute of limitations. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">The record reveals the following facts, the truth of which we assume for purposes of the issue raised in this appeal. See <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>249 Conn. 385, 392, 734 A.2d 535 (1999) (\u201c[i]n evaluating a motion to dismiss, [t]he evidence offered by the plaintiff is to be taken as true and interpreted in the light most favorable to [the plaintiff], and every reasonable inference is to be drawn in [the plaintiffs] favor\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 117, 120 S. Ct. 1239, 146 L. Ed. 2d 99 (2000). On April 1, 1997, the defendant, as surety, and Metcalf and Eddy, Inc. (Met-calf), as general contractor and principal, executed a labor and material payment bond as required by \u00a7 49-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>41 in the amount of $8.9 million in favor of the city of Danbury (city) in connection with a construction contract for the closure of the city\u2019s municipal landfill (project). Under the terms of the bond, Metcalf and the defendant bound themselves to make payments promptly to all claimants furnishing labor and materials to the project.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The bond provided in relevant part that \u201c[n]o suit or action shall be commenced hereunder by any claimant . . . [ajfter the expiration of one . . . year following the date on which [Metcalf] ceased work on said [c]ontract, it being understood, however, that if any limitation embodied in this bond is prohibited by any law controlling the construction hereof such limitation shall be deemed to be amended so as to be equal to the minimum period of limitation permitted by such law. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">The plaintiff was a subcontractor of Poole and Kent-New England, Inc., which, in turn, was a subcontractor of Metcalf on the project. In 1999, the plaintiff brought a timely action against the defendant alleging that the plaintiff had provided labor and materials for the project for which it had not been paid and seeking payment from the defendant under the bond. Thereafter, the plaintiff and the defendant entered into a written tolling agreement, with an effective date of April 19, 2002, pursuant to which the plaintiff agreed to withdraw the action on the bond and the defendant agreed to waive any statute of limitations defenses that might arise after the effective date of the agreement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant agreed that this waiver would remain in effect for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>period of one year after the effective date of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">On February 26, 2003, the plaintiff brought another action seeking payment under the bond. Thereafter, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs complaint on the ground that it was barred by the time limitation set forth in \u00a7 49-42. The trial court, <em>Adams, J., </em>denied the motion to dismiss. The defendant then filed a second amended answer in which it claimed as an affirmative defense that the plaintiffs action was time barred under \u00a7 49-42. The defendant also raised a counterclaim for attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to \u00a7 49-42, claiming that the plaintiffs action was without substantial basis in law or fact. The plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss the counterclaim on the ground that it was time barred under \u00a7 49-42. The defendant then filed a second motion to dismiss the plaintiffs complaint on the ground that it was time barred under \u00a7 49-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">The trial court, <em>Jennings, J., </em>granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the plaintiff had commenced the action more than one year after the date that it last had performed work on the project<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the action was, therefore, time barred under \u00a7 49-42. The court rejected the plaintiffs claim that, because the plaintiff had not brought an action pursuant to \u00a7 49-42 but, instead, had brought a common-law action on the bond, the time limitation in \u00a7 49-42 did not apply to the action. The court concluded that there is no common-law right to sue on a bond issued pursuant to \u00a7 49-41. With respect to the plaintiffs motion to dismiss the defendant\u2019s counterclaim, the trial court concluded that it need not decide the question of whether the counterclaim was time barred, as the plaintiff had claimed, because, in light of the court\u2019s dismissal of the plaintiffs complaint on timeliness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>grounds, the court would be unable to determine whether the complaint was \u201cwithout substantial basis in fact or law.\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 49-42 (a). Accordingly, the court concluded that the counterclaim was \u201cin a state of procedural mootness\u201d and dismissed the counterclaim on this alternate ground. This appeal followed. See footnote 3 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">The plaintiff claims that the trial court<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> improperly granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss its complaint on the grounds that the complaint was time barred under \u00a7 49-42 because the plaintiff had not brought its action pursuant to that statute, but instead had brought a common-law action on the bond.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We conclude that the trial court properly granted the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">\u201cThe standard of review for a court\u2019s decision on a motion to dismiss is well settled. A motion to dismiss tests, inter alia, whether, on the face of the record, the court is without jurisdiction. . . . [O]ur review of the court\u2019s ultimate legal conclusion and resulting [determination] of the motion to dismiss will be de novo.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Marsh &amp; McLennan Cos., </em>286 Conn. 454, 463-64, 944 A.2d 315 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 49-42 (b) provides in relevant part: \u201cEvery suit instituted under this section shall be brought in the name of the person suing . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>but no such suit may be commenced after the expiration of one year after . . . the date such materials were supplied or any work was performed.\u201d This court previously has concluded that \u201cthe General Assembly intended . . . \u00a7\u00a7 49-41 and 49-42 to operate in general conformity with the federal statute, popularly known as the Miher Act (40 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 270a-270e) . . . . The provision of \u00a7 49-42 . . . [that] sets forth the time limitation within which suit must be commenced under the statute, therefore, is not to be treated as an ordinary statute of limitation, but as a jurisdictional requirement establishing a condition precedent to maintaining an action under that section.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>American Masons\u2019 Supply Co. </em>v. <em>F. W. Brown Co., </em>174 Conn. 219, 223-24, 384 A.2d 378 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">It is well settled that, in an action brought pursuant to \u00a7 49-42, \u201cthe time fixed for bringing the action is a limitation of the liability itself, and not of the remedy alone.\u201d Id., 224;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> see also <em>Okee Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>National Grange Mutual Ins. Co., </em>225 Conn. 367, 373, 623 A.2d 483 (1993) (\u201c[w]e have relied on the rule of strict construction when the issue was whether the claimant\u2019s notice complied with the specific time requirements of [\u00a7 49-42]\u201d); <em>Okee Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>National Grange Mutual Ins. Co., </em>supra, 374 (\u201c[t]he federal precedents, like our own, counsel liberal construction of statutory requirements <em>other than those relating to specific time constraints\u201d </em>[emphasis added]). Because compliance with the limitations period set forth in \u00a7 49-42 is a jurisdictional requirement, \u201ca timely suit is an absolute condition precedent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>to maintaining an action under that section. . . . This substantive requirement cannot be avoided by waiver or estoppel.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Fisher Skylights, Inc. </em>v. <em>CFC Construction Ltd. Partnership, </em>79 F.3d 9, 12 (2d Cir. 1996); see also <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Beresford, </em>184 Conn. 558, 562, 440 A.2d 224 (1981) (\u201c[i]t is hornbook law that the parties cannot confer subject matter jurisdiction on a court by consent, waiver, silence or agreement\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">This court also has held that, when a bond has been furnished pursuant to \u00a7 49-41 \u201cas a condition precedent to the execution of the construction contract . . . [t]he bond and the statute . . . are to be construed together, and the language of the bond is to be interpreted in the light of the statute and with a view to effectuating the legislative intent manifested therein.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>American Masons\u2019 Supply Co. </em>v. <em>F. W. Brown Co., </em>supra, 174 Conn. 225; see also <em>New Britain Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>American Surety Co., </em>113 Conn. 1, 5-6, 154 A. 147 (1931) (\u201cWhere a statutory bond is given, the provisions of the statute will be read into the bond. ... If the law has made the instrument necessary, the parties are deemed to have had the law in contemplation when the contract was executed.\u201d [Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.]).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">The plaintiff in the present case concedes that, under these principles, it is barred from bringing an action against the defendant pursuant to \u00a7 49-42. It claims, however, that it did not bring this action pursuant to \u00a7 49-42 but, instead, brought a common-law contract action on the bond.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In support of its claim that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>was entitled to bring such an action, the plaintiff relies primarily on this court\u2019s decision in <em>Herbert S. Newman &amp; Partners, P.C. </em>v. <em>CFC Construction Ltd. Partnership, </em>236 Conn. 750, 674 A.2d 1313 (1996). In that case, the defendants, a general contractor and a surety company, had executed a surety bond pursuant to \u00a7 49-41, under which they \u201cbound themselves to make payments promptly to all claimants supplying labor, services or materials for\u201d a public works project owned by the city of New Haven. Id., 753. Thereafter, the plaintiff, which had entered into a contract with the general contractor for the provision of architectural services, commenced an action against the defendants on the bond for payment of services that it had provided under the contract. Id., 753-54. The defendants claimed that the plaintiff was barred from recovering under the bond because the plaintiff had not distinguished between services that it had rendered at the job site, which came under the \u201cpersons supplying labor or materials\u201d provision of \u00a7 49-41, and services it had rendered away from the job site, which the defendants claimed were not covered under the bond. Id., 754-55. The trial court held that the defendants were liable to the plaintiff for all of the services that the plaintiff had rendered for which it had not been paid, and the defendants appealed from the judgment. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">On appeal, the defendants claimed that \u201ca payment bond executed pursuant to \u00a7 49-41 cannot establish broader protection than that required by the statute.\u201d Id., 755. This court concluded that the language of the statute,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the remedial purpose of the statute and federal precedent all supported the conclusion that \u201ccon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>tracting parties who execute a payment bond pursuant to \u00a7 49-41 have the authority to expand coverage beyond that required by the statute.\u201d Id., 758. Because the bond issued by the defendants had allowed recovery for services provided by a claimant, regardless of where the services had been rendered, we concluded that the plaintiff was entitled to recover under the bond. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">In the present case, the plaintiff contends that our decision in <em>Herbert S. Newman &amp; Partners, P. </em>C., stands for the general proposition that a surety who executes a payment bond pursuant to \u00a7 49-41 is not prohibited from agreeing to a more generous provision than those provided under \u00a7 49-42 and that an action upon such a bond is not governed by \u00a7 49-42. It is clear, however, that the plaintiffs complaint in <em>Herbert S. Newman &amp; Partners, P.C., </em>was brought pursuant to \u00a7 49-42, and was not a common-law action on the bond. See id., 766 (addressing defendants\u2019 claim that plaintiff had not brought action on bond within time period allowed by \u00a7 49-42). Thus, the case merely stands for the proposition that \u00a7 49-41 does not prohibit a general contractor from providing more protection to claimants than is required by that statute. Nothing in the case suggests that \u00a7 49-42 does not govern an action on such a bond or that, contrary to the cases holding that the time limitation of \u00a7 49-42 is jurisdictional, the parties are not prohibited from waiving that provision.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reject the plaintiffs claim that <em>Herbert S. Newman &amp; Partners, P.C., </em>supports its claim that a claimant may bring a common-law action on a bond issued pursuant to \u00a7 49-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">The plaintiff also relies on a number of Superior Court decisions to support its claim that it was entitled to bring a common-law action on the bond. See <em>Wolverine </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number><em>Fire Protection Co. </em>v. <em>Tougher Industries, Inc., </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Hartford, Docket No. CV 01-0805554-S (June 20, 2001); <em>Northeast Waste Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Connecticut Abatement Technologies, Inc., </em>Superior Court, judicial district of New Haven, Docket No. CV 98-0419724-S (June 2, 2000); <em>Ten Hoeve Bros., Inc. </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Hartford, Docket No. CV 93-0704020-S (May 13, 1996). We are not persuaded. In <em>Wolverine Fire Protection Co. </em>v. <em>Tougher Industries, Inc., </em>supra, Superior Court, Docket No. CV 01-0805554-S, the court concluded that an action brought pursuant to \u00a7 49-42 is not the exclusive remedy against a surety that has provided a bond on a public works project, and the claimant was entitled to bring claims that the surety had breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and had engaged in unfair trade practices. In reaching this determination, the court relied on the remedial purpose of the statutory scheme. In <em>Northeast Waste Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Connecticut Abatement Technologies, Inc., </em>supra, Superior Court, Docket No. CV 98-0419724-S, the court held that, under this court\u2019s decision in <em>Herbert S. Newman &amp; Partners, P.C. </em>v. <em>CFG Construction Ltd. Partnership, </em>supra, 236 Conn. 758-59, the parties to a statutory bond could extend protection to fourth tier subcontractors, even though they were not required to do so by statute. <em>Ten Hoeve Bros., Inc. </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>supra, Superior Court, Docket No. CV 93-0704020-S, merely stands for the proposition that a subcontractor may bring an action for an equitable hen against a <em>municipality </em>for amounts due from the general contractor when the municipality has created a special fond for payment of the general contractor. The court in that case reasoned that, in creating a remedial statute, the legislature could not have intended to deprive a party of common-law remedies that had existed before the statute was enacted. Id. In none of these cases did the court hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>that \u00a7 49-42 was not the exclusive remedy with respect to an action against a surety on a bond executed pursuant to \u00a7 49-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">We conclude, therefore, that the plaintiff was not entitled to bring a common-law action on the bond. It would be absurd to conclude that, although the provisions of the statutory scheme will be read into a bond issued pursuant to \u00a7 49-41; see <em>New Britain Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>American Surety Co., </em>supra, 113 Conn. 5-6; and parties cannot waive the time limitations set forth in \u00a7 49-42 by agreement; see <em>Fisher Skylights, Inc. </em>v. <em>CFC Construction Ltd. Partnership, </em>supra, 79 F.3d 12; the parties nevertheless can remove themselves entirely from the statutory scheme by entering into such an agreement. If that were the case, the rule that parties cannot waive the limitations provision of \u00a7 49-42 by agreement would apply only when the parties have not waived the provision by agreement. In addition, we see no reason why, if the limitations provision may be waived by agreement, it may not be waived by a defendant\u2019s failure to raise it as a defense, a result that also would be inconsistent with our case law holding that compliance with the provision is a jurisdictional prerequisite. See <em>American Masons\u2019 Supply Co. </em>v. <em>F. W. Brown Co., </em>supra, 174 Conn. 224. Accordingly, we conclude that, when a surety has executed a bond pursuant to \u00a7 49-41, any action on the bond is governed by \u00a7 49-42.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We conclude, therefore, that the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>properly dismissed the plaintiffs complaint as barred by the limitations period of \u00a7 49-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b593-5\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 49-41 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cEach contract exceeding twenty-five thousand dollars in amount for the construction, alteration or repair of any public building or public work of the state or any subdivision thereof shall include a provision that the person to perform the contract shall furnish to the state or the subdivision on or before the award date, a bond in the amount of the contract which shall be binding upon the award of the contract to that person, with a surety or sureties satisfactory to the officer awarding the contract, for the protection of persons supplying labor or materials in the prosecution of the work provided for in the contract for the use of each such person ....
