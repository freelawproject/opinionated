At the time of his injury, the plaintiff was an employee of the defendant EBH Enterprises, Inc. The defendant Boyle Services, Inc., was the prime contractor hired directly by the School District to perform asbestos abatement. The defendant Park East Construction (hereinafter Park East) was the construction manager hired directly by the School District to coordinate the renovation project. The Supreme Court, inter alia, granted those branches of the motion of Park East which was for summary judgment dismissing the plaintiffs causes of actions sounding in common-law negligence and based on violation of Labor Law \u00a7\u00a7 200, 240 (1) and \u00a7 241 (6) on the grounds, among others, that Park East was not a contractor or an agent subject to liability under the Labor Law and did not supervise or control the plaintiff or his work. We modify by reinstating the causes of action to recover damages for violations of Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1) and \u00a7 241 (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Liability for violations of Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1) and \u00a7 241 (6) may be imposed against contractors and owners, and those parties who have been delegated the authority to supervise and control the work such that they become statutory agents of the owners and contractors <em>(cf. Russin v Picciano &amp; Son, </em>54 NY2d 311, 318 [1981]). The title by which a party is known is not determinative, however, and a party with essentially the same duties as a contractor or as an agent of the owner will be held to have the responsibilities of a contractor or owner under the Labor Law <em>(see Kenny v Fuller Co., </em>87 AD2d 183, 189 [1982]).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Park East failed to establish its prima facie entitlement to judgment as a matter of law on the plaintiffs causes of action to recover damages for violation of Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1) and \u00a7 241 (6). The agreement between Park East and the School District gave Park East many of the powers of a general contractor. Accordingly, there is an issue of fact as to whether Park East was in fact a general contractor or agent of the owner, and thus was not entitled to summary judgment on the causes of action alleging violations of Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1) and \u00a7 241 (6) <em>(see Kenny v Fuller Co., supra </em>at 188-190).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Liability for causes of action sounding in common-law negligence and for violations of Labor Law \u00a7 200 is limited to those who exercise control or supervision over the work <em>(see Lombardi v Stout, </em>80 NY2d 290, 295 [1992]). Park East met its initial burden on its motion for summary judgment on the plaintiffs causes of action alleging common-law negligence and to recover damages for violations of Labor Law \u00a7 200 by demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>strating that it exercised no actual supervision or control over the plaintiff or his work. The plaintiff failed to submit any evidence that would raise a triable issue of fact in this regard. Therefore, summary judgment was correctly granted to Park East on the plaintiffs causes of action sounding in common-law negligence and violation of Labor Law \u00a7 200 <em>(cf. Ross v Curtis-Palmer Hydro-Elec. Co., </em>81 NY2d 494, 505-506 [1993]). Santucci, J.E, Schmidt, Adams and Crane, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
