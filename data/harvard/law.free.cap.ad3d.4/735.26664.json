Dev. Agency, </em>209 AD2d 34, 40 [1995], <em>appeal dismissed </em>86 NY2d 776 [1995]). Although respondent passed a resolution that authorized the condemnation of the property, that resolution does not adequately set forth the basis for respondent\u2019s determination. Nor did respondent undertake an appropriate review under the State Environmental Quality Review Act ([SEQRA] ECL art 8) to determine whether the taking would have a significant impact on the environment or was otherwise exempt from environmental review under SEQRA.
