Logan, the respondent. The petition charged that the respondent violated Rules 1.3, Diligence,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>1.4, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>Communication,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 1.16, Declining or terminating representation,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 5.5, Unauthorized practice of law,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 8.1, Bar admission and disciplinary matters,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and 8.4, Misconduct,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct, as adopted by Maryland Rule 16-812.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">We referred the case, pursuant to Rule 16-752(a),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> to the Honorable Nelson W. Rupp, of the Circuit Court for Mont<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>gomery County, for hearing. When the respondent did not answer the petition, an order of default was entered against him. Following a hearing, at which, despite being notified as to the date and time, the respondent did not appear, the hearing court, pursuant to Rule 16-757(c),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> found facts by the clear and convincing standard, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">\u201cWilliam Malcom Logan, Jr. (hereinafter \u2018the Respondent\u2019) was admitted to the Bar of Maryland on December 24, 2002. The only address he has provided to the Client Protection Fund of the Bar of Maryland is 1004 Hopewell Avenue, Takoma Park, Maryland 20912.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">\u201cOn or about June 30, 2003, the Respondent replied via email to a newspaper advertisement placed by Geoffrey L. Tibbetts, also known as Jeffrey L. Tibbetts, in The Washington Post. Mr. Tibbetts\u2019 ad sought the services of an experienced litigator to represent Mr. Tibbetts in civil litigation. As an attachment to his email reply, the Respondent included a cover letter dated July 01, 2003. The Respondent represented in his cover letter that he had \u201925 years experience as a Senior Trial Attorney with the Department of Justice supervising the litigation of very large and complex civil and criminal cases before 38 different Federal judges.\u2019 He further represented that he had taken more than 45 cases to trial before retiring. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>The Respondent submitted an attached resume listing his Career Highlights, Professional Experience and Education.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">\u201cOn the basis of the Respondent\u2019s reply, Mr. Tibbetts initiated further communications which led to an agreement for the Respondent to represent Mr. Tibbetts in several pending matters. On July 6, 2003, the Respondent forwarded a proposed Representation Agreement to Mr. Tibbetts. Following additional communications, the Respondent and Mr. Tibbetts finalized a Representation Agreement, which was executed by both parties on August 11, 2003. The Representation Agreement listed six civil actions already in litigation in which the Respondent agreed to represent Mr. Tibbetts \u2018through judgment.\u2019 Of those six, three were pending in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut. The other three listed litigation matters included one case in each of the following courts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-5\">(a) Arlington County (Va.) Circuit Court;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-6\">(b) Fairfax County (Va.) Circuit Court;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-7\">(c) United States District Court for the Northern District of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-8\">Virginia.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">\u201cIn a letter dated July 25, 2003, addressed to the Honorable Christopher F. Droney, U.S. District Judge for the District of Connecticut, the Respondent wrote that he was \u2018writing to enter an appearance on behalf of the Plaintiff in this matter, Jeffrey L. Tibbetts,\u2019 in the case of <em>Tibbetts v. President and Fellows of Yale College, </em>Case No. 301CV01763, 2005 WL 162382. On August 13, 2003, the Respondent filed a Line of Appearance with the Clerk of the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut, accompanied by a \u2018Motion for Leave to Appear Pro Haec Vice.\u2019 The Respondent was not admitted to practice before the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut and did not have a member of that Court\u2019s Bar sponsor his appearance at the time he attempted to enter his appearance as Mr. Tibbetts\u2019 lawyer in Case No. 301CV01763.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">\u201cThe Respondent was not a member of the Virginia State Bar at the time he agreed to represent Mr. Tibbetts in two pending cases in Virginia state courts. The Respondent also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>was not admitted to practice before the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Virginia.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">\u201cOn or about August 22, 2003, Mr. Tibbetts and the Respondent discussed a legal malpractice action (not listed on the Representation Agreement) that Mr. Tibbetts had filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against a lawyer named Rodney Sweetland. The Sweetland lawsuit had been dismissed by the U.S. District Court, but Mr. Tibbetts had noted an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The Respondent agreed to represent Mr. Tibbetts in the appeal of the Sweetland case. On August 27, 2003, the Respondent filed a motion titled \u2018Motion for Extension of Time for Pro Se Appellant\u2019s Counsel to be Admitted and to File the Brief with the Cl\u00e9rk of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. In that motion, the Respondent represented that on August 26, 2003, he \u2018agreed to represent the Appellant [Tibbetts] on a contingency-fee basis.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">\u201cOver a period of approximately ten days after the Respondent filed the aforementioned motion in connection with the appeal of the Sweetland case, the Respondent and Mr. Tibbetts exchanged a series of electronic mail communications which became increasingly contentious. In an email sent on September 5, 2003, the Respondent advised Mr. Tibbetts he was terminating their attorney-client relationship. Mr. Tibbetts has not heard from the Respondent since receiving his final email on September 5, 2003. Since terminating the representation, the Respondent has not returned original documents belonging to Mr. Tibbetts. The Respondent did not file any papers seeking to withdraw as counsel in the two federal court matters in which he had filed motions indicating his representation of Mr. Tibbetts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">\u201cFollowing receipt of Mr. Tibbetts\u2019 complaint against the Respondent in April 2004, the office of Bar Counsel sought a response from the Respondent on three occasions by sending letters to the mailing address of record provided by the Respondent to the Client Protection Fund of the Bar of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>Maryland. Bar Counsel\u2019s letters were sent on April 20, 2004, May 12, 2004 and June 16, 2004. The Respondent signed for the May 12, 2004 letter, which was sent by certified mail. The Respondent did not respond at all to any of Bar Counsel\u2019s letters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">On the basis of the foregoing findings of fact, the hearing court concluded that the respondent engaged in the professional misconduct, as charged by the petitioner and that each of the charged Rule violations was established by his acts and omissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Neither the petitioner nor the respondent took exceptions to the hearing court\u2019s findings of fact or conclusions. Indeed, the respondent, though notified of the proceedings in this Court, did not file any pleadings or appear at oral argument. Consequently, for purposes of sanction, we treat the findings of fact as established. Rule 16-759(b)(2)(A).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Moreover, upon our <em>de novo </em>review of the hearing court\u2019s conclusions of law, Rule 16 \u2014 759(b)(1),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> we are satisfied that they follow from, and are supported by, the court\u2019s factual findings, which, again, have been established.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">That leaves for resolution the appropriate sanction. The petitioner recommends disbarment, submitting that, under the circumstances, it is the only viable sanction. In its <em>Petitioner\u2019s Recommendation For Sanction, </em>the petitioner emphasizes the respondent\u2019s failure to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s lawful demands for information, his failure to participate in the disciplinary process, having failed to answer the formal charges or to appear during the proceedings. Also of concern to the petitioner is the respondent\u2019s failure, although an apparently experienced litigator, to have complied with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>rules of the various courts in which he entered an appearance, or to have made more than cursory efforts to do so. The final reason underlying the petitioner\u2019s disbarment recommendation is its belief, unrebutted by the evidence or any inferences to be drawn therefrom, that \u201c[sjhortly after filing a motion with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in the Sweetland case, the Respondent abandoned his representation of Mr. Tibbetts and refused to engage in further communications with the client after terminating his representation via electronic mail.\u201d In summary, the petitioner concludes, citing <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Velasquez, </em>380 Md. 651, 846 A.2d 422 (2004) for the proposition that disbarment is the proper sanction when, among other misconduct, an attorney abandons his or her client and engages in the unauthorized practice of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-4\">\u201cFor reasons unknown, the Respondent has chosen to ignore this Court\u2019s disciplinary authority over him, initially by not answering Bar Counsel\u2019s attempts to obtain a response to the Tibbetts complaint and thereafter by failing to file an answer in this proceeding. The Respondent has not otherwise attempted to present any explanatory information in response to the charges. Having offered no justification for a less severe sanction, the Respondent should be disbarred.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">We agree. Here, the fact of the misconduct meriting the ultimate sanction has been established and there has been no showing, or even an attempt at showing, that the misconduct is mitigated. The respondent is ordered disbarred.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE 16-761, FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION AGAINST WILLIAM M.
