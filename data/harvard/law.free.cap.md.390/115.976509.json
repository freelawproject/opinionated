Weller, respondent, following a driving incident where respondent refused to submit to a chemical breath test. On May 16, 2004, a police officer stopped the car respondent was driving after seeing the car cross over a set of double yellow lines on the road. Respondent failed the field <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>sobriety tests administered by the police officer and refused to take a chemical breath test to determine the amount of his alcohol consumption. Respondent was issued an Order of Suspension, pursuant to Md.Code (1977, 2002 Repl.Vol., 2005 Supp.), \u00a7 16-205.1 of the Transportation Article,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for refusing to take the chemical breath test.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Respondent contested this suspension at an administrative show cause hearing conducted by an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) of the Maryland Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH). The Motor Vehicle Administration (hereinafter, the \u201cAdministration\u201d or \u201cAgency\u201d), petitioner, had delegated final administrative decision-making authority in such cases to the OAH, subject to \u00a7 16-205.1. Following the hearing, the ALJ found that respondent had violated \u00a7 16-205.1 and suspended respondent\u2019s Maryland driving privileges for one year. Respondent sought judicial review of the Agency\u2019s decision in the Circuit Court for Carroll County. The Circuit Court reversed the Agency\u2019s decision and vacated the one-year suspension of respondent\u2019s driving privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">The Administration then filed a Petition for Writ of Certiorari to this Court and on June 9, 2005, this Court granted certiorari. <em>Motor Vehicle Administration v. Weller, </em>387 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>462, 875 A.2d 767 (2005). In its brief, the Administration presents two questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-5\">1. \u201cDid the circuit court erroneously rule that preliminary breath test results are inadmissible in an administrative hearing under Transportation Article \u00a7 16-205.1, when Transportation Article \u00a7 16-205.2[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] prohibits their use as evidence only in a \u2018court action\u2019 or \u2018civil action\u2019?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-6\">2. \u201cDid the circuit court improperly substitute its judgment for that of the agency when it reversed and vacated the agency\u2019s decision because it found the ALJ did not properly consider Weller\u2019s employment as an insurance adjuster and the fact that it had been eight years since his prior test refusal?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">We answer the Administration\u2019s questions in the affirmative and reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court for Carroll <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>County. Addressing the first question, we hold that the trial court erred in considering the issue of the admissibility of the preliminary breath test result before the agency. No objection to its admissibility was made, accordingly that issue was not preserved. We shall discuss this matter further, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">The evidence before the ALJ reflected that early on the morning of May 16, 2004, Officer Jeffrey Shuster of the Hampstead Police observed a white Chevrolet, driven by respondent, cross over a set of double yellow lines. Officer Shuster stopped the vehicle and identified the driver from his Maryland license as Steven W. Weller, the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">Upon speaking with the respondent, Officer Shuster detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from respondent\u2019s breath. The officer also observed that respondent had bloodshot and watery eyes. During the stop, respondent admitted to the officer that he had consumed six beers. The officer conducted field sobriety tests and noted that respondent performed poorly on, and thus failed, the field sobriety tests administered during the stop. When the officer gave respondent a PBT, the result suggested he had a blood alcohol concentration of 0.16.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">As a result of this \u2022 information, the officer arrested the respondent for driving under the influence of alcohol pursuant to \u00a7 21-902 of the Transportation Article. The officer then requested that the respondent submit to the chemical breath test authorized under \u00a7 16-205.1<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to determine his blood alcohol concentration. Prior to the respondent\u2019s decision, the officer advised him of the administrative sanctions that he would face if he refused to take the breath test for a first or subsequent time. Respondent refused to take the test and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>acknowledged his refusal in writing by signing a DR-15 (\u201cAdvice of Rights\u201d) form.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>Respondent contested this suspension at an administrative show cause hearing conducted by an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ). Pursuant to \u00a7 16-205.1 of the Transportation Article, Officer Shuster then issued respondent an Order of Suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Pursuant to his rights under \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(3)(v)(l),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> respondent requested an administrative \u201chearing to show cause why [respondent\u2019s] driver\u2019s license should not be suspended concerning the refusal to take the [chemical breath] test.\u201d On June 28, 2004, a hearing was conducted in front of an ALJ at the Office of Administrative Hearings. Respondent eight years earlier had refused such a test and was therefore facing a possible one-year suspension pursuant to \u00a7 16-205.1 (b)(l)(i)(2)(B). The Administration presented several documents at the hearing which were admitted into evidence by the ALJ, including a DR-15A \u201cOfficer Certification and Order of Suspension\u201d and the respondent-signed DR-15 \u201cAdvice of Rights\u201d form acknowledging respondent\u2019s refusal to take the chemical breath test. <em>Respondent did not object to the introduction into evidence of any of the Administration\u2019s documents, including the DR-15 officer certification that contained the respondent\u2019s PBT result.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Respondent testified that he was single and lived alone. Respondent also testified that he was employed by an insurance company as a material damage adjuster and had worked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>in the insurance adjustment business for twenty-three years. His job consisted of inspecting vehicles for collision damage and, thus, required him to spend a large amount of his time on the road, driving to and from inspections. Respondent testified that he was provided with a company car for these purposes, but that he had a private vehicle that he used for non-work related driving. Finally, respondent testified that he had inquired of his employer about the possibility of an ignition interlock being installed in the company car and was told that it was not possible because it was a leased vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">At the conclusion of the hearing, respondent asked the ALJ to exercise her discretion and not suspend his driver\u2019s license for the full one-year period mandated by \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(l)(i)(2)(B) for repeat offenders. Respondent asked that the ALJ grant him the opportunity to use his company vehicle without restriction, because the ignition interlock could not be installed on that vehicle, and that he be allowed to use his personal vehicle with an ignition interlock.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">The ALJ rejected respondent\u2019s proposed disposition and held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-6\">\u201cI\u2019ve considered the evidence and testimony presented in the case, and I find by a preponderance of the evidence that the officer who stopped [respondent] had reasonable grounds to believe that he was driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of or impaired by alcohol because on May [16], 2004, [respondent] was observed driving across [a] double yellow line. The officer noted a strong odor of alcohol. A preliminary breath test of .16. Licensee said he had six beers. Blood shot and watery eyes. The officer fully advised [respondent] of the administrative sanctions, asked that he take a breath test, and he refused the test, and [that refusal] is a violation of Section 16-205.1. The record indicates that there was a prior refusal on July 12, 1996, followed by a 120-day suspension. Therefore, this is a second offense with a possible one-year suspension. In deciding what to do, I consider a number of different factors. I have considered the prior refusal, which put [respondent] in \u2014 resulted in some alcohol treatment. I\u2019ve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>considered that he\u2019s employed as an insurance adjuster (INAUDIBLE). He was evaluated by Westminster Recovery Center on June 25, 2004, (INAUDIBLE) 26 weeks of alcohol treatment. There are a number of extremely serious problems in [respondent\u2019s] case. I have considered the request for the interlock device but the problems are this. The driving was dangerous. [May] 16, 2004, it indicates that he drove across a double yellow line (INAUDIBLE). The level of alcohol as indicated by the evidence, and you can consider preliminary breath test result[s] in administrative proceedings, was .16, double the legal limit. Also, according to the Officer\u2019s Certification [respondent] told the officer he had six beers. This is after a prior alcohol offense that resulted in a suspension and alcohol treatment. [Respondent] has recently been evaluated by Westminster Recovery Center. I have reviewed the report, which is fairly detailed. This program \u2014 the program representative indicates that he believes that [respondent] was honest in all the information he gave me but this report doesn\u2019t indicate a prior alcohol offense or prior alcohol treatment. It is of concern to me that (INAUDIBLE) [respondent] may not have been completely honest with (INAUDIBLE). My decision in weighing all these different factors is that I am going to suspend your license for one year.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">The Administration then suspended respondent\u2019s privilege to drive in Maryland for one-year as provided for in \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(l)(i)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Respondent sought judicial review of the Administration\u2019s decision in the Circuit Court for Carroll County and that court held a hearing on January 14, 2005. On February 16, 2005, the Circuit Court issued an Order reversing the decision of the Administration and vacating the one-year suspension of respondent\u2019s Maryland driving privileges. The Circuit Court held that the Administration via the ALJ:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-7\">\u201cdid not give proper consideration to [respondent\u2019s] employment as an insurance adjuster for the past twenty-three years, to the fact that his prior alcohol offense was eight years ago, or that ignition interlock was an available option <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>on his personal vehicle. What is most significant, however, is that the Administrative Law Judge considered the result of [respondent\u2019s] preliminary breath test which is prohibited under MD. Transp. Code Ann. \u00a7 16.205.2(c) ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-5\">\u201cTherefore, after a thorough review of the record in this matter, the [Circuit] Court finds that the decision of the Administrative Law Judge is not supported by competent, material and substantial evidence and is, therefore, arbitrary and capricious.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">II. Consideration of unpreserved issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">As a preliminary issue, we first address the Administration\u2019s argument in its brief that respondent\u2019s failure to object to the introduction of his preliminary breath test result at the administrative hearing constitutes a waiver of his right to argue the admissibility of the evidence. <em>See Cicala v. Disability Rev. Bd. for Prince George\u2019s Co., </em>288 Md. 254, 263, 418 A.2d 205, 210-11 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">We stated in <em>Cicala: </em>\u201cBecause the issue of the alleged error was not raised during the administrative proceeding, it was not properly raised in the judicial review proceeding, and therefore is not properly before us.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 263, 418 A.2d at 210-11. We declined to address that issue. More recently, Judge Raker, writing for the Court, opined in <em>Schwartz v. Maryland Department of Natural Resources, </em>385 Md. 534, 554-56, 870 A.2d 168, 180-81 (2005):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-9\">\u201cThe difficult problem presented in the case <em>sub judice </em>is that the Circuit Court for Queen Anne\u2019s County ruled on an issue that was never raised before the agency____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-10\">\u201cBecause, even if the exemption exists, we agree with the agency decision that appellants are not entitled to the exemption as a matter of fact, we will not in this case decide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>whether the Circuit Court was correct in its construction of the statute.\u201d (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">In our decision in <em>Schwartz, </em>although we declined to reach the exemption issue, we, in a footnote as dicta made a brief comment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-5\">\u201cThis case should provide fair notice to the Department of Natural Resources, boat dealers, boat builders, and potential boat purchasers that the exemption at issue may not exist under the statute. Inasmuch as the Circuit Court ... may well have been correct in its interpretation, DNR might consider proposing to the Legislature language clarifying or amending the statute to provide explicitly for that which is reflected in Form 110B.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 556 n. 4, 870 A.2d at 181 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">Prior to our <em>Schwartz </em>case there was a recent line of our cases that consistently held that if issues were not raised during the administrative proceeding they could not later be raised during judicial review. In <em>Delmarva Power &amp; Light Company v. Public Service Commission, </em>370 Md. 1, 32, 803 A.2d 460, 478 (2002), Judge Wilner for the Court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Am7\">\u201cThe cases in which a waiver has been found based on non-preservation have been in the nature of contested cases, as to which judicial review ... is limited. As we noted in <em>Bulluck, [v. Pelham Wood Apartments], </em>283 Md. [505] at 518-19, 390 A.2d [1119] at 1127 [(1978)], quoting from <em>Unemployment Compensation Comm\u2019n v. Aragon, </em>329 U.S. 143, 155, 67 S.Ct. 245, 91 L.Ed. 136 (1946), \u2018[a] reviewing court usurps the agency\u2019s function when it sets aside the administrative determination upon a ground not theretofore presented and deprives the [agency] of an opportunity to consider the matter, make its ruling, and state the reasons for its action.\u2019 We do not allow issues to be raised for the first time in actions for judicial review of administrative agency orders entered in contested cases because to do so would allow the court to resolve matters <em>ab initio </em>that have been committed to the jurisdiction and expertise of the agency.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>In <em>Brodie v. Motor Vehicle Administration, </em>367 Md. 1, 3-4, 785 A.2d 747, 748-49 (2001), with Judge Eldridge writing, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-5\">\u201cBrodie filed in this Court a petition for a writ of certiorari which presented the single question of whether the MVA was authorized to revoke a driver\u2019s license when \u2018the petitioner\u2019s license and privilege to drive were already revoked.\u2019 ... Believing that this was an important legal issue ..., we granted the petition. We shall not, however, be able to reach the issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-6\">\u201cSince Brodie\u2019s entire challenge to the administrative decision was based on an issue not raised before the agency, the Circuit Court should have affirmed the administrative decision without reaching the issue.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">Judge Harrell noted an exception to the general rule as to preservation issues in respect to judicial review of administrative agency actions in <em>Engineering Management Services, Inc. v. Maryland State Highway Administration, </em>375 Md. 211, 235, 825 A.2d 966, 980 (2003), when he stated for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-8\">\u201cThe SHA argues, and the Court of Special Appeals agreed, that the issue of the MSBCA\u2019s failure to promulgate rules was not preserved for review as EMS failed to raise the issue during the proceedings before the MSBCA. Judicial review of administrative decisions generally is limited to the issues raised before the agency. We reach this issue, however, not because EMS raised it on appeal, but rather because it is an integral, and thus unavoidable, component of our determination of the properly raised issue of whether the MSBCA\u2019s grant of summary disposition was appropriate in this case.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">Because of the nature of the Circuit Court\u2019s opinion in this case, where he did not separate the issues he was addressing, a resolution of the un-preserved issue by this Court is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">The Circuit Court, in respect to the second issue presented by the Petitioner, opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-6\">\u201cIt was apparent from the transcript of the June 28, 2004, hearing that the ALJ did not give proper consideration to Petitioner\u2019s employment as an insurance adjuster for the past twenty-three years, to the fact that his prior alcohol offense was eight years ago, or that ignition interlock was an available option on his personal vehicle. What is most significant, however, is that the Administrative Law Judge considered the result of Petitioner\u2019s preliminary breath test which is prohibited....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-7\">\u201cTherefore, after a thorough review of the record in this matter, the Court finds that the decision of the Administrative Law Judge is not supported by competent, material and substantial evidence and is, therefore, arbitrary and capricious.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">Part of the evidence before the Administrative Law Judge and before the Circuit Court was the results of the preliminary breath test. While normally we do not, and circuit courts should not, consider issues not preserved, in this case the Circuit Court specifically based its opinion on the lack of substantial evidence only after specifically ruling that some of the material evidence presented should not have been admitted before the agency. At the least, it is difficult to separate the ruling of the trial judge, from its subsequent finding that the evidence was not sufficiently substantial. Under these particular circumstances, especially the language of the Circuit Court\u2019s opinion, it appears that the evidentiary issue was integral to the trial court\u2019s ruling, and, thus, it may be a necessary component integral to our holding arising out of that particular opinion. We shall thus address that ruling. It was wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">We additionally note that addressing this issue does not work to the disadvantage of the party raising the issue before us, as the decision of the Circuit Court will be reversed and the determination by the agency upheld. Neither does it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>prejudice the Respondent in that he was not entitled to raise the issue in the first instance before the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">As we previously stated in <em>Motor Vehicle Administration v. Jones, </em>380 Md. 164, 172-73, 844 A.2d 388, 393 (2004):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-7\">\u201cSection 16-205.1 of the Transportation Article, commonly known as Maryland\u2019s Implied Consent Law, provides the statutory structure for the suspension of a suspected drunk motorist\u2019s driving privileges where that driver refuses to submit to a chemical breath test for intoxication.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] Section 16-205.1(a)(2) states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-8\">\u2018(2) Any person who drives or attempts to drive a motor vehicle on a highway or on any private property that is used by the public in general in this State is deemed to have consented, subject to the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 10-302 through 10-309, inclusive, of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, to take a test if the person should be detained on suspicion of driving or attempting to drive while under the influence of alcohol, while impaired by alcohol, while so far impaired by any drug, any combination of drugs, or a combination of one or more drugs and alcohol that the person could not drive a vehicle safely, while impaired by a controlled dangerous substance, in violation of an alcohol restriction, or in violation of \u00a7 16-813 of this title.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-9\">Pursuant to \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(l) of the Transportation Article, an officer detaining a suspected drunk driver must advise the suspect of certain rights enumerated in that subsection and may not compel that suspect to take a chemical breath test. Section 16-205.1(b) further discusses the exact procedures an officer must follow if the officer has reasonable grounds to suspect the driver is under the influence of alcohol or drugs, including detaining the suspect, requesting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>a chemical breath and/or blood test and advising the suspect of administrative sanctions for refusal to take a requested test. If, as occurred in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the suspect refuses to take the chemical breath test after being properly advised, \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(3) directs the officer to confiscate the suspect\u2019s driver\u2019s license, serve an order of suspension, issue a temporary license and inform the suspect of the suspect\u2019s right to a hearing and of the possible administrative sanctions.\u201d (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">Section 16-205.2 of the Transportation Article, titled \u201cPreliminary breath test,\u201d governs when a PBT can be administered and, as applicable to the case <em>sub judice, </em>how the results of a PBT are to be used. Section 16-205.2(c) is particularly relevant, providing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-5\">\u201c(c) <em>Use of results of test. </em>\u2014 The <em>results of the preliminary breath test shall be used as a guide for the police officer in deciding whether an arrest should be made and may not be used, as evidence by the State in any court action. The results of the preliminary breath test may be used as evidence by a defendant in a court action. The taking of or refusal to submit to a preliminary breath test is not admissible in evidence in any court action. Any evidence pertaining to a preliminary breath test may not be used in a civil action.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">The first issue in the case <em>sub judice </em>is whether a PBT is admissible in an administrative hearing in light of the restriction contained in \u00a7 16-205.2(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">A. An Administrative Hearing is Neither a \u201cCourt Action\u201d Nor a \u201cCivil Action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">The central question is whether an administrative hearing is a \u201ccourt action\u201d or a \u201ccivil action.\u201d The Circuit Court found that \u00a7 16-205.2(c) applied to the administrative hearing and, therefore, the ALJ should not have considered the results of the respondent\u2019s PBT. This was an erroneous interpretation of \u00a7 16-205.2(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>We look to the well-settled canons of statutory interpretation in aid of reaching our holding. As we stated in <em>Jones, </em>380 Md. at 175, 844 A.2d at 394-95:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-4\">\u201cIt has long been settled by this Court that \u2018the cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the legislature.\u2019 <em>Holbrook v. State, </em>364 Md. 354, 364, 772 A.2d 1240, 1245-46 (2001) (quoting <em>In re Anthony R, </em>362 Md. 51, 57, 763 A.2d 136, 139 (2000) (internal citation omitted)). First and foremost, a court should thoroughly examine the plain language of the statute when attempting to ascertain the Legislature\u2019s intentions. <em>Holbrook, </em>364 Md. at 364, 772 A.2d at 1246; <em>In re Anthony R, </em>362 Md. at 57, 763 A.2d at 139. If the statutory language in question is unambiguous when construed according to its ordinary and everyday meaning, then this Court \u2018will give effect to the statute as it is written.\u2019 <em>Pak v. Hoang, </em>378 Md. 315, 323, 835 A.2d 1185, 1189 (2003) (quoting <em>Moore v. Miley, 372 </em>Md. 663, 677, 814 A.2d 557, 566 (2003) (internal citation omitted)). This Court, however, will not add or delete words from the statute. <em>Gillespie v. State, </em>370 Md. 219, 222, 804 A.2d 426, 427 (2002). We will look \u2018beyond the statute\u2019s plain language in discerning the legislative intent\u2019 only where the statutory language is ambiguous. <em>Comptroller of the Treasury v. Clyde\u2019s of Chevy Chase, Inc., </em>377 Md. 471, 483, 833 A.2d 1014, 1021 (2003).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">The Administration argues that the plain language of \u00a7 16-205.2(c) is clear and does not prohibit a PBT from being admitted into evidence at a \u00a7 16-205.1 administrative hearing. Section 16-205.2(c) only prohibits a PBT from being admitted into evidence in three instances: (1) \u201c[t]he results of the [PBT] ... may not be used as evidence by the State in any <em>court action,\u201d </em>(2) \u201c[t]he taking of or refusal to submit to a[PBT] is not admissible in evidence in any <em>court action,\u201d </em>and (3) \u201c[a]ny evidence pertaining to a preliminary breath test may not be used in a <em>civil action.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">It is the Administration\u2019s contention that a \u00a7 16-205.1 administrative hearing is not a court action. The Administration argues that \u00a7 1-101 (c) of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>Article defines a court as \u201cthe Court of Appeals, Court of Special Appeals, circuit court, and District Court of Maryland, or any of them, unless the context clearly requires a contrary meaning. It does not include an orphans\u2019 court, or the Maryland Tax Court.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As the Office of Administrative Hearings is not included in this definition, it cannot, according to petitioner, be considered a court in which a \u201ccourt action\u201d could take place.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">Respondent argues that, while \u00a7 l-101(c) of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article defines what a court is, it does not specifically define what a \u201ccourt action\u201d is and therefore, an administrative hearing before an ALJ can be a \u201ccourt action.\u201d We disagree. Examining the plain language of \u00a7 16-205.2(c) we find the term \u201ccourt action,\u201d as used, to be clear and unambiguous. A court is defined as \u201c[a] governmental body consisting of one or more judges who sit to adjudicate disputes and administer justice.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 378 (8th ed.2004). The General Assembly specifically defines Maryland courts in \u00a7 l-101(c) of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article, as stated above.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> An action is defined as \u201c[a] civil or criminal judicial proceeding.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 31 (8th ed.2004). Thus, a \u201ccourt action\u201d is a proceeding in the Court of Appeals, the Court of Special Appeals, Circuit Court for a county or Baltimore City, District Court of Maryland or an Orphans\u2019 Court. An administrative hearing before an ALJ, pursuant to \u00a7 16-205.1, or any hearing before an administrative agency does not fall within this field. Such a hearing, pursuant to \u00a7 16-205.1, does not take place in one of Maryland\u2019s enumerated \u201ccourts.\u201d It is an administrative proceeding and not a \u201ccourt action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>This interpretation is supported in our case law. In <em>Janes v. State, </em>350 Md. 284, 302, 711 A.2d 1319, 1328 (1998), we found that collateral estoppel does not operate in respect to the relationship between criminal prosecutions for drunken driving and driver\u2019s license suspension hearings. This is because \u201c <em>\u00a7 16-205.1-type proceedings do not sufficiently resemble court proceedings, </em>even though the agency acts in a quasi-judicial capacity, to serve as the basis of a constitutional estoppel. They are ordinarily informal in nature, intended to provide minimally necessary due process before temporarily suspending an important privilege____\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). We also stated that \u201cthe General Assembly has made clear through the enactment of \u00a7 16-205.1(0(1) that criminal proceedings under \u00a7 21-902 [also of the Transportation Article] and administrative proceedings under \u00a7 16-205.1 are independent of one another and that findings made in one do not affect the other.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 304, 711 A.2d at 1328; <em>see also Motor Vehicle Admin, v. Richards, </em>356 Md. 356, 377, 739 A.2d 58, 70 (1999) (finding that \u201c[a]ffording licensees the opportunity to invoke the exclusionary rule of the Fourth Amendment in license suspension proceedings would not only interfere with the informal and summary nature of those proceedings but also alter their purposefully limited scope, as prescribed under \u00a7 16-205.1(f)(7)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">The Court of Special Appeals addressed when evidence of a PBT was not admissible in <em>Harmon v. State, </em>147 Md.App. 452, 809 A.2d 696 (2002), where the court considered whether a trial court committed error by admitting into a probation violation evidentiary hearing, evidence of a PBT that was performed on the defendant during his participation in a work-release program. The Court of Special Appeals found the language of \u00a7 16-205.2(c) to be \u201cexceedingly clear.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 468, 809 A.2d at 705. In finding that the trial court committed error by admitting evidence of the PBT, the court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AD8\">\u201cSection 16-205.2 pronounces that a PBT \u2018may <em>not </em>be used as evidence by the State in <em>any </em>court action.\u2019 (Emphasis added). No exceptions are embodied in the text, nor is the mandatory language of the text limited to transportation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>actions. <em>Indeed, the only limitation is that the action must be a court action, which the hearing below surely was. </em>Regardless of its precise nature, it was an evidentiary court proceeding with significant consequences to appellant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-5\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). The evidentiary hearing in <em>Harmon </em>took place in the Circuit Court. It arose out of and was part of a criminal court proceeding. Thus, it was a court action. The hearing in the case <em>sub judice </em>was a \u00a7 16-205.1 administrative hearing in front of an ALJ and was, therefore, not a court action.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">In addition, it is important to note that administrative hearings are distinguishable from court actions and civil actions on the basis of evidentiary standards. As indicated in the case law above, administrative hearings are ordinarily informal in nature. <em>Richards, </em>356 Md. at 377, 739 A.2d at 70; <em>Janes, </em>350 Md. at 302, 711 A.2d at 1328; <em>see also Gorin v. Board of County Com\u2019rs, </em>244 Md. 106, 110, 223 A.2d 237, 239 (1966) (finding that \u201c[wjhile <em>proceedings before an administrative board are informal and the strict rules of evidence do not apply, </em>when the board is functioning in an adversary proceeding, the fundamentals applicable to the decision of adjudicative facts by any tribunal must be preserved\u201d) (emphasis added). Administrative hearings involving State agencies generally are governed by the rules of evidence as outlined in Md.Code (1984, 2004 ReplVol.), \u00a7 10-213 of the State Government Article<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and COMAR 28.02.01.18.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In addition, generally, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>administrative agencies are not bound by technical rules of evidence. <em>Fairchild Hiller Corp. v. Supervisor of Assmts., </em>267 Md. 519, 523, 298 A.2d 148, 150 (1973). The Administration\u2019s administrative procedure concerning evidence specifically spells this out in COMAR 11.11.02.10C, stating that <em>\u201c[t]he administrative law judge or other trier of fact is not bound by the technical rules of evidence.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">It is also respondent\u2019s contention that an administrative hearing is a \u201ccourt action\u201d because an ALJ\u2019s decision can be appealed to the Circuit Court or an appellate court. Such an action is not technically an appeal. It is an original action for judicial review of an administrative agency action and is subject to limited standards of review, as discussed <em>infra </em>in our response to the Administration\u2019s second question. Therefore, respondent\u2019s arguments are further flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Furthermore, an administrative hearing is not a \u201ccivil action.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>defines a \u201ccivil action\u201d the same as it does an \u201caction,\u201d \u201cSee action (4).\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 262 (8th ed.2004). Therefore, a \u201ccivil action\u201d is defined as \u201c[a] civil or criminal judicial proceeding.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 31 (8th ed.2004). This conforms with Maryland Rule 2-101 (a) which states that \u201c[a] civil action is commenced by filing a complaint with a <em>court.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). As discussed <em>supra, </em>a \u00a7 16-205.1 administrative hearing clearly falls outside the scope of a court action. In fact, pursuant to \u00a7 12-206 of the Transportation Article \u201ca hearing held under the Maryland Vehicle Law shall be conducted in accordance with Title 10, Subtitle 2 of the State Government Article (Administrative Procedure Act \u2014 Contested Cases).\u201d Section 10-203(a)(2) of the State Government Article, titled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>\u201cScope of subtitle,\u201d explicitly states that Subtitle 2 does not apply to \u201cthe Judicial Branch of the State government or an agency of the Judicial Branch.\u201d Additionally, \u00a7 10-202(d) of the State Government Article defines adversarial proceedings before an agency as \u201ccontested cases,\u201d not civil actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">For the above reasons, the Circuit Court erred in ruling that PBT results are inadmissible in administrative hearings. Section 16-205.1 administrative hearings are not court actions or civil actions, thus, PBT results are not prohibited blanketedly as evidence in such hearings by \u00a7 16-205.2(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">B. The Circuit Court Improperly Substituted Its Judgment for that of the Administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">The second issue in the case <em>sub judice </em>is whether the Circuit Court improperly substituted its judgment for that of the Administration when it reversed and vacated the Administration\u2019s decision because it found that the ALJ in the administrative hearing did not properly consider respondent\u2019s employment as an insurance adjuster and the fact that it had been eight years since his prior test refusal. We hold that the Circuit Court failed to apply the appropriate standard of review to the administrative agency\u2019s decision and thus, improperly substituted its judgment for that of the Administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">Judicial review of an administrative agency\u2019s decision is authorized by Md.Code (1984, 2004 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10-222 of the State Government Article. Under \u00a7 10-222(h), when exercising such review, the court may:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-9\">\u201c(1) remand the case for further proceedings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-10\">(2) affirm the final decision; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-11\">(3) reverse or modify the decision if any substantial right of the petitioner may have been prejudiced because a finding, conclusion, or decision:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-12\">(i) is unconstitutional;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-13\">(ii) exceeds the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the final decision maker;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-14\">(iii) results from an unlawful procedure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>(iv) is affected by any other error of law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-5\">(v) is unsupported by competent, material, and substantial evidence in light of the entire record as submitted; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-6\">(vi) is arbitrary or capricious.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">The Circuit Court in the case <em>sub judice </em>found that the decision of the ALJ was not supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence and therefore was arbitrary and capricious. Pursuant to \u00a7 10-222(h)(3)(v) of the State Government Article the Circuit Court reversed and vacated the decision of the ALJ. The Administration argues that the Circuit Court improperly substituted its judgment for that of the ALJ and, consequently, applied the wrong standard of review to the ALJ\u2019s decision. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">\u201cOur review of the agency\u2019s factual finding entails only an appraisal and evaluation of the agency\u2019s factfinding and not an independent decision on the evidence.\u201d <em>Catonsville Nursing Home, Inc. v.

I have considered the request for the interlock device....\u201d </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Pursuant to \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(l)(i)(2)(B) and (n)(3) and (4) there are only two options for the Administration when faced with a licensed individual who has refused to take a chemical breath test for a second time: (1) suspend the driver\u2019s license for one year, or (2) modify a suspension or issue a restrictive license to a licensee who participates in the Ignition Interlock System Program as outlined under \u00a7 16-404.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">The ALJ used her discretion and decided that suspension was the appropriate sanction in this case. There is substantial evidence in the record to support this decision. This was respondent\u2019s second refusal, he had admitted to drinking six beers before driving, his PBT indicated a high alcohol level at the time of his arrest, and the alcohol treatment report he submitted to the ALJ failed to mention his prior drinking and driving incident. It is clear that a \u201creasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached.\u201d <em>Bulluck, </em>283 Md. at 512, 390 A.2d at 1123 (quoting <em>Dickinson-Tidewater v. Supervisor, </em>273 Md. 245, 256, 329 A.2d 18, 25 (1974)). The ALJ\u2019s imposition of a one-year suspension of the respondent\u2019s driving license based upon the facts in the record is one of two options available and it is within the discretion of the ALJ as to which option is appropriate. <em>See Motor Vehicle Admin, v. Lindsay, </em>309 Md. 557, 564, 525 A.2d 1051, 1054 (1987) (where \u201c[t]he hearing officer decided to exercise the discretion allowed by \u00a7 16-405(a) [of the Transportation Article] and suspend [the driver\u2019s] license for a relatively brief period\u201d). It is evident from the record that the decision of the ALJ is supported by competent and substantial evidence and is, therefore, not arbitrary and capricious. There is absolutely no indication in the record of the matter at bar that the ALJ acted illegally, or in an arbitrary, capricious, oppressive or fraudulent manner. Thus, it was well within the ALJ\u2019s discretion to impose the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>sanction of a one-year suspension of Maryland driving privileges upon respondent and by reversing and vacating the Agency\u2019s decision the Circuit Court improperly substituted its own judgment for that of the administrative agency \u2014 the AL J.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">In reversing the decision of the Circuit Court for Carroll County, we find that the Circuit Court was incorrect in its interpretation of \u00a7 16-205.2(c) of the Transportation Article and that the Circuit Court improperly substituted its judgment for that of the ALJ when it reversed and vacated the agency\u2019s decision. For the reasons stated herein, we reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court for Carroll County.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR CARROLL COUNTY REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR ENTRY OF JUDGMENT AFFIRMING THE AGENCY DETERMINATION; COSTS TO BE PAID BY RESPONDENT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b168-7\">.
