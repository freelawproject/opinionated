Woodall, Daniel Falcone, and Earl F. Cox, Jr. All are, or were,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> inmates serving sentences in the Division of Correction (\u201cDOC\u201d). In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>his respective grievance, each inmate alleged that amendments to the Code of Maryland Regulations (\u201cCOMAR\u201d) adopted by the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services (\u201cthe Department\u201d) were <em>ex post facto </em>laws, in violation of the United States Constitution and Article 17 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. The regulations concerned \u201cspecial project\u201d diminution of confinement credits that were awarded to inmates lor being double celled.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">The dismissed grievances were each appealed to the respective circuit courts in the counties in which the inmates were confined<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and all of the dismissals were affirmed. Each respondent filed an application for leave to appeal the decisions to the Court of Special Appeals. The intermediate appellate court, in a reported opinion,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> granted each respective application and consolidated the matters, ultimately reversing the circuit courts and remanding with instructions to reverse the Secretary and order further proceedings. <em>Demby, supra, v. Secretary, Dep\u2019t of Pub. Safety and Corr. Servs., </em>163 Md.App. 47, 877 A.2d 187 (2005). We subsequently granted the petition for writ of certiorari filed by the Secretary of Public Safety and Correctional Services (\u201cthe Secretary\u201d) and the cross-petition for writ of certiorari filed by respondents.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Secretary of Corr. v. Demby, </em>388 Md. 97, 879 A.2d 42 (2005). The Secretary presented two issues for our review, which we have recast as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>1. Are the amendments to former COMAR 12.02.06.05N(2) (now COMAR 12.02.06.04F(1)) \u201claws\u201d and thus subject to the prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws by the Federal and Maryland Constitutions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-5\">2. If the amendments constitute laws within this context, do they violate the <em>ex post facto </em>prohibitions?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Respondents raise three issues. Two of the respondents\u2019 issues are encompassed in our rephrased questions above; respondents\u2019 additional question is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-7\">1. Did the Secretary waive her principal argument here by not raising that argument in the circuit courts?<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">For -the reasons stated below, we conclude that the Secretary\u2019s amendments are laws within the meaning of <em>ex post facto </em>clause and that those amendments violate the prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws under the Federal and Maryland Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b634-10\">In his application for leave to appeal, Mr. Demby admits that the Agency record is \u201cmeager\u201d and proffers the following regarding his underlying charges and sentence: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>Mr. Demby initiated his case by filing an administrative remedy procedure complaint (\u201cARP\u201d)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that was received on May 15, 2002. Mr. Demby\u2019s complaint was reviewed by the warden and dismissed on June 10, 2002. An administrative appeal of this decision was received by the Commissioner of Correction (the \u201cCommissioner\u201d) on June 20, 2002, and was dismissed by Assistant Commissioner of Correction on July 17, 2002. Mr. Demby\u2019s timely complaint was received by the IGO on August 13, 2002. The substance of Mr. Demby\u2019s IGO complaint was that his eligibility to earn special housing credits for double celling was terminated by the amendments to COMAR 12.02.06.05N, and that this violated the <em>ex post facto </em>clause. Mr. Demby\u2019s complaint was dismissed by the IGO on October 4, 2003.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>[Mr. Demby] is serving a term of confinement as a result of a sentence imposed on April 8, 1999[,] by the Circuit Court for Harford County as follows: No. 99C0042 Count 1\u2014 assault [2nd] degree, 10 years from 2/21/99; No. 98C1286 Count 1 \u2014 distribution of a non-controlled substance, 2 years consecutive to No. 99C0042. The result is a term that expires on February 21, 2011.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>Mr. Demby\u2019s petition for judicial review was heard on May .16, 2003, in the Circuit Court for Somerset County. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>court affirmed the decision of the IGO, finding that the Secretary and Commissioner have the authority to abolish, revoke, or revise the eligibility standards for double-celling credits. The Circuit Court also found that the <em>ex post facto </em>clause did not apply to Mr. Demb/s case. On June 12, 2003, Mr. Demby filed for leave to appeal from the decision of the Circuit Court for Somerset County.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">The procedural histories of respondents, Messrs. Baltimore, Woodall, Falcone, and Cox are similar to that of Mr. Demby. Previously, all respondents had been eligible for special project credits for double celling, but were precluded from such credits as a result of the January 1, 2002, amendment to COMAR 12.02.06.05 (\u201cthe amendments\u201d). Mr. Dem-by was serving a term of confinement for both qualifying and disqualifying sentences, and was informed on May 15, 2002, in response to his ARP, that, as a result of the amendment, he would no longer be eligible for special project credits because his sentence included a disqualifying offense. Mr. Woodall is serving a term of confinement for both qualifying and disqualifying sentences. Subsequently, in response to his ARP, the DOC informed Mr. Woodall that as of January 1, 2002, he was no longer eligible for special project credits for housing because his charge for kidnapping was included as a disqualifying offense per the amendment. Similarly, Mr. Falcone\u2019s term of confinement consists of a sentence for robbery with a deadly weapon, a qualifying offense, and a consecutive sentence for carjacking, a disqualifying offense. The carjacking sentence precluded Mr. Falcone from receiving special project credits for housing after the amendment. Mr. Cox was serving a sentence for assault, a qualifying offense, and for use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence, which always has been a disqualifying offense. On April 20, 2000, Mr. Cox\u2019s handgun sentence ended, beginning his eligibility for double-celling credits. While the record is unclear as to the specific crimes respondents committed, we note that all respondents were serving terms of confinement that included at least one sentence that made them eligible to receive special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>project housing credits for double celling prior to the amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">The respondents who remain incarcerated provided the following updated information on their current situations in their brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-5\">Based on information provided to counsel by the DOC, the projected mandatory release date for Respondent Kenneth E. Woodall, currently incarcerated in Maryland Correctional Institution in Hagerstown, is May 13, 2010 (as of June 30, 2005). The projected release date for Respondent Daniel Falcone, currently incarcerated at the Maryland Correctional Training Center, also in Hagerstown, is October 11, 2008 (as of July 31, 2005).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">The dismissals of the respondents\u2019 grievances were affirmed by the Circuit Courts for Somerset and Washington Counties. After granting respondents\u2019 petitions for leave to appeal, the Court of Special Appeals held that the COMAR amendments were laws for <em>ex post facto </em>purposes, \u201cby virtue of the legislative discretion granted to the Secretary and the Commissioner pursuant to Corr. Serv. \u00a7 3-707.\u201d <em>Demby, supra, </em>163 Md.App. at 67-68, 877 A.2d at 199. Further, the intermediate appellate court held that the amendments violated the <em>ex post facto </em>prohibition because the \u201capplication of current COMAR \u00a7 12.02.06.04F ... alters [respondents\u2019] punishments by increasing the lengths of their sentences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 64, 877 A.2d at 197. In its reversal of the opinions of the respective circuit courts and the decisions of the Secretary, the Court of Special Appeals noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-7\">With this opinion, we do not suggest that once doublecelling credits are established they must remain unchanged and available to all inmates in perpetuity. Clearly, current COMAR \u00a7 12.02.06.04F may lawfully be applied to inmates who committed their offenses after it took effect. Nor do we suggest that an inmate who is serving a sentence for an offense that is eligible for double-celling credits may not be removed to a single cell in accordance with DOC policies and regulations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>We hold only that an inmate serving a term of confinement for an offense committed prior to January 1, 2002(i) may not be denied double-celling credits, for periods of time during which he or she was or is serving only an eligible sentence, for the sole reason that another sentence in his or her term of confinement is ineligible, and (ii) may not be denied double-celling credits on sentences for offenses that were eligible under the former regulation but are ineligible under the current regulation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 68, 877 A.2d at 199-200 (footnote omitted).

State, </em>140 Md.App. 445, 780 A.2d 1199 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">Ramarro Smith was an inmate in DOC custody at the time the Court of Special Appeals rendered its decision. He was denied \u201cspecial project\u201d credits that he allegedly had earned through double celling during his incarceration. <em>Smith, </em>140 Md.App. 445, 448-49, 780 A.2d 1199, 1201. The Circuit Court for Baltimore City denied Smith\u2019s petition for writ of habeas corpus, and the Court of Special Appeals granted his application for leave to appeal. <em>Smith, </em>140 Md.App. at 448-49, 780 A.2d at 1201-1202. Smith was sentenced to thirty-years incarceration for second-degree murder, and his sentence began on June 10, 1977. <em>Smith </em>140 Md.App. at 449, 780 A.2d at 1202. Smith was paroled on January 5, 1989, and, subsequently, the Maryland Parole Commission issued a parole violation warrant as a result of a reasonable belief that Smith had violated parole. <em>Id. </em>Smith\u2019s parole was revoked, and the parole commissioner awarded him 273 of the 373 days he had been on parole as \u201cstreet time credit.\u201d <em>See </em>Md.Code 1999, \u00a7 7-401(d)(l) of the Correctional Services Article. Smith returned to the DOC and his maximum term of confinement date was recalculated. <em>Id. </em>at 450, 780 A.2d at 1202. After his return to the DOC, Smith was convicted for a robbery that he committed while on parole and was sentenced to a five-year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>term consecutive to his murder sentence. <em>Id. </em>The DOC refused to give Smith special project credits for double celling. <em>Id. </em>Smith argued that the hearing court erred in failing to award him special project credits for double celling which accrued during his robbery sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 451, 780 A.2d at 1203. The DOC responded that the fact that Smith was serving a term of confinement for a murder sentence precluded his earning double-celling credits under the regulations. <em>Id. </em>at 452, 780 A.2d at 1203. In support of its position, the DOC cited \u00a7 3-702 of the Correctional Services Article which provides for an entitlement to diminution of confinement credits as a result of an inmate\u2019s \u201cterm of confinement\u201d rather than \u201csentence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">The Court of Special Appeals held in <em>Smith, inter alia, </em>that precedent supported the contention that the intermediate appellate court had already considered and \u201crejected attempts to narrow eligibility for diminution credits by using the \u2018term of confinement\u2019 concept to deny an inmate credits against a sentence that is eligible for them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 460, 1208. Pursuant to the rule that governs good conduct credits, the intermediate appellate court ultimately held that, \u201cwhen an inmate\u2019s term of confinement includes both a sentence that is not eligible for the special project credits in question and a consecutive sentence that is eligible for those credits, the two sentences must be considered separately, so that the inmate may reduce his or her term of confinement by earning special project credits against the eligible sentence.\u201d 140 Md.App. at 461, 780 A.2d at 1209. In addressing the DOC\u2019s argument that application of good conduct credits and special project credits should be distinguished, the Court of Special Appeals stated: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>ment. The DOC established double celling as a special project under the authority of section 3-707. Once the special program was created and defined in accordance with section 3-707, it became a legislatively created benefit, albeit one accomplished through the Secretary and Commissioner. Exercising the discretionary authority given by the legislature, the Secretary and Commissioner selected eligibility standards for earning double-celling credits, and then promulgated a regulation adopting those standards in order to confer the benefit of double-celling credits on inmates. At that point DOC was bound by its regulation. <em>See Hopkins, </em>40 Md.App. at 336, 391 A.2d 1213.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>The fact that special project credits are legislatively authorized, but not mandated, does not justify the DOC\u2019s denial of special project credits. We think the DOC has missed the broader lesson of these \u201cgood conduct\u201d cases\u2014 that diminution credits, once they are created, should be earned and calculated against the eligible sentence of an inmate rather than against his or her entire term of confine-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>The DOC is now obligated to honor and follow the regulation as it is written. If an inmate serving an eligible sentence qualifies for double-celling credits, then the inmate may not be denied those credits. The DOC may not enact the regulation and then ignore an inmate who falls within its ambit. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 336-37, 780 A.2d 1199, 40 Md.App. 329, 391 A.2d 1213 (reversing order sentencing inmate to isolated confinement, because DOC violated its own rules governing such sentencing, which \u201cconfer[red] important procedural benefits and safeguards\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">We are not persuaded otherwise by language in subsection (7) of the DOC regulation that \u201c[t]his regulation may not be interpreted, understood, or construed to mean that an inmate who is eligible to receive the credits described in it has a right to these credits or that an inmate will continue to receive these credits in the future.\u201d COMAR 12.10.06.05N(7). We do not read this language as reserving unlimited authority in the DOC. As we have discussed, the DOC does not have complete discretion to deny doublecelling credits to inmates who clearly meet the eligibility standards in the regulation. Accordingly, we shall not construe this language as an attempt to confer on the DOC impermissible authority to exercise its power and discretion in an arbitrary manner that conflicts with its own regulation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>Instead, we view this language as a forthright reminder that the Secretary and Commissioner have authority to abolish, to revoke, or to revise the eligibility standards for double-celling credits.

U.S. Parole Comm\u2019n, </em>802 F.2d 948, 953-54 (7th Cir.1986) (citations omitted). Petitioner argues that the COMAR amendments were not laws for the purposes of the <em>ex post facto </em>Clause because the amendments were interpretive in nature, and were merely a result of a change in policy by the Secretary and the Commissioner as to how double-celling credits should be awarded and as to which inmates should be eligible to receive such credits. Petitioner relies upon our decision in <em>Watkins v. Secretary Dept. of Public Safety and Correctional Servs., </em>377 Md. 34, 831 A.2d 1079 (2003), and analogizes the arguments of the respondents in the instant case to those of the inmates in <em>Watkins.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>In <em>Watkins, </em>the focus of our <em>ex post facto </em>analysis was not \u201cspecial project\u201d credits, but DOC directives that affected security classification, work release, and family leave. With regard to security classification, the DOC maintained a subjective policy that based transfers to minimum security and prerelease on a discretionary assessment by the DOC classification team. <em>Watkins, supra, </em>377 Md. at 37, 831 A.2d at 1081. While changes in the policy occurred, the general policy of the DOC \u201cdid not exclude all inmates serving life sentences from the pre-release system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The DOC formally changed its policy on December 1, 1994, and declared that \u201cno inmates sentenced to life imprisonment could be transferred below medium security.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 38, 831 A.2d at 1081. Subsequently, in June 1995, the DOC issued DOC directive (\u201cDCD\u201d) 100-005 which stated that \u201c[ijnmates serving life sentences shall be initially classified at no less than maximum security and shall not be reclassified below medium security.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing DCD 100-005.II.N.l.b). The DOC also included security classification limits on inmates serving a term of confinement for rape or sex offenses, stating that those offenders \u201cshall not be reduced below medium security unless approved for a delayed parole release contingent upon a transfer to lesser security ... or unless within one year of a mandatory supervision release date or maximum expiration release date.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">On June 2,1993, after an inmate who had been serving a life sentence murdered his girlfriend while on work release, the Commissioner suspended all work release privileges of inmates serving life sentences. DCD 100-508 was subsequently amended, making all inmates serving life sentences \u201cineligible for work release.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 39, 831 A.2d at 1082. The final amended DCD involved family leave. Prior to the Commissioner\u2019s amendment, \u00a7 3-811 of the Correctional Services Article granted authority to the Commissioner to allow an inmate to visit his family for a reasonable time if the inmate was (1) confined to a DOC correctional facility; (2) classified to be in pre-release status; and (3) recommended by the correctional facility\u2019s case management team and managing official. <em>Id. </em>(citing Md.Code (1999) \u00a7 3-811 of the Correction<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>al Services Article). On June 2, 1993, the Commissioner declared that all life-sentenced inmates were ineligible for family leave. <em>Id. </em>DCD 100-543 followed, stating that \u201c[i]n-mates serving life sentences, including life with all but a portion suspended, and inmates under a sentence of death are not eligible for family leave consideration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 40, 831 A.2d at 1082.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">The inmates each appealed from their denials of relief issued in their respective circuit courts. <em>Watkins, supra, </em>377 Md. at 45, 831 A.2d at 1085. The Court of Special Appeals consolidated the inmates\u2019 appeals and this Court issued a writ of certiorari prior to any proceedings in the intermediate appellate court. <em>Id. </em>The issue decided by this Court was whether, as applied to the inmates, the DCDs at issue violated the Constitutional prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws. <em>Id., </em>831 A.2d at 1085-86. We ultimately determined that the DCDs at issue did not violate the <em>ex post facto </em>clause \u201cbecause they [were] not \u2018laws\u2019 within the meaning of the United States Constitution or Maryland Declaration of Rights. Rather, the DCDs were guidelines promulgated as an exercise of the discretion of the Commissioner of Correction who has authority to modify them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 45, 831 A.2d at 1086. The inmates in <em>Watkins </em>argued that the DCDs at issue constituted \u201claws\u201d for the purposes of the <em>ex post facto </em>prohibition because they were \u201c \u2018legislative rules\u2019 [that prevent] the staff of the DOC from exercising any discretion over assigning a lesser security classification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 46, 831 A.2d at 1086. The inmates further argued that the DCDs enhanced the punishments for their crimes by changing the parole eligibility rules after the date of the offenses committed by the inmates. <em>Id. </em>at 47, 831 A.2d at 1086-87. The Secretary in <em>Watkins </em>countered by asserting that the DCDs merely annunciated the manner in which the Commissioner intended to exercise his discretion concerning security classifications. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">In our discussion, we relied upon <em>Gluckstern v.

The inmate who brought the claim in <em>Gluckstem </em>began serving a life sentence at Patuxent when the Institutional Board of Review of the Patuxent Institution \u2018retained exclusive control to parole a Patuxent inmate.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gluckstem, supra, 319 Md, </em>at 642, 574 A.2d at 901. The General Assembly subsequently enacted a statute that required the Governor to approve parole for all inmates serving life sentences. <em>Id. </em>at 643, 574 A.2d at 902. We concluded that the retroactive application of that statute, which modified the inmate\u2019s parole eligibility, \u201c \u2018substantially alter fed] the consequences attached to a crime already completed and therefore changefd] the quantum of punishment.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 668, 574 A.2d at 914 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">We distinguished <em>Gluckstem </em>from those federal cases that held that the <em>ex post facto </em>prohibition did not apply to changes by the United States Parole Commission to its own discretionary guidelines for granting parole, because the federal opinions dealt with guidelines that did not have \u201c \u2018the force and effect of law\u2019 but are merely \u2018policies] ... that show how agency discretion is likely to be exercised.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 672, 574 A.2d at 916 (citations omitted). Because the Parole Commission could choose not to follow the guidelines in a prisoner\u2019s case, as statements of discretionary administrative policy, we found that they did not affect a prisoner\u2019s punishment \u201ceither actually or potentially.\u201d <em>Watkins, supra, </em>377 Md. at 49, 831 A.2d at 1088 (citing <em>Gluckstern, supra, </em>319 Md. at 672, 574 A.2d at 916) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Judge Battaglia, 'writing for this Court in <em>Watkins, </em>found our emphasis on the distinction between discretionary and non-discretionary administrative policy directives in <em>Lomax v. Warden, Md. Corr. Training Ctr., </em>356 Md. 569, 741 A.2d 476 (1999), to be notable. In <em>Lomax, </em>the petitioner filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in response to the Governor\u2019s announcement in 1995 that he would not approve parole for any inmates sentenced to life in prison unless they were very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>old or terminally ill, and that he had instructed the Parole Commission not to bother recommending murderers and rapists to him for parole. 356 Md. at 573, 741 A.2d at 478. Having been convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison, Lomax argued that the Governor\u2019s statement effectively changed his sentence to life without the possibility of parole. <em>Id. </em>With regard to the effect of the Governor\u2019s statement, we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-5\">If the General Assembly in 1995 had enacted a statute restricting the Governor\u2019s discretion to approve the parole of inmates serving life sentences, and providing that the Governor could only approve the parole of those beyond a certain age or who were terminally ill, the holding in <em>Gluckstem </em>would preclude the application of the statute to Lomax. No such statute or regulation, however, has been enacted. The Governor today has the same discretionary authority under the law regarding the parole of persons in Lomax\u2019s position as a Governor had in 1969 or 1967.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 577, 741 A.2d at 480.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-7\">We recognized that, although in the context of the <em>ex post facto </em>clause, the \u201cconcept of a \u2018law\u2019... is broader than a statute enacted by a legislative body, and may include some administrative regulations,\u201d it does not encompass \u201c \u2018guidelines assisting [a government agency] in the exercise of its discretion.\u2019\u201d Therefore, whether an administrative provision qualifies as a \u201claw\u201d for <em>ex post facto </em>purposes depends in large part on the manner and extent that it limits an agency\u2019s discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-8\"><em>Watkins, </em>377 Md. at 49, 831 A.2d at 1088 (citations omitted). If the provision \u201cdo[es] not have the force and effect of law\u201d but simply announces how an agency is likely to exercise its discretion, \u201cthe <em>ex post facto </em>clause does not apply.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">In <em>Watkins </em>we found \u201cno meaningful difference between the promulgation of the DCDs at issue in that case and the Governor\u2019s statement in <em>Lomax,\u201d </em>and we noted that the Commissioner\u2019s authority to establish policies that govern the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>inmates in her custody is similar to the Governor\u2019s authority to exercise discretion over parole decisions. <em>Id. </em>at 50, 831 A.2d 1079, 881 A.2d at 1088-89. Our decision in that case turned on the extent of the Commissioner\u2019s discretion. Acknowledging that certain administrative rules may be considered \u201claw\u201d in the <em>ex post facto </em>context, we reiterated that such rules are not subject to the prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>prohibition if the rules merely serve as \u201c \u2018guides ... that may be discarded where circumstances require.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 52, 831 A.2d at 1090 (citing <em>Lomax, supra, </em>356 Md. at 576, 741 A.2d at 480). In our consideration of the Commissioner\u2019s discretion in <em>Watkins, </em>we noted that the Commissioner has discretion to establish policy guidelines regarding security classifications \u201cwithout legislative ratification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As such, we held that the Commissioner, in the context of carrying out his or her policies on security classifications, inmate ineligibility for work release, and family leave, \u201cunilaterally, may adopt or discard whatever DCDs he or she deems appropriate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 53, 831 A.2d at 1090. Thus, we held that the DCDs in <em>Watkins </em>did not violate the <em>ex post facto </em>prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">The intermediate appellate court in the present case addressed the impact of <em>Watkins. </em>It said: \u201cThe [Court of Appeals] by no means implied in <em>Watkins, </em>however, that the Legislature has given the Commissioner discretion to make a prisoner\u2019s punishment more burdensome than it was at the time the offense was committed.\u201d <em>Demby, supra, </em>163 Md.App. at 64, 877 A.2d at 197. The Court of Special Appeals also acknowledged that its opinion in <em>Smith, supra, </em>did not quantify the special projects credits for double celling as a law, but did note that it was established under the authority of \u00a7 3-707 of the Correctional Services Article and \u201c[o]nce the special program was created and defined in accordance with section 3-707, it became a legislatively-created benefit, albeit one accomplished through the Secretary and Commissioner.\u201d <em>Demby, supra, </em>163 Md.App. at 62-63, 877 A.2d at 196 (quoting <em>Smith, supra, </em>140 Md.App. at 461, 780 A.2d at 1199).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Primarily, Petitioner argues that, similar to the directives upheld in <em>Watkins, </em>the Secretary and Commissioner\u2019s current <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>policies regarding the eligibility criteria for double celling can be revised at any time and are thus not laws for the purposes of the <em>ex post facto </em>prohibition. The clear distinction between <em>Watkins </em>and the instant case is the method in which the regulations are submitted and approved. Petitioner, citing a case from the Ninth Circuit, contends that the promulgation of the regulations at issue through the notice and comment rule making procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act, Md. Code (1984, 2004 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 10-101 <em>et seq. </em>of the State Government Article, does not transform them into laws for the purposes of the <em>ex post facto </em>prohibition. Unlike the purely verbal expression of policy intent by the Governor in <em>Lomax, </em>the Secretary\u2019s amendments in this case were submitted as emergency regulations pursuant to Md.Code (1984, 2004 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 10-111(b) and were published in the Maryland Register, subject to public comment, and committee approval. Similarly, the amendments are distinct from the DCDs in <em>Watkins, </em>as DCDs are not submitted pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act. <em>See Demby, supra, </em>163 Md.App. at 63 n. 10, 877 A.2d at 196 n. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">In the determination of whether the amendments in the present case are laws for the purposes of the <em>ex post facto </em>prohibition, we must focus our analysis on the nature of the amendment. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has noted the relevant factors to consider when determining whether actions of administrative agencies are exempt from scrutiny under the <em>ex post facto </em>clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-6\">\u201cWhen Congress has delegated to an agency the authority to make a rule instead of making the rule itself, the resulting administrative rule is an extension of the statute for purposes of the [C]lause.\u201d <em>Rodriguez v. United States Parole Comm\u2019n, </em>594 F.2d 170, 173 (7th Cir.1979). The reason for applying the Clause to such legislative rules is straightforward: Congress \u201cshould not be allowed to do indirectly what it is forbidden to do directly.\u201d <em>Prater, </em>802 F.2d at 954. But when an agency promulgates an interpretive rule, the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause is inapplicable. \u201c[I]nterpretive rules simply state what the administrative agency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>thinks the statute means, and only \u2018remind\u2019 affected parties of existing duties.\u201d <em>Jerri\u2019s Ceramic Arts, Inc. v. Consumer Product Safety Comm\u2019n, </em>874 F.2d 205, 207 (4th Cir.1989). Unlike legislative rules, which \u201cha[ve] the force of law,\u201d <em>id,., </em>interpretive rules \u201care statements of enforcement policy. They are ... \u2018merely guides, and not laws: guides may be discarded where circumstances require; laws may not.\u2019\u201d <em>Prater, </em>802 F.2d at 954 (quoting <em>Inglese v.

Nonetheless, courts are in general agreement that interpretative rules simply state what the administrative agency thinks the statute means, and only \u201cremind\u201d affected parties of existing duties. <em>Chula Vista City School District v. Bennett, </em>824 F.2d 1573, 1582 (Fed.Cir.1987); <em>Southern California Edison Co. v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, </em>770 F.2d 779, 783 (9th Cir.1985); <em>General Motors Corp. v.

Washington, </em>[301 U.S. 397, 401, 57 S.Ct. 797, 799, 81 L.Ed. 1182 (1937)]; <em>Calder v. Bull, </em>[3 Dall. 386, 390, 1 L.Ed. 648 (1798)]. Contrary to the reasoning of the Supreme Court of Florida, a law need not impair a \u201cvested right\u201d to violate the <em>ex post facto </em>prohibition. Evaluating whether a right has vested is important for claims under the Contracts or Due Process Clauses, which solely protect pre-existing entitlements. <em>See, e.g., Wood v, Lovett, </em>313 U.S. 362, 371, 61 S.Ct. 983, 987, 85 L.Ed. 1404 (1941); <em>Dodge v. Board of Education, </em>302 U.S. 74, 78-79, 58 S.Ct. 98, 100, 82 L.Ed. 57 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>(1937). <em>See also United States Railroad Retirement Board v. Fritz, </em>449 U.S. 166, 174, 101 S.Ct. 453, 459, 66 L.Ed.2d 368 (1980). The presence or absence of an affirmative, enforceable right is not relevant, however, to the <em>ex post facto </em>prohibition, which forbids the imposition of punishment more severe than the punishment assigned by law when the act to be punished occurred. Critical to relief under the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause is not an individual\u2019s right to less punishment, but the lack of fair notice and governmental restraint when the legislature increases punishment beyond what was prescribed when the crime was consummated. Thus, even if a statute merely alters penal provisions accorded by the grace of the legislature, it violates the Clause if it is both retrospective and more onerous than the law in effect on the date of the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">450 U.S. 24, 29-31, 101 S.Ct. 960, 964-65, 67 L.Ed.2d 17 (1981) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">The ambit of punishment, for <em>ex post facto </em>purposes, extends beyond a prison sentence or fine. <em>Anderson, supra, </em>310 Md. at 227-28, 528 A.2d at 909-910. In <em>Lynce v. Mathis, </em>519 U.S. 433, 117 S.Ct. 891, 137 L.Ed.2d 63 (1997), a case involving several Florida statutes that awarded early release credits to inmates when the population of the state prison system exceeded particular levels, the Supreme Court considered whether a 1992 Florida statute canceling said statutes for certain classes of offenders, after they had been awarded, constituted an \u201cincreased punishment,\u201d and thus violated the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause of the Federal Constitution. <em>Lynce, supra, </em>519 U.S. at 435, 117 S.Ct. at 893. Lynce had previously been sentenced to 22 years in prison for attempted murder. <em>Id. </em>He was released in 1992 after accumulating five different types of early release credits, 1,860 days of which were \u201cprovisional credits\u201d given as a result of prison overcrowding. <em>Id. </em>at 435-36, 117 S.Ct. at 893. Subsequent to Lynee\u2019s release, the Florida Attorney General issued an opinion that interpreted a 1992 statute as having canceled all provisional credits awarded to inmates convicted of murder and attempted murder. <em>Id. </em>This interpretation resulted in Lynce\u2019s rearrest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>and return to custody with a new release date set for 1998. <em>Id. </em>Lynce\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus alleged that the retroactive cancellation of his provisional credits violated the <em>ex post facto </em>clause. <em>Id. </em>Lynce\u2019s petition was dismissed as the Magistrate Judge, and then the District Court, found that the sole purpose of the revocation of the provisional credits was to alleviate prison overcrowding. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">The Supreme Court reversed the District Court and Magistrate Judge. The Court cited <em>Weaver v.

The Court cited its holding in <em>Weaver </em>that the retroactive decrease in that case violated the <em>ex post facto </em>clause because it made punishment for crimes committed before its enactment \u201c \u2018more onerous.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 442, 117 S.Ct. at 896 (quoting <em>Weaver, supra, </em>450 U.S. at 36, 101 S.Ct. at 968). The Court noted that the focus of <em>ex post facto </em>analysis should not be on the Legislature\u2019s subjective intent, but instead, on \u201cwhether objectively the new statute \u2018lengthened] the period that someone in petitioner\u2019s position must spend in prison.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id, </em>(quoting <em>Weaver, supra, </em>450 U.S. at 33, 101 S.Ct. at 967).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>In determining the changes in the \u201cquantum of punishment\u201d an individual incurs, the Court in <em>Lynce </em>reiterated its holding in <em>California Dep\u2019t of Corr. v. Morales, </em>514 U.S. 499, 115 S.Ct. 1597, 131 L.Ed.2d 588 (1995). While serving a sentence for his second murder,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Morales became eligible for parole in 1990, and the California Board of Prison Terms (\u201cthe Board\u201d) held a hearing on Morales\u2019s suitability for parole, as required by California law. <em>Id. </em>at 502-503, 115 S.Ct. at 1600. The Board was required by law to set a release date for Morales, unless it found that \u201cthe public safety requires a more lengthy period of incarceration for this individual.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 503, 115 S.Ct. at 1600. (Citation omitted). Morales was found unsuitable for parole for many reasons, \u201cincluding the heinous, atrocious, and cruel nature of his offense; the mutilation of [his second victim] during or after the murder; respondent\u2019s record of violence and assaultive behavior; and respondent\u2019s commission of his second murder while on parole for his first.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(Citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">The law in place at the time Morales murdered Ms. Washabaugh would have entitled Morales to subsequent yearly parole suitability hearings. In 1981, however, the California Legislature authorized the Board to defer such hearings for up to three years \u201cif the prisoner has been convicted of \u2018more than one offense which involves the taking of a life\u2019 and if the Board \u2018finds that it is not reasonable to expect that parole would be granted at a hearing during the following years and states the bases for the finding.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(Citation omitted) (footnote omitted). For the same reasons that it found Morales ineligible for parole, the Board determined that a longer observation period was required for Morales and before a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>parole release date could be projected, and \u201cthe Board determined that it was not reasonable to expect that respondent would be found suitable for parole in 1990 or 1991,\u201d and thus scheduled his next hearing for 1992. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Morales filed a federal habeas corpus petition in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, arguing that the 1981 amendment constituted an <em>ex post facto </em>law. <em>Id. </em>at 504, 115 S.Ct. at 1600. The United States Court of Appeals ultimately concluded that \u201c \u2018any retrospective law making parole hearings less accessible would effectively increase the [prisoner\u2019s] sentence and violate the <em>ex post facto </em>clause,\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Morales v. California Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>16 F.3d 1001, 1004 (9th Cir.1994)), and held that Morales must be provided with the annual parole suitability hearings required by the law in effect when he committed his crime. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court concluded in <em>Morales </em>that the amendment to California\u2019s parole procedures decreasing the frequency of parole hearings for certain offenders did not elicit a change in the overall amount of time the affected offender would serve, and thus constituted a \u201cspeculative and attenuated\u201d possibility of increasing the offender\u2019s punishment, and thus did not implicate the <em>ex post facto </em>clause. <em>Id. </em>at 509, 115 S.Ct. at 1603.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">The Supreme Court in <em>Lynce </em>rejected respondent\u2019s argument that the 1992 statute did not violate the <em>ex post facto </em>clause because, when Lynce entered his guilty plea, he could not have possibly expected to receive overcrowding credits, and because it created an effect similar to that in <em>Morales, </em>of only \u201cthe most speculative and attenuated possibility of producing the prohibited effect of increasing the measure of punishment for covered crimes.\u201d <em>Lynce, supra, </em>519 U.S. at 446, 117 S.Ct. at 898 (citing <em>Morales, supra, </em>514 U.S. at 509, 115 S.Ct. at 1603). In its rejection of this contention, the Court noted that the fact that Lynce\u2019s 1,860 credits, already awarded, were retroactively canceled left little speculation as to what might have happened to him: he was rearrested and subjected to a prolonged imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>at 446-47, 117 S.Ct. at 898. The Court further held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>Unlike the California amendment at issue in <em>Morales, </em>the 1992 Florida statute did more than simply remove a mechanism that created an opportunity for early release for a class of prisoners whose release was unlikely; rather, it made ineligible for early release a class of prisoners who were previously eligible \u2014 including some, like petitioner, who had actually been released.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 447, 117 S.Ct. at 898.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">\n<em>The Instant Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">In our review of the decision of an administrative agency, we consider the agency\u2019s decision pursuant to the \u201csame statutory standards as would the circuit court, and we do not employ those standards to reevaluate the decision of the circuit or intermediate appellate court.\u201d <em>Charles County Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs. v. Vann, </em>382 Md. 286, 294, 855 A.2d 313, 318 (2004). Our role is limited to ascertaining whether there exists substantial evidence in the record as a whole that supports the findings and conclusions of the agency; we must also determine \u201cif the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d <em>United Parcel Serv., Inc. v. People\u2019s Counsel for Baltimore County, </em>336 Md. 569, 577, 650 A.2d 226, 230 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">Here, the amendments in question are clearly retroactive for the purposes of the <em>ex post facto </em>clause as they concern the now ineligible crimes committed prior to the adoption of the amendments. We must then consider whether the amendments impose a punishment on the respondents that is \u201cmore severe than the punishment assigned by law when the act to be punished occurred.\u201d <em>Weaver, supra, </em>450 U.S. at 30, 101 S.Ct. at 965. We conclude that the amendments in the instant case do impose a more severe punishment upon respondents than that which was annexed to their actions on the date their crimes were committed. The respondents, if they continued to be double celled, would have had the opportunity to obtain double-celling special project credits in the future, and thus, decrease the amount of time they would have to serve on their respective sentences, but for the amendments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>which disqualified one of their previously qualifying crimes. Retroactive alteration of regulations that determine an inmate\u2019s eligibility for early release implicates the <em>ex post facto </em>clause because those credits count as \u201c \u2018one determinant of [a] petitioner\u2019s prison term ... and ... [the petitioner\u2019s] effective sentence is altered once this determinant is changed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lynce, supra, </em>519 U.S. at 445, 117 S.Ct. at 898 (quoting <em>Weaver, supra, </em>450 U.S. at 32, 101 S.Ct. at 966). The prison terms of the respondents here were altered by the amendment\u2019s inclusion of their respective crimes in its prohibition of special project credits for that class of inmates.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Further, petitioner attempts to distinguish the present case from <em>Lynce </em>because, unlike the amendments in that case, the DOC in the instant case did not cancel any credits previously earned by respondents. We find this argument unpersuasive. While the amendment in the present case did not revoke credits already given to the respondents, it instead, \u201ccurtailed] the availability of future credits [and] effectively postponed the date when [respondents] would become eligible for early release,\u201d which has been found by the Supreme Court to also constitute an increased punishment in <em>ex post facto </em>terms. <em>Lynce, supra, </em>519 U.S. at 442, 117 S.Ct. at 896. <em>Cf. Alston v. Robinson, </em>791 F.Supp. 569, 590 (D.Md.1992) (holding that an amendment to Article 31B of the Maryland Code providing that the Patuxent Institution Board of Review \u201cmay\u201d grant parole to an inmate under certain circumstances, instead of the former language that the Board of Review \u201cshall\u201d grant parole under said circumstances, did not violate the <em>ex post facto </em>clause because it did not prescribe more punishment or provide less opportunity for the inmate to shorten his criminal sentence) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">We also disagree with petitioner\u2019s attempts to distinguish the present case from <em>Weaver </em>on the grounds that the availability of the special project credits in the present case were discretionary, rather than mandatory, as were the credits in the <em>Weaver </em>case. We note that the parties in <em>Lynce, supra, </em>raised similar arguments about the nature of the credits at issue, and how that nature would factor into the Court\u2019s <em>ex </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number><em>post facto </em>analysis. The petitioner in <em>Lynce, </em>a case that involved credits given as a result of overcrowding, argued that his case was comparable to <em>Weaver </em>because both cases involved the issuance of credits that were \u201cdependent on an inmate\u2019s good conduct.\u201d <em>Lynce, </em>519 U.S. at 442, 117 S.Ct. at 896. The respondent in <em>Lynce </em>countered that <em>Weaver </em>was not controlling because \u201cit was the overcrowded condition of the prison system, rather than the character of the prisoner\u2019s conduct, that gave rise to the award.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court declined to adopt either contention, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-5\">In our view, both of these submissions place undue emphasis on the legislature\u2019s subjective intent in granting the credits rather than on the consequences of their revocation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-6\">In arriving at our holding in <em>Weaver, </em>we relied not on the subjective motivation of the legislature in enacting the gain-time credits, but rather on whether objectively the new statute \u201clengthenfed] the period that someone in petitioner\u2019s position must spend in prison.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 38, 101 S.Ct., at 967. Similarly, in this case, the fact that the generous gain-time provisions in Florida\u2019s 1983 statute were motivated more by the interest in avoiding overcrowding than by a desire to reward good behavior is not relevant to the essential inquiry demanded by the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause: whether the cancellation of 1,860 days of accumulated provisional credits had the effect of lengthening petitioner\u2019s period of incarceration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-8\">In our post <em>-Weaver </em>cases, we have also considered whether the legislature\u2019s action lengthened the sentence without examining the purposes behind the original sentencing scheme. In <em>Miller v. Florida, </em>482 U.S. 423, 107 S.Ct. 2446, 96 L.Ed.2d 351 (1987), we unanimously concluded that a revision in Florida\u2019s sentencing guidelines that went into effect between the date of petitioner\u2019s offense and the date of his conviction violated the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause. Our determination that the new guideline was \u201c \u2018more onerous than the prior law,\u2019 \u201d <em>id., </em>at 431, 107 S.Ct., at 2452 (quoting <em>Dobbert v. Florida, </em>432 U.S. 282, 294, 97 S.Ct. 2290, 2298-2299, 53 L.Ed.2d 344 (1977)), rested entirely on an objective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>appraisal of the impact of the change on the length of the offender\u2019s presumptive sentence. 482 U.S., at 431, 107 S.Ct., at 2452 (\u201clooking only at the change in primary offense points, the revised guidelines law clearly disadvantages petitioner and similarly situated defendants\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 442-43, 117 S.Ct. at 896-97. We find this analysis instructive in the instant case. The nature of the special project credits in this case is irrelevant for the purposes of our <em>ex post facto </em>analysis. The focus of our analysis is not on whether these credits were mandatory or discretionary but, rather, whether the amendments to the regulations which provides these credits has the effect of lengthening respondents\u2019 sentences and is more \u201conerous\u201d than the prior law.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> As we have already noted, the sentences of those individuals who are double celled, and whose qualifying crimes have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>changed to disqualifying crimes by the amendments, have clearly been lengthened.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">We do not find the increased punishment caused by the amendments in this case, as petitioner argues, to be \u201cspeculative and attenuated.\u201d We note that the case from which that language originates, <em>Morales, supra, </em>is factually distinguishable from the present case. In <em>Morales, </em>the statutory change affected the frequency of parole eligibility hearings for inmates by giving parole officials the ability, after meeting several procedural safeguards, to postpone an inmate\u2019s yearly evaluation by up to three years when potential safety issues, among other things, were a concern, and parole officials believed the inmate would not be eligible for parole during the extended period regardless. Morales\u2019s <em>ex post facto </em>claims were rejected as the chances of an increased punishment were \u201cspeculative and attenuated.\u201d Here, respondents will clearly serve a longer period of time as a result of the amendments and the determination of that increase is far easier than in <em>Morales.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Moreover, we note that the language included in the regulation providing that, \u201c[t]his section may not be interpreted ... to mean that an inmate who is eligible to receive the credits described in this section has a right to these credits or ... will continue to receive these credits in the future,\u201d does not provide sufficient notice to inmates for the purposes of the <em>ex post facto </em>prohibition, see <em>Miller v. Florida, </em>482 U.S. 423, 431, 107 S.Ct. 2446, 2452, 96 L.Ed.2d 351 (1987). That disclaimer alone does not exempt the regulation from <em>ex post facto </em>scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">The amendments at issue in the present case are constitutionally valid when applied to inmates who are double celled and who committed any of the enumerated disqualifying crimes after the date that the amendments took effect on January 2, 2002. Our holding applies only to those inmates who committed one or more of the enumerated disqualifying crimes prior to the adoption of the amendments. We do not propose to limit the authority of the Secretary or the Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>sioner, and acknowledge that they must be allowed to manage the DOC effectively.
