Kinnane, the respondent, charging him with violations of various of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct, as adopted by Maryland Rule 16-812. The Petition alleged, specifically, that the respondent violated Rules 1.5(e) (Fees),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 8.4(b) and (c) (Misconduct).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">We referred the case, pursuant to Rules 16-752,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for hearing to the Honorable Ronald A. Silkworth, a judge of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. Following the hearing, at which the respondent appeared and participated, the hearing court made findings of fact, <em>see </em>Rule 16-757(c)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>\u201cPetitioner\u2019s Exhibit 1 is a Stipulation of Facts prepared by the parties. The Court finds that the facts contained therein have been proven by clear and convincing evidence. The Stipulation states:</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">\u201cThe Respondent, Thomas W. Kinnane, Esquire (\u2018Respondent\u2019) was admitted to the Bar of the Court of Appeals of Maryland on June 5,1996. He is also admitted to the Virginia Bar and District of Columbia Bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">\u201cPrior to becoming an attorney, Respondent was a uniformed officer in the United States Secret Service for two years then a police officer in the Anne Arundel County Police Department for eight years.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">\u201cWhile attending law school, Respondent began working for the law firm of Alexander &amp; Cleaver in Fort Washington, Maryland. Once he was admitted to the Maryland Bar, he became an associate of that firm, where he remained until February 2000. He then practiced with another lawyer in the firm, Howes &amp; Kinnane, P.C. and later became a solo practitioner, with his office in Anne Arundel County. Throughout the course of his law practice, Respondent has concentrated a significant portion of his practice representing energy companies in connection with matters pending before government regulatory agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">\u201cIn or about 1998, while employed by Alexander &amp; Cleaver, Respondent met Andrew N. Chau, Esquire (\u2018Mr. Chau\u2019), the manager of regulatory affairs for Shell Energy Services (\u2018Shell Energy\u2019). Mr. Chau also held himself out to the Respondent and others as an attorney. Respondent performed legal services for Shell Energy and other similar clients while at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>Alexander &amp; Cleaver. He continued to represent Shell Energy after leaving the firm. Respondent\u2019s primary point of contact at Shell Energy continued to be Mr. Chau. Respondent later performed work for Tractebel Power where Mr. Chau accepted employment after leaving Shell Energy. During the course of his representation of Shell Energy, Respondent submitted approximately 15 invoices for legal services. It was Respondent\u2019s practice to invoice Shell Energy for work after it was performed, rather than to receive a retainer for future work.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">\u201cIn or about July 2001, Respondent and Mr. Chau met in Washington, D.C., at Mr. Chau\u2019s request. Mr. Chau informed Respondent that he had been authorized by Judith Burow, vice president of Shell Energy, to pay Respondent a $70,000.00 retainer for future work. He instructed Respondent to prepare an invoice for that amount. Respondent prepared an invoice from Howes &amp; Kinnane, P.C. to Shell Energy dated July 26, 2001. The description of services read, \u2018Nevada regulatory and government relations activities, 2001 session and implementation.\u2019 On August 8, 2001, Shell Energy paid $70,000.00 to Respondent by electronic transfer. Respondent held the $70,000.00 in the firm\u2019s escrow account. Respondent had never received a retainer from Shell Energy before this payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">\u201cOn or about August 22, 2001, Mr. Chau called the Respondent. He directed the Respondent to take the entire retainer as a bonus for work he had done before at a discounted rate, but to issue a check for $35,000.00 to Mr. Chau. Mr. Chau asked for the $35,000.00 payment to compensate him for referring future business from Shell Energy and its affiliated companies as well as Tractebel Power.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">\u201cRespondent transferred $70,000.00 to the firm\u2019s operating account. Respondent issued a $35,000.00 check to Andrew Chau &amp; Associates, P.C. on August 22, 2001. The statement accompanying the check indicated that it was for \u2018professional fees: consulting\u2019. In fact, Mr. Chau provided no consulting services to Respondent or his firm. Respondent drew a check to himself for $35,000.00 from the firm\u2019s operating account.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>\u201cHowes &amp; Kinnane, P.C. issued an invoice to Shell Energy-on August 8, 2001. That invoice identified the $85,000.00 payment to Andrew Chau as a \u2018consulting fee\u2019. Respondent also issued a form 1099 to Mr. Chau, reporting the payment of the purported consulting fee. Respondent claimed the $85,000.00 on his annual state and federal tax returns.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">\u201cIn the fall of 2001, Respondent received a telephone call from Judith Burow and a Mr. Estes of Shell Energy. They informed the Respondent that the $70,000.00 payment had not been authorized by Shell Energy. Mr. Chau called Respondent shortly afterward and indicated that the invoice \u2018might not have been approved\u2019. Respondent believed this to be an internal dispute among Chau and his supervisors at Shell Energy.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">\u201cMr. Chau was subsequently discharged by Shell Energy. Criminal charges were brought against both Mr. Chau and the Respondent. Respondent was charged with felony theft on April 30, 2003. Harris County (Texas) District Court entered a deferred adjudication of guilt on July 11, 2003. Respondent has paid restitution of $35,000.00, as well as a $2,000.00 fine. Respondent also provided all information he had to assist in the prosecution of Mr. Chau. Respondent has also cooperated fully with Bar Counsel\u2019s investigation of this matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">From the foregoing facts, which it found by clear and convincing evidence, <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Culver, </em>381 Md. 241, 266, 849 A.2d 423, 438 (2004), Rule 16-757(b),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the hearing court concluded that the respondent violated Rules 1.5(e)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and 8.4(b) and (c), as charged. The Rule 1.5(e) viola<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>tion was established, it stated, by the evidence that the respondent split his fee from Shell Energy with Mr. Chau, Shell\u2019s in-house counsel. Further explaining, the hearing court pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-4\">\u201cMr. Chau performed no services to earn that portion of the fee. Respondent has acknowledged that the payment was made at Mr. Chau\u2019s direction to pay him to make future referrals of work to Respondent\u2019s firm. While Respondent characterizes the payment as the equivalent of purchasing advertising with his own funds received from clients\u2019 payments, that position is contradicted by Respondent\u2019s billing statement submitted to Shell Energy, which disclosed that $35,000.00 was paid to Chau for consulting services. The client never authorized Respondent to share the fee with Mr. Chau. In fact, the payment was an incentive for Mr. Chau to refer work to Respondent also from Tractabel Power, a company unrelated to Shell Energy. Mr. Chau was not a member of Respondent\u2019s firm. The division of fees was not in proportion to the work performed since Mr. Chau was being compensated for making future referrals of work. There was no written agreement between Respondent and Shell Energy for Respondent and Mr. Chau to assume joint responsibility for the work. The fee charged by Respondent was not reasonable because no services were performed for the fee. Rather, it was a \u2018bonus\u2019 not authorized by the client, but only offered by the corrupt employee who was seeking the improper kickback of half of the fee. Respondent\u2019s conduct violated Rule 1.8(e) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">As we have seen, the respondent was charged with, and found guilty of, felony theft, in respect of which he made restitution and paid a fine. That criminal conduct, the hearing court concluded, \u201creflects adversely on [the respondent\u2019s] honesty, trustworthiness and fitness as a lawyer.\u201d It also in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>volved, the court noted and determined, dishonesty and misrepresentation, proscribed by Rule 8.4(c). It elucidated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ax7\">\u201cRespondent\u2019s invoice for $70,000.00 retainer made no reference to the fact that it was to be a retainer for future services. Nothing on the bill would alert the client to the fact that the payment requested was not for services already performed. In fact, the charging of a retainer was inconsistent with Respondent\u2019s previous dealings with the client, who had only paid fees after services were rendered. Respondent then accepted that \u2018retainer\u2019 as a bonus for work long since performed and paid for, solely on the authorization of the client\u2019s employee who was demanding that he split the \u2018bonus\u2019 with him personally. Particularly in light of the fact the client had never paid a bonus to him before, the large amount of the payment, the fact the payment was submitted for other purposes and the client had consistently insisted on paying extremely low fees to the Respondent, Respondent could not reasonably have believed that Mr. Chau had authorization from Shell Energy to pay a bonus to Respondent, to be shared with Mr. Chau. Respondent\u2019s acceptance of the $70,000.00 and his sharing of the unearned funds with Mr. Chau led to Respondent\u2019s] entering a plea of guilty to felony theft and receiving a deferred adjudication by the Texas court. Respondent\u2019s invoicing of the $70,000.00 fee and his taking it as a fee at the direction of Mr. Chau to Shell Energy were dishonest acts and crimes adversely reflecting on Respondent\u2019s character and fitness as an attorney. His invoices, which did not reflect that the $70,000.00 was unearned and which described the $35,000.00 paid to Mr. Chau as a professional fee for consulting services, were dishonest misrepresentations. Respondent and Mr. Chau participated in a fraudulent scheme which constituted felony theft in Texas.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">Unlike the Petitioner, which took no exceptions to the hearing court\u2019s findings or conclusions, the respondent filed <em>Respondent\u2019s Exceptions To The Findings Of Fact and Conclusions Of Law. </em>In that pleading, he excepted to the hearing court\u2019s conclusion that he could not have believed reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>that Mr. Chau had been authorized by Shell Energy to pay him a bonus, \u201cto be shared with Mr. Chau.\u201d There is not, he asserts, any evidence in the record to support the conclusion, while, on the other hand, there is evidence to the contrary, his testimony, \u201cthat [he] had no knowledge upon payment of the bonus that Chau later required [be] split.\u201d He also maintains that his actions, all of them \u2014 \u201cproviding invoices and statements through normal channels; providing a 1099 Form to Chau; depositing and processing the funds appropriately in firm accounts; and reporting the income on respondent\u2019s annual state and federal taxes,\u201d \u2014 \u201cindicate that he had a good faith belief that the bonus was properly paid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">In further support of this exception, the respondent relies on the very fact that he took an \u201cAlford plea,\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> proffering that entering such a plea \u201creflects respondent\u2019s good faith belief that his conduct was appropriate and ... [his] evaluation of the risks and benefits of proceeding to trial on the facts of the case, at a particular time, and in a particular distant city.\u201d The respondent further finds it \u201cnoteworthy\u201d that, notwithstanding the length of the process and the hearing court\u2019s conclusion in this regard and \u201cthe effects thereof on respondent\u2019s honesty, trustworthiness and fitness as an attorney,\u201d Bar Counsel took no preliminary action to terminate his practice, thereby \u201cevidencing its apparent belief that respondent\u2019s actions do not, and have not, affected his ability to honestly and competently continue to represent members of the public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The respondent\u2019s second exception relates to the hearing court\u2019s refusal to admit into evidence the Peer Review Panel\u2019s Report.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Characterizing that ruling as erroneous, he notes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>that the report was offered to clarify the record \u201cwith respect to how the formal Bar Counsel petition ultimately was arrived at and filed with the Circuit Court\u201d and that the filing of them was not recommended to Bar Counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Maryland Rule 16-759(b) governs review by this Court and, in particular, the disposition of exceptions to the hearing court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGF\">\u201c(1) <em>Conclusions of law. </em>The Court of Appeals shall review de novo the circuit court judge\u2019s conclusions of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-5\">\u201c(2) <em>Findings of fact. </em>(A) If no exceptions are filed. If no exceptions are filed, the Court may treat the findings of fact as established for the purpose of determining appropriate sanctions, if any.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-6\">\u201c(B) If exceptions are filed. If exceptions are filed, the Court of Appeals shall determine whether the findings of fact have been proven by the requisite standard of proof set out in Rule 16-757(b). The Court may confine its review to the findings of fact challenged by the exceptions. The Court shall give due regard to the opportunity of the hearing judge to assess the credibility of witnesses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">The respondent\u2019s first exception implicates Rule 16-759(b)(1), because it involves a conclusion of law drawn by the hearing court. Those conclusions are reviewed de novo. We do not agree, at the outset, that there are no facts to support the hearing court\u2019s conclusion of law. Indeed, the hearing court enumerated the facts on which it relied: the course of dealings between the client and the respondent, the failure of the bill for the \u201cretainer\u201d to so characterize it or, at least, \u201calert the client to the fact that the payment requested was not for services already performed,\u201d the large amount of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>requested payment, and, as indicated, the respondent took no exception to any of these findings of facts. <em>See </em>Rule 16-759(b)(2)(B). Having reviewed the hearing court\u2019s detailed and cogent explanation and the facts on the basis of which its challenged legal conclusion was drawn, we have no hesitancy in overruling the exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">We shall also overrule the respondent\u2019s exception to the hearing court\u2019s refusal to admit the Peer Review Panel\u2019s Report. Rule 16-743, the rule governing the Peer Review process, makes clear the limited office that Panel performs. It provides, as relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-5\">\u201c(a) <em>Purpose of Peer Review Process. </em>The purpose of the peer review process is for the Peer Review Panel to consider the Statement of Charges and all relevant information offered by Bar Counsel and the attorney concerning it and to determine (1) whether the Statement of Charges has a substantial basis and there is reason to believe that the attorney has committed professional misconduct or is incapacitated, and, (2) if so, whether a Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action should be filed or some other disposition is appropriate. The peer review process is not intended to be an adversarial one and it is not the function of Peer Review Panels to hold evidentiary hearings, adjudicate facts, or write full opinions or reports.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">To be sure, although Rule 16-743(e)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> permits the Peer Review Panel to make recommendations to the petitioner to the same extent as could Bar Counsel, nevertheless, it is the petitioner, as Rule 16-751(a) makes clear, that determines whether, and what, charges are to be filed; the Rule provides for the filing of charges upon approval or at the direction of the petitioner. Thus, whether Bar Counsel recommends the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>filing of charges or another procedure is not only not dispositive, we agree with the hearing court, it is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Moreover, pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-723, certain matters pertaining to the Peer Review process are confidential. Section (b)(2) of that Rule lists \u201cthe records and proceedings of a Peer Review Panel\u201d as among such matters. The Report of the Peer Review Panel qualifies as \u201crecords and proceedings [that] are confidential and not open to public inspection [whose] contents may not be revealed by the Commission, the staff of the Commission, Bar Counsel, the staff and investigators of the Office of Bar Counsel, members of the Peer Review Committee, or any attorney involved in the proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">In <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Lee, </em>387 Md. 89, 108, 874 A.2d 897, 908 (2005), we addressed an issue akin to, though certainly not identical to, the issue presented in this case. There, the Respondent claimed that he had been denied the opportunity to impeach the complainant in his case when the hearing court refused to allow him to cross-examine her by introducing statements she made at the Peer Review Panel proceeding that he alleged were inconsistent with certain statements she made at the evidentiary hearing before the hearing judge. <em>Id. </em>at 102, 874 A.2d at 904. We rejected his argument, <em>id. </em>at 113-14, 874 A.2d at 911-12, in the process delineating the nature and function of the Peer Review process:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-6\">\u201cThe Peer Review process features a panel of at least three individuals comprised of a majority of attorneys and at least one member being a non-attorney that makes a preliminary determination as to whether formal charges should be filed against the respondent attorney.... [T]he Peer Review Panel proceeding is an informal, nonadversarial meeting designed to allow Bar Counsel, the respondent attorney, the complainant, and other invited persons to meet and discuss the issues presented in the complaint in an environment similar to a mediation process.... The Panel is not governed by any formal rules of evidence, but must respect lawful privileges....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>\u201cThe purpose of the Peer Review Panel is not principally to make recommendations as to the appropriateness of formal charges.... If a Peer Review Panel concludes that the complaint has a substantial basis indicating the need for some remedy, some behavioral or operational changes on the part of the lawyer, or some discipline short of suspension or disbarment, part of the peer review process can be an attempt through both evaluative and facilitative dialogue, (A) to effectuate directly or suggest a mechanism for effecting an amicable resolution of the existing dispute between the lawyer and the complainant, and (B) to encourage the lawyer to recognize any deficiencies on his or her part that led to the problem and take appropriate remedial steps to address those deficiencies. The goal, in this setting, is not to punish or stigmatize the lawyer or to create a fear that any admission of deficiency will result in substantial harm, but rather to create an ambience for a constructive solution. The objective views of two fellow lawyers and a lay person, expressed in the form of advice and opinion rather than in the form of adjudication, may assist the lawyer (and the complainant) to retreat from confrontational positions and look at the problem more realistically.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">\u201cIf, however, after hearing statements, the Panel determines that the Statement of Charges \u2018has a substantial basis and that there is reason to believe that the [respondent] attorney has committed professional misconduct or is incapacitated, the Panel may ... make an appropriate recommendation to the Commission or ... inform the parties of its determination and allow the attorney an opportunity to consider a reprimand or a Conditional Diversion Agreement.\u2019 The Panel is authorized to recommend to the Commission that either a Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action be filed, the Statement of Charges be dismissed, or that a Conditional Diversion Agreement or reprimand is appropriate. Although the purpose of the Panel proceeding is not to generate any formal findings of fact, the Panel must accompany its recommendation with \u2018a brief explanatory statement.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 108-09, 874 A.2d at 908-09 (internal citations omitted). We concluded, noting the \u201ccomprehensive and sweeping language of Md. Rule 16-723(a)\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-4\">\u201cDespite the common sense appeal of permitting use of statements made during the Peer Review process to expose later inconsistencies or intentional misrepresentations, we conclude that the better course is to declaim, borrowing and mutating somewhat a currently popular advertising slogan, \u2018what happens in Peer Review stays in Peer Review.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 113, 874 A.2d at 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Where there is no more than a recommendatory function, one that is not binding and certainly not dispositive, there is even more reason to \u201cinsulate\u201d Peer Review Panel Reports from subsequent disclosure at later stages of the attorney discipline process.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">While not excepting to the findings or the conclusions, the petitioner filed <em>Petitioner\u2019s Recommendation For Sanction. </em>It seeks the respondent\u2019s disbarment. Stressing the hearing judge\u2019s characterization of the respondent\u2019s conduct as \u201cdishonest\u201d and \u201ccrimes adversely reflecting on respondent\u2019s character and fitness as an attorney,\u201d concluding that he \u201cparticipated in a fraudulent scheme which constituted felony theft in Texas,\u201d the petitioner relies on <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. 376, 418, 773 A.2d 463, 488 (2001) and its progeny.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">The respondent has not specifically recommended a sanction. It is obvious from his exceptions and the prayers thereto \u2014 requesting the Court to \u201ctake such actions it deems appropriate with respect to Bar Counsel\u2019s petition and the Circuit Court\u2019s findings and Conclusions that will allow the respondent to continue his honorable service to the public and exemplary representation of the Bar\u201d \u2014 that he opposes, and is urging something short, perhaps quite a bit short, of disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>\u25a0 The purpose of attorney disciplinary proceedings is well settled: to protect the public and not to punish the erring attorney. <em>See Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Davis, </em>375 Md. 131, 167, 825 A.2d 430, 451 (2003); <em>Bar Ass\u2019n of Baltimore City v.

We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-7\">\u201cUnlike matters relating to competency, diligence and the like, intentional dishonest conduct is closely entwined with the most important matters of basic character to such a degree as to make intentional dishonest conduct by a lawyer almost beyond excuse.
