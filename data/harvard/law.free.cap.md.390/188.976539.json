The question presented by this case is whether the driver of a taxicab, who is injured in a collision between the taxicab and a motor vehicle which is neither a taxicab nor a bus, has personal injury protection (PIP) coverage, under his personal motor vehicle insurance policy, for the injuries suffered in the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">The second question presented by this case concerns the validity, under the Insurance Code, of a PIP exclusion in the GEICO insurance policy covering the petitioner\u2019s personal motor vehicle. The PIP section of the policy provides that the insured is \u201cnot covered if injured while in, or through being struck by, any motor vehicle which is not an insured auto if it is ... available for the regular use of\u2019 the insured.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The facts of this case are undisputed, and to a large extent they were set forth in a stipulation filed in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. The accident giving rise to this litigation occurred on May 15, 2001. The petitioner Ebrahim Nasseri was driving a taxicab that collided with a motor vehicle which was neither a taxicab nor a bus. Nasseri\u2019s taxicab was available to him under an agreement entered into between the owner of the taxicab, Action Taxicab, Inc., and Nasseri. That agreement required Nasseri to pay Action $95.00 per day in exchange for the use of the taxicab. The agreement further restricted his use of the taxicab to twelve hours within any twenty-four hour period. At the time of the accident, the taxicab was covered only by liability insurance, in accordance with the minimum requirements of Maryland law applicable to taxicabs. Nasseri, however, maintained a separate policy of motor vehicle insurance through GEICO General Insurance Company for his personal motor vehicle. That policy provided for PIP coverage in the event of personal injury resulting from a \u201cmotor vehicle accident.\u201d It is the coverage under Nasseri\u2019s policy with GEICO that is at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Following the accident, Nasseri submitted a claim for PIP benefits to GEICO under his personal motor vehicle insurance policy in the amount of $2,500.00, the limit under that policy. GEICO responded by denying PIP coverage for alternative reasons. First, GEICO stated that, under \u00a7 19 \u2014 501(b)(2)(ii) of the Insurance Article, taxicabs are specifically exempt from the definition of \u201cmotor vehicle,\u201d and that, therefore, Nasseri was not injured in a \u201cmotor vehicle accident\u201d within the meaning of the PIP statute, \u00a7 19-505 of the Insurance Article.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Next, GEICO asserted that, under the insurance policy,</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>Nasseri then filed a small claim action for damages in the District Court of Maryland, sitting in Montgomery County, against GEICO. He claimed that, under the insurance policy on his personal motor vehicle and the pertinent statutory provisions, he was entitled to PIP benefits for the injuries suffered in the collision. The District Court held that he was not entitled to PIP benefits because of the exclusion of taxicabs from the statutory definition of \u201cmotor vehicle.\u201d The District Court, therefore, rendered judgment for GEICO. On a <em>de novo </em>appeal to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, the Circuit Court also entered judgment for GEICO, although on the ground that the \u201cregular use\u201d exclusion in the GEICO policy was applicable and valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Nasseri filed in this Court a petition for a writ of certiorari, presenting the issues of whether \u00a7 19-505 of the Insurance Article requires GEICO to provide PIP coverage under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>circumstances here and whether the \u201cregular use\u201d exclusion contained in the insurance policy is invalid under the statute. We granted the petition, <em>Nasseri v. Geico, </em>377 Md. 111, 832 A.2d 204 (2003), and we shall reverse.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>(a) <em>Coverage required. </em>\u2014 Unless waived in accordance with \u00a7 19-506 of this subtitle, each insurer that issues, sells, or delivers a motor vehicle liability insurance policy in the State shall provide coverage for the medical, hospital, and disability benefits described in this section for each of the following individuals:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-8\">(1) except for individuals specifically excluded under \u00a7 27-606 of this article:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-9\">(1) the first named insured, and any family member of the first named insured who resides in the first named insured's household, who is injured in any motor vehicle accident, including an accident that involves an uninsured motor vehicle or a motor vehicle the identity of which cannot be ascertained; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-10\">(ii) any other individual who is injured in a motor vehicle accident while using the insured motor vehicle with the express or implied permission of the named insured;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-11\">(2) an individual who is injured in a motor vehicle accident while occupying the insured motor vehicle as a guest or passenger; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-12\">(3) an individual who is injured in a motor vehicle accident that involves the insured motor vehicle:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-13\">(i) as a pedestrian; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-14\">(ii) while in, on, or alighting from a vehicle that is operated by animal or muscular power.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">GEICO\u2019s argument, that the driver of a taxicab is not entitled to PIP benefits under the driver\u2019s personal motor vehicle insurance policy, is based entirely upon the definitions of \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d and \u201cmotor vehicle accident\u201d in \u00a7 19-501(b)(2)(h) and (c)(1) of the Insurance Article. The essence of GEICO\u2019s argument is as follows (respondent\u2019s brief at 5-6): \u201cBy statutory definition, \u00a7 19-501, \u2018motor vehicle\u2019 does not include \u2018a taxicab.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-7\">\u201cFurthermore, inasmuch as the statute provides that \u2018motor vehicle accident\u2019 means an occurrence involving a \u2018motor vehicle,\u2019 the policy language referring to motor vehicle accidents must be read as requiring a motor vehicle accident <em>which does not involve </em>a \u2018taxicab.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">A principal flaw in GEICO\u2019s argument is that \u00a7 19-501(c)(l) of the Insurance Article does <em>not </em>define \u201cmotor vehicle accident\u201d as an \u201caccident which does not involve a taxicab.\u201d Instead, the statute defines \u201cmotor vehicle accident\u201d as \u201can occurrence involving <em>a motor vehicle </em>that results in damage to property or injury to a person.\u201d (Emphasis supplied). The occurrence in the present case clearly involved \u201ca motor vehicle,\u201d namely the other vehicle with which Nasseri\u2019s taxicab collided.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">For purposes of this case, we shall assume <em>arguendo </em>that the statutory phrase \u201cmotor vehicle accident\u201d in subsection (c)(1) incorporates the taxicab exclusion in subsection (b)(2)(ii), and that an accident between two taxicabs might not be a \u201cmotor vehicle accident\u201d within the meaning of subsection (c)(1). Nevertheless, as long as another motor vehicle, which is not a taxicab or bus, is involved in the accident, such accident plainly comes within the definition of \u201cmotor vehicle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>accident\u201d in subsection (c)(1). The subsection requires only the involvement of one motor vehicle for there to be a motor vehicle accident; it does not require that all vehicles involved in the collision be \u201cmotor vehicles.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Moreover, the pertinent language of \u00a7 19-505 of the Insurance Article, setting forth the basic PIP coverage, encompasses in subsection (a)(l)(i) an insured</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9\">\u201cwho is injured in <em>any </em>motor vehicle accident, including an accident that <em>involves an uninsured motor </em>vehicle.... \u201d (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Again, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that a person injured in a collision between two taxicabs might not be injured in \u201cany motor vehicle accident\u201d within the meaning of the \u00a7 19-505, Nasseri was injured in an accident involving his taxicab and a motor vehicle which was neither a taxicab nor a bus. .Nasseri was certainly injured in a motor vehicle accident under the language of the statute, and \u00a7 19-505 provides PIP coverage for anyone injured in <em>any </em>motor vehicle accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">The applicability of \u00a7 19-505, under the circumstances of this case, is reinforced by the language of \u00a7 19 \u2014 513(d)(l)(i) of the Insurance Article. Section 19 \u2014 513(d)(l)(i) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-8\">\u201c \u2014 (1) The insurer under a policy that contains the coverages described in \u00a7\u00a7 19-505 and 19-509 of this subtitle shall pay the benefits described in \u00a7\u00a7 19-505 and 19-509 to an individual insured under the policy who is injured in a motor vehicle accident:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-9\">(i) while occupying a motor vehicle for which the coverages described in \u00a7\u00a7 19-505 and 19-509 of this subtitle are not in effect....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">It would appear that the above-quoted language was directly aimed at circumstances like those presented here. The vehicles \u201cfor which the coverages described in \u00a7\u00a7 19-505 and 19-509\u201d would legally not be \u201cin effect\u201d are taxicabs, buses, vehicles owned by the State of Maryland,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and vehicles for which the first named insured has made \u201can affirmative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>written waiver of [PIP] benefits.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In this case, Nasseri had an insurance policy providing PIP benefits, and he was occupying a motor vehicle for which PIP benefits were not in effect. A holding that he was not entitled to PIP benefits, precisely because he was occupying a vehicle for which PIP benefits were not in effect, could not be reconciled with \u00a7 19\u2014 513(d)(l)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">The legislative enactment which deleted taxicabs from the definition of \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d for purposes of certain coverages mandated by the Insurance Code was Ch. 655 of the Acts of 1977. The title to Ch. 655 shows that the exemption for taxicabs was not as sweeping as GEICO argues in the case at bar.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The title of Ch. 655 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-6\">\u201cFOR the purpose of exempting certain vehicles, as defined in the Vehicle Laws, from certain required primary coverage insurance provisions; and subdividing a section.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Alt\">Consequently, the purpose of Ch. 655 was simply to provide that the compulsory automobile liability insurance policies on taxicabs and certain other vehicles did not have to contain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>policy provisions for PIP and some other statutory coverages. The purpose was not to negate required PIP and other required coverages, under policies on all other types of motor vehicles, whenever a taxicab happened to be involved in an accident with another type of motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">The language of the Insurance Article, as well as numerous opinions by this Court, make it clear that an insured, who has PIP coverage under a policy on the insured\u2019s motor vehicle, and who is injured in an accident while occupying a different motor vehicle owned by someone else, is ordinarily entitled to PIP coverage under the policy on the insured\u2019s vehicle. If the vehicle occupied by the insured also has PIP coverage, that coverage will be primary and the coverage under the policy on the insured\u2019s vehicle will be secondary. If the occupied vehicle has no PIP coverage, the coverage under the insured\u2019s policy will be primary. <em>See, e.g., Bishop v. State Farm Mutual Auto Insurance, </em>360 Md. 225, 236-238, 757 A.2d 783 (2000); <em>MAIF v. Perry, </em>356 Md. 668, 671-672, 676-677, 741 A.2d 1114, 1115-1116, 1118-1119 (1999); <em>Travelers Ins. Co. v. Benton, </em>278 Md. 542, 543, 365 A.2d 1000, 1002 (1976) (The statute \u201cprovides, with respect to a person insured under a policy providing PIP coverage who is injured in an accident while occupying a motor vehicle for which such coverage is not in effect, that the PIP benefits shall be payable by the injured party\u2019s insurer providing such coverage\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted). <em>See also Pennsylvania Nat\u2019l Mutual Casualty Insurance Company v. Gartelman, </em>288 Md. 151, 154-157, 416 A.2d 734, 736-739 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Therefore, under the circumstances of this case, the fact that Nasseri was driving a taxicab furnished no valid basis for denying him PIP benefits required by the Insurance Code.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">GEICO\u2019s alternative argument is based on the exclusion, in the PIP section of the insurance policy on Nasseri\u2019s personal vehicle, that the insured is \u201cnot covered if injured while in, or being struck by, any motor vehicle which is not an insured auto if it is ... available for the regular use of\u2019 the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Section 19-505(c) of the Insurance Article specifies the permissible exclusions from required PIP coverage. That subsection reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-7\">\u201c(c) <em>Exclusions. </em>\u2014 (1) An insurer may exclude from the coverage described in this section benefits for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-8\">(1) an individual, otherwise insured under the policy, who:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-9\">1. intentionally causes the motor vehicle accident resulting in the injury for which benefits are claimed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-10\">2. is a nonresident of the State and is injured as a pedestrian in a motor vehicle accident that occurs outside of the State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-11\">3. is injured in a motor vehicle accident while operating or voluntarily riding in a motor vehicle that the individual knows is stolen; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-12\">4. is injured in a motor vehicle accident while committing a felony or while violating \u00a7 21-904 of the Transportation Article; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-13\">(ii) the named insured or a family member of the named insured who resides in the named insured\u2019s household for an injury that occurs while the named insured or family member is occupying an uninsured motor vehicle owned by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-14\">1. the named insured; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-15\">2. an immediate family member of the named insured who resides in the named insured\u2019s household.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-16\">(2) In the case of motorcycles, an insurer may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>(i) exclude the economic loss benefits described in this section; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-5\">(ii) offer the economic loss benefits with deductibles, options, or specific exclusions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">The \u201cregular use\u201d exclusion in Nasseri\u2019s insurance policy is not one of the permissible exclusions set forth in the above-quoted statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">While GEICO acknowledges that the \u201cregular use\u201d exclusion goes beyond the permissible exclusions set forth in the Insurance Code,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> GEICO argues that we should uphold the exclusion \u201cas applied to the facts of this case \u2014 where the vehicle \u2018available for the regular use\u2019 of Nasseri is a taxicab.\u201d (Respondent\u2019s brief at 9). Nevertheless, \u201c \u2018this Court has consistently held that exclusions from statutorily mandated insurance coverage not expressly authorized by the Legislature generally will not be recognized.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stearman v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, </em>381 Md. 436, 445-446, 849 A.2d 539, 545 (2004), quoting <em>West American Insurance Co. v. Popa, </em>352 Md. 455, 475, 723 A.2d 1, 10 (1998). For a recent comprehensive review of numerous circumstances in which this principle has been applied, <em>see </em>Judge Harrell\u2019s opinion for the Court in <em>Salamon v. Progressive Classic Insurance Company, </em>379 Md. 301, 311-315, 841 A.2d 858, 864-867 (2004). <em>See also, e.g., Lewis v. Allstate Ins.

Allstate, </em>341 Md. 541, 547, 671 A.2d 509, 512 (1996) (\u201cWhere the Legislature has mandated insurance coverage, this Court will not create exclusions that are not specifically set out in the statute\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">It would be flatly inconsistent with the above-cited decisions, as well as numerous other opinions by this Court, to accept GEICO\u2019s argument and uphold the unauthorized \u201cregular use\u201d exclusion \u201cwhere the vehicle \u2018available for the regular use\u2019 ... is a taxicab.\u201d Furthermore, other than the argument which we have rejected in Part II of this opinion, GEICO suggests no basis for upholding the \u201cregular use\u201d exclusion with respect to taxicabs but invalidating the exclusion with respect to other types of vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">There is another compelling reason for rejecting GEICO\u2019s argument. Upholding the \u201cregular use\u201d exclusion would be flatly inconsistent with this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Pennsylvania Nat\u2019l Mutual Casualty Insurance Company v. Gartelman, supra, </em>288 Md. 151, 416 A.2d 734, and with the General Assembly\u2019s response to the <em>Gartelman </em>opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">As previously noted, <em>supra, </em>n. 2, the entire exclusion in the GEICO insurance policy excludes PIP coverage if the insured or \u201crelatives\u201d of the insured are \u201cinjured while in, or through being struck by, any motor vehicle which is not an insured auto if it is owned by you [the insured] or a relative or available for the regular use of either.\u201d <em>Pennsylvania Nat\u2019l Mutual Casualty Company v. Gartelman, </em>involved the validity, under the Insurance Code, of two similar exclusions, one applicable to PIP coverage and one applicable to uninsured motorist coverage. The PIP exclusion in the <em>Gartelman </em>case provided as follows:<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">\u201cMARYLAND PERSONAL INJURY PROTECTION ENDORSEMENT\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>\u201cExclusions</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">This insurance does not apply:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-6\">\u201c(c) to bodily injury sustained by the named insured or any relative while occupying, or while a pedestrian through being struck by any motor vehicle owned by the named insured or furnished or available for the named insured\u2019s regular use and which is not an insured motor vehicle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AtF\">This Court in <em>Gartelman </em>held that both the PIP exclusion and the uninsured motorist exclusion were invalid. Although the facts of <em>Gartelman </em>presented an issue concerning the \u201cowned\u201d rather than the \u201cavailable for regular use\u201d aspect of the PIP exclusion, the Court\u2019s reasoning would clearly apply to both aspects. The Court stated (288 Md. at 156-157, 416 A.2d at 787):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-7\">\u201c[The statute] expressly provides for only four exclusions from the required PIP coverage. It does not expressly provide an exclusion for an insured occupying an uninsured motor vehicle owned by a named insured. We decline to insert such an exclusion which would be contrary to the remedial legislative purpose of assuring compensation for damages to victims of motor vehicle accidents without regard to fault.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-8\">\u201cThe insurance policy in this case, because it provides an exclusion for an insured occupying an uninsured motor vehicle owned by a named insured, denies PIP coverage to a class of persons who are required by \u00a7 539 [now \u00a7 19-505] to be covered. The policy\u2019s exclusion, therefore, conflicts with the statute and is invalid. Accordingly, the claimant is entitled to coverage under the policy\u2019s PIP provision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">Apparently in response to <em>Gartelman, </em>the General Assembly enacted Ch. 573 of the Acts of 1982, which is currently codified as \u00a7 19-505(c)(1)(ii) of the Insurance Article.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>tion 19 \u2014 505(c)(1 )(ii) allows an insurer to exclude from PIP coverage</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-4\">\u201c(ii) The named insured or a family member of the named insured who resides in the named insured\u2019s household for an injury that occurs while the named insured or family member is occupying an uninsured motor vehicle owned by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-5\">1. the named insured; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-6\">2. an immediate family member of the named insured who resides in the named insured\u2019s household.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">The permissible exclusion is much narrower than the exclusion contained in the insurance policy involved in <em>Gartelm,an </em>and in the GEICO policy involved in the present case. The exclusion permitted by the statute does not extend broadly to \u201crelatives\u201d of the named insured but is limited to the named insured\u2019s immediate family residing in the same household. More significantly for the case at bar, the permissible exclusion is limited to uninsured vehicles \u201cowned\u201d by the insured and does not encompass uninsured vehicles available for regular use of the insured.

The only issue in <em>Winterwerp, </em>however, was the interpretation of the clause and whether it was ambiguous. The case did not involve any issue concerning the clause's validity or the Insurance Code.
