Supp.) Art. 27, \u00a7 449(e).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Subsequently, he was sentenced for that offense to five years imprisonment, without the possibility of parole. When the petitioner was sentenced, he previously had been convicted of second degree assault, the proof of which was supplied by the State, and for violating an <em>ex parte </em>order entered when he and his wife were separated. Second degree assault, the critical conviction, was a crime of violence, <em>see </em>\u00a7 441(e),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but not a felony. <em>See </em>\u00a7 12A (b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">The petitioner believed he was illegally sentenced because, he argued, for \u00a7 449(e) to apply, not simply a crime of violence was required to be shown, but proof of a felony conviction was a prerequisite as well. This is evident, he submits, from the language of the statute itself:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-7\">\u201cA person who was previously convicted of a crime of violence as defined in \u00a7 441(e) of this article or convicted of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>a violation of \u00a7 286 or \u00a7 286A of this article, and who is in illegal possession of a firearm as defined in \u00a7 445(d)(l)(i) and (ii) of this article, is guilty of a felony and upon conviction shall be imprisoned for not less than 5 years, no part of which may be suspended and the person may not be eligible for parole. Each violation shall be considered a separate offense.\u201d [<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">That section, he points out, in delineating its scope, referred to Art. 27, \u00a7 445, which identifies the persons whose possession of a firearm is illegal, and, more to the point, expressly specified, as a unit, two of the sub-sections defining illegal possession, (d)(l)(i) and (ii),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as the definition applicable to it. Under that definition, he concludes, \u201ca person is not in illegal possession of a firearm unless the person has previously been convicted of <em>both </em>a \u2018crime of violence\u2019 <em>and </em>\u2018[a]ny violation classified as a felony in this State.\u2019 \u201d Because his conviction for second degree assault, although a crime of violence, was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>misdemeanor, the petitioner maintained that the enhanced penalty of \u00a7 449(e) did not apply to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Armed with that argument, the petitioner noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. A divided panel of that court, in a reported opinion, rejected the argument. <em>Stanley v. State, </em>157 Md.App. 363, 851 A.2d 612 (2004). It did so despite its recognition that \u00a7 449(e) was an enhanced penalty statute, which, because highly penal, must be construed strictly and to which the rule of lenity applied insofar as doubt might exist regarding the punishment imposed, <em>id. </em>at 678, 851 A.2d at 620 (quoting <em>Melton v. State, </em>379 Md. 471, 489, 842 A.2d 743, 753 (2004)), and its acknowledgment both that this Court has been clear that \u201c[ojnly if the statutory language is ambiguous will this Court look \u2018beyond the statute\u2019s plain language in discerning the legislative intent,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 377, 851 A.2d at 620, (quoting <em>Melton, 379 </em>Md. at 476-477, 842 A.2d at 746-747), and that \u201cthe \u2018plain meaning\u2019 of \u00a7 449(e) suggests that it applies to persons who have been convicted of both a crime of violence and a felony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 379, 851 A.2d at 620. Noting, and relying on some of our other, earlier cases emphasizing the non-absoluteness of the \u201cplain meaning\u201d rule, <em>i.e. Derry v. State, </em>358 Md. 325, 336, 748 A.2d 478, 483-484 (2000) (\u201c[W]e do not view the plain language of a statute in a vacuum. The plain meaning rule of construction is not absolute; rather, the statute must be construed reasonably with reference to the purpose, aim, or policy of the enacting body\u201d); <em>Degren v. State, </em>352 Md. 400, 418, 722 A.2d 887, 898 (1999) (\u201c \u2018[w]e are not constrained ... by ... \u201cthe literal or usual meaning\u201d of the terms at issue.\u2019 \u201d); <em>Outmezguine v. State, </em>335 Md. 20, 41, 641 A.2d 870, 880-881 (1994) (\u201cThe plain language can not be viewed in isolation; rather, the entire statutory scheme must be analyzed as a whole.\u201d), and <em>State v. Pagano, </em>341 Md. 129, 134, 669 A.2d 1339, 1341 (1996) for the proposition that statutes are to be read \u201cso that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless, or nugatory,\u201d the intermediate appellate court concluded, \u201can examination of the statute in context and in conjunction with the statutory scheme makes clear that [both a conviction of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>crime of violence and of a felony] was not the legislative intent.\u201d <em>Stanley, 157 </em>Md.App. at 378-79, 851 A.2d at 620. It explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-5\">\u201cInterpreting the statute as appellant suggests would require us to render a portion of the statute superfluous and would produce an illogical result. Section 449(e) applies to \u2018a person who was previously convicted of a crime of violence as defined in \u00a7 441(e)\u2019 or of a violation of Article 27 \u00a7 286 or \u00a7 286A. Article 27 \u00a7\u00a7 286 and 286A prohibit various drug crimes. None of the offenses prohibited by those statutes is a \u2018crime of violence as defined in \u00a7 441(e).\u2019 It would be illogical for the legislature specifically to have listed \u00a7\u00a7 286 and 286A in \u00a7 449(e) if it intended that the section apply only to persons who have previously been convicted of both a felony and a crime of violence. In addition, \u00a7 445(d)(1) does not prohibit possession of any firearm, but of a \u2018regulated firearm.\u2019 Reading \u00a7 449(e) together with \u00a7 445(d)(1) indicates that the phrase, \u2018who is in possession of a firearm as defined in \u00a7 445(d)(l)(i) and (ii) of this article,\u2019 refers to a person who is in possession of a regulated firearm and that the legislature used the word \u2018and\u2019 because the definition of \u2018regulated firearm\u2019 is the same in \u00a7 445(d)(l)(i) as it is in \u00a7 445(d)(l)(ii). As seen above, section 445(d)(1) lists subsections (i) and (ii) in the disjunctive.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-6\"><em>Id </em>at 379, 851 A.2d at 620.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">The majority also found support for its position in the legislative history, both pre- and post-enactment, of \u00a7 449(e). Significant, in that regard, were the bill analyses for the House and Senate versions of the bill that was to become \u00a7 449(e). They both referred to the qualifying convictions applicable to the bill under consideration in the disjunctive: the House version providing, \u201cThe bill creates a new felony and a five-year mandatory minimum term of imprisonment for a person who illegally possesses a firearm and has certain qualifying convictions for crimes of violence or certain controlled dangerous substances\u201d and the Senate version declaring, \u201cThe bill establishes a felony that provides a 5 year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>minimum mandatory term of imprisonment for a person who illegally possesses a firearm and who was previously convicted of <em>a crime of violence or certain serious controlled dangerous substances violations.\u201d </em>Similarly important to the majority\u2019s reasoning is the new statute, the recodified version of \u00a7 449(e), <em>i.e. </em>Maryland Code (2003) \u00a7 5-133(c) of the Public Safety Article. It points to that statute as \u201csupport[ive of] the view that the legislature intended \u00a7 449(e) to apply to a person previously convicted of either a felony or a crime of violence,\u201d <em>Stanley, </em>157 Md.App. at 380, 851 A.2d at 621, noting that the revisor\u2019s note states that the simpler formulation, which it attributes to the revisers, reflected in \u00a7 5-133(c) of the Public Safety Article \u201cis new language derived <em>without substantive change </em>from former Art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 449(e) and 445(d), (e) and, except as it related to the transfer of regulated firearms, (a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 380-381, 851 A.2d at 621-622.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">As indicated, the Court of Special Appeals was divided. Judge Davis, in dissent, relying on one of our more recent cases for the purpose, <em>Price v. State, </em>378 Md. 378, 387-88, 835 A.2d 1221, 1226-1227 (2003),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> reminded the majority of the importance that this Court places on beginning its quest for legislative intent with the plain language of the enactment at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>issue and, in fact, that it is \u201cthe strongly preferred norm of statutory interpretation.\u201d <em>Stanley, </em>157 Md.App. at 384, 851 A.2d at 623 (Davis, J., dissenting). In that case, as Judge Davis pointed out, we were emphatic as to process: when the statutory text reveals ambiguity, we are required to resolve it utilizing \u201call the resources and tools of statutory construction at our disposal, but</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-5\"><em>\u201cbefore judges may look to other sources for interpretation, first there must exist an ambiguity within the statute, i.e., two or more reasonable alternative interpretations of the statute. See Greco v. State, </em>347 Md. 423, 429, 701 A.2d 419, 421 (1997). Where the statutory language is free from such ambiguity, courts will neither look beyond the words of the statute itself to determine legislative intent nor add to or delete words from the statute, <em>see Gillespie v. State, </em>370 Md. 219, 222, 804 A.2d 426, 427 (2002). Only when faced with ambiguity will courts consider both the literal or usual meaning of the words as well as their meaning in light of the objectives and purposes of the enactment. As our predecessors noted, \u2018We cannot assume authority to read into the Act what the Legislature apparently deliberately left out. Judicial construction should only be resorted to when an ambiguity exists.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 383, 851 A.2d at 623, quoting <em>Price, </em>378 Md. at 387-88, 835 A.2d at 1226. Judge Davis concluded that there was no ambiguity in \u00a7 449(e), that it was clear and unambiguous. Therefore, no construction was required. Moreover, relying on <em>Melton, </em>379 Md. at 488-89, 842 A.2d at 753-754, Judge Davis believed that the Rule of Lenity applied in any event, the language of \u00a7 449(e) being at best ambiguous, thus raising a doubt as to the punishment the statute imposed. <em>Id. </em>at 623-24, 851 A.2d at 384-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">The petitioner, aggrieved by the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, filed a petition for certiorari with this Court, which we granted, <em>Stanley v. State, </em>383 Md. 256, 858 A.2d 1017 (2004), to consider whether legislative history, pre- and post-enactment, may trump the plain and clear and unambiguous language of a statute. We shall reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>We agree with the petitioner and with Judge Davis, \u00a7 449(e) is clear and unambiguous. By its clear and explicit terms, to be subject to the enhanced penalty it prescribes, a person must be \u201cin illegal possession of a firearm as defined in \u00a7 445(d)\u00ae and (ii),\u201d and been convicted previously of a crime of violence as defined in \u00a7 441(e) or been convicted of certain enumerated drug-related offenses. <em>See Price, </em>378 Md. at 384, 835 A.2d at 1224, in which this Court commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-5\">\u201cSection 449 (e), by its plain structure, is divided into two requirements. The first requirement is that the defendant have a previous conviction of a crime that falls within \u00a7 441(e). The second requirement is that the defendant have a current conviction under \u00a7 445(d)(1)\u00ae and (ii).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aex\">The definition of the illegal possession targeted for purposes of this statute \u2014 there are two other proscribed possessions listed in \u00a7 445(d)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u2014 consists of two elements and is stated in the conjunctive. Consequently, both elements must be met; it is not sufficient if only one is present. That means, since the definition includes a crime of violence <em>and </em>\u201cany violation classified as a felony in this State,\u201d that a conviction of both, not just one, must be established. Thus, it is not enough that the person be convicted of a crime of violence under \u00a7 441(e). On the contrary, unless the illegal possession of the firearm is established by proof of a \u201cviolation classified as a felony,\u201d the establishment of the crime of violence under \u00a7 441(e) could not trigger the enhanced punishment. Were it otherwise, we would not give the entire statute effect and, in fact, we would be rendering the conjunction, \u201cand,\u201d superfluous. Moreover, we would be adding a word, \u201cor,\u201d to the statute that the General Assembly did not. It is a well settled canon of statutory construction that we should, when interpreting a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>statute, give effect to all of the language and avoid a construction that renders any portion superfluous. <em>Design Kitchen and Baths v. Lagos, </em>388 Md. 718, 729, 882 A.2d 817, 823-24 (2005); <em>Moore v. State, </em>388 Md. 446, 453, 879 A.2d 1111, 1114 (2005); <em>Ware v. State, </em>348 Md. 19, 59, 702 A.2d 699, 719 (1997). We have also recognized that \u2018Where the words of a statute, construed according to their common and everyday meaning, are clear and unambiguous and express a plain meaning,\u201d the Court will give effect to the statute as the language is written. <em>Moore v. Miley, </em>372 Md. 663, 677, 814 A.2d 557, 566 (2003).\u201d <em>See Moore, </em>388 Md. 446, 453, 879 A.2d 1111, 1114 (\u201cif the plain language of the statute is unambiguous and consistent with the apparent purpose of the statute, we give effect to the statute as it is written\u201d). Just as a court may not render statutory language surplusage, it may neither add nor delete language so as to reflect an intent not evidenced in the plain and unambiguous language of the statute. <em>Price, </em>378 Md. at 387, 835 A.2d at 1226 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">The Court of Special Appeals asserted, as part of its rationale for interpreting \u00a7 449(e) as it did, that it would be illogical for the Legislature to have placed \u00a7\u00a7 286 and 286A in \u00a7 449(e), disjunctively with \u00a7 441(e), had it intended \u00a7 449(e) to apply only to persons with both a felony and a crime of violence conviction. At the outset, it is appropriate to reiterate that the statute is clear and unambiguous. Even if it may be, to us, illogical and irrational, there is no basis for the Court to refuse to give effect to the clear direction of the General Assembly. But, it is not illogical or irrational for the General Assembly to have reserved the harshest punishment for those with the most reprehensible record. As the petitioner points out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-6\">\u201cA person in illegal possession of a firearm, either because of a previous conviction of a crime of violence or a previous conviction of a felony, would always have been subject to the penalty provided by Article 27, \u00a7 449(a).... It is entirely reasonable to reserve the mandatory penalty of subsection (e) for those individuals who have criminal records which include both a felony and a crime of violence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>Nor are we satisfied that the legislative history preenactment of \u00a7 449(e) or post its enactment, <em>ie. </em>its repeal and recodification as \u00a7 5-133(c), provides a basis for an interpretation different from the one we reach. As indicated, the statute is not ambiguous; thus, there is no reason to consult legislative history as an aid to construing it. What we said in <em>Price </em>bears repeating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-5\">\u201c[A]ll statutory interpretation begins, and usually ends, with the statutory text itself, <em>Marriott Employees v. MVA, </em>346 Md. 437, 444-45, 697 A.2d 455, 458 (1997), for the legislative intent of a statute primarily reveals itself through the statute\u2019s very words, <em>Derry v. State, </em>358 Md. 325, 335, 748 A.2d 478, 483 (2000). A court may neither add nor delete language so as to reflect an intent not evidenced in the plain and unambiguous language of the statute; nor may it construe the statute with forced or subtle interpretations that limit or extend its application. <em>County Council v. Dutcher, </em>365 Md. 399, 416-417, 780 A.2d 1137, 1147 (2001). In short, if the words of a statute clearly and unambiguously delineate the legislative intent, ours is an ephemeral enterprise. We need investigate no further but simply apply the statute as it reads. <em>Derry, </em>358 Md. at 335, 748 A.2d at 483; <em>Kaczorowski v. Mayor &amp; City of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 515, 525 A.2d 628, 633 (1987).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">We are aware that this Court has reviewed the legislative history of a statute which we have pronounced clear and unambiguous. In those circumstances, that is a confirmatory process, <em>see Lagos, </em>388 Md. 718, 730, 882 A.2d 817, 824; <em>State v. Glass, </em>386 Md. 401, 411, 872 A.2d 729, 735 (2005); <em>Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v. Chase, </em>360 Md. 121, 128, 756 A.2d 987, 991 (2000) (when the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, \u201cthe resort to legislative history is a confirmatory process; it is not undertaken to contradict the plain meaning of the statute\u201d); <em>Coleman v. State, </em>281 Md. 538, 546, 380 A.2d 49, 54 (1977) (\u201ca court may not as a general rule surmise a legislative intention contrary to the plain language of a statute or insert exceptions not made by the legislature\u201d), not a contradictory one.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>We also do not believe that the amendment of a statute, with an explanatory note suffices to contradict the plain language of a statute. The amendment itself, because it must change that which was contradictory of the legislative intent, is proof of the contrary, that the statute actually did not mirror legislative intent. A revisor\u2019s note indicating that the change was made without substantive change does not change that fact. That is especially the case here, where the revisor highlighted for the General Assembly what the revisor termed \u201cunclear.\u201d In any event, <em>albeit </em>not the identical issue, what we said in Price, addressing a similar issue, is instructive. In that case, the State argued that the crime of daytime housebreaking, though not actually included in the list of crimes of violence in \u00a7 441(e), was included by implication, referring to a Committee Note to the 1994 amendment to \u00a7 441(e), in which the amendment was characterized as \u201cstylistic\u201d and \u201cessentially retaining] the current law in the area.\u201d 378 Md. at 391, 835 A.2d at 1228. This Court rejected the argument. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-5\">\u201cA change to a statute cannot, regardless of what the Committee Note declares, be considered \u2018stylistic\u2019 if it removes one crime from an enumerated list and replaces it with another that requires different elements of proof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6B\"><em>Id. </em>at 392, 835 A.2d at 1229.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">The same can be said of an amendment that radically changes the requirements for the application of an enhanced penalty statute. In this case, rather than a definition supplied by a reference in the conjunctive, the reference has been removed entirely and replaced by specific references to specified crimes. Such a change is not \u201cwithout substantive change.\u201d It radically changes, as in Price, the elements of proof required by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO REVERSE THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY.
