The complaint regarding Ms. Lipscomb was based on Maignan\u2019s alleged mishandling of $4,000 derived from the settlement of an action against her former landlord; the Magruder complaint involved allegations of a failure to provide a written retainer agreement and overcharging.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">In accordance with Maryland Rule 16-752, we referred Bar Counsel\u2019s petition to Judge Sherrie Krauser, of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, to conduct a hearing and present to us her proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. Bar Counsel has filed exceptions to certain of Judge Krauser\u2019s findings with respect to the Lipscomb complaint, which we find have merit and shall sustain.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">We deal first with the Magruder complaint, and do so summarily. Although Bar Counsel charged violations of MRPC 1.1 (competence), 1.5 (fees to be reasonable), 1.15 (safekeeping property), 8.1 (false statement to Bar Counsel), 8.4(c) (dishonesty), 8.4(d) (conduct prejudicial to administration of justice), Maryland Rules 16-604, 16-606, 16-607 and Maryland Code, \u00a7 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article (all dealing with attorney trust accounts), he eventually pressed only the alleged violation of MRPC 1.5.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The hearing judge found no violation of that rule, and Bar Counsel has not excepted to that finding. There is no need for us, therefore, to recount the record and make any determinations regarding the Magruder complaint. The Lipscomb complaint is a different matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Hattie Lipscomb sued her former landlord in District Court to recover the value of certain property that the landlord had wrongfully removed from the apartment. At some point, she employed an associate in respondent\u2019s office to represent her and paid the associate (and thus the firm) a fee of $750. When that associate left the office in August, 2003, respondent agreed to continue the representation. On or about September 13, 2002, respondent negotiated a settlement of the matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>for $4,000. He informed Ms. Lipscomb of the settlement and told her that she would need to come to the office to endorse the settlement check and sign a release. Respondent testified that, after speaking with Ms. Lipscomb, he called his associate, Tesheia Wright and asked her to check the mail for the settlement check and then arrange for Ms. Lipscomb to come to the office to complete the transaction. It is conceded that respondent received the settlement check for $4,000 from Kay Management Co., Inc. by September 15, 2002.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">Ms. Lipscomb was pleased with the settlement. Her complaint to Bar Counsel, and Bar Counsel\u2019s petition, were based on the delay that occurred in her receiving the proceeds of the settlement. Ms. Lipscomb did not receive a check from respondent until February 19, 2003 \u2014 some four months later- \u2014 after she had, <em>pro se, </em>attempted to reopen the District Court case. The check was in the full amount of $4,000, the fee having already been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">At the hearing before Judge Krauser, respondent contended that a receptionist in his office misplaced the settlement check when it arrived and that he was unaware, until some time in December, that the check had been received and that Ms. Lipscomb had not been paid. Bar Counsel, relying on the settlement check itself and ancillary bank records, asserted that the settlement check had been promptly deposited into respondent\u2019s operating account in September and that, as the balance in the operating account dropped below $4,000 on a number of occasions between the time of the deposit and the time he paid Ms. Lipscomb, he therefore misappropriated the funds. On that premise, Bar Counsel charged respondent with violations of MRPC 1.1 (Competence), 1.3 (Diligence), 1.4 (Communication with client), 1.15 (Safekeeping property), 5.3 (Responsibility for non-lawyer assistants), 8.1(a) (making false statement to Bar Counsel), and 8.4(a), (b), (c), and (d). Respondent was also charged with violations of Maryland Rules <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>16-604, 16-606, and 16-607, dealing with attorney trust accounts, and Maryland Code, \u00a7 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article, also dealing with attorney trust accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">The real controversy was over what happened to the settlement check after it was received by respondent in September. Bar Counsel eventually- conceded that there had been no violation of MRPC 1.3, and respondent conceded that he had, in fact, deposited the settlement check to his operating account, not his trust account, and that he drew the check to Ms. Lipscomb from the operating account. The hearing judge concluded that Bar Counsel had also conceded that there was no violation of MRPC 1.1, which Bar Counsel denies and which the record shows was not the case. Giving no weight whatever to the check itself, to the ancillary bank records, and to statements made by respondent to an Assistant Bar Counsel during her investigation of the matter, the hearing judge found as a fact that the settlement check was misplaced in respondent\u2019s office, that it was not discovered until late December, 2002, and that it was not deposited until January 6, 2003. On that finding, and with the various concessions (or, in the case of MRPC 1.1, assumed concession), she concluded that respondent had violated MRPC 1.15 and 5.3 and Rule 16-604, but that he had not violated any of the other MRPC Rules, or statutes charged by Bar Counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">The hearing judge did not specify which parts of MRPC 1.15 respondent violated, but, in light of her other findings, including that respondent had not misappropriated any client funds, it would appear that her finding under MRPC 1.15 was limited to a violation of section (a) of that Rule. Bar Counsel excepts to her failure to find a violation of MRPC 1.15(b), to MRPC 1.1, which he claims he did not concede, and MRPC 8.4(a) and (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">Original jurisdiction over attorney discipline matters resides in the Court of Appeals. We determine, ultimately, whether an attorney has committed the misconduct charged by the Attorney Grievance Commission. In accordance with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>Maryland Rule 16-752, we ordinarily refer petitions for disciplinary action to a Circuit Court judge to act as a hearing officer for this Court, to take evidence and present to us proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, to which exceptions may be taken. In all cases, we review the judge\u2019s conclusions of law <em>de novo. </em>Maryland Rule 16-759(b)(l). If exceptions are filed with respect to the judge\u2019s fact-finding, we determine whether those findings have been proven by the requisite standard of proof. Rule 16-759(b)(2)(B). In doing so, we give \u201cdue regard to the opportunity of the hearing judge to assess the credibility <em>of witnesses.\u201d Id. </em>(Emphasis added). It is ultimately for us, however, to determine whether the judge\u2019s findings are, indeed, supported by substantial evidence. It is against the background of these principles that we review the evidence regarding what happened to the settlement check after it was received by respondent in September, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">Ms. Lipscomb testified that, although she was unable to come to respondent\u2019s office immediately, as she was going on vacation, she called the office several times thereafter regarding the matter. She said that on some occasions she spoke with a staff person but was never able to speak with respondent. On January 21, 2003, she wrote to respondent, complaining that she had been trying since November to get the proceeds of the settlement, that \u201cI have made three appointments to come in and talk to you so I could receive my proceeds,\u201d that \u201c[e]ach appointment was cancelled by your office,\u201d that, since January 1, she had called three times, that each time she got a recording and left a message, that none of the calls were returned, that she was finally given an appointment for January 20, 2003, but that, when she arrived, she was told that respondent was unavailable and that she would have to reschedule the appointment. Ms. Lipscomb\u2019s testimony and the statements in her letter were contradicted to some extent by respondent, and it was permissible for the hearing judge to make a credibility assessment with respect to the contradiction. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>The critical issue before us, however, is not whether Ms. Lipscomb came to respondent\u2019s office or called to complain, but what happened to the settlement check after respondent received it in September: When was it deposited into respondent\u2019s operating account? If it was deposited in September, as Bar Counsel contends, then, in light of what the bank statements regarding that account reveal thereafter, respondent did, indeed, misappropriate the settlement funds. If, through carelessness, the check was not deposited until January, as the hearing judge found, respondent would be culpable of failing to supervise his staff and failing to place the funds in a trust account, but not misappropriation.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Based largely on the check itself and ancillary bank records, Bar Counsel maintained that respondent deposited the check in his trust account on September 18, 2002. Respondent claimed that his former receptionist put the check in a drawer and failed to inform him or the office manager that it had arrived, that he did not learn he had the check until late December or early January, and that the check was not deposited in his trust account until January 6, 2003. The hearing judge gave no weight at all to the documentary evidence \u2014 the check itself \u2014 and, crediting the office manager\u2019s testimony and that of respondent, found, as a fact, that the check was not deposited until January 6, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">As noted, respondent conceded that his office received the settlement check on or about September 13. A copy of the check was admitted into evidence. On the reverse side appear four printed dates; one is September 18, 2002, and the other three are September 19, 2002. There are no January, 2003 dates on the check. Immediately following the September 18 date is the number 15018733, which the evidence shows is the account number of respondent\u2019s operating account with Citibank, the account to which respondent conceded he deposited the check. Respondent\u2019s own bank \u2014 the depository bank\u2014 stamped the check as being handled by it on September 18. That is consistent with Citibank\u2019s records regarding the account. The bank record of activity on the account during September, 2002, shows a deposit on September 18 of $4,756. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>Records produced by the bank under subpoena show three checks deposited that day \u2014 the check from Kay Management for $4,000 and two personal checks, one for $256 and one for $500 \u2014 a total of $4,756.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">One of the September 19 dates on the back of the check was placed there by Bank of America, the drawee bank. The settlement check shows as the drawee bank NationsBank N.A., but, in <em>Taylor v. NationsBank, </em>365 Md. 166, 169, n. 1, 776 A.2d 645, 648, n. 1 (2001), we recognized that NationsBank had merged with Bank of America. It is thus clear from the Bank of America stamp that the check cleared the drawee bank on September 19, 2002. Another of the September 19 dates is accompanied by another series of numbers, 280215938, which is also stamped on the front of the check. It is not clear who applied that stamp.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Respondent did not offer any explanation of how the September, 2002 dates got on the check or why no January, 2003 dates appear on the check. It is clear, really beyond cavil, that the check was deposited on September 18 and that it cleared the drawee bank the next day, September 19. The hearing judge\u2019s announced finding that \u201cthe bank records do not evidence deposit of the settlement check until January 2003\u201d is fundamentally and clearly erroneous. The very document belies the judge\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">It is true, as we have indicated, that credibility decisions made by a hearing judge are ordinarily entitled to deference, but, despite the protestations of the dissent, not when the credibility decision is so contrary to unexplained, unimpeached, unambiguous documentary evidence as to be inherently incredible and unreliable. If the check admitted into evidence was blue in color, and we could see it was blue in color, we certainly would not accept the judge\u2019s crediting of the office manager\u2019s testimony that it was yellow. The situation here is no different.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">Respondent\u2019s story about organizing a search for the settlement check and not discovering its existence until December is at odds not just with the document itself but also with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>story he told to Bar Counsel\u2019s staff in response to their request for information. On March 14, 2003, he wrote to Assistant Bar Counsel, Dolores Ridgell, that \u201c[o]n September 15, 2002, we advised Ms. Lipscomb <em>that we had received the settlement check in this case </em>and requested that she make an appointment to discuss the conclusion of the matter\u201d and that \u201c[d]ue to conflicts between Ms. Lipscomb\u2019s travel schedule and our trial calendar, no such meeting could be arranged before February 2003.\u201d (Emphasis added). He continued, \u201cAt all times, however, we advised Ms. Lipscomb that we could place the check in the mail to her attention. Rather, Ms. Lipscomb requested that we meet to discuss the possibilities of further actions in the matter.\u201d That explanation \u2014 that he informed Ms. Lipscomb on September 15 that he had the check and that \u201call all times\u201d he \u201ccould place the check in the mail to her attention\u201d cannot be squared with the assertion that he was unaware that he had the check until December. How could he \u201cat all times\u201d place the check in the mail to her if he didn\u2019t know he had the settlement check? The letter was admitted into evidence and ignored by the hearing judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Our rejection of the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that the check was not discovered until December and was not deposited until January fatally undermines nearly all of her other conclusions to which Bar Counsel has taken exception. The bank records produced by Citibank reveal that, as early as September 19, 2002, and at various times in October, the operating account balance fell below $4,000, which meant that respondent had spent for other purposes all or part of the funds that belonged to Ms. Lipscomb. That constitutes misappropriation of funds that respondent was obliged to hold inviolate in trust for her.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Bar Counsel does not argue that the misappropriation was intentional and thus seems to accept that respondent was unaware that the check had, in fact, been deposited in September. He argues, however, that respondent\u2019s failure to maintain the funds in a proper trust account demonstrates incompetence under MRPC 1.1 and that it also establishes a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>violation of MRPC 1.15(a) and (b) and 8.4(d), and he is correct. In <em>Attorney Grievance v. James, </em>385 Md. 637, 662-63, 870 A.2d 229, 244 (2005), we confirmed our holding in <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Brown, </em>380 Md. 661, 667-68, 846 A.2d 428, 432 (2004), that a \u201cRespondent\u2019s failure to properly maintain [a client\u2019s] settlement monies in his escrow account demonstrates his incompetence pursuant to Rule 1.1.\u201d We further concluded in <em>James </em>that a violation of MRPC 1.15 also constituted a violation of MRPC 8.4(a). <em>See id., </em>at 663, 870 A.2d at 245, citing <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Gansler, </em>377 Md. 656, 699, n. 22, 835 A.2d 548, 573, n. 22 (2003) and <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Gallagher, </em>371 Md. 673, 710-11, 810 A.2d 996, 1018 (2002). We have long recognized that the failure to maintain settlement funds intact until disbursed \u2014 the comingling of personal and client funds \u2014 constitutes a violation of MRPC 8.4(d). <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Drew, </em>341 Md. 139, 669 A.2d 1344 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">The posture of the case, then, is that the settlement check for $4,000 was deposited in respondent\u2019s operating account on September 18, 2002, after his associate, Ms. Wright, allegedly with permission, apparently signed both respondent\u2019s name and that of Ms. Lipscomb on the back of the check, as purported endorsers. Notwithstanding his admission to the contrary in his letter to Ms. Ridgell, we accept that respondent was unaware until at least late December that the check had been received and deposited. Under his own version, he was certainly aware, at least when he claimed to have deposited the check in January, that it was deposited to his operating account, not a trust account. It is also the case that, between the time the check was actually deposited in September and the time the $4,000 was paid to Ms. Lipscomb in mid-February, 2003, the balance in the operating account fell below $4,000 on a number of occasions. Ultimately, Ms. Lipscomb was paid the entire $4,000, so her only loss was that of the use of the funds for five months.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Relying on <em>Attorney Grievance v. Sperling, </em>380 Md. 180, 844 A.2d 397 (2004), which involved an unintentional shortfall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>in an attorney\u2019s trust account, Bar Counsel recommends an indefinite suspension, which was the sanction imposed in that case. If anything, this case is more egregious than <em>Sperling, </em>as respondent did not even use a trust account but co-mingled Ms. Lipscomb\u2019s funds in his operating account. Nonetheless, we believe that an indefinite suspension is the appropriate sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE 16-761, FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION AGAINST PETER RICHARD MAIGNAN.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">BELL, C.J., HARRELL and GREENE, JJ. dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Dissenting Opinion by HARRELL, J., which BELL, C.J. and GREENE, J. join.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">I dissent. The Majority opinion, in its parsing and reweighing of the conflicting evidence before the hearing judge, ignores the appellate discipline we are supposed to exercise in our review of the fact-finding process in attorney discipline matters. Even if we would have found differently the operative facts based on the concededly conflicting evidence in this record, that is not our prerogative.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">The hearing judge, in her written recommendation, characterized the conflicting evidence on the relevant points as follows: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>responsible for opening office mail, maintaining records of all funds received and disbursed, and preparing bank deposits. Ms. Boulet left the firm in late September [of 2002], and Ms. Terri Anthony assumed her duties. Ms. Wright left the firm in early October [of 2002] on maternity leave and never returned.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>The dispute in this matter surrounds the events after September 13, 2002. Mr. Maignan testified that, after speaking with Ms. Lipscomb, he called his associate, Ms. Tesheia Wright, and asked her to check the mail for the settlement proceeds, and then arrange for Ms. Lipscomb to come to the office to complete their transaction. He also asked Ms. Wright to make sure that the office manager, Ms. Sherri Boulet, prepared the deposit for the trust account and the disbursement to Ms. Lipscomb. Ms. Boulet was</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>The parties do not dispute that Respondent\u2019s office received the settlement check dated September 12, 2002, payable jointly to Ms. Lipscomb and Respondent (Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 4), but do not agree on the date of receipt or deposit of that check. Petitioner contends that stamps on the reverse of the check, noting \u201cBank of America, NA\u201d and \u201cSeptember 19, 2002,\u201d show that Respondent or his agent deposited the check on or about that date. Respondent disagrees. Ms. Anthony testified that she discovered the Lipscomb check under or behind a drawer in Ms. Boulet\u2019s desk when she cleaned it out in December 2002, and immediately notified Mr. Maignan. Mr. Maignan testified that he assumed that Ms. Wright had completed the transaction with Ms. Lipscomb in early October 2002, and was upset to learn differently from Ms. Anthony in December. However, when he examined the check, he realized that Ms. Wright had endorsed the check and signed the release on Ms. Lipscomb\u2019s behalf. Ms. Wright explained that Ms. Lipscomb authorized her to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Ms. Lipscomb initially complained that Mr. Maignan failed to communicate with her between October and December 2002 regarding her settlement funds. However, she testified that she had several telephone conversations with his office staff during those months about unrelated matters, but that neither she nor anyone else mentioned the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Petitioner offers records of Respondent\u2019s bank accounts (Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 14) to show days on which the available balance fell below the amount due Ms. Lipscomb, before she received her funds. However, the bank records do not evidence deposit of the settlement check until January 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>Mr. Maignan acknowledges that, by relying on electronic banking services and daily internet reviews of deposit, withdrawal and balance information, his understanding of the status of the firm\u2019s bank accounts differed from the monthly statements issued by the bank. Mr. Maignan testified that the bank\u2019s electronic records credit deposits when received by the bank, but that the monthly statement credits deposits on the date that the funds are actually deposited into the account. Mr. Maignan first learned of this difference from Petitioner\u2019s investigator in February 2003; as a result, he transferred the firm\u2019s accounts to a bank convenient to his office.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Respondent admits that he was alarmed by the belated discovery of Ms. Lipscomb\u2019s settlement proceeds, and directed Ms. Anthony to contact Ms. Lipscomb to arrange prompt delivery of her funds, either in the office or through the mail. Ms. Lipscomb testified that she remembered Ms. Anthony\u2019s call, admitting that she was mistaken when she complained that she knew nothing about the December discovery. Ms. Lipscomb further acknowledged that she asked Ms. Anthony to mail the check to her, because an office appointment would be inconvenient.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Mr. Maignan testified that he then executed a check from his general operating account to Ms. Lipscomb, and deposited the settlement check into that account. He concedes that his actions violate Rule 16-604, requiring that he deposit those funds into the trust account. However, he explained that he wanted to avoid any further delay in transferring the funds to Ms. Lipscomb, which would necessarily occur if he waited for the deposit to clear the trust account before disbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">However, Ms. Anthony inadvertently misaddressed the envelope, resulting in further delay. A call from Ms. Lipscomb alerted Ms. Anthony to her mistake, and Mr. Maignan directed Ms. Anthony to send another check immediately. Ms. Anthony testified that she disregarded that instruction and waited for the first letter to be returned by the Postal Service. Ms. Lipscomb finally received her check in early <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>February 2003, after initiating this complaint. She testified that she now considers the matter closed, and has no further concern about Mr. Maignan\u2019s representation or his handling of her funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">Based on this factual record, the hearing judge drew the following factual conclusions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-5\">Respondent concedes that he did not properly supervise his legal and administrate subordinates\u2019 handling of Ms. Lipscomb\u2019s settlement check. He assumed that his directions were carried out, and did not verify receipt or disbursement of Ms. Lipscomb\u2019s funds. Further, after discovering the misplaced check, he admits that he failed to deposit the funds into the trust account, as required.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-6\">However, the evidence does not establish that Mr. Maignan failed to communicate with Ms. Lipscomb. Ms. Lipscomb spoke with Mr. Maignan\u2019s employees several times during the relevant period, but neither she nor anyone else discussed the settlement funds. Further, scheduling conflicts prevented Ms. Lipscomb from meeting Mr. Maignan in his office. Once the settlement check was discovered, Ms. Lipscomb acknowledges that she simply forgot that she had spoken with Ms. Anthony about the circumstances, and called the office when she did not receive the check as expected. That call resulted in Ms. Anthony\u2019s discovery of the misaddressed mail. Thus, there was no lack of communications between Ms. Lipscomb and Mr. Maignan or other members of his office; rather, the failure to discuss the settlement proceeds resulted from Mr. Maignan\u2019s failure to supervise his subordinates properly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-7\">Moreover, the evidence does not establish that Mr. Maignan misappropriated Ms. Lipscomb\u2019s funds for his own use. Mr. Maignan explained that he deposited the settlement check into his operating account to expedite the transfer to Ms. Lipscomb. Although Respondent\u2019s bank records show some discrepancies between electronic and paper records of balances, Ms. Lipscomb received her funds appropriately after their belated deposit. Thus, Respondent did not misappropriate his client\u2019s funds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>Judge Krauser concluded, as recommendations of law, that Respondent\u2019s contentions as to violations of Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct (MRPC) 1.1 and 1.3 were dismissed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She then concluded that \u201cPetitioner failed to establish that Respondent wrongfully misappropriated Ms. Lipscomb\u2019s funds to his own use or failed to communicate with her;\u201d thus, Respondent did not violate MRPC 1.4, 1.5, 8.1, or 8.4; Maryland Rule 16-606 or 16-607; or Section 10-306 of the Md. Code, Business Occupations and Professions Article. Nonetheless, the hearing judge resolved that Respondent violated MRPC 1.15(a)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and 5.3(a) and (b),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as well as Maryland Rule 16-604, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-4\">Clear and convincing evidence, including Respondent\u2019s admissions, establishes that Respondent failed to supervise the handling of Ms. Lipscomb\u2019s settlement funds properly by his office staff, and failed to deposit those funds in his trust account. By failing to supervise the handling of Ms. Lipscomb\u2019s settlement funds, and failing to safeguard those funds, Respondent violated Rules 1.15 and 5.3 of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct. Further, Respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>violated Maryland Rule 16-604, by depositing Ms. Lipscomb\u2019s settlement check into his regular business account.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AT\">The Majority opinion in the present case, although paying brief lip service to the standards of appellate review of the hearing judge\u2019s fact-finding (Maj. slip op. at 5), rushes by the fuller context for those standards in its haste to replace her fact-finding with its own version.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">We are supposed to accept a hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact unless we determine that they are clearly erroneous. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Stolarz, </em>379 Md. 387, 397, 842 A.2d 42, 47 (2004); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Culver, </em>371 Md. 265, 274, 808 A.2d 1251, 1256 (2002). This deference accorded to the hearing judge is due, in part, because the fact finder is in the best position to assess the demeanor-based credibility of a witness. <em>Stolarz, </em>379 Md. at 398, 842 A.2d at 48; <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Sheridan, </em>357 Md. 1, 17, 741 A.2d 1143, 1152 (1999); <em>see also </em>Maryland Rule 16-759(b)(2)(B) (\u201cThe Court shall give due regard to the opportunity of the hearing judge to assess the credibility of witnesses.\u201d). The hearing judge is permitted to \u201cpick and choose which evidence to rely upon\u201d from a conflicting array when determining findings of fact. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Fezell, </em>361 Md. 234, 253, 760 A.2d 1108, 1118 (2000) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">In deciding whether the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous where exceptions are filed, this Court looks first to Maryland Rule 16-759(b)(2)(B), which states that \u201cthe Court of Appeals shall determine whether the findings of fact have been proven by the requisite standard of proof set out in Rule 16-757(b).\u201d Under Maryland Rule 16-757(b), where exceptions to findings of fact are filed by Bar Counsel, we consider that Bar Counsel, before the hearing judge, \u201chas the burden of proving the averments of the petition by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d <em>See also Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. DiCicco, </em>369 Md. 662, 681, 802 A.2d 1014, 1025 (2002) (\u201cClear and convincing evidence must be more than a mere preponderance but not beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d) (internal quotations omitted) (citations omitted). Thus, where the exceptions are to findings made that were favorable to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>respondent attorney, under Maryland Rule 16-757(b), we consider also that the attorney \u201cwho asserts an affirmative defense or a matter of mitigation or extenuation has the burden of proving the defense or matter by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See also Garfield, </em>369 Md. at 99, 797 A.2d at 765 (stating that \u201can attorney in a disciplinary proceeding need only establish factual matters in defense of an attorney\u2019s position by the preponderance of the evidence, including whether mitigating circumstances existed at the time of the alleged misconduct\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Applying these standards, and based on my review of the entire record, I would overrule Bar Counsel\u2019s exceptions and affirm the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions in the Lipscomb matter. Thus, Respondent would have violated only MRPC 1.15(a) and 5.3(a) and (b), as well as Maryland Rule 16-604.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Bar Counsel excepted to Judge Krauser\u2019s factual determination that \u201cthe bank records do not evidence deposit of the settlement check until January 2003.\u201d While Judge Krauser did not explicate specifically the basis for her factual finding in this regard, she did highlight the testimonial evidence offered by Respondent. Respondent presented his own testimony and that of Ms. Terri Anthony, a former office manager in his law firm. As the hearing judge noted, Ms. Anthony, who arrived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>on the scene shortly after the receipt of Ms. Lipscomb\u2019s settlement check in September 2002, testified that in December 2002 she discovered the check in a drawer in the former office manager\u2019s desk and immediately notified Respondent. Respondent testified that he was surprised to find that the check had not been deposited in September 2002 in accordance with his instructions to his office staff.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">In contrast, to demonstrate that Respondent or his agent deposited the check on or about 18 September 2002, Petitioner relied upon documentary evidence. This evidence included stamp markings on the reverse side of the settlement check stating \u201cBank of America, NA\u201d and 19 September 2002. The date is found in three separate locations on the back of the check. Additionally, Petitioner introduced an affidavit from a representative of Respondent\u2019s bank who supplied copies of deposit slips and accompanying checks for two separate aggregate deposit transactions \u2014 $4,756.00 on 18 September 2002 and $4,060.00 on 6 January 2003. The affidavit indicates that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>Ms. Lipscomb\u2019s $4,000.00 settlement check was included in the $4,756.00 deposit transaction on 18 September 2002. Petitioner corroborated this assertion with Respondent\u2019s own bank statement records for September 2002, which show an aggregate deposit on 18 September 2002 of $4,756.00, and January 2003, which show an aggregate deposit on 6 January 2003 of $4,060.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">It is not for this Court to re-weigh the competing evidence, no matter its view as to the arguably more compelling nature of parts of the evidence had it been the fact-finder. Considering Respondent\u2019s preponderance of the evidence burden as set forth in Maryland Rule 16-757(b), I am unable to conclude that Judge Krauser\u2019s findings of fact with regard to the deposit date of the settlement check are clearly erroneous. She listened to the testimony and observed the demeanor of several witnesses, in addition, presumably, to reviewing the Petitioner\u2019s documentary evidence bearing on this point. As stated, <em>supra, </em>the hearing judge is allowed to choose from the competing evidence that upon which she or he elects to rely. Therefore, I would overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Predicated on having its factual exception to the deposit date of the settlement funds sustained, Petitioner also took exception to Judge Krauser\u2019s refusal to conclude specifically, in her finding of a violation of MRPC 1.15(a),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that Respondent misappropriated his client\u2019s funds and thus violated that component of the Rule, and MRPC 1.15(b) as well. With respect to MRPC 1.15(a), Petitioner requests this Court to conclude specifically that Respondent misappropriated Ms. Lipscomb\u2019s funds.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We have defined misappropriation as \u201cany unautho<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>rized use by an attorney of [a] client\u2019s funds entrusted to him [or her], whether or not temporary or for personal gain or benefit.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Glenn, </em>341 Md. 448, 484, 671 A.2d 463, 481 (1996) (internal quotations omitted) (alterations in original) (citations omitted); <em>see also Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Morehead, </em>306 Md. 808, 817, 511 A.2d 520, 525 (1986) (stating that the attorney\u2019s use of \u201cthe funds of his client for his own benefit constitutes misappropriation\u201d). To undermine Judge Krauser\u2019s conclusion of law that \u201cPetitioner failed to establish that Respondent wrongfully misappropriated Ms. Lipscomb\u2019s funds to his own use,\u201d Petitioner relied upon its factual exception argument as to the deposit date of the settlement funds. Petitioner asserted that, because the settlement funds were deposited on or about 18 September 2002 in the law firm\u2019s general operating bank account, which is the bank account into which the parties agree the funds were deposited ultimately, Respondent misappropriated Ms. Lipscomb\u2019s funds when the account balance fell below $4,000.00, the amount of Ms. Lipscomb\u2019s settlement check, and even fell to a negative balance at some point before Ms. Lipscomb was paid. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Sperling, </em>380 Md. 180, 192, 844 A.2d 397, 404-05 (2004) (noting that \u201ca shortfall in an attorney\u2019s trust account ... places clients and others whose funds are being held at some considerable risk\u201d); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Bernstein, </em>363 Md. 208, 229, 768 A.2d 607, 618 (2001) (\u201cThis Court, however, has stated that the rule against misappropriation is concerned with the risk of loss, not only the actual loss.\u201d) (internal quotations omitted) (citations omitted). Because, I would conclude <em>supra, </em>Judge Krauser\u2019s contrary finding of fact with regard to the deposit date of the settlement funds is not clearly erroneous, Respondent did not misappropriate Ms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>Lipscomb\u2019s funds as the evidence does not reveal that the account balance fell below $4,000.00 after the date the hearing judge determined Respondent deposited the funds. Thus, this exception should be overruled, in my view.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">Regarding MRPC 1.15(b), Petitioner argued that Respondent failed to promptly deliver the settlement payment, pointing to the delay between when Respondent\u2019s office received the funds in September 2002 and Ms. Lipscomb\u2019s receipt of the money in February 2003. Judge Krauser determined, however, that \u201cthe evidence d[id] not establish that [Respondent] failed to communicate with Ms. Lipscomb\u201d regarding her settlement check, and that \u201cscheduling conflicts prevented Ms. Lipscomb from meeting [Respondent] in his office\u201d to transfer the settlement proceeds. Although we have stated, in the context of analyzing a MRPC 1.15(b) violation, that \u201c[a] lawyer should hold settlement funds with the care of a professional fiduciary,\u201d at no time did Respondent fail to recognize Ms. Lipscomb\u2019s interest in the funds he possessed. <em>Stolarz, </em>379 Md. at 400, 842 A.2d at 49 (citation omitted). The length of the delay (five months) in transmitting the proceeds to Ms. Lipscomb does not by itself necessarily yield a violation of MRPC 1.15(b). <em>See, e.g., Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Mininsohn, </em>380 Md. 536, 571, 846 A.2d 353, 374 (2004) (concluding a MRPC 1.15(b) violation where the attorney held the client\u2019s funds for over one year). Accordingly, Respondent did not fail to deliver promptly those funds in violation of MRPC 1.15(b). The exception ought to be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Finally, Petitioner excepted to Judge Krauser\u2019s determination that Respondent did not violate either MRPC 1.1 or 8.4(d). With regard to MRPC 1.1, even if we were to assume Petitioner did not dismiss the claim before the hearing judge, the evidence does not indicate that Respondent violated the competency obligation of MRPC 1.1. Additionally, there is nothing in the record to support a conclusion that Respondent \u201cengage[d] in conduct that [wa]s prejudicial to the administration of justice\u201d and thus violated MRPC 8.4(d). Consequently, these exceptions ought to be overruled as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>As to the appropriate sanction, the Majority accepts Bar Counsel\u2019s recommended indefinite suspension. As noted, Judge Krauser gratuitously recommended a written reprimand. I would reject both suggestions.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">For unintentional misappropriation that does not result in financial loss to the client, an indefinite suspension, with or without a temporal limitation on when re-admission may be sought, ordinarily is appropriate. <em>DiCicco, </em>369 Md. at 687, 802 A.2d at 1028. In <em>DiCicco, supra, </em>we determined that an indefinite suspension with the right to reapply in ninety days was appropriate for violations of MRPC 1.15(a) and (c) and 8.4(a), as well as Maryland Rules 16-607(a) and 16-609. 369 Md. at 686, 688, 802 A.2d at 1027, 1028. With regard to the MRPC 1.15(a) violation, we noted the hearing judge\u2019s determination that DiCicco \u201con occasion, used [the escrow account] as if it also served as his personal bank account.\u201d <em>DiCicco, </em>369 Md. at 676, 802 A.2d at 1022 (internal quotations omitted). No evidence substantiates a similar situation in Respondent\u2019s case. In light of Judge Krauser\u2019s factual finding of a December 2002 deposit date of the settlement check, which I would affirm, an indefinite suspension is inappropriate in the present case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">For co-mingling of client and attorney funds, as was the case here, suspension from the practice of law for a finite period of time is appropriate.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Although we have stated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>\u201cevery attorney is deemed to know the Rules of Professional Conduct and is charged with the knowledge of how to operate and maintain a trust account,\u201d a finite suspension is in accordance with the nature and gravity of the violations and intent involved in Respondent\u2019s circumstances, and aligns with our recent treatment of analogous cases. <em>Bernstein, </em>363 Md. at 228, 768 A.2d at 618; <em>see also Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Adams, </em>349 Md. 86, 89-90, 706 A.2d 1080, 1081-82 (1998), the attorney violated both MRPC 1.15(a) and Maryland Rule 16-604. The attorney tendered a check drawn from his law firm\u2019s operating account to pay to the Comptroller of the Treasury the client\u2019s negotiated tax delinquency settlement of $2,000.00. <em>Adams, </em>349 Md. at 91, 706 A.2d at 1082. The client pledged to provide immediately a check that would be deposited in the operating account to cover the client\u2019s obligation. <em>Id. </em>Before the client provided the attorney the funds to cover the attorney\u2019s check to the Comptroller, the attorney\u2019s check was returned on two separate occasions due to a lack of funds in the attorney\u2019s operating account. <em>Id. </em>Although the client eventually presented a check to the attorney for $1,900.00, the operating account nonetheless lacked sufficient funds to cover the obligation due to an overdraft balance which pre-existed the dishonored check tendered to the Comptroller. <em>Adams, </em>349 Md. at 92, 706 A.2d at 1082-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Under Maryland Rule 16-604, we determined that the client\u2019s payment of $1,900.00 could not be considered a repay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>ment for an advanced expense, and thus failed to qualify for exemption under the rule as being deposited into a trust account or forwarded directly to a third party, as the attorney \u201ccould not loan what he did not have.\u201d <em>Adams, </em>349 Md. at 95, 706 A.2d at 1084. Because the attorney neither deposited the funds into a trust account nor forwarded the money to the Comptroller, he violated Maryland Rule 16-604. <em>Adams, </em>349 Md. at 95-96, 706 A.2d at 1084-85. We also sustained the hearing court\u2019s conclusion of a MRPC 1.15(a) violation because we concluded that the initial payment was actually the client\u2019s own funds, <em>supra, </em>which should have been delivered by the attorney to the Comptroller, and thus could not be considered a repayment as the attorney argued. <em>Adams, </em>349 Md. at 96, 706 A.2d at 1085. As a result, the attorney was required to safeguard the funds under MRPC 1.15(a). <em>Id. </em>In determining the appropriate sanction, we considered as factors that: (a) the attorney unintentionally mishandled the client\u2019s funds; (b) the attorney had no other disciplinary violations; (c) the attorney acted with good intention; and, (d) the attorney eventually paid the Comptroller with the money the client gave to him. <em>Adams, </em>349 Md. at 98-99, 706 A.2d at 1086. Ultimately, we deemed that an appropriate sanction was a thirty-day suspension from the practice of law, together with a requirement that Adams\u2019 conduct with regard to his operating and trust accounts be supervised by another attorney for one year, at Adams\u2019 expense. <em>Adams, </em>349 Md. at 99, 706 A.2d at 1086.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">In <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. McClain, </em>373 Md. 196, 212, 817 A.2d 218, 228 (2003), the attorney was found to have violated MRPC 1.15 by failing to retain in escrow the entire amount given to him by a successful bidder at a foreclosure sale. He also violated Maryland Rule 16-606 by failing to properly name and designate an escrow account as an attorney trust account. <em>Id. </em>The hearing court rejected McClain\u2019s dual explanations that he withdrew the money under a belief that he had sufficient funds on hand from prior unclaimed fees or that he was entitled to the withdrawn portion as payment for services rendered. <em>McClain, </em>373 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>at 205, 817 A.2d at 224. In assessing the appropriate sanction, we considered: (a) the lack of evidence establishing willful or conscious violations; (b) that the violations were corrected shortly after the attorney was made aware of the problems; (c) the attorney took a course in escrow management following the violations; and, (d) the lack of prior disciplinary proceedings against the attorney. <em>McClain, </em>373 Md. at 212, 817 A.2d at 228. Consequently, we determined that a thirty-day suspension was apposite. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\"><em>Adams </em>and <em>McClain </em>guide my consideration of the appropriate sanction here. The conduct of Respondent was sloppy and negligent, but not willful or intentional. This was Respondent\u2019s first involvement with the attorney disciplinary process. Respondent deposited the settlement check into the firm\u2019s business operating account, which Judge Krauser correctly concluded was a violation of Maryland Rule 16-604, in an effort to remit more expeditiously the money to Ms. Lipscomb. Ms. Lipscomb received the entire amount of settlement funds due her. The likelihood of repeating the violative conduct also is an important factor in determining an appropriate sanction. <em>Seiden, </em>373 Md. at 422, 818 A.2d at 1116 (citation omitted). Judge Krauser noted in her written recommendation that Respondent took several remedial actions to improve the operations of his law firm. Specifically, Judge Krauser found the following facts that she apparently anticipated might be of aid to this Court in considering a sanction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-6\">In late 2002, on the advice of his accountant, he purchased a new office management system, including a training program from himself and his office manager, to record the receipt and disbursement of all funds, correlate retainer agreements with billing, and document trust account transactions. He now prepares written retainer agreements for every client and service, whether for contingent or fixed fee arrangements, for use in the new system. He has improved the office\u2019s record keeping system, to provide ready access to retainer agreements and to separate wordprocessing functions from financial transactions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>In the past three years, Respondent has participated in several courses for Maryland attorneys, and others offered by the District of Columbia and Federal Bar Associations, regarding ethics, office practice management, and management of escrow accounts. Upon learning of the hazards of electronic banking in February 2003, Respondent transferred the firm\u2019s banking business to a bank with which he conducts transactions personally.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-5\">In sum, Respondent recognized his weakness in office management almost immediately, and spent considerable time and money to improve his ability to supervise and manage his firm within the first year of its existence. Petitioner does not dispute that these improvements have prevented any recurrence of the errors committed, and should prevent such errors in the future.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">I would impose a thirty-day suspension from the practice of law as the proper sanction for Respondent\u2019s violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">Chief Judge BELL and Judge GREENE authorize me to state that they join in this dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b338-8\">.

His defense was that it was mislaid by staff after receipt and not rediscovered until December and thereafter deposited.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">Apparently wishing to have it both ways, the Majority opinion, at slip op. 10, then elects to \"accept\u201d part of Respondent\u2019s testimonial evidence when it states that \"[n]otwithstanding [Maignan's] admission to the contrary in his letter to [Bar Counsel], we accept that respondent was unaware until at least late December that the check had been received and deposited.\u201d This, to me, looks like an appellate \"picking- and-choosing\u201d in its exercise of appellate fact-finding, a prerogative denied to us by our own rules in such cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b354-6\">. Judge Krauser concluded that Respondent violated MRPC 1.15 because he \u201cfail[ed] to safeguard\u201d Ms. Lipscomb's settlement funds by not depositing the funds into a trust account; yet, she did not indicate explicitly which provision of MRPC 1.15 Respondent violated. As noted <em>supra, </em>it appears from the context of her findings of fact and conclusions of law that Judge Krauser determined that Respondent violated MRPC 1.15(a) only.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b354-7\">. The word \u201cmisappropriation\u201d, as such, does not appear explicitly in the language of MRPC 1.15. We, however, have discerned violations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>described as misappropriations in connection with MRPC 1.15 violations. <em>See, e.g., Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Glenn, </em>341 Md. 448, 484, 671 A.2d 463, 481 (1996) (\"In violating Rule 1.15 and Rule BU9, [which prohibits using funds required to be deposited in a trust account for any unauthorized purpose,] Respondent misappropriated client funds.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b357-6\">. Although we have sanctioned attorneys with indefinite suspensions, with the right to reapply after a specified period of time, for violations of MRPC 1.15, these results generally were administered in conjunction with a determination of misappropriation. <em>See, e.g., Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Sperling, </em>380 Md. 180, 844 A.2d 397 (2004); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Seiden, </em>373 Md. 409, 818 A.2d 1108 (2003); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm'n v. Culver, </em>371 Md. 265, 808 A.2d 1251 (2002); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. DiCicco, </em>369 Md. 662, 802 A.2d 1014 (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b357-7\">. As Judge Wilner noted in dissent in <em>Bernstein, </em>however, co-mingling does not insulate attorneys necessarily from being found to have engaged in misappropriation. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-8\">The co-mingling of client and attorney funds always creates the potential for misappropriation, even when there is no intent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>misappropriate. A misappropriation necessarily occurs whenever the attorney withdraws funds from a co-mingled account for his or her own purpose and, as a result, leaves the account insufficient to cover all client funds, and such a misappropriation is never innocent. It is not necessarily willful, however, or for the conscious purpose of unlawfully taking funds held in trust for another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-7\"><em>Bernstein, </em>363 Md. at 231, 768 A.2d at 619-20 (Wilner, J., dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
