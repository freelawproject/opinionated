Allen Whitehead, respondent, was disbarred by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, based upon respondent\u2019s consent. Bar Counsel, on behalf of the Attorney Grievance Commission, petitioner, pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-773(b),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and based on the misconduct for which respondent was disbarred in the District of Columbia filed a Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action against respondent for violation of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct (MRPC).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The petition alleged that the respondent unethically and unprofessionally violated MRPC 8.4 and 1.15.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Petitioner also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>alleged that respondent violated Maryland Rules 16-609 and Maryland Code (1989, 2004 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 10-306 and 10-307 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article. On June 16, 2005, this Court issued a Show Cause Order pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-773(e).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Both parties filed their responses to the Show Cause Order and oral arguments were heard on December 5, 2005. Petitioner asked this Court to impose a \u201creciprocal\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> sanction and disbar respondent. Respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>argued that, under Maryland law, suspension was the appropriate sanction for his conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Respondent was admitted as a member of the Bar of this Court on December 1, 1973. He practiced in Maryland and the District of Columbia until 1999, when he moved to New York. Throughout his legal career, respondent has concentrated in estate and trusts law. In December of 1998, he became involved in the District of Columbia in the administration of the proceeds from a medical malpractice settlement. Then, in September of 1999, he was appointed as the Conservator of those funds.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">Upon allegations that respondent had paid legal fees to himself in the amount of $40,200.00 for his services in that case without prior court approval, he was removed from his post.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As a result of his conduct, the District of Columbia Bar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>Counsel initiated proceedings against respondent. Respondent represented himself during the disciplinary proceedings and, according to him, was led to believe that the infraction subjected him to automatic disbarment in the District of Columbia. Accordingly, respondent filed an affidavit consenting to disbarment from the Bar of the District of Columbia. In that affidavit, respondent admitted to taking the fees prior to court approval and stated that the fees were reimbursed. The District of Columbia Court of Appeals, on consideration of the affidavit, a report and recommendation from the Board on Professional Responsibility, and a letter from Bar Counsel, disbarred respondent by consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">\u201cReciprocal\u201d discipline cases are adjudicated according to Maryland Rule 16-773. Under subsection (b), \u201c[u]pon receiving and verifying information from any source that in another jurisdiction an attorney has been disciplined ..., Bar Counsel may file a Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action in the Court of Appeals pursuant to Rule 16-751(a)(2).\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Court, then, issues a show cause order as required by subsection (c). After the parties respond to the show cause order, the Court <em>\u201cmay </em>immediately impose <em>corresponding </em>discipline,\u201d assign the matter to a judge for a hearing, or enter \u201cany other appropriate order.\u201d Rule 16\u2014773(f) (emphasis added). This subsection, entitled \u201cAction by Court of Appeals,\u201d makes it clear that it is within the Court\u2019s discretion as to which sanction should be imposed upon the attorney. The rule states that the Court <em>may </em>impose \u201ccorresponding discipline,\u201d not that it <em>shall </em>impose \u201cidentical discipline.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b717-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>In making a determination in \u201creciprocal\u201d disciplinary cases, this Court generally gives deference to the factual findings of the original jurisdiction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-4\">\u201c(g) Conclusive effect of adjudication. Except as provided in subsections (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this Rule, a final adjudication in a disciplinary or remedial proceeding by another court, agency, or tribunal that an attorney has been guilty of professional misconduct or is incapacitated is conclusive evidence of that misconduct or incapacity in any proceeding under this Chapter. The introduction of such evidence does not preclude the Commission or Bar Counsel from introducing additional evidence or preclude the attorney from introducing evidence or otherwise showing cause why no discipline or lesser discipline should be imposed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqu\">Rule 16\u2014773(g); <em>see also Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Weiss, </em>389 Md. 531, 886 A.2d 606 (2005); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Scroggs, </em>387 Md. 238, 249, 874 A.2d 985, 992 (2005); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Ayres-Fountain, </em>379 Md. 44, 56, 838 A.2d 1238, 1245 (2003); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Cafferty, </em>376 Md. 700, 703, 831 A.2d 1042, 1045-46 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"AeX\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the only factual finding by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals is contained in the order of disbarment by consent. The order states that the sanction is based upon respondent\u2019s affidavit in which he stated: \u201cI was appointed as Conservator, I took fees (which later were reimbursed) prior to Court approval.\u201d In keeping with the general spirit of Rule 16-773(g) we accept the District of Columbia Court of Appeals\u2019 finding that respondent violated the rules of professional conduct by taking fees without prior court approval. We must, however, determine whether the sanction imposed by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals is appropriate under the circumstances of this case, especially since in this Court, the attorney has not consented to disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">A. Reciprocal Discipline Sanctions</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">Maryland Rule 16-773(e) is titled \u201cexceptional circumstances,\u201d it provides that \u201c[rjeciprocal discipline <em>shall not be </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number><em>ordered, </em>if Bar Counsel or the attorney demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence\u201d any of five different conditions. Rule 16-773(e) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It does not define the term \u201creciprocal discipline\u201d as to whether it refers to process, findings, sanctions, or all three. The use of the language \u201cshall not be ordered\u201d does not imply that, in the absence of any of the five exceptions, the Court <em>shall </em>find that the same sanction must be imposed even if the findings of the foreign court as to misconduct are accepted. To the contrary, this language reads so as to limit the ability of this Court to rely solely on the original jurisdiction\u2019s findings as to misconduct when any of the enumerated exceptions are met. If Bar Counsel \u2014 or the sanctioned attorney \u2014 provides sufficient evidence showing that one or more of the exceptions exist, the Court cannot use its discretion as to whether to accept the findings as to misconduct and to impose a corresponding (but not necessarily the same) sanction, or a different sanction all together. If these exceptions exist, the Court cannot rely exclusively on the findings of the foreign jurisdiction and cannot summarily impose the same discipline. If, however, none of the exceptions exist the Court <em>may </em>do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">In further interpreting the meaning of subsection (e), we must evaluate it in the context of the entire Rule 16-773. Subsection (b) provides that Bar Counsel \u201cmay\u201d file a petition upon learning that an attorney has been disciplined in another state. Under subsection (d) the Court \u201cmay\u201d suspend the attorney from practice while the proceedings in Maryland are taking place. Then, under subsection (f), the Court \u201cmay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>immediately impose corresponding discipline,\u201d or it \u201cmay\u201d assign the case for a hearing, or it \u201cmay enter any other appropriate order.\u201d None of these provisions provide any indication that the findings and the sanction of the foreign court are required to be accepted. Only subsections (a), (c), and (h) use the mandatory language \u201cshall.\u201d Subsection (a) requires that the attorney \u201cshall\u201d inform Bar Counsel if he or she has been disciplined in another state; subsection (c) states that the Court \u201cshall\u201d issue a show cause order; subsection (h) orders that when the case is stayed in the original jurisdiction, any proceedings under the rule \u201cshall\u201d be stayed. Subsection (g), which establishes that an adjudication in another state is conclusive evidence of misconduct, does not relate to sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">In light of the fact that the sections dealing with sanctioning the attorney, (b), (d), and (f), use the permissive language \u201cmay,\u201d it is reasonable to interpret the use of the language \u201cshall not be ordered ... if \u2019 to be read as permissive language also. Were that section to be read as requiring the Court to impose the same or equivalent sanction (if one exists) unless any of the circumstances in subsection (e) were present, it would render \u2014 at the very least \u2014 part of subsection (f) meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">The rule specifically provides that the Court shall not impose the same sanction if \u201cthe conduct established ... <em>warrants substantially different discipline in this State.\u201d </em>Rule 16\u2014773(e)(4) (emphasis added). The most reasonable way to determine whether the attorney\u2019s conduct in another jurisdiction <em>warrants substantially different discipline in this state </em>is to review our own cases and determine which sanction would have been adequate had the case originated in this State. <em>Weiss, </em>889 Md. at 548, 886 A.2d at 616.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">This reading of the rule is consistent with practically every prior holding of this Court in \u201creciprocal\u201d discipline cases. We have repeatedly stated that in these cases, we are prone, but not required, to impose the same sanction the original jurisdiction imposed. <em>Weiss, </em>389 Md. at 546, 886 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>at 615.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Furthermore, in \u201creciprocal\u201d discipline cases \u201c[w]e are required to assess for ourselves the propriety of the sanction imposed by the other jurisdiction and that recommended by the Commission.\u201d <em>Scroggs, </em>387 Md. at 254, 874 A.2d at 995 (citing <em>Gittens, </em>346 Md. at 326, 697 A.2d at 88). We have consistently pronounced:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-4\">\u201c When the Court considers the appropriate sanction in a case of reciprocal discipline, we look not only to the sanction imposed by the other jurisdiction <em>but to our own cases as well. </em>The sanction will depend on the unique facts and circumstances of each case, but with a view toward <em>consistent dispositions for similar misconduct.\u2019 \u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-5\"><em>Weiss, </em>389 Md. at 548, 886 A.2d at 616 (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Parsons, </em>310 Md. 132, 142, 527 A.2d 325, 330 (1987)). We do not take this position lightly. The Court views it as a <em>duty </em>to \u201cassess for itself the propriety of the sanction imposed by the other jurisdiction.\u201d <em>See e.g., Steinberg, </em>385 Md. at 704 n. 9, 870 A.2d at 608 n. 9; <em>Ayres-Fountain, </em>379 Md. at 57, 838 A.2d at 1246. It is clear that this language, used in essentially every \u201creciprocal\u201d discipline case, would be meaningless were the Court to apply the same sanction regardless of the state of the law in Maryland with respect to the proscribed conduct. Certainly, as acknowledged in Weiss, many (if not most) times we will come to the same conclusion as the original jurisdiction and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>impose an identical sanction. <em>See e.g., Willcher, </em>340 Md. at 220, 665 A.2d at 1060; <em>Roberson, </em>373 Md. at 357, 818 A.2d at 1077; <em>Cafferty, </em>376 Md. at 728, 831 A.2d at 1059; <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Moore, </em>301 Md. 169, 171, 482 A.2d 497, 498 (1984). When our cases, however, clearly demonstrate that we would apply a different sanction \u2014 had the conduct occurred or the case originated here \u2014 we need not follow the original jurisdiction\u2019s determination. To always follow the same sanction imposed by the originating jurisdiction might result in two different lines of sanctions for identical conduct; one in \u201creciprocal\u201d cases and a different one in cases originating in Maryland. This would lead to an inconsistency in sanctions that we try to avoid.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">We have applied this principle in a number of occasions. Most recently in <em>Weiss, </em>we found that disbarment was the appropriate sanction in Maryland for an attorney after he had been suspended in the District of Columbia for embezzling funds from his law firm. We determined that when the conduct involves stealing or like offenses, our cases clearly indicate that disbarment is the appropriate sanction absent compelling extenuating circumstances as the root cause of the misconduct. <em>Weiss, </em>389 Md. at 553, 886 A.2d at 618-19; <em>see also Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Goodman, </em>381 Md. 480, 850 A.2d 1157 (2004); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Post, </em>379 Md. 60, 839 A.2d 718 (2003); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Spery, </em>371 Md. 560, 810 A.2d 487 (2002); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. 376, 773 A.2d 463 (2001). In <em>Dechowitz, </em>this Court found that a conviction for possession of marijuana with intent to distribute required disbarment in Maryland, even though Dechowitz was only suspended in California where the conduct took place. <em>Dechowitz, </em>358 Md. at 192, 747 A.2d at 661. The District of Columbia and California courts imposed a different sanction from that which we normally imposed in such cases originating in Maryland. Thus, we declined to impose the same sanction. This principle is not only followed when the original jurisdiction does not impose a sanction that is as severe as we would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>impose had the conduct originated here, we also follow it when a lesser sanction is consistent with our experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">In <em>Parsons, </em>two attorneys were suspended for six months in the District of Columbia for forging a client\u2019s signature on a divorce complaint. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Parsons, </em>310 Md. 132, 527 A.2d 325 (1987). This Court determined that a ninety day suspension was the appropriate sanction in Maryland, due to a similar case decided eight months earlier. <em>Parsons, </em>310 Md. at 142, 527 A.2d at 330 (citing <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Maxwell, </em>307 Md. 600, 516 A.2d 570 (1986) (holding that a ninety day suspension was appropriate for an attorney\u2019s false signature on a deed)). Even though attorney discipline is for the primary purpose of protecting the public, the bar and public policy are served best by determinations consistent with other Maryland sanctions for similar misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">B. Public Policy for Attorney Discipline</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">The primary purpose of attorney discipline is the protection of the public, not the punishment of the attorney. <em>Weiss, </em>389 Md. at 547, 886 A.2d at 615; <em>Scroggs, </em>387 Md. at 254, 874 A.2d at 995; <em>Steinberg, </em>385 Md. at 703, 870 A.2d at 607; <em>Ayres-Fountain, </em>379 Md. at 58, 838 A.2d at 1246; <em>Cafferty, </em>376 Md. at 727, 831 A.2d at 1059; <em>Roberson, </em>373 Md. at 356, 818 A.2d at 1076; <em>McCoy, </em>369 Md. at 237, 798 A.2d at 1138. As Chief Judge Bell stated for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-7\">\u201c \u2018We have recognized that the public interest is served when this Court imposes a sanction which demonstrates to members of the legal profession the type of conduct that will not be tolerated.... Moreover, such a sanction represents the fulfillment by this Court of its responsibility \u201cto insist upon the maintenance of the integrity of the bar and to prevent the transgression of an individual lawyer from bringing its image into disrepute.\u201d... Therefore, the public interest is served when <em>sanctions designed to effect general and specific deterrence are imposed on an attorney </em>who violates the disciplinary rules.... Of course, what the ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>propriate sanction for the particular misconduct is, in the public interest, generally depends upon the facts and circumstances of the case____The attorney\u2019s prior grievance history, as well as facts in mitigation, constitute part of those facts and circumstances.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-5\"><em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Sperling, </em>380 Md. 180, 191, 844 A.2d 397, 404 (2004) (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Myers, </em>333 Md. 440, 447, 635 A.2d 1315, 1318 (1994)). This goal of effecting general and specific deterrence is best achieved by ensuring that every member of the bar clearly understands the standards of conduct to which he or she is expected to adhere and the consequences of failing to meet those standards. One of our goals, in maintaining these standards is to ensure that <em>consistent determinations </em>as to sanctions for similar misconduct are reached in our cases. Whether the case arises in this jurisdiction, or it comes to us as a \u201creciprocal\u201d discipline case, does not change this Court\u2019s duty to apply consistent treatment, i.e., sanctions-as far as is possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Our position on sanctions in \u201creciprocal\u201d cases has to do with ensuring consistency, which in turn provides the appropriate deterrent for incompetent, unscrupulous or unethical lawyers. Nor do we abandon well reasoned principles of comity in reaching our decision. As required by Rule 16-773(g), the heaviest weight is given to our sister jurisdictions\u2019 factual findings. From them we rarely stray. We deviate from their sanctions, however, when the history of our cases warrants a substantially different disposition, such as is the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">C. Appropriate Sanction in Maryland</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">In the case <em>sub judice </em>we must determine what sanction is typically imposed in Maryland when an attorney takes fees from funds held in trust without prior court approval. In <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Owrutsky, </em>322 Md. 334, 587 A.2d 511 (1991), an attorney took fees from two \u201cestates before they were earned and before approval of the Orphans\u2019 Court had been sought or obtained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 341, 587 A.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>514. The Court determined that his actions in taking the fees without approval and proper accounting came \u201cperilously close to misappropriation of funds for which, in the absence of extenuating circumstances, disbarment is ordinarily the appropriate sanction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 355, 587 A.2d at 521. The attorney, however, was suspended for a period of three years instead, based on the totality of the circumstances, including the fact that he had been a member of the Bar for nearly thirty years without a record of previous misconduct. <em>Id. </em>In the case at bar, respondent did not take the fees before they were improperly accounted for or earned. Respondent practiced in Maryland for twenty-six years before moving to New York and petitioner did not provide any evidence that respondent was disciplined on any other occasion. From the record it is not apparent that respondent\u2019s conduct was intentional. Furthermore, he returned the unapproved fees upon learning that taking them -without approval was inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">In <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Thompson, </em>376 Md. 500, 519, 830 A.2d 474, 485 (2003), an attorney violated the rules of professional conduct when he failed to pay employee withholding taxes and \u201cby improperly handling the ... estate, <em>i.e., </em>improperly distributing the assets, not paying inheritance taxes before distributing the assets, suing the heirs, distributing less than the heirs were entitled to under the will, and then, to add insult to injury, <em>retaining the $16,000.00 commission.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). The attorney had received a check for his commission, which he deposited into his personal account without approval from the Orphans\u2019 Court. We imposed an <em>indefinite suspension </em>with the right to reapply after one year. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the only confirmed allegation against respondent is that he paid himself fees, which he had earned, without prior court approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\"><em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Seiden, </em>373 Md. 409, 818 A.2d 1108 (2003), is also illustrative. In that case, an attorney managing an estate for a difficult client took his fee from the proceeds of a settlement without submitting a fee petition to the Orphans\u2019 Court. We imposed an <em>indefinite suspension </em>with the right to reapply within thirty days. <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>425, 818 A.2d at 1117. In arriving at our decision we took into consideration a number of mitigating factors: it was the attorney\u2019s first disciplinary proceeding in twenty-four years of practice, there was no evidence of intentional misappropriation or dishonesty, the attorney was remorseful for his conduct, he was cooperative throughout the proceedings, and the reason he had not filed the fee petition was due to his ill health. M; <em>see, also Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Sperling, </em>380 Md. 180, 844 A.2d 397 (2004) (attorney\u2019s negligent management of a trust account resulted in a $42,415.91 shortfall. The Court imposed an <em>indefinite suspension </em>with the right to reapply for admission after ninety days.); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Culver, </em>371 Md. 265, 808 A.2d 1251 (2002) (attorney collected $3,500.00 from his escrow account for services rendered to clients who challenged the fees and the attorney failed to have a written contingency agreement. The Court imposed an <em>indefinite suspension </em>with the right to reapply after thirty days).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">As demonstrated in the cases cited supra, the appropriate sanction for respondent\u2019s misconduct in Maryland is an indefinite suspension and not disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">D. Comity</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Because our decision today affects the weight given to the decisions of other states, we now address the role of comity<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>in the context of attorney discipline.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Supreme Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>Florida has provided a very persuasive explanation of the \u201creciprocal\u201d discipline doctrine. In reviewing that state\u2019s policy, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-4\">\u201cHere we note that to hold that Florida is not obligated to recognize and enforce the New York judgment of disbarment does not mean that it cannot do so if it elects. This brings us to an interpretation of Rule 11.02(6) and the determination of what effect this court intended to give foreign judgments of disbarment or other discipline when it adopted the rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-5\">\u201cIn considering the question of the effect to be given disciplinary judgments of a sister state, this court could have adopted the extreme position under which no recognition would be given such a judgment. The rational for rejecting this position is well explained in <em>Selling v. Radford, </em>1916, 243 U.S. 46, 49, 37 S.Ct. 377, 61 L.Ed. 585. Alternatively, the court could have adopted the opposite extreme under which such a judgment would be given automatic and complete effect by imposing the same discipline in Florida as imposed in a sister state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-6\">\u201cIn our view adoption of either of these extremes would amount to an abdication of this court\u2019s responsibility imposed by the Florida constitution. On the one hand, to ignore acts of professional misconduct merely because they occurred outside this state would be to ignore our duty to protect the people of this state from one who has been held by another state to be an unfit practitioner. On the other hand, to accept the second extreme would constitute an abdication of the responsibility imposed on this court to determine for itself, in proceedings conducted by it, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>under its direction, the fitness of those permitted to practice in this state.

By the plainest language the rule makes such a foreign judgment of guilt conclusive proof of such misconduct in a disciplinary proceeding in this state. Proof of guilt of the acts of misconduct adjudicated in the sister state is accomplished by simply proving the entry of the foreign judgment. This eliminates any necessity to retry the bare issue of guilt and makes unnecessary the production in Florida of testimony and evidence on this issue. The rule nether [sic] prescribes nor proscribes professional behavior. It relates solely to the question of proof of guilt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-5\"><em>Florida Bar v.

In Colorado an attorney was disbarred although the original jurisdiction, Arizona, had only suspended him for six months. <em>People v. Apker, </em>67 P.3d 23, 25 (Colo.2003). The Arizona court had found that the attorney had stolen client funds. <em>Id. </em>He was disbarred in Colorado because \u201c[t]he knowing conversion of client property almost invariably results in disbarment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>under Colorado law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As a result, the disciplinary board determined that a substantially different sanction was necessary from that imposed in Arizona. <em>Id.

We give that deference where it is due: to the other jurisdiction\u2019s factual findings. In terms of sanctions in \u201creciprocal\u201d cases, we agree with those jurisdictions that reserve the right to impose a sanction which is consistent with others imposed in cases originating in their jurisdictions. This policy is sound in that it ensures that every member of the Maryland Bar is held to the same standards regardless of where their misconduct takes place.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">Maryland Rule 16-773 governs discipline cases in which a foreign state has already acted to discipline the attorney for the same misconduct. Under that rule this Court may also impose a sanction upon a Maryland attorney who has already been disciplined in another jurisdiction for the same misconduct. This rule,, however, does not mandate that the same sanction must be imposed. In these types of case, this Court gives great deference to the other jurisdiction\u2019s factual findings. In addition, we are duty-bound to examine the other jurisdiction\u2019s sanction and determine whether that sanction is consistent with our disciplinary precedent. Where Maryland attorneys are given a substantially different sanction for similar conduct in cases originating in this State, to that imposed in the originating state, we may not follow the original jurisdiction\u2019s finding as to the sanction imposed. This result supports our policy of providing consistency in sanctioning for similar conduct for all members of the Maryland Bar. It furthers our goal to protect the public by ensuring that every Maryland attorney is held to consistent standards of conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">Indefinite suspension with the right to reapply after eighteen months is the appropriate sanction in this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED, FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION OF MARYLAND AGAINST H.

All of these conclusions are incorrect, and the Court\u2019s analysis is based upon a faulty interpretation of Rule 16-773.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">The District of Columbia Court of Appeals disbarred H. Allen Whitehead, the respondent, pursuant to Rule XI, \u00a7 12 of the Rules Governing the Admission to the Bar of the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>of Columbia,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which provides for disbarment by consent. The ground on which the respondent was disbarred was stated in the respondent\u2019s affidavit accompanying the petition for disbarment \u2014 he admitted: \u201cIn the Matter of Reginald Grayson, Intvp. No. 195-94, wherein I was appointed as Conservator, I took fees (which were later reimbursed) prior to Court approval.\u201d To be sure, in his affidavit, the respondent made no mention of, and certainly did not admit to, misappropriating $600,000 of estate funds, which, Bar Counsel alleged, he used for a real estate investment; instead, as we have seen, he only admitted taking legal fees without Court consent. It is, thus, arguable, as the majority concludes, that it was only on that basis that the respondent was disbarred.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>That the respondent\u2019s admission in the District of Columbia attorney discipline case was limited to the fee payment, and did not include the self-dealing alleged, is, in truth, immaterial to the proper analysis under Rule 16-773. Applying the proper analysis demonstrates that disbarment is the only appropriate sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">Moreover, in this Court the respondent\u2019s status is not simply that of one who has consented to disbarment; rather, on the basis of that consent<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u2014 from the admission it con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>tained \u2014 he has been found by the hearing court to have violated Rule 8.4(a), (b), (c) and (d). Either subsection (b) or (c) constitutes a finding of intentional misappropriation of estate funds. That finding, in turn, is supported by the respondent\u2019s admission that he took fees from the estate, as to which he was conservator, without court permission. <em>In re Reginald Grayson, Jr., </em>No. 195-94, Superior Court of the District of Columbia. In other cases, in which the hearing court has found a violation of Rule 8.4(b) or (c), where there has been an inappropriate handling of monies or in which a trust account has been out of balance, we have refused to allow a respondent to be heard to say, and certainly not to succeed in the argument, that there was no misappropriation found or that it was not intentional. <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Cafferty, </em>376 Md. 700, 723, 831 A.2d 1042, 1056-7 (2003); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Sabghir, </em>350 Md. 67, 68, 710 A.2d 926, 926 (1998); <em>Attorney Griev.

That basis, moreover, is consistent with the majority\u2019s desire and apparent determination, to attain, and to maintain, internal consistency in attorney discipline cases. As we have so often stated, disbarment is the inexorable result of a finding of misappropriation, absent compelling extenuating circumstances. <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Bakas, </em>323 Md. 395, 403, 593 A.2d 1087, 1091 (1991); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Spery, </em>371 Md. 560, 568, 810 A.2d 487, 491-92 (2002); <em>Attorney Griev.

Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. 376, 410, 773 A.2d 463, 483 (2001). That the respondent did not appreciate, or was not told, that disbarment need not be the sanction for the premature taking of a fee is neither a compelling nor extenuating circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">A definition of \u201creciprocal\u201d is \u201ccorresponding; equivalent.\u201d (Blacks Law Dictionary, 7th Edition, 2000). \u201cCorresponding\u201d means \u201cto be analogous or similar; to agree in amount, position, etc.; to be in harmony or agreement.\u201d (Oxford Concise Dictionary, 9th edition, 1995). As such, \u201creciprocal\u201d is an appropriate word to use in describing our practice under Rule 16-773, at least it was, until this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Weiss, </em>389 Md. 531, 546, 886 A.2d 606, 614-15 (2005). The purpose of Rule 16-773 is to ensure that two jurisdictions with the same interest in regulating the legal profession and, in the process and necessarily, protecting the public, ordinarily will impose the same (corresponding, equivalent) discipline upon a violating attorney for the same misconduct. One explanation for the use of the word \u201ccorresponding\u201d is that there are some instances in which a particular form of sanction which exists in one jurisdiction has no exact equivalent in another jurisdiction; therefore, the reciprocating jurisdiction must replicate the sanction as closely as possible within the framework which exists in its state. <em>See, e.g., Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Ruffin, </em>369 Md. 238, 798 A.2d 1139 (2002). (concluding that, because the original sanction ordered in Arizona, a seven month suspension, permitted reinstatement only by order of the court, it thus was most like an indefinite suspension in Maryland, the Court ordered an indefinite suspension).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">Rule 16-773 addresses reciprocal discipline and inactive status. Subsection (e) of that Rule requires that, if exception<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>al circumstances are shown by clear and convincing evidence, reciprocal discipline <em>shall not </em>be imposed (ordered).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> To be sure, the Rule does not state explicitly that reciprocal discipline must be ordered unless exceptional circumstances are proven. Nevertheless, the converse necessarily implies that reciprocal discipline ordinarily may not, or should not, be avoided when there are <em>no </em>\u201cexceptional\u201d circumstances shown by either Bar Counsel or the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">Our analysis in a reciprocal discipline case has its foundation in two co-existing duties \u2014 to protect the public, an underlying purpose of our sanctioning scheme, and to analyze the facts of each case \u2014 and several policy goals \u2014 to ensure consistency of sanction and to demonstrate comity towards our sister jurisdictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">First, this Court is required to determine the propriety of a sanction issued by another jurisdiction by looking to the facts and circumstances particular to each case. <em>Attorney Griev. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number><em>Comm\u2019n v.

Case law demonstrates that there are several important considerations which affect our decision to impose reciprocal discipline: the location of the attorney\u2019s practice, where the misconduct actually occurred, and the seriousness with which the other jurisdiction treats the misconduct.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See Attorney Griev.

Our cases have demonstrated that, when all other facts and considerations indicate that reciprocity is appropriate, internal consistency, while desirable, as a theoretical matter, is not an end in and of itself and, thus, should not alter the outcome. <em>Ayres-Fountain, </em>379 Md. 44, 56-58 838 A.2d 1238, 1245-1247 (2003) (ordering reciprocal discipline of indefinite suspension though, ordinarily, such misconduct would warrant disbarment in this state); <em>Saul, </em>337 Md. 258, 653 A.2d 430 (1995) (reciprocating although sanction was not consistent with Maryland practice, due to mitigating circumstances considered by the original court); <em>Sparrow, </em>314 Md. 421, 550 A.2d 1150 (1988) (reciprocating, although sanction was not consistent with Maryland practice, due to mitigating circumstances presented to, and considered by, the original court). <em>See also Gittens, </em>346 Md. 316, 697 A.2d 83 (1997); <em>Richardson,, </em>350 Md. 354, 712 A.2d 525 (1998) (issue of consistency not material to the decision to reciprocate); <em>McCoy, </em>369 Md. 226, 798 A.2d 1132 (2002) (same); <em>Ruffin, </em>369 Md. 238, 798 A.2d 1139 (2002) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"AZo\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>The majority cites three cases in which we refused to impose reciprocal sanctions. In <em>Weiss, </em>the most recent case, I dissented for the same reasons that I am dissenting in this case. In that dissent, I addressed both <em>Dechowitz, </em>358 Md. 184, 747 A.2d 657 (2000), and <em>Parsons, </em>310 Md. 132, 527 A.2d 325 (1987). As I said, only one of the cases, <em>Dechowitz, </em>may actually support the majority. <em>Weiss, </em>389 Md. at 568-69, 886 A.2d at 628 (Bell, C.J. dissenting). In that case, we did impose a more severe sanction in a reciprocal discipline case, disbarment, rather than a period of suspension. <em>Dechowitz, </em>358 Md. at 193, 747 A.2d at 661. Thus, it is an exception to Rule 16-773, perhaps falling under Rule 16-773(e)(4). It is significant, however, that the attorney in that case was still on probation when this Court considered the disciplinary petition. <em>Id. </em>at 191, 747 A.2d at 661.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\"><em>Parsons </em>is an unusual case. There, following a precedent set five months earlier in a non-reciprocal attorney discipline case with facts identical to those of <em>Parsons, </em>we suspended Parsons for ninety days, rather than six months, which suspension was not to run concurrently with the suspension imposed by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. <em>Id. </em>310 Md. at 143, 527 A.2d at 330. It is significant that the District\u2019s suspension had already ended; therefore, it is likely that we would have deferred, by running our suspension concurrently, had that opportunity been available. Neither of these cases supports the majority\u2019s claim that internal consistency overrides the other policy concerns, or controls, our Rule 16-773 analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">In fact, the majority\u2019s approach to reciprocal discipline \u2014 a haphazard analysis whereby the Court may impose whatever discipline it sees fit, without regard to that issued by our sister states \u2014 compromises the very purpose reciprocal discipline professes to serve. By refusing to maintain and adhere to a standard by which reciprocal discipline is imposed, a Maryland attorney being disciplined under Rule 16-773 can not anticipate what kind of sanction he or she will receive, and on what basis. This does not promote consistency amongst the reciprocal States and cases; rather, it ensures that there will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>significant inconsistency. Indeed, the majority\u2019s approach encourages inconsistency among the reciprocal states. The majority may believe that it is, and, it in fact may be, creating internal consistency, that is, making the sanction imposed in Maryland reciprocal and non-reciprocal cases more consistent. But, because, at the same time it fosters and even exacerbates the inconsistency, in reciprocal discipline cases, between the sanctions imposed by this Court and the reciprocal states, what, I ask, is the purpose, then, of Rule 16-773?</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">The majority\u2019s single-minded focus upon internal consistency, thus, also has a secondary consequence, that of diminishing the importance of another of our policy goals \u2014 comity. The majority views comity as an excuse to override all other concerns \u2014 namely, those of consistency and protection of the public. <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Whitehead, </em>390 Md. at 677-83, 890 A.2d at 759-63 (2005). Certainly, this is not the purpose; in fact, comity and consistency must be balanced, and our duty to protect the public must always be paramount. The majority\u2019s approach would have us relegate this important goal to the outskirts of our analysis, drawing upon it only when convenient, or when we have already come to a conclusion based on what we perceive to be more important concerns. In fact, comity is <em>the </em>underlying, perhaps the only, purpose for Rule 16-773. Consequently, to allow internal consistency to override the Rule itself, again, makes our reciprocal discipline framework utterly and totally superfluous and meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">The majority is also imposing a lesser sanction because it believes that Rule 16-773(e)(4) is implicated. This is not the case. The purpose of Rule 16 \u2014 773(e)(4) is to provide an escape mechanism for those meritorious cases in which a sanction is unwarranted or is unduly harsh; by providing for <em>exceptional </em>circumstances, it ensures that when \u201cthe conduct established does not constitute misconduct in this State or it warrants <em>substantially different </em>discipline in this State,\u201d (emphasis added) reciprocal sanctions will not be imposed. Exceptional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>circumstances are those which are \u201cunusual; not typical.\u201d (Oxford Concise Dictionary, 9th Edition, 1995) <em>Substantially </em>different discipline is that which is \u201cof real importance, value, or validity; of large size or amount.\u201d (Id.). The purpose of such extreme language is to ensure that Rule 16-773(e)(4) remains a rarely-used exception, one which applies only when the discipline typically imposed in this state for the conduct at issue is drastically different than that imposed by the original jurisdiction. It is not an excuse for the Court to impose whatever discipline it sees fit, whenever it is dissatisfied with the sanction issued by the original jurisdiction. The Court\u2019s only burden under Rule 16-773(e) is to assess respondent\u2019s and Bar Counsel\u2019s arguments and to determine whether either side has proven the existence of an exception by clear and convincing evidence. It is the respondent\u2019s burden to prove that a lesser sanction, or no sanction, should be imposed. <em>See Sabghir, </em>350 Md. at 84, 710 A.2d at 934; <em>Richardson, </em>350 Md. at 371, 712 A.2d at 533; <em>McCoy, </em>369 Md. at 236-37, 798 A.2d at 1138; <em>Roberson, </em>373 Md. at 356, 818 A.2d at 1076; <em>Cafferty, </em>376 Md. at 727, 831 A.2d at 1058. To that end, the Court must analyze Maryland initiated cases in which attorneys have been sanctioned for misconduct identical to that committed by the reciprocal respondent. It should not, however, characterize every discrepancy in sanction as an exceptional circumstance prohibiting reciprocal discipline. This is nothing short of a deliberate dilution and distortion of the meaning of Rule 16-773(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">Judge RAKER and Judge WILNER join in the views expressed herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b713-9\">.

The provisions of this Rule 16-760 apply to an order under this section that disbars or suspends an attorney or that places the attorney on inactive status.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-13\">\"(g) <em>Conclusive Effect of Adjudication. </em>Except as provided in subsections (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this Rule, a final adjudication in a disciplinary or remedial proceeding by another court, agency, or tribunal that an attorney has been guilty of professional conduct or is incapacitated is conclusive evidence of that misconduct or incapacity in any proceeding under this Chapter. The introduction of such evidence does not preclude the Commission or Bar Counsel from introducing additional evidence or preclude the attorney from introducing evidence or otherwise showing cause why no discipline or lesser discipline should be imposed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-14\">\"(h) <em>Effect of stay in other jurisdiction. </em>If the other jurisdiction has stayed the discipline or inactive status, any proceedings under this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>rule shall be deferred until the stay is no longer operative and the discipline or inactive status becomes effective.\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b734-6\">. \"Section 12.

An attorney who is the subject of an investigation or a pending proceeding based on allegations of misconduct may consent to disbarment, but only by delivering to Bar Counsel an affidavit declaring the attorney\u2019s consent to disbarment and stating: \"(1) That the consent is freely and voluntarily rendered, that the attorney is not being subjected to coercion or duress, and that the attorney is fully aware of the implication of consenting to disbarment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-8\">\"(2) That the attorney is aware that there is currently pending an investigation into, or a proceeding involving, allegations of misconduct, the nature of which shall be specifically set forth in the affidavit;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-9\">\"(3) That the attorney acknowledges that the material facts upon which the allegations of misconduct are predicated are true; and \"(4) That the attorney submits the consent because the attorney knows that if disciplinary proceedings based on the alleged misconduct were brought, the attorney could not successfully defend against them. \"(b) Action by the Board and the Court. Upon receipt of the required affidavit, Bar Counsel shall file it and any related papers with the Board for its review and approval. Upon such approval, the Board shall promptly file it with the Court.

The order disbarring an attorney on consent shall be a matter of public record. However, the affidavit required under subsection (a) of this section shall not be publicly disclosed or made available for use in any other proceeding except by order of the Court or upon written consent of the attorney.\"</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b734-11\">. It is incorrect to state that neither of the District of Columbia courts\u2014 neither the Superior Court nor the Court of Appeals \u2014 had determined that the respondent had misappropriated the $600,000, in addition to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>taking legal fees. In its December 3, 2003 Order removing the respondent as conservator for the Reginald Grayson, Jr. estate, the Superior Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-6\">\"The Court heard the representations and admissions from Michael Grady, made on behalf of the Conservator, H. Allen Whitehead. The Conservator, by and through his attorney, admitted on the record that he had violated D.C.Code \u00a7 21-2060, D.C.Code 21-2068, SCR-PD 5(c) and SCR-PD 308. <em>Specifically, the Conservator admitted that he paid legal fees of $40,200.00 to himself without prior authorization and he entered into a self-dealing mortgage investment transaction, $600,000.00 of the adult ward's assets for the purchase of property located in New York City for himself and Aric Johnson </em>\u2014 such an investment by the Conservator represents a clear conflict of interest. Notwithstanding the Conservator\u2019s on the record admissions, Conservator seeks to tender his resignation to the Court, in lieu of removal from his post.\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-7\">Further, in the attorney discipline case, Bar Counsel for the District of Columbia specifically averred that the respondent had misappropriated funds on two occasions, began an investigation on both counts, and sought consent from respondent on both bases. Therefore, while it is true that the District of Columbia Court of Appeals did not specifically disbar the respondent based on his misappropriation of $600,000, because the respondent did not specifically admit such behavior in his affidavit, the record clearly demonstrates that the respondent did admit to two incidents of misappropriation.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b735-8\">. Noting that \"this Court generally gives deference to the factual findings of the original jurisdiction,\u201d <em>Attorney Griev. Comm'n v.

The majority observes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-7\">\"Interestingly, the rule gives Bar Counsel the discretion to file a petition after it learns of an attorney\u2019s misconduct in another state as evidenced by the use of the permissive language \"may file.\u201d It is argued, however, that \u2014 upon filing of the petition \u2014 this Court lacks any discretion in regards to the sanction being imposed under Rule 16-773(e), even though Bar Counsel has discretion not to file a petition in the first instance.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-8\"><em>Attorney Griev. Comm'n v. Whitehead, </em>390 Md. 663, 668 n. 8, 890 A.2d 751, 754 n. 8 (2005). I am not impressed. First, it is not at all unheard of that the prosecuting authority will be given broader discretion to initiate proceedings than the sanctioning authority is given to sanction. <em>See e.g. </em>Maryland Code (2002) \u00a7 14-101 of the Criminal Law Article, subsection (f) of which requires the state, if it intends to prosecute the defendant as a subsequent offender under the section, to comply with the applicable Maryland Rules. Maryland Rule 4-245(b) prescribes the notice required when additional penalties are permitted, but are not mandated. The prosecutor may, but need not, give the notice, but once given, if the pre-requite convictions are proven, the court <em>must </em>impose the additional penalty. <em>See e.g. State v. Green, </em>367 Md. 61, 785 A.2d 1275 (2001); <em>Jones v. State, </em>336 Md. 255, 647 A.2d 1204 (1994); <em>State v. Montgomery, </em>334 Md. 20, 637 A.2d 1193 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-9\">Second, in any event, the argument is not that the Court has no discretion in regards to the sanction in a reciprocal discipline case, it is that it has limited discretion, in accordance with a Rule that it knowingly, intentionally, and voluntarily promulgated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b739-4\">. Critical to attorney discipline, and essential to according deference to another jurisdiction\u2019s sanction decision on a reciprocal basis, is the policy of protecting the public. That purpose of the attorney discipline process is well established. <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Scroggs, </em>387 Md. 238, 254, 874 A.2d 985, 995 (2005); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v.

The majority argues that our duty to analyze each case would be rendered meaningless were we generally required to impose reciprocal discipline. Yet, it is precisely this duty which would permit this Court to determine the existence of extenuating circumstances, many of which concern constitutional and fairness issues, and which ensures that the process is a considered one, and is not simply automatic.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">The majority also contends that were Rule 16-773(e) generally to require reciprocal discipline, Rule 16 \u2014 773(f) would be rendered meaningless. <em>Whitehead, </em>390 Md. at 671, 890 A.2d at 756. This is not so. Subsection (f) provides that, after the petition and answer have been filed, several things may happen: the Court can immediately impose corresponding discipline, the Court can designate a judge to hear the matter in accordance with Rule 16-757, or the Court may enter any other \"appropriate order.\u201d The purpose of this subsection is to give the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>Court a choice as to how to proceed. Whether reciprocal discipline is required by Rule 16-773(e) in the majority of circumstances, or not, does not change the meaning of subsection (f). That an order under Rule 16-773(e) must be \"appropriate\u201d further ensures that subsections (i) and (e) are in harmony.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
