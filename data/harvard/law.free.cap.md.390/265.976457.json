Illiano, </em>387 Md. 465, 875 A.2d 769 (2005). We hold that, pursuant to Maryland Code (1977, 2002 Repl.Vol.), Section 16-205.1(b)(2) of the Transportation Article, the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s determination that the police officer had reasonable grounds to detain Illiano and request a breath test was supported by substantial evidence and was not premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law. Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">At approximately two o\u2019clock in the morning on October 30, 2003, Maryland Transportation Authority Police Officer J. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>Marll was in a marked patrol car parked on the shoulder of Route 170 in Anne Arundel County operating a stationary radar unit when a Saturn pulled up approximately ten feet behind him and sat idling for a few minutes. Officer Marll decided to check on the well-being of the driver and backed his car alongside the Saturn, at which time the driver, Carmelina Illiano, rolled down her window. Officer Marll detected the smell of alcohol coming from the Saturn and decided to park behind it. While Officer Marll was moving the police car, Ms. Illiano alighted from the Saturn and switched positions with the passenger. After approaching the passenger side window, Officer Marll asked Ms. Illiano why she had stopped on the shoulder to which she replied that she should not be driving because she had consumed one beer and one mixed drink. Observing that her eyes were bloodshot and glassy and that her speech was slurred, the officer requested Ms. Illiano\u2019s driver\u2019s license and asked her to perform various field sobriety tests. While she was getting out of her car, Ms. Illiano disclosed to Officer Marll that she was coming from Canc\u00fan Cantina and that her friend was taking over because Ms. Illiano realized that she should not be driving; Officer Marll further observed that Ms. Illiano leaned on the Saturn for balance while walking.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">After Ms. Illiano failed the field sobriety tests,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Officer Marll placed her under arrest for Driving Under the Influence and read to her from the DR-15 Form.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Initially, Ms. Illiano <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>agreed to take a chemical breath test; she was taken to the Maryland State Police Barracks in Glen Burnie where the test was to be administered. When Ms. Illiano arrived, however, she changed her mind, refused to submit to the test and, thereafter, pursuant to Section 16 \u2014 205.1(b)(3),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Officer Marll <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>confiscated Ms. Uliano\u2019s driver\u2019s license, served her with an order of suspension for one year,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> issued her a temporary license, and informed her of her right to a hearing and the required administrative sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">At the administrative show cause hearing held on March 9, 2004, Ms. Illiano, represented by counsel, contended that the officer never drove abreast of her car, but instead made a U-turn and immediately parked behind her; that she never told Officer Marll that she should not have been driving; that her difficulty performing the field sobriety tests was due to her poor grasp of the English language and her inability to understand Officer Marll\u2019s directions and that she switched seats with the passenger because she was having difficulty driving due to a damaged tendon on the top of her foot. In his findings of fact, ALJ Barry stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-6\">I do find by a preponderance of the evidence in this record that the officer had reasonable grounds to believe the licensee was driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or while impaired by alcohol.... I don\u2019t have any problems finding Ms. Illiano in violation of Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>16-205.1. Frankly, I find Ms. Illiano\u2019s version of events to be totally not credible, not even a close call in this matter. There\u2019s a total \u2014 I mean as far as basically from the beginning, she admits that she\u2019s out with her friend at a club. She\u2019s indicated she only had this half a glass of bitter wine and a rum and Coke, and wants me to believe that all the problems here were not \u2014 the problems with the test didn\u2019t have to do with the consumption of alcohol, but with this foot problem. The evidence that I have on the foot problem is that the injury actually goes back to August of 2002, and the podiatrist, Dr. Seider, has indicated the nerve damage and [sic] may cause difficulty with ambulation and balance. But the evidence of the impairment in this case goes beyond that. We have the bloodshot, glassy eyes, the slurred speech, and I believe the licensee made the admissions to the officer. People driving up behind police when they\u2019re intoxicated doesn\u2019t shock me. I\u2019ve had cases where people have driven into the police station drunk to pick up their friend, who had been arrested earlier in the night, drunk. People do things when they\u2019re intoxicated they wouldn\u2019t ordinarily do when sober. I believe that Ms. Illiano was quite intoxicated that night, pulled over, decided not to drive for whatever reason, performed \u2014 couldn\u2019t even stand up, basically. I believe very little of what Ms. Illiano said here today, so I do find her in violation of Section 16-205.1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Accordingly, ALJ Barry upheld the one-year suspension of Ms. Illiano\u2019s driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">Ms. Illiano filed a Petition for Judicial Review of ALJ Barry\u2019s decision in the Circuit Court for Carroll County pursuant to Maryland Code (1984, 1999 Repl.Vol.), Section 10-222 of the State Government Article. Finding that Section 16-205.1(b)(2) \u201cclearly requires that an officer have reasonable grounds for detaining someone for driving under the influence of alcohol,\u201d the judge held that \u201cany results of the field sobriety tests would be irrelevant in determining whether the officer had reasonable grounds to detain Petitioner to perform these tests,\u201d and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>In reviewing the record, the transcript, and specifically the ALJ\u2019s decision, the ... decision was arbitrary and capricious. The fact that Petitioner admitted to attending a club and that she had one or two drinks is not sufficient to conclude that she was driving under the influence. Nor is the fact that there was a strong odor of alcohol being emitted from the car, not any particular passenger, conclusive .... The Court further finds that there was no substantial evidence to conclude that the officer had reasonable grounds to detain Petitioner. The issue is not fairly debatable and must be reversed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">In so doing, the court reversed ALJ Barry\u2019s decision to suspend Ms. Illiano\u2019s license and remanded the matter to the Motor Vehicle Administration for further proceedings in compliance with the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">Section 10-222 of the Maryland Administrative Procedure Act, Md.Code (1984, 2002 RepLVoL), \u00a7 10-222 of the State Government Article, delineates that a court, upon judicial review of an administrative agency\u2019s decision, may decide to:<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-8\">(1) remand the case for further proceedings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-9\">(2) affirm the final decision; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-10\">(3) reverse or modify the decision if any substantial right of the petitioner may have been prejudiced because a finding, conclusion, or decision:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-11\">(i) is unconstitutional;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-12\">(ii) exceeds the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the final decision-maker;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-13\">(iii) results from an unlawful procedure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-14\">(iv) is affected by any other error of law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>(v) is unsupported by competent, material, and substantial evidence in light of the entire record as submitted; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-5\">(vi) is arbitrary and capricious.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">In <em>Maryland Aviation Administration v. Noland, </em>386 Md. 556, 571, 873 A.2d 1145, 1154 (2005), Judge Eldridge, writing for this Court, thoroughly examined the standard of review of an adjudicatory decision by an administrative agency, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aos\">A court\u2019s role in reviewing an administrative agency adjudicatory decision is narrow, <em>United Parcel v. People\u2019s Counsel, </em>336 Md. 569, 576, 650 A.2d 226, 230 (1994); it \u201cis limited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d <em>United Parcel, </em>336 Md. at 577, 650 A.2d at 230. <em>See also </em>Code (1984, 1995 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10-222(h) of the State Government Article; <em>District Council v. Brandywine Enterprises, Inc., </em>350 Md. 339, 349, 711 A.2d 1346, 1350-51 (1998); <em>Catonsville Nursing v. Loveman, </em>349 Md. 560, 568-69, 709 A.2d 749, 753 (1998).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">In applying the substantial evidence test, a reviewing court decides \u201cwhether a reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached.\u201d <em>Bulluck v. Pelham Wood Apts., </em>283 Md. 505, 512, 390 A.2d 1119, 1123 (1978). <em>See Anderson v. Dep\u2019t of Public Safety, </em>330 Md. 187, 213, 623 A.2d 198, 210 (1993). A reviewing court should defer to the agency\u2019s fact-finding and drawing of inferences if they are supported by the record. <em>CBS v. Comptroller, </em>319 Md. 687, 698, 575 A.2d 324, 329 (1990). A reviewing court \u201cmust review the agency\u2019s decision in the light most favorable to it; ... the agency\u2019s decision is prima facie correct and presumed valid, and ... it is the agency\u2019s province to resolve conflicting evidence\u201d and to draw inferences from that evidence. <em>CBS v. Comptroller, supra, </em>319 Md. at 698, 575 A.2d at 329, quoting <em>Ramsay, Scarlett &amp; Co. v. Comptroller, </em>302 Md. 825, 834-35, 490 A.2d 1296, 1301 (1985). <em>See Catonsville Nursing v. Loveman, supra, </em>349 Md. at 569, 709 A.2d at 753 (final agency decisions \u201care <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number><em>prima facie </em>correct and carry with them the presumption of validity\u201d).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-5\">Despite some unfortunate language that has crept into a few of our opinions, a court\u2019s task on review is <em>not </em>to \u201csubstitute its judgment for the expertise of those persons who constitute the administrative agency,\u201d <em>United Parcel v. People\u2019s Counsel, supra, </em>336 Md. at 576-77, 650 A.2d at 230, quoting <em>Bulluck v. Pelham Wood Apts., supra, </em>283 Md. at 513, 390 A.2d at 1124. Even with regard to some legal issues, a degree of deference should often be accorded the position of the administrative agency. Thus, an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers should ordinarily be given considerable weight by reviewing courts. <em>Lussier v. Md,. Racing Commission, </em>343 Md. 681, 696-97, 684 A.2d 804, 811-12 (1996), and cases there cited; <em>McCullough v. Wittner, </em>314 Md. 602, 612, 552 A.2d 881, 886 (1989) (\u201cThe interpretation of a statute by those officials charged with administering the statute is ... entitled to weight\u201d). Furthermore, the expertise of the agency in its own field should be respected. <em>Fogle v. H &amp; G Restaurant, </em>337 Md. 441, 455, 654 A.2d 449, 456 (1995); <em>Christ v. Department of Natural Resources, </em>335 Md. 427, 445, 644 A.2d 34, 42 (1994) (legislative delegations of authority to administrative agencies will often include the authority to make \u201csignificant discretionary policy determinations\u201d); <em>Bd. of Ed. for Dorchester Co. v. Hubbard, </em>305 Md. 774, 792, 506 A.2d 625, 634 (1986) (\u201capplication of the State Board of Education\u2019s expertise would clearly be desirable before a court attempts to resolve the legal issues\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-6\"><em>Id </em>at 571-72, 873 A.2d at 1154-55, quoting <em>Board of Physician Quality Assurance v. Banks, </em>354 Md. 59, 67-69, 729 A.2d 376, 380-81 (1999) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">Section 16-205.1 of the Transportation Article, also known as Maryland\u2019s Implied Consent Law, which provides for the suspension of driving privileges when a driver refuses to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>submit to a chemical breath test for intoxication, states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-4\">(a)(2) Any person who drives or attempts to drive a motor vehicle on a highway or on any private property that is used by the public in general in this State <em>is deemed to have consented, </em>subject to the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 10-302 through 10-309, inclusive, of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, <em>to take a test </em>if the person should be detained on suspicion of driving or attempting to drive while under the influence of alcohol, while impaired by alcohol, while so far impaired by any drug, any combination of drugs, or a combination of one or more drugs and alcohol that the person could not drive a vehicle safely, while impaired by a controlled dangerous substance, in violation of an alcohol restriction, or in violation of \u00a7 16-813 of this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">(emphasis added). Section 16-205.1(b)(2)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> defines the process an officer is to follow before requesting that a driver submit to a chemical breath test:</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">[I]f a police officer stops or detains any person who the police officer has reasonable grounds to believe is or has been driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, while impaired by alcohol, while so far impaired by any drug, any combination of drugs, or a combination of one or more drugs and alcohol that the person could not drive a vehicle safely, while impaired by a controlled dangerous substance, in violation of an alcohol restriction, or in violation of \u00a7 16-813 of this title, and who is not unconscious or otherwise incapable of refusing to take a test, the police officer shall:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-7\">(i) Detain the person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-8\">(ii) Request that the person permit a test to be taken;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-9\">(iii) Advise the person of the administrative sanctions that shall be imposed for refusal to take the test, including ineligibility for modification of a suspension or issu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>anee of a restrictive license under subsection (n)(l) or (2) of this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">The MVA contends that AL J Barry was correct in concluding that Officer Marll acted on reasonable grounds in requesting that Ms. Illiano take a chemical breath test based upon his observations made after the initial stop and that the Circuit Court was incorrect in superimposing a requirement upon the officer that he have reasonable grounds to suspect Ms. Illiano of driving under the influence at the time of the initial stop. The Circuit Court\u2019s interpretation of Section 16-205.1(b)(2), the MVA submits, prohibits the consideration of any subsequent events, such as the results of field sobriety tests, that the officer may observe, after the initial detention in determining whether the officer had reasonable grounds to detain the driver for the purpose of administering a chemical breath test. The MVA asserts that the Circuit Court conflates the statutory criteria of Section 16-205.1 (b)(2) from \u201cstop or detain\u201d to \u201cstop and detain,\u201d whereas the statute in fact incorporates a two-part process whereby the officer initially stops the driver, then acquires reasonable grounds to believe a drunk driving offense has occurred and thereafter continues to detain the driver for the purpose of requesting a chemical breath test. Based on this interpretation, the MVA argues, there was more than sufficient evidence to establish that the officer had reasonable grounds to suspect Ms. Illiano of driving while under the influence and to request that she take a chemical breath test. According to the MVA, the ALJ\u2019s decision should, therefore, be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">The Circuit Court, in its opinion, stated that \u201cthe reviewing court may substitute its own judgment, if the decision was based solely on an error of law.\u201d As a preliminary matter, we have previously disapproved of the use of the language that the reviewing court may \u201csubstitute the court\u2019s judgment\u201d to describe the analysis undertaken in judicial review of legal issues. <em>See Noland, </em>386 Md. at 573 n. 3, 873 A.2d at 1155 n. 3, citing <em>Banks, </em>354 Md. at 68-69, 729 A.2d at 381. As we have noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>The \u201csubstituted judgment\u201d language is misleading and inaccurate for several reasons. It suggests, with respect to legal issues, that no deference whatsoever is owed to the agency\u2019s decision. That is not the law.... [T]he agency\u2019s interpretations and applications of the statutory or regulatory provisions \u201cwhich the agency administers should ordinarily be given considerable weight by reviewing courts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ASY\"><em>Noland, </em>386 Md. at 573 n. 3, 873 A.2d at 1155 n. 3, quoting <em>Banks, </em>354 Md. at 68, 729 A.2d at 381.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Even after giving that deference, it is ultimately for the court to determine whether an error of law was made. We still must decide, therefore, whether ALJ Barry\u2019s determination that, under Section 16-205.1, an officer may stop a driver for any legitimate reason and then detain that individual to administer chemical breath tests, after developing reasonable grounds to believe that the driver was driving under the influence of alcohol was premised on an erroneous conclusion of law, because although we generally imbue the statutory interpretation of the agency with considerable weight, \u201cwhen a statutory provision is entirely clear, with no ambiguity whatsoever, \u2018administrative constructions, no matter how well entrenched, are not given weight.\u2019 \u201d <em>Noland, </em>386 Md. at 572, 873 A.2d at 1155, quoting <em>Banks, </em>354 Md. at 69 n. 2, 729 A.2d at 381 n. 2. To determine whether ALJ Barry\u2019s interpretation of Section 16-205.1 is erroneous, we must address the issue of whether, after having made what may be characterized as a routine stop, it is reasonable for the police officer to further detain the driver for the purpose of administering a chemical breath test based upon facts developed after the initial stop. The answer clearly is \u201cyes\u201d based on the plain language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Section 16 \u2014 205.1(b)(2) provides that if a police officer \u201cstops or detains\u201d an individual who the officer has reasonable grounds to believe is driving under the influence, the officer may request that the person submit to a breath test. Md. Code (1977, 2002 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(l) of the Transportation Article. The use of the conjunction \u201cor\u201d indicates that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>the officer may have reasonable grounds to believe that the driver is under the influence either at the time of the stop or, due to events occurring after the stop, when the stop transforms into a detention during which the breath test is administered. The decision to utilize the phrase \u201cstop or detain\u201d serves to disjoin the stop from the detention and permits reasonable grounds to arise <em>post-stop </em>to justify the detention and request for a breath test.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\"> We repeatedly have stated that a police officer may stop a driver for a myriad of reasons, such as \u201cto enforce the laws of the roadway, and ordinarily to investigate the manner of driving with intent to issue a citation or warning.\u201d <em>State v. Green, </em>875 Md. 595, 609, 826 A.2d 486, 494 (2003), quoting <em>Ferris v. State, </em>355 Md. 356, 369, 735 A.2d 491, 497-98 (1999). Some examples of permissible traffic stops, other than for driving under the influence, include: failure to properly display registration plates on the vehicle, Maryland Code, (1977, 2002 Repl.Vol.), Section 13-411 of the Transportation Article; failure to drive on the right side of the roadway, Maryland Code, (1977,2002 Repl.Vol.), Section 21-309 of the Transportation Article; failure to yield the right of way upon entering onto a highway, Maryland Code, (1977, 2002 Repl.Vol.), Section 21-403 of the Transportation Article; failure to yield the right of way to an emergency vehicle, Maryland Code, (1977, 2002 Repl.Vol.), Section 21-405 of the Transportation Article; and, failure to come to a complete stop at a stop sign, Maryland Code, (1977, 2002 Repl.Vol.), Section 21-707 of the Transportation Article, among others. A police officer also may stop a motor vehicle where the officer has a \u201creasonable belief that \u2018criminal activity is afoot.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rowe v. State, </em>363 Md. 424, 433, 769 A.2d 879, 884 (2001). Moreover, a police officer may stop or detain a driver in what is known as a \u201cconsensual encounter,\u201d where the officer approaches a driver on the street, or in another public place, and the driver cooperates in responding to the officer\u2019s non-coercive questioning. <em>See Green, </em>375 Md. at 609, 826 A.2d at 494, quoting <em>United States v. Werking, </em>915 F.2d 1404, 1408 (10th Cir.1990); <em>Ferris v. State, </em>355 Md. 356, 373 n. 4, 735 A.2d 491, 500 n. 4 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>This Court has affirmed numerous AL J decisions permitting the administration of chemical breath tests in situations where the initial stop was not for driving under the influence of alcohol, but for any number of related reasons. In <em>MVA v. Jones, </em>380 Md. 164, 844 A.2d 388 (2004), the officer initially stopped a driver because his vehicle was facing sideways across the northbound traffic lanes of Interstate 95 and, when the officer pulled up behind the vehicle, the driver made a U-turn on Interstate 95 and began driving southbound into oncoming traffic. The police officer stopped Jones for his multiple traffic violations. After he was stopped, the officer observed that Jones had difficulty standing, smelled of alcohol, and performed poorly on the administered field sobriety tests. We upheld the ALJ\u2019s determination that there was sufficient evidence to believe that the police officer had acted upon reasonable grounds in requesting a chemical breath test based upon the officer\u2019s observation made after the initial stop. <em>Id. </em>at 168, 844 A.2d at 390.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">In <em>MVA v. McDorman, </em>364 Md. 253, 772 A.2d 309 (2001), the police officer initially stopped a driver after observing that the driver\u2019s truck was parked alongside a curb facing the wrong direction of the street. Subsequent to the stop, the officer noted that McDorman smelled of alcohol and failed a field sobriety test. We upheld the ALJ\u2019s finding that there was sufficient evidence to believe that the officer had reasonable grounds to request a chemical breath test where the indicia of alcohol use arose after the initial stop. <em>Id. </em>at 262, 772 A.2d at 315. Likewise in <em>MVA v. Richards, </em>356 Md. 356, 739 A.2d 58 (1999), the police officer, while patrolling an area that had recently experienced a rash of vehicle thefts and burglaries, initially stopped a vehicle at 12:30 a.m. after it had driven down a dead-end street and turned around without stopping at any of the homes on the street which, in light of the recent automobile thefts, aroused the officer\u2019s suspicion. When speaking to the driver, the police officer noticed a strong odor of alcohol and asked Richards to perform field sobriety tests, which he failed. We upheld the ALJ\u2019s determination that the officer had reasonable grounds to request a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>chemical breath test based upon the circumstances observed after the initial stop. <em>Id. </em>at 378, 739 A.2d at 71. <em>See also MVA v. Lytle, </em>374 Md. 37, 46-47, 821 A.2d 62, 67 (2003) (upholding suspension where officer\u2019s initial stop was because driver was speeding, then officer detected a strong scent of alcohol, that driver\u2019s eyes were bloodshot and glassy, speech was slurred, and the driver failed field sobriety tests); <em>Lowry v. State, </em>363 Md. 357, 768 A.2d 688 (2001) (upholding conviction where officer stopped driver for failing to obey a proper traffic control device and subsequently administered a breath test); <em>Embrey v. MVA </em>339 Md. 691, 692-93, 664 A.2d 911, 912 (1995) (upholding suspension of driver\u2019s license where officer stopped driver after observing defendant driving at a high rate of speed, then noted strong scent of alcohol coming from driver and that the driver performed poorly on field sobriety tests, which provided grounds for breath test).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Based on the plain meaning of Section 16 \u2014 205.1(b)(2) and this Court\u2019s jurisprudence, we conclude that ALJ Barry\u2019s determination that \u201cstop or detain\u201d permits police officers to develop a reasonable belief that a driver was driving under the influence <em>after </em>making the initial stop is not \u201cpremised on an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d <em>Noland, </em>386 Md. at 574 n. 3, 873 A.2d at 1156 n. 3, quoting <em>United Parcel v. People\u2019s Counsel, </em>336 Md. 569, 577, 650 A.2d 226, 230 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Having concluded that ALJ Barry\u2019s interpretation of Section 16-205.1 was clearly correct, we turn to our review of his factual finding that Officer Marll had reasonable grounds to detain Ms. Illiano for driving under the influence of alcohol and to ask that Ms. Illiano take a chemical breath test. The substantial evidence test, set forth in Section 10-222(h)(3)(v) of the Administrative Procedure Act, Md.Code (1984, 2004 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 10-222(h)(3)(v) of the State Government Article, requires that an agency\u2019s factual determination be supported by \u201ccompetent, material, and substantial evidence in light of the entire record as submitted.\u201d We have further explicated the concept of substantial evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>In applying the substantial evidence test, a reviewing court decides whether a reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached. A reviewing court should defer to the agency\u2019s fact-finding and drawing of inferences if they are supported by the record. A reviewing court must review the agency\u2019s decision in the light most favorable to it[, and] the agency\u2019s decision is prima facie correct and presumed valid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-5\"><em>Board of Physician Quality Assurance v. Mullan, </em>381 Md. 157, 172, 848 A.2d 642, 651 (2004), quoting <em>Banks, </em>354 Md. at 68, 729 A.2d at 380-81 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The record in the instant case indicates that Officer Marll detected a strong odor of alcohol emanating from Ms. Illiano\u2019s vehicle, that Ms. Illiano stated that she stopped because she should not be driving, and that she admitted to having consumed two alcoholic drinks. Officer Marll, according to the record, asked her to perform field sobriety tests and observed that Ms. Illiano\u2019s eyes were bloodshot and glassy and that her speech was slurred. The record also states that Ms. Illiano failed the field sobriety tests. At the hearing Ms. Illiano testified and denied that she had consumed two alcoholic drinks earlier in the evening. She also explained that her stop behind Officer Marll\u2019s car and her inability to pass the field sobriety tests were caused by an injury to her foot and her inability to fully understand spoken English.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">Based on the evidence in the record, a reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion of ALJ Barry. Indeed, \u201c \u2018not only is it the province of the agency to resolve conflicting evidence, but where inconsistent inferences from the same evidence can be drawn, it is for the agency to draw the inferences.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gigeous v. ECI, </em>363 Md. 481, 504, 769 A.2d 912, 926 (2001), quoting <em>Bulluck v. Pelham Wood Apts., </em>283 Md. 505, 513, 390 A.2d 1119, 1124 (1978). We give great deference to the agency\u2019s assessment of the credibility of the witnesses. <em>Schwartz v. Md. Dept. of Natural Resources, </em>385 Md. 534, 554, 870 A.2d 168, 180 (2005). Thus, we conclude that ALJ Barry\u2019s determination that Officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>Marll had reasonable grounds to detain Ms. Illiano for driving under the influence of alcohol and to request that she submit to a breath test is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">For these reasons, we reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court and direct that court to affirm ALJ Barry\u2019s decision upholding the one-year suspension of Ms. Illiano\u2019s driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR CARROLL COUNTY REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO AFFIRM THE DECISION OF THE MOTOR VEHICLE ADMINISTRATION.
