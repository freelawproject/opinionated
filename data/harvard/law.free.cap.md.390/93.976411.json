Because the ADEA claim was adjudicated on the merits in a suit filed by Norville in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, <em>Norville v. Anne Arundel County Bd. of Educ., </em>No. Civ A. MJG-99-764, 1999 WL 1267696 (D.Md. Nov.23, 1999), we shall hold that this action is barred by the principles of res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">David Norville was employed by the Board as a Media Production Specialist from 1979 until 1998. Norville received a memorandum from his supervisor, Don Cramer, accusing him of insubordination on or about June 24, 1998. The Board sent Norville a letter in July 1998 explaining that it was reducing the number of positions in Norville\u2019s department for budgetary reasons. The Board discharged Norville from his employment as a Media Production Specialist on September 80,1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Norville filed an age discrimination complaint, grounded in ' ADEA, with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) against the Board. Following an investigation, the EEOC closed its file, and advised Norville that it was \u201cunable to conclude that the information obtained establishes violations of statutes.\u201d The EEOC added, however, that its action did not certify that the Board was in compliance with statutory requirements and informed Norville of his \u201cright to sue\u201d under federal law, either in state or federal court, within 90 days of the notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Norville filed a complaint on March 18, 1999, which he amended on June 2, 1999, against the Board in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, alleging six counts: violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> violation of Art. 49B,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> unjust enrichment, quantum meruit, wrongful discharge, and intentional infliction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>emotional distress.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Board argued that it is an agency of the State of Maryland, and thus enjoys immunity from suit under the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Norville contended that Eleventh Amendment immunity was unavailable under ADEA because the Board was not an arm of the State<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and hence was not entitled to immunity as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">The District Court, in a Memorandum Opinion and Order, noted that on October 13, 1999, the Supreme Court had heard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>oral argument in <em>Kimel v. Bd. of Regents, </em>139 F.3d 1426 (11th Cir.1998), <em>cert. granted, </em>525 U.S. 1121, 119 S.Ct. 901, 142 L.Ed.2d 901 (1999), <em>aff'd, </em>528 U.S. 62, 120 S.Ct. 631, 145 L.Ed.2d 522 (2000), presenting two issues bearing on the resolution of the issue before the District Court. The issues before the Supreme Court were whether the ADEA contained a clear abrogation of the States\u2019 Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit by individuals and whether the extension of the ADEA to the States was a proper exercise of Congress\u2019s power under \u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, thereby constituting a valid exercise of congressional power to abrogate the States\u2019 Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit by individuals. The District Court stayed the action against the Board pending the <em>Kimel </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Following the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Kimel </em>that the ADEA did not constitute a proper abrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity pursuant to \u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, 528 U.S. 62, 82-83, 120 S.Ct. 631, 645, 145 L.Ed.2d 522,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the District Court lifted the stay and, pursuant to Fed R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), dismissed all Norville\u2019s remaining federal claims with prejudice, and the state law claims without prejudice. The District Court ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-6\">\u201cBy separate Order issued this date, the Court has dismissed all remaining claims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-7\">1. Judgment shall be, and hereby is, entered in favor of Defendants Board of Education, Anne Arundel County, Maryland and Don Cramer against Plaintiff David Nor-ville <em>dismissing all federal claims with prejudice </em>and all state law claims without prejudice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">The District Court made clear that this Order constituted a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>Norville did not appeal the judgment of the District Court. Instead, Norville filed suit against the Board and Cramer in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, alleging age discrimination in violation of Art. 49B, unjust enrichment, quantum meruit, common law wrongful discharge, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The Circuit Court dismissed the unjust enrichment and quantum meruit claims with prejudice and the remaining claims, without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Norville then filed an Amended Complaint in which he alleged violations of Article 49B, wrongful discharge, and intentional infliction of emotional distress as well as claims alleging violation of ADEA. The ADEA claims against the Board and Cramer were the same claims that the District Court had dismissed with prejudice. In his Amended Complaint, Norville alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-6\">\u201c13. Defendant [the Board] willfully discriminated against the Plaintiff on account of his age in violation of Section 4(a)(1) of the ADEA, 29 U.S.C. 623(a)(1) with respect to its decision to discharge the Plaintiff from employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-7\">34. Defendant [Cramer] willfully discriminated against the Plaintiff on account of his age in violation of Section 4(a)(1) of the ADEA, 29 U.S.C. 623(a)(1) with respect to its decision to discharge the Plaintiff from employment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">In response, pursuant to Md. Rule 2-323(g), the Board and Cramer raised several affirmative defenses, including \u201cres judicata, as a result of the dismissal of the prior federal court suit\u201d and \u201csovereign and/or governmental immunity, as well as the failure to give proper notice under the Maryland Torts Claim Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">The Circuit Court granted the Board\u2019s Motion to Dismiss the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim, all other state law claims against the Board and Cramer, and the ADEA claim against Cramer. Norville\u2019s ADEA claim against the Board was the only claim to survive this Motion to Dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">Prior to trial, the Board requested that the Circuit Court rule on the sovereign immunity issue. The Board argued that it was a State agency for the purpose of sovereign immunity. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>The Circuit Court dismissed Norville\u2019s ADEA claim, holding that the Board is a State agency, and as such, the Eleventh Amendment bars the suit against the Board. In regard to the federal cause of action, the court noted as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-5\">\u201cIn the instant case, Plaintiffs ADEA claim was dismissed in federal court on the basis of the Board\u2019s Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit.... <em>The United States District Court for the District of Maryland has already held that the Board enjoys governmental immunity from ADEA claims that Plaintiff brought in federal court.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Age\">The Circuit Court concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-6\">\u201cThe Eleventh Amendment protects the States from suit unless they have explicitly waived their immunity. Maryland has clearly not waived its immunity from suits brought under the ADEA, and this immunity applies to private actions brought against its agencies in both federal and state courts. Accordingly, the Anne Arundel County Board of Education has a constitutional immunity to suits brought in State courts under the ADEA.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Norville noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. That court affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court, holding that the Circuit Court did not err in dismissing the Art. 49B claim and the common law wrongful discharge claim.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Norville v. Anne Arundel County Bd. of Educ., </em>160 Md.App. 12, 862 A.2d 477 (2004). With respect to the ADEA claim, the Court of Special Appeals held that the Board was an arm of the State under the Eleventh Amendment, and that Md.Code (1973, 2002 Repl.Vol., 2004 Cum.Supp.) Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, \u00a7 5-518(c)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> waived the Board\u2019s sovereign immunity defense to \u201cany claim\u201d of $100,000 or less, including claims brought by individuals under the ADEA.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b151-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>We granted the Board\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari to decide the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-4\">1. \u201cDid the Court of Special Appeals err in construing [Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article] \u00a7 5-518, which waives the sovereign immunity of local boards of education for \u2018any claim\u2019 up to $100,000, as a waiver of the Board\u2019s immunity from suit under the Eleventh Amendment against an ADEA action filed in state court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-5\">2. Did the Court of Special Appeals err by failing to apply to a federal cause of action filed in state court the rules of strict construction that are applicable to determining whether a state has waived its immunity under the Eleventh Amendment to a suit filed in federal court?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">We granted Norville\u2019s cross-petition for certiorari to decide the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-7\">\u201cWhether the Court of Special Appeals erred in holding that the Anne Arundel County Board of Education is entitled to sovereign immunity under the U.S. Constitution because the Board is an \u2018arm of the State\u2019?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">We shall not reach these questions in deciding this case based on the principles of res judicata. Norville may not bring the same ADEA claim against the Board that a court of competent jurisdiction has dismissed with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">Although the issue of res judicata was not raised directly in the certiorari petition, nevertheless, we may determine whether res judicata bars Norville\u2019s claims. <em>See Lizzi v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., </em>384 Md. 199, 205-06, 862 A.2d 1017, 1021-22 (2004). Md. Rule 8-131(a) states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_4\">\u201c(a) Generally. The issues of jurisdiction of the trial court over the subject matter and, unless waived under Rule 2-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>322, over a person may be raised in and decided by the appellate court whether or not raised in and decided by the trial court. Ordinarily, the appellate court will not decide any other issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court, but the Court may decide such an issue if necessary or desirable to guide the trial court or to avoid the expense and delay of another appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">The Board raised the defense of res judicata as an affirmative defense pursuant to Md. Rule 2-323(g) in its Answer to the Amended Complaint filed in the Circuit Court. The Circuit Court, in dismissing Norville\u2019s claims, arguably relied on the principles of res judicata, in part, explaining that \u201cThe United States District Court for the District of Maryland has already held that the Board enjoys governmental immunity from ADEA claims that Plaintiff brought in federal court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">We have decided cases previously on res judicata grounds, even though res judicata was not raised in the petition for writ of certiorari. In <em>Lizzi, </em>the Circuit Court dismissed an employee\u2019s Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) claim against his employer, Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA), on res judicata grounds, because the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit had held in a prior action that Lizzi\u2019s claim against WMATA was barred because of sovereign immunity. <em>See id. </em>at 204, 862 A.2d at 1020-21. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed on the ground of sovereign immunity rather than res judicata.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 205, 862 A.2d at 1021. Although we did not grant certiorari on the res judicata issue, we held nevertheless that Lizzi\u2019s FMLA claim was barred by the res judicata effect of the Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Lizzi v. Alexander, </em>255 F.3d 128 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 1081, 122 S.Ct. 812, 151 L.Ed.2d 697 (2002), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number><em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>585 U.S. 952, 122 S.Ct. 1352, 152 L.Ed.2d 254 (2002). <em>Id. </em>at 213, 862 A.2d at 1025-26. As we stated in <em>Lizzi, </em>\u201cwe find it preferable to address the res judicata issue at this point, so as \u2018to avoid the expense and delay of another appeal,\u2019 \u201d as is expressly permitted under the language of Maryland Rule 8-131(a). <em>Id. </em>at 206, 862 A.2d at 1021-22; <em>see also Johnston v. Johnston, </em>297 Md. 48, 59, 465 A.2d 436, 441-42 (1983) (noting that \u201c[although the parties in the instant case have not precisely raised the issue of res judicata, we believe that in the interests of judicial economy, it is appropriate for us to address it as it is dispositive of the matter before us\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">The U.S. Supreme Court took a similar approach in <em>Arizona v. California, </em>530 U.S. 392, 120 S.Ct. 2304, 147 L.Ed.2d 374 (2000) <em>(Arizona </em>II). In that case, the Court was faced with the Quechan Tribe\u2019s claims for increased water rights from the Colorado River. <em>Id. </em>at 397, 120 S.Ct. at 2310. These claims were based on the contention that the Tribe\u2019s reservation included thousands of acres not attributed properly to the Tribe in earlier stages of the litigation. <em>Id. </em>The Court considered whether these claims for additional rights were precluded by the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Arizona v. California, </em>373 U.S. 546, 83 S.Ct. 1468, 10 L.E.2d. 542 (1963) <em>(Arizona </em>I). The Court noted the following with regard to raising res judicata <em>sua sponte:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-5\">\u201c \u2018[I]f a court is on notice that it has previously decided the issue presented, the court may dismiss the action <em>sua sponte, </em>even though the defense has not been raised. The result is fully consistent with the policies underlying res judicata: <em>it is not based solely on the defendant\u2019s interest in avoiding the bu'rdens of twice defending a suit, but is also based on the avoidance of unnecessary judicial waste.\u2019 \u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AsK\"><em>Arizona II, </em>530 U.S. at 412, 120 S.Ct. at 2318 (citations omitted) (emphasis added). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Our view is in accord with other appellate courts that have raised res judicata <em>sua sponte. See, e.g., Carbonell v. La. Dept. of Health &amp; Human Res., </em>772 F.2d 185, 189 (5th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>Cir.1985); <em>Wilson v. United States, </em>166 F.2d 527, 529 (8th Cir.1948); <em>Merrilees v. Treasurer, </em>159 Vt. 623, 618 A.2d 1314, 1315-16 (1992); <em>Dakota Title &amp; Escrow Co. v. World-Wide Steel Sys., </em>238 Neb. 519, 471 N.W.2d 430, 434-35 (1991); <em>Campbell v. Lake Hallowell Homeowners Ass\u2019n., </em>157 Md.App. 504, 528, 852 A.2d 1029, 1042-43 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Res judicata, also known as claim preclusion or direct estoppel, means \u201ca thing adjudicated.\u201d We explained the doctrine recently in <em>Lizzi v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., </em>384 Md. at 206-07, 862 A.2d at 1022, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0H\">\u201cRes judicata literally means \u2018a thing adjudicated,\u2019 and generally indicates \u2018an affirmative defense barring the same parties from litigating a second lawsuit on the same claim, or any other claim arising from the same transaction or series of transactions and that could have been \u2014 but was not \u2014 raised in the first suit.\u2019 Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1336-37 (8th ed.2004). <em>See Alvey v. Alvey, </em>225 Md. 386, 390, 171 A.2d 92, 94 (1961) (stating that \u2018the doctrine of res judicata is that a judgment between the same parties and their privies is a final bar to any other suit upon the same cause of action, and is conclusive, not only as to all matters that have been decided in the original suit, but as to all matters which with propriety could have been litigated in the first suit\u2019); <em>see also Mackall v. Zayre Corp., </em>293 Md. 221, 228, 443 A.2d 98, 102 (1982) (stating that \u2018if a proceeding between parties involves the same cause of action as a previous proceeding between the same parties, the principle of res judicata applies and all matters actually litigated or that could have been litigated are conclusive in the subsequent proceeding\u2019).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The doctrine of res judicata bars the relitigation of a claim if there is a final judgment in a previous litigation where the parties, the subject matter and causes of action are identical or substantially identical as to issues actually litigated and as to those which could have or should have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>raised in the previous litigation. Res judicata protects the courts, as well as the parties, from the attendant burdens of relitigation. This doctrine \u201cavoids the expense and vexation attending multiple lawsuits, conserves the judicial resources, and fosters reliance on judicial action by minimizing the possibilities of inconsistent decisions.\u201d <em>Murray Int\u2019l Freight Corp. v. Graham, </em>315 Md. 543, 547, 555 A.2d 502, 503-04 (1989) (quoting <em>Montana v. United States, </em>440 U.S. 147, 153-54, 99 S.Ct. 970, 973-74, 59 L.Ed.2d 210 (1979)). Norville\u2019s claims in the Circuit Court were either fully raised and litigated in the federal District Court, or could have been raised in the federal action, and thus, are barred by the doctrine of res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\"> Res judicata restrains a party from litigating the same claim repeatedly and ensures that courts do not waste time adjudicating matters which have been decided or <em>could have been </em>decided fully and fairly. Almost 130 years ago, the Supreme Court made this point in <em>Cromwell v. County of Sac, </em>94 U.S. 351, 358, 4 Otto 351, 24 L.Ed. 195 (1876):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-6\">\u201cThe plea of [res judicata] applies, except in special cases, not only to the points upon which the court was required by the parties to form an opinion, and pronounce a judgment, but to every point which properly belonged to the subject of litigation, and which the parties, exercising reasonable diligence, might have brought forward at the time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">Under Maryland law, the elements of res judicata, or claim preclusion, are: (1) that the parties in the present litigation are the same or in privity with the parties to the earlier dispute; (2) that the claim presented in the current action is identical to the one determined in the prior adjudication; and, (3) that there has been a final judgment on the merits. <em>See Colandrea v. Wilde Lake Comm,. Ass\u2019n., </em>361 Md. 371, 392, 761 A.2d 899, 910 (2000); <em>Blades v. Woods, </em>338 Md. 475, 478-79, 659 A.2d 872, 873 (1995); <em>Gertz v. Anne Arundel County, </em>339 Md. 261, 269, 661 A.2d 1157, 1161 (1995); <em>deLeon v. Slear, </em>328 Md. 569, 580, 616 A.2d 380, 385; <em>Cicala, v. Disability Review Bd., </em>288 Md. 254, 263, 418 A.2d 205, 211 (1980). <em>See also </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 19 (1982). If a final judgment exists as to a controversy between parties, those parties and their privies are barred from relitigating any claim upon which the judgment is based.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">When a federal court renders a final judgment, generally the judgment\u2019s preclusive effect is determined by federal law. <em>See Shoup v. Bell &amp; Howell Co., </em>872 F.2d 1178, 1179 (4th Cir.1989); <em>Luxford v. Dalkon Shield Claimants, </em>978 F.Supp. 221, 228 n. 6 (D.Md.1997); Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 87 (1982). In state court, the law of the state in which the judgment was rendered determines the preclusive effect. <em>See Rourke v. Amchem Prods., Inc., </em>384 Md. 329, 344, 863 A.2d 926, 935 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">The elements of res judicata under federal law are analogous to those under Maryland law: (1) identical parties, or parties in privity, in the two actions; (2) the claim in the second matter is based upon the same cause of action involved in the earlier proceeding; and, (3) a prior and final judgment on the merits, rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with due process requirements. <em>See Grausz v. Englander, </em>321 F.3d 467, 472 (4th Cir.2003). <em>See also Kent County Bd. of Educ. v. Bilbrough, </em>309 Md. 487, 493-94, 525 A.2d 232, 235 (1987). Whether the final judgment is pronounced by a federal court or a state court, its preclusive bar extends to any theory arising out of the same claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">When a prior court has entered a final judgment as to the matter sought to be litigated in a second court, the claim analysis is usually uncomplicated. <em>See FWB Bank v. Richman, </em>354 Md. 472, 493, 731 A.2d 916, 927 (1999). It is when a court has not ruled upon a matter directly that the analysis becomes more complex, \u201cfor then the second court must determine whether the matter currently before it was fairly included within the claim or action that was before the earlier court and could have been resolved in that court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We have adopted the transactional test of the Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 24 to address the latter kinds of cases, which states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>\u201cWhat factual grouping constitutes a \u2018transaction\u2019 and what groupings constitute a \u2018series,\u2019 are to be determined pragmatically, giving weight to such considerations as whether the facts are related in time, space, origin, or motivation, whether they form a convenient trial unit, and whether their treatment as a unit conforms to the parties\u2019 expectations or business understanding or usage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 493, 731 A.2d at 927-28 (1999); <em>see Gertz, </em>339 Md. at 269-70, 661 A.2d at 1161; <em>Bilbrough, </em>309 Md. at 498, 525 A.2d at 237-38. <em>Compare United Mine Workers of Am. v. Gibbs, </em>383 U.S. 715, 725, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 1138, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966) (federal and state causes of action are the same for the purposes of pendant jurisdiction when the causes of actions \u201cderive from the same common nucleus of operative fact\u201d); <em>see GLF Constr.

Legal theories may not be divided and presented in piecemeal fashion in order to advance them in separate actions. <em>See C.I.R. v. Sunnen, </em>333 U.S. 591, 597, 68 S.Ct. 715, 719, 92 L.Ed. 898 (1948) (quoting <em>Cromwell, </em>94 U.S. at 352 (1876)); <em>Lockett v. West, </em>914 F.Supp. 1229, 1233 (D.Md.1995); <em>Colandrea, </em>361 Md. at 392, 761 A.2d at 910 (2000); <em>Batson v.

State, </em>98 Md.App. 459, 465, 633 A.2d 902, 905 (1993). In applying res judicata, we are concerned simply with the final judgment entered and its concomitant consequences. <em>Id. </em>Because Norville has fully litigated the same ADEA claim against the Board, we shall examine the consequences of the federal District Court judgment in the prior case.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Norville argues before this Court that the Board is not a State agency for Eleventh Amendment purposes, and thus it is not immune from his ADEA claim. Alternatively, Norville argues that, based on Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, \u00a7 5-518,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the State has waived partially the Board\u2019s sovereign immunity. Res Judicata principles apply to Norville\u2019s ADEA claim as well as his alternative arguments, because the federal District Court previously entered judgment against Norville on the same ADEA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">The first element of res judicata \u2014 that the second action feature the same parties or their privies \u2014 is satisfied easily here. In federal District Court, Norville filed an action against the Board, alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>a violation of ADEA. <em>Norville v. Anne Arundel County Bd. of Educ., </em>No. Civ.A MJG-99-764, 1999 WL 1267696, (D.Md. Nov.23, 1999). In the present action, Norville again brought suit against the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>The second element of res judicata \u2014 whether a party is raising the same claim in the current action \u2014 is met. In his state court action, Norville alleges the same claim of age discrimination, grounded in ADEA, that he alleged in his federal court action. The only new matter in Norville\u2019s state case is that he advances another theory of ADEA liability based on \u00a7 5-518. He argues that the State\u2019s waiver of the county school boards\u2019 liability for \u201cany claim\u201d up to $100,000 necessarily includes claims grounded in ADEA. This alternative theory, however, does not save Norville from the effects of res judicata. Even if \u201ca number of different legal theories casting liability on an actor may apply to a given episode, [they do] not create ... multiple claims\u201d depriving a prior judgment of its preclusive bar. <em>See Lockett v. West, </em>914 F.Supp. 1229, 1233 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 24 cmt. c (1982)). \u201cThis remains true although the several legal theories depend on different shadings of facts, or would emphasize different elements of facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Once a set of facts has been litigated, res judicata generally prevents the application of a different legal theory to that same set of facts, assuming that \u201cthe second theory of liability existed when the first action was litigated.\u201d <em>See Gertz v. Anne Arundel County, </em>339 Md. 261, 270, 661 A.2d 1157, 1162 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Norville\u2019s \u201csecond theory\u201d simply is another attempt to hold the Board liable for the same case of age discrimination which the parties have litigated previously. After losing his case in federal court, Norville cannot apply his new theory to the same set of facts, when this theory is grounded upon a statute that was effective during the litigation of his prior action.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Norville\u2019s arguments that the Board was not entitled to assert Eleventh Amendment immunity and that \u00a7 5-518(e) partially waived the Board\u2019s sovereign immunity from a \u201cconvenient trial unit,\u201d <em>Gertz, </em>339 Md. at 271, 661 A.2d at 1162, and therefore, could have been, and should have been, brought together in the federal District Court action. Inasmuch as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>both of the arguments advanced by Norville arise out of the same set of facts, they form \u201cthe basis of the litigative unit or entity which may not be split.\u201d <em>Kent County Bd. of Educ. v. Bilbrough, </em>309 Md. 487, 498, 525 A.2d 232, 237 (1987) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 24 cmt. a (1982)). By splitting theories applicable to the same case, Norville seeks a second bite at the apple in the Maryland court system, which res judicata does not permit. <em>See Procter &amp; Gamble Co. v. Amway Corp., </em>376 F.3d 496, 500-01 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Finally, the prior decision of the District Court constitutes a final judgment on the merits, which satisfies the third element of res judicata. The District Court granted the Board\u2019s Motion to Dismiss against Norville, which relied explicitly on Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), the federal rule which authorizes a party to move for a dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. When the District Court granted the Board\u2019s Motion to Dismiss and entered a final judgement against Norville, it necessarily decided that the Board was a State agency entitled to the assert Eleventh Amendment immunity. The Board would not enjoy Eleventh Amendment protection unless it was an arm of the State, and therefore, without such a finding, there would not have been a basis to dismiss the suit at the 12(b)(6) stage, at least as to Norville\u2019s ADEA claim. <em>See Howlett v. Rose, </em>496 U.S. 356, 377, 110 S.Ct. 2430, 2443, 110 L.Ed.2d 332 (1990) (noting that \u201c[fjederal law makes governmental defendants that are not arms of the State, such as municipalities, liable for their constitutional violations\u201d); <em>Mt.

Having relied on <em>Kimel </em>to dismiss Norville\u2019s ADEA claim, the District Court necessarily decided that the Board was an arm of the state for Eleventh Amendment purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">In the Judgment Order, the District Court deemed its dismissal of Norville\u2019s case to be a \u201cfinal judgment.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Furthermore, Rule 41(b) of the Federal Rules of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>Civil Procedure provides that the dismissal of an action upon a defendant\u2019s motion constitutes an adjudication on the merits, <em>unless </em>specified otherwise by the court dismissing the action.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>See Bell v.

It is significant that the District Court considered the Board\u2019s Motion to Dismiss on Eleventh Amendment immunity grounds as a Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) motion (dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted) rather than a Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1) motion (dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction). When a federal court grants a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, the dismissal does not constitute an adjudication on the merits, and thus, a plaintiff is free to pursue the claim in a court having jurisdiction. <em>See Winslow v.

Unless the court in its order for dismissal otherwise specifies, a dismissal under this subdivision and any dismissal not provided for in this rule, other than a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction, for improper venue, or for failure to join a party under Rule 19, operates as an adjudication upon the merits.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
