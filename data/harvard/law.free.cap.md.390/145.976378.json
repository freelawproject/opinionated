The Board, the Circuit Court, and the Court of Special Appeals found that the citations were properly issued. Petitioners filed a Petition for Writ of Certiorari on May 3, 2005, and we granted certiorari on June 16, 2005. <em>Kane v. Bd. of Appeals, </em>387 Md. 465, 875 A.2d 769 (2005).

Furthermore, we hold that the County Code sections in question, as applied here, did not violate the petitioners\u2019 rights to due process or equal protection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-6\">I. Facts and Procedural History</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-7\">Realty Development Group, Inc., (\u201cRDG\u201d), owns three rental properties located at 4204, 4205, and 4206 Knox Road, College Park, Maryland. James L. Kane, Jr., an agent of RDG, manages the properties (Mr. Kane is sometimes hereafter referred to as petitioner). As required by the County Code, the Prince George\u2019s County Fire Department conducts regular inspections of the properties.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-8\">On March 30, 2000, Captain Steven Hess, a fire department employee, inspected the buildings. The tenant of unit 7, at 4204 Knox Road, allowed Captain Hess to inspect the apartment. Captain Hess determined that the unit was unsafe and later stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-9\">\u201cThe dangerous accumulations of trash and rubbish that I observed during my inspection was such that there was approximately a three foot pile high [of] newspaper, magazines, pizza boxes, other food type containers strewn throughout this [tenant\u2019s] unit to the point that he could open his door approximately a foot and a half to allow us <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>entry to check the smoke detector, and in the event that [the tenant is] in his room and there is a fire in his unit the likelihood is that not only will the abundant accumulation of this combustible material not allow him to exit his unit properly, it will probably facilitate the fire to spread more quickly. I found that to be a dangerous accumulation not only for him but also for the tenants that reside in that building.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">Captain Hess found that the conditions of the apartment violated \u00a7 11 \u2014 161(a)(1). He also found that a room in 4205 Knox Road, used by a tenant as a storage closet, also contained the building\u2019s boiler and water heater. Captain Hess determined that the tenant\u2019s use of the storage room was a violation of \u00a7 11-161(a)(1) as it created \u201c[d]angerous conditions which are liable to cause or contribute to the spread of fire in or on said premises, building, or structure, or endanger the occupants thereof.\u201d As a result of these findings, Captain Hess issued a \u201cCorrection Order,\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 11-161. The order named James L. Kane as the owner and it stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-5\">\u201cAll storage rooms must be locked, supervised by fire sprinklers or be 100% empty and have a smoke detector. In addition, access must be provided to officials of the Prince George\u2019s County Fire/EMS Department to inspect these common areas of the property for hazards or appliances as the Fire Chief or his authorized representative may designate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-6\">\u201cThe tenant in 4204 Knox Road # 7 must immediately clean all trash and debris from the unit in order to eliminate the dangerous conditions found in the room.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">The form stated that both conditions were cited pursuant to \u00a7 11 \u2014 161(a)(1). The order also provided that it was the \u201c1st Notice\u201d and that \u201cthe owner/manager must act immediately to correct the listed issues, prior to the next scheduled appointment,\u201d which was set for May 1, 2000. Captain Hess gave the order to a rental manager who refused to sign, acknowledging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>receipt of it.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">After his second visit on May 1, 2000, Captain Hess issued a \u201c2nd Notice\u201d to Mr. Kane stating that the conditions described on the first notice had not been corrected. In addition, this notice stated that \u201c[fjailure to comply could result in a $1000.00 fine and/or 180 days in jail upon conviction\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and that the next scheduled appointment would take place on May 17, 2000. The manager again refused to sign the order. Finally, after inspecting the buildings a third time, Captain Hess issued a \u201cTHIRD and FINAL notice\u201d on June 12, 2000. The final notice provided that the conditions found in the previous two occasions had not been corrected.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Captain Hess gave the notice to Mr. Kane who refused to sign it.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>Petitioner Kane filed a notice of appeal to the Board of Appeals of Prince George\u2019s County (the \u201cBoard\u201d)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> on May 10, 2000, challenging the Correction Order dated May 1, 2000. In his notice of appeal, petitioner Kane argued that he was incorrectly identified as the owner, he denied the existence of any storage rooms in the buildings in question, and stated that \u201c[a]ny recommendation to a tenant in any building (4204 Knox Road, # 7) which concerns that tenant\u2019s particular personal habits should be directed to that tenant. Any correction order to a tenant should specifically describe the offending conditions and the alleged violation(s).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">On June 20, 2000, petitioner Kane filed a notice of appeal to the Board, challenging the Correction order dated June 12, 2000. In the notice, petitioner Kane again denied being the owner of the property. He also denied the existence of any storage rooms in the building. He acknowledged, however, the existence of the small room in which the furnace and hot water heater were located, but denied that the tenants had access to the room. He maintained his position that any complaints regarding the leased premises should be addressed to the tenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">The Board held hearings on petitioners\u2019 appeals on June 7 and July 12, 2000. At the hearing on June 7, only petitioner Kane was present and he denied being the owner of the properties. The Board decided to postpone the hearing until the property owners were properly identified, notified and represented. On July 12, satisfied that all parties in interest were properly represented, the Board then conducted a hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>ing on the .merits of the appeal. Petitioners (both RDG and Mr. Kane) were represented by the same counsel. Petitioners and the County stipulated that they had come to an agreement as to most of the violations for which the petitioners had been cited. Both parties asked for the Board to make a determination on whether the owners and agent of the leased properties alone can be cited for the violations created by the tenants.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Board heard evidence from petitioners including petitioner Kane explaining the situation in 4204 Knox Road # 7:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYb\">\u201cThat\u2019s a single sleeping room. I have no control over it. It\u2019s just basically ... a rooming house building. I have no control over, in my view, the tenant so long as the tenant does not disturb other tenants, the tenant[\u2019]s matters do not spill over in the common areas, what the tenant does behind that door, as far as I\u2019m concerned, is the tenant\u2019s business. Others don\u2019t like that then I think they should directly address their concern to the tenant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">The Board heard evidence from the fire department and made the following findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-5\">\u201c1. James Kane, Jr. has a legal interest in the properties at issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-6\">\u201c2. The owner of the property located at 4204 Knox Road # 7, College Park, Maryland, is responsible for removing all trash and debris from the unit in order to abate a dangerous condition and bring the unit into compliance with Prince George\u2019s County Code Section ll-161(a)(l) and 11-159.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-7\">\u201c3. The room in dispute at the premises located at 4205 Knox Road, College Park, Maryland, constitutes a storage room and must be in compliance with Prince George\u2019s County Code Sections ll-161(a)(l) and 11-159.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">The Board did not assess any fines against the petitioners at that time. Following that decision, petitioners appealed to the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. In the Circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>Court, petitioners argued that the Board\u2019s reading of the County Code was erroneous and, as applied, violated the petitioners\u2019 rights to due process and equal protection. Finally, petitioners argued that the statute was void for vagueness. On August 13, 2001, the Circuit Court remanded the case to the Board and \u201cORDERED that given the equal protection concerns raised by the Petitioners, the Board of Appeals of Prince George\u2019s County, sitting as the Board of Administrative Appeals shall determine why the tenants were not cited for the violations at issue in this matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">On remand, the Board held meetings concerning this issue on three different dates October 3, 10, and 24, 2001. Petitioners were not advised of the dates and times of the meetings and were not given an opportunity to be heard. After the October 24 meeting the Board issued an \u201cOrder of the Board on Remand from the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland\u201d stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-5\">\u201cAfter reviewing the Order of the Circuit Court, the members of the Board met in executive session with counsel to the Board to discuss the law. At the Board\u2019s regular meeting on October 24, 2001, the matter was discussed in open session. The members agreed that this matter involved a rational basis test, versus strict scrutiny, and there was no violation of equal protection in declining to cite the tenants for the violations at issue \u2014 landlords have the ability to control their tenants, whether they do or not cannot hinder the local government from fulfilling its duty to protect the citizenry\u2019s health, safety and welfare, and it would require a \u2018Registry of Landlord-Tenant Agreements\u2019 to make tenants anywhere near as susceptible to enforcement as landowners are by virtue of the County tax records. Under the law, the decision by the Board to uphold the determinations of the County Fire Inspector -withstands an equal protection analysis.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">The Board determined that their prior decision met a rational basis inquiry and affirmed the correction orders. The Circuit Court, unsatisfied with the Board\u2019s explanation, remanded the case once again with specific instructions to determine why <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>the tenants were not cited; whether \u201cthere is a County policy to charge landlords rather than tenants where, as here, the tenant is equally or more accessible to code enforcement officers than the landlord;\u201d and if such policy did exist explain the rationale behind it. Furthermore, the Circuit Court directed the Board to give petitioners notice of the new hearing and \u201can opportunity to be heard and participate fully.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The Board held a remand hearing on July 17, 2002, in which the Fire Department and petitioners were allowed to present their arguments. Following the hearing, the Board issued a decision answering the Circuit Court\u2019s questions, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-6\">\u201cThe inspectors in this case are hereby determined, as a matter of credibility, to have cited the properties in question for the legitimate reasons set forth in the violation notice(s), and the landlord was served in good faith inasmuch as the law gives landlords ultimate responsibility for the condition of their real property (including the improvements thereon). As for a \u2018policy,\u2019 this Board finds that there is no \u2018policy\u2019 in terms of the government desiring to impose upon or inconvenience landlords as opposed to tenants; the County\u2019s inspectors simply follow the common sense of using the tax records and similar readily-available sources of information to enforce the County Code as efficiently and effectively as possible. (As stated previously in these proceedings, there is no \u2018tenant registry\u2019 readily-available to government employees, s'o there is no way a government employee can be sure the person answering the door of a rental unit is the actual tenant \u2014 conversely, the tax records provide a fairly reliable indication of who the landlord is, and in this case Mr. Kane has not seriously contended that there was error in that regard here with respect to the Knox Road unit(s) in question.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">The Board then determined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-8\">\u201cIn sum, this Board concludes that the landlord/owner was cited rather than the tenant(s) because this method of serving the citation is most likely to cause the corrective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>actions to be carried out as directed; to the extent that this manner of serving violation notices is a \u2018policy,\u2019 it comports with all laws, including the equal protection clause. The actions of the inspector(s) are hereby affirmed in all respects, on all grounds.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>The Circuit Court affirmed the Board\u2019s decision, finding that there was a rational basis for the fire department\u2019s practice of citing the owner and/or management agent of the building and not the tenants. The Court determined that \u201c[t]he ordinance provides wide discretion for the County to cite whomever it believes would most likely remedy the problem.\u201d As a result, \u201c[u]nder the rational basis test so long as the means are reasonable and the ends legitimate, the Court must give deference to the County\u2019s decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Petitioners appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. That court found that the plain language of the statute allowed the County to cite the landlord. The court also found that the County Code, as applied, met the rational basis inquiry required under the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution and Article 24 of Maryland Declaration of Rights. The Court of Special Appeals determined that the petitioners had the burden of demonstrating that the County Code as applied to them was unconstitutional. The intermediate appellate court found that the petitioners failed to meet that burden, in part, by not introducing a copy of the tenant\u2019s lease on the record showing the petitioners\u2019 lack of authority over the tenant\u2019s actions. The court took judicial notice of the fact that most leases in the state have clauses allowing the landlord to exercise control over the tenants by requiring them to comply with all laws and reserving the landlord\u2019s right to enter the premises if he or she has \u201cgood cause to believe the Tenant may have damaged the premises or may be in violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>of county, state, or federal law.\u201d The Court of Special Appeals then affirmed the Circuit Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Judge Harrell, writing for the Court, recently stated: \u201c \u2018We review an administrative agency\u2019s decision under the same statutory standards as the Circuit Court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Annapol is Market Place, L.L.C., v. Parker, </em>369 Md. 689, 703, 802 A.2d 1029, 1037 (2002) (quoting <em>Jordan Towing, Inc. v. Hebbville Auto Repair, Inc., </em>369 Md. 439, 449-52, 800 A.2d 768 (2002)). In <em>Board of Physician Quality Assurance v. Banks, </em>354 Md. 59, 67-69, 729 A.2d 376, 380-81 (1999), Judge Eldridge, writing for the Court, explained the standard of review for administrative agency decisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-6\">\u201cA court\u2019s role in reviewing an administrative agency adjudicatory decision is narrow, <em>United Parcel v. People\u2019s Counsel, </em>336 Md. 569, 576, 650 A.2d 226, 230 (1994); it \u2018is limited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u2019 <em>United Parcel, </em>336 Md. at 577, 650 A.2d at 230. <em>See also </em>Code (1984, 1995 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10-222(h) of the State Government Article; <em>District Council v.

Loveman, </em>349 Md. 560, 568-569, 709 A.2d 749, 753 (1998).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-7\">\u201cIn applying the substantial evidence test, a reviewing court decides \u2018whether a reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bulluck v. Pelham Wood Apts., </em>283 Md. 505, 512, 390 A.2d 1119, 1123 (1978). See <em>Anderson v. Dep\u2019t of Public Safety, </em>330 Md. 187, 213, 623 A.2d 198, 210 (1993). A reviewing court should defer to the agency\u2019s fact-finding and drawing of inferences if they are supported by the record. <em>CBS v. Comptroller, </em>319 Md. 687, 698, 575 A.2d 324, 329 (1990). A reviewing court \u2018 \u201cmust review the agency\u2019s decision in the light most favorable to it; ... the agency\u2019s decision is prima <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>facie correct and presumed valid, and ... it is the agency\u2019s province to resolve conflicting evidence\u2019 and to draw inferences from that evidence.\u201d <em>CBS v. Comptroller, supra, </em>319 Md. at 698, 575 A.2d at 329, quoting <em>Ramsay, Scarlett &amp; Co. v. Comptroller, </em>302 Md. 825, 834-835, 490 A.2d 1296, 1301 (1985). <em>See Catonsville Nursing v. Loveman, supra, </em>349 Md. at 569, 709 A.2d at 753 (final agency decisions \u201care <em>prima facie </em>correct and carry with them the presumption of validity\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-4\">\u201cDespite some unfortunate language that has crept into a few of our opinions,[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>] a \u2018court\u2019s task on review is <em>not </em>to \u201csubstitute its judgment for the expertise of those persons who constitute the administrative agency,\u201d \u2019 <em>United Parcel v. People\u2019s Counsel, supra, </em>336 Md. at 576-577, 650 A.2d at 230, quoting <em>Bulluck v. Pelham Wood Apts., supra, </em>283 Md. at 513, 390 A.2d at 1124. Even with regard to some legal issues, a degree of deference should often be accorded the position of the administrative agency. Thus, an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers should ordinarily be given considerable weight by reviewing courts. <em>Lussier v. Md. Racing Commission, </em>343 Md. 681, 696-697, 684 A.2d 804, 811-812 (1996), and cases there cited; <em>McCullough v.

Safety and Corr. Servs. v. Palmer, </em>389 Md. 443, 886 A.2d 554 (2005). Using these standards, we now turn to the Prince George\u2019s County Board of Appeals\u2019 decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">We shall discuss the three specific issues presented: the plain reading of the Prince George\u2019s County Code, the validity of the statute as applied under the Due Process Clause and the validity of the actions taken under the Equal Protection Clause of the United States and Maryland Constitutions. First, we note the framework for our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">A. Statutory Construction-Plain Meaning</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">This Court has previously stated that \u201c[ljocal ordinances and charters are interpreted under the same canons of construction that apply to the interpretation of statutes.\u201d <em>O\u2019Connor v. Balt. County, </em>382 Md. 102, 113, 854 A.2d 1191, 1198 (2004). It is also a well settled principle of law that \u201c \u2018[t]he cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the legislature,\u2019 \u201d in this case the County Council. <em>Rockwood Cas. Ins. Co. v. Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund, </em>385 Md. 99, 108, 867 A.2d 1026, 1031 (2005) (quoting <em>Oaks v. Connors, </em>339 Md. 24, 35, 660 A.2d 423, 429 (1995)).

Petitioners contend that the plain language of the statute requires the fire department to cite <em>only </em>the \u201cother person responsible for the condition or violation,\u201d i.e., the tenant. The County, on the other hand, argues that the qualifier \u201cresponsible for the condition or violation\u201d only modifies the term \u201cother person\u201d and, as a result, the fire department may cite the \u201cowner\u201d and/or \u201cagent\u201d even if they did not cause the condition or violation. The Circuit Court and later the Court of Special Appeals agreed with the County\u2019s interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">The analysis of this statute in respect to \u201cplain meaning\u201d involves a three step process.

Interpreting the language of the statute, Judge Harrell, writing for the Court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-6\">\u201cRespondents\u2019 interpretation of this section would have the clause \u2018who caused the ... violation of this subtitle\u2019 modify all three categories of potential responsible parties described in the statute, i.e. the \u2018owner,\u2019 the \u2018operator,\u2019 and \u2018any other person.\u2019 That interpretation, however, ignores the clear meaning of the structure and relationship of the words as they appear in the statute.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 175, 792 A.2d at 1139. More specifically, the Court determined that such interpretation would disregard the rule described in <em>Sullivan </em>and require that, in order to be found liable under the statute, the owner or operator must also have caused the violation. The Court then explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-8\">\u201cThe language of \u00a7 9-276 does not contain commas setting apart the three categories of potential responsible parties and the modifying clause (e.g. \u2018the owner or operator of the site, or any other person, who caused the [violation] ...\u2019), nor does it explicitly apply the modifying clause to all three parties. In the absence of such context, it is clear that the modifying clause \u2018who caused the [violation] ... \u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>was intended to apply <em>only </em>to \u2018any other person.\u2019 Consequently, the language of \u00a7 9-276(a) mandates that liability for reimbursement to the [Department] may be placed on any of 3 categories of persons who violate the subtitle: (1) an owner of a site [where the violation occurred]; (2) an operator of a site [where the violation occurred]; or (3) any other person who caused the [violation].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 176, 792 A.2d at 1139.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">ii. Punctuation: the Importance of a Comma</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">Like the statute in <em>Underwood, </em>\u00a7 11-162 does not contain commas setting apart the clause from the different categories of individuals named in the list. When the qualifying clause is set apart by a comma, it is clear that it modifies every element within the list. For example, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment states: \u201cnor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d The comma following the word \u201cproperty\u201d clearly indicates that the qualifying clause \u201cwithout due process of law\u201d applies to all three terms: life, liberty, and property.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">The Court of Special Appeals recognized that the qualifying clause was not set apart by a comma and was therefore limited to modify only the term \u201cother person.\u201d Petitioners, in response, argue that the intermediate court \u201cignored the comma before \u2018or,\u2019 which comma applies the entire subsequent phrase to \u2018owner\u2019 or \u2018agent.\u2019 \u201d There is no such comma in the statute. Interestingly, however, although \u2014 as we indicate\u2014 there is no comma after agent in the text of the actual statute, it somehow made it\u2019s way into the petitioners\u2019 briefs.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>iii. Meaning of the Word \u201cOther\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Under the County Code</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Petitioners argue that this reading of the County Code renders the word \u201cother\u201d superfluous. In support of their contention they point to <em>Underwood </em>as well. In addition to determining who was liable for the violation, the <em>Underwood </em>Court also determined that \u2014 under the statute \u2014 the action to seek reimbursement was a \u201clegal action.\u201d Md.Code (1982, 1996 Repl.Vol., 2001 Supp.), \u00a7 9-276(b) of the Environment Article provided that \u201c[i]n addition to any <em>other </em>legal action authorized by this subtitle, the Attorney General may bring an action to recover costs and interest from any person who fails to make reimbursement as required under subsection (a) of this section.\u201d <em>Underwood, </em>368 Md. at 174, 792 A.2d at 1138 (emphasis added). The Court concluded that the use of the word \u201cother,\u201d which is modified by the qualifying clause \u201clegal action,\u201d indicated that the action to recover costs under that section was a \u201clegal action.\u201d <em>Underwood, </em>368 Md. at 184, 792 A.2d at 1144. As a result, petitioners contend that under this interpretation of \u00a7 11-162 of the County Code, use of the term \u201cother\u201d indicates that the other persons named in the list must also be responsible for the condition or violation in order to be cited. The use of the words \u201cother\u201d and \u201clegal action\u201d in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>particular part of <em>Underwood, </em>however, related to a different context than that of the present case and offers little support for petitioners\u2019 position in the current context.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Petitioners\u2019 argument, moreover, fails to reconcile the Court\u2019s interpretation, in the <em>same opinion, of </em>two <em>adjacent sections of the same statute </em>containing the term \u201cother.\u201d As described <em>supra, </em>the Court limited the effect of the qualifying clause in \u00a7 9-276(a) of the Environment Article to \u201cany <em>other </em>person,\u201d interpreting \u201cother\u201d to exclude the owner or operator of the site. <em>Underwood, </em>368 Md. at 176, 792 A.2d at 1139.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Then, the Court interpreted the term \u201cother\u201d in \u00a7 9-276(b) of the Environment Article to mean that such action was also a \u201clegal action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 184, 792 A.2d at 1144. These apparent incongruent interpretations can be easily and reasonably explained. Section 9-276(a) of the Environment Article, like \u00a7 11-162 of the County Code (the section at issue here in the case at bar), involves a list of persons responsible for a violation of the code. Section 9-276(b) of the Environment Article, on the other hand, does not refer to a list of persons who have violated a statute, but to a type of action similar to that of different sections described in the Code. Furthermore, \u00a7 9-276(a) of the Environment Article and \u00a7 11-162 of the County Code could have easily been written to include all the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>persons of the list by the addition of a comma or an express provision in the statute to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">As petitioners suggest, an interpretation of the statute must not render any word within it superfluous or nugatory. <em>See Moore, </em>388 Md. at 453, 879 A.2d at 1115. The use of the word \u201cother\u201d supports the conclusion that the County Council intended to limit the qualifying clause to those persons, other than the ones in the specific list, responsible for the condition or violation. If the Council had intended that only the persons responsible for the violation were to be cited, then the use of the terms \u201cowner, operator, occupant, agent\u201d would be rendered superfluous. Had that been the intention of the drafters, they could simply have stated: \u201cNotice shall be served upon the p\u00e9rson responsible for the condition or violation.\u201d Such language, had it been used, might have restricted application of that section to only those persons who caused the condition or violation. But, the statute was not so drafted.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Applying the <em>Sullivan </em>standard to the facts of the case <em>sub judaic\u00e9, </em>we find \u2014 as did the Court of Special Appeals \u2014 that the qualifying clause \u201cresponsible for the condition or violation\u201d only modifies the term \u201cother person.\u201d As a result, there are five separate persons or entities who can be cited under the County Code: (1) the owner, (2) the operator, (3) the occupant, (4) the agent, or (5) \u201cother person responsible for the condition or violation.\u201d As a result, the owner, operator, occupant, or agent may be cited even though they may not have caused the condition or violation. We, therefore, affirm the Court of Special Appeals finding that the plain language of \u00a7 11-162 allows the fire department to cite the owner and/or managing agent of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">B. Due Process</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">In interpreting city and county ordinances, this Court has held that \u201c[t]he test for constitutionality under the Due Process Clause is whether a statute, as an exercise of the state\u2019s police power, bears a real and substantial relation to the public health, morals, safety, and welfare of the citizens of this state.\u201d <em>Bowie Inn, Inc. v. Bowie, </em>274 Md. 230, 236, 335 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>A.2d 679, 683 (1975); <em>see also Steuart Petroleum Co. v.

State Bd. of Cosmetologists, </em>268 Md. 32, 48, 300 A.2d 367, 377-78 (1973). In addition, the use of the police power \u201cwill not be interfered with unless it is shown to be misused or abused, or where it is shown to be exercised arbitrarily, oppressively or unreasonably.\u201d <em>Salisbury Beauty Schs., </em>268 Md. at 48, 300 A.2d at 377; <em>Steuart Petroleum, </em>276 Md. at 446, 347 A.2d at 861.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">This Court has previously addressed the validity of statutes regulating rental properties. In <em>McBriety v. Baltimore, </em>219 Md. 223, 148 A.2d 408 (1959), a Baltimore City ordinance requiring the licensing and registration of rental properties was challenged. The Court\u2019s analysis first pointed out that \u201c[t]here is also a presumption that a municipal ordinance is reasonable and for the public good, and the burden of proving the contrary is on those who attack it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 231, 148 A.2d at 414. If there are any reasonable doubts regarding the validity of the ordinance, they are resolved in its favor. <em>Id. </em>The Court also stated that this presumption remains, even if the exercise of police power may cause a loss to the individual. <em>Id. </em>The Court then held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-5\">\u201c[T]he City Council found that the licensing and inspection of rooming houses, multiple family dwellings or combinations thereof was required to protect the public health, safety, morals and general welfare. Such a finding is entitled to great weight and courts will not ordinarily interfere to enjoin the enforcement of an ordinance embodying such precepts unless it is shown that the ordinance is arbitrary or unreasonable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-6\"><em>McBriety, </em>219 Md. at 232,148 A.2d at 414.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">One of the arguments advanced by the owners of the properties in <em>McBriety </em>was that the privacy of the lessees would be infringed by the regulation, which required inspections of the premises. The Court, although in dicta, addressed that argument in a manner which is relevant here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>\u201cThe argument advanced by the owners \u2014 which they claim was ignored by the chancellor \u2014 to the effect that the privacy of a lessee is not subject to regulation (a truth which the defendants-appellees do not even contest), overlooks the fact that <em>it is the operators, who engage in the business of leasing multiple family dwellings, that are subjected to regulation by the terms of the ordinance, and not the tenants who lease from them. </em>Moreover, it is not likely that a tenant would object to an occasional inspection of his place of abode for health, fire and other hazards.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 233, 148 A.2d at 414-15 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Petitioners argue that the County Code as applied violates the Due Process Clause of the United States and the Maryland Constitutions.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In their view, the Board acted in an arbitrary, capricious, and unduly oppressive manner, when it held them responsible for the acts of the tenants, over whom \u2014 they argue \u2014 they have no control. It is fundamentally unfair, petitioners claim, to cite the property owner and manager for the acts of a third party. Petitioners contend that the Board\u2019s interpretation would require the owner or manager to inspect the premises, determine what constitutes a violation, and then \u201corder\u201d the tenant to correct the condition. They further point out that \u201cif the [petitioners] were to undertake such inspections and advise the tenants regarding such fire safety issues, the [petitioners] could be subject to significant civil liability for giving inaccurate or incomplete <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>advice in a highly technical and specialized field in which the [petitioners] have no special training or expertise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">In response to these arguments, the County explains that the County Code as applied bears a \u201csubstantial relation to the health, morals, safety, and welfare of the citizens of this state.\u201d That, in citing the owners and property managers, the County is exercising its police power. This practice, the County contends, is not arbitrary, capricious, or unduly burdensome because it does not require the owners or managers to become fire experts, conduct their own investigations, or issue correction orders. It simply requires the owner to ensure that the buildings meet the code requirements and to remedy any conditions found by the County to violate those requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The owners and managers, furthermore, are not automatically fined for the first finding of violations \u2014 in the case <em>sub judice </em>there were no fines levied even after the third notice was issued. After the first notice, the landlord is always in the position of correcting the condition for which he, she, or it was cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">There is no evidence to show that the statute is being inappropriately administered. The owners and managers of rental properties, the lessees of rental properties, the public, and the County, have an interest in ensuring that their buildings are safe. Interestingly, petitioner Kane during his testimony to the Board stated: \u201cso long as the tenant does not disturb other tenants, the tenant[\u2019]s matters do not spill over in the common areas, what the tenant does behind that door, as far as I\u2019m concerned, is the tenant\u2019s business.\u201d Mr. Kane fails to acknowledge that other tenants, at the least, will be disturbed and the problem will necessarily spill over into the common areas, if there is a fire. The statute, as applied, does not ask the landlord to inspect or even monitor every tenant\u2019s actions. It primarily requires that, upon notification of a violation, the landlord must ensure that the violation is corrected. This is not unreasonable. Additionally \u2014 as pointed out in <em>McBriety </em>\u2014 only the landlords are required to obtain a license to rent their properties, which subjects them to regular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>inspections under the County Code, as a result it is them who should most reasonably be cited for the violations found during the inspections.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">C. Equal Protection</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Petitioners contend that the County Code, as applied, violates the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution and Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> It is clear that petitioners are not members of a suspect class and that the County Code does not infringe upon a fundamental right requiring the application of strict scrutiny analysis.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>See Md Green Party v. Md Bd of Elections, </em>377 Md. 127, 161, 163, 832 A.2d 214, 234-35 (2003) (holding that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>classification affecting the right to vote is afforded a higher level of scrutiny); <em>Verzi v.

Mayor and City Council of Balt, </em>284 Md. 490, 496, 398 A.2d 52, 56 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">The County\u2019s practice of citing the owners and managers of rental properties and not the tenants concerns two distinct classes of individuals: the cited landlords/managers and the tenants who caused the condition or violation. This classification \u2014 not involving a fundamental right or a suspect class \u2014 is subject to a rational basis analysis: it must \u201cbear a rational relation to or rest upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to a legitimate state objective.\u201d <em>Massage Parlors, </em>284 Md. at 496-97, 398 A.2d at 56; <em>Md. Green Party, </em>377 Md. at 161, 832 A.2d at 234; <em>Verzi, </em>333 Md. at 419, 635 A.2d at 971; <em>Kirsch, </em>331 Md. at 98, 626 A.2d at 376; <em>Md. State Bd. of Barber Examiners v. Kuhn, </em>270 Md. 496, 507, 312 A.2d 216, 222 (1973). The Court, explaining this principle, has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-5\">\u201c \u2018The constitutional need for equal protection does not shackle the legislature. It has the widest discretion in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>classifying those who are to be regulated and taxed. Only if the grouping is without any reasonable basis, and so entirely arbitrary, is it forbidden. Abstract symmetry or mathematical nicety are not requisites. The selection need not depend on scientific or marked differences in things or persons or their relations. If any state of facts reasonably can be conceived that would sustain a classification, the existence of that state of facts as a basis for the passage of the law must be assumed. The burden is on him who assails a classification to show that it does not rest on any reasonable basis.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-4\"><em>Bruce, </em>261 Md. at 601-02, 276 A.2d at 209 (quoting <em>Allied Am. Mutual Fire Ins. Co. v. Comm\u2019r of Motor Vehicles, </em>219 Md. 607, 623, 150 A.2d 421, 431 (1959)); <em>see also Harden v. Mass Transit Admin., </em>277 Md. 399, 354 A.2d 817 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The County\u2019s purpose to ensure the safety and welfare of its citizens is an appropriate objective of government. As stated by the Court of Special Appeals in its opinion in this case: \u201cThe Board found that the purpose of subtitle 11 was to eliminate quickly and efficiently any dangerous condition likely to contribute to a fire by serving the person who was most likely to correct it.\u201d The only point in controversy is whether the classification bears a substantial relationship to that purpose. The answer to that question is twofold. First, landlords have, at the very least, an interest in the property they own, which gives them leverage. More importantly, however, they should have an interest in the safety of the tenants who inhabit those buildings. It is landlords who are most likely to ensure that the conditions are remedied.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Furthermore, the owners can be readily identified through a search of the land records. Petitioners contend that the tenant should be cited at least when the tenant allows the inspectors to enter the premises. There is no guarantee, however, that the person answering the door is the actual tenant or has any responsibility or interest in the property. The second reason why it is reasonable to cite the landlords is that, as stated in <em>McBriety supra, </em>it is the landlords who are subject to regulation. The landlords are required to obtain a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>license in order to rent, and are subject to the fire inspections as a result of that license. Accordingly, it is reasonable to cite them for the alleged violations of the County Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Finally, petitioners argue that the Court of Special Appeals incorrectly shifted the County\u2019s burden of proving all the elements of the violation. Petitioners contend that they did not bear the burden of producing a lease showing that they did not have control over their tenants. As stated above, the statute does not require that the owners be responsible for the violations in order to be charged. As a result, there is no requirement to show that the landlords could exercise control over their tenants. The exercise of control only comes into play upon the petitioners challenge to the statute, and as the Supreme Court of the United States has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-5\">\u201cLegislative classifications, however, are presumed to be constitutional, and the burden of showing a statute to be unconstitutional is on the challenging party, <em>not </em>on the party defending the statute: \u2018those challenging the legislative judgment must convince the court that the legislative facts on which the classification is apparently based could not reasonably be conceived to be true by the governmental decisionmaker.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-6\"><em>New York State Club Ass\u2019n, Inc. v.

Petitioners argue that this discrepancy denied them proper notice and violated their due process rights. This argument lacks merit. First, \u00a7 ll-161(a) requires that the Fire Chief order the removal of dangerous materials or conditions which \"include, but are not limited to\u201d those listed in sections (1) through (12).

In support of its finding, the Board stated that under well-settled principles of nuisance law, a landlord is responsible for dangerous conditions created by a tenant. This is not entirely correct. The Board quoted <em>Owings v. Jones, </em>9 Md. 108, 117-18 (1856): \"[W]here the owner leases premises which are a nuisance, or must, in the nature of things, become so by their user, and receives rent for them, then, whether in or out of possession, he is liable.\u201d This assertion is taken out of context as the entire passage actually states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-6\">\"LW]e understand the court to deduce, at least the two following principles from the numerous adjudications to which reference is <em>had: </em>\u2014 First.

There is no evidence that the apartment was a nuisance at the time it was leased to the tenant. It became a nuisance <em>\"only </em>by the act of the tenant\u201d and, as a result, the landlord would not be liable for any damages caused by it \u2014 at least not under this doctrine. <em>See Matthews v. Amberwood Assocs., </em>351 Md. 544, 556-57, 719 A.2d 119, 125 (1998); <em>Smith v.

The Court cited the following examples: when the \"landlord agrees to rectify a dangerous condition in the leased premises, and fails to do so, he may be liable for injuries caused by the condition. <em>See, e.g., Sacks v. Pleasant, </em>253 Md. 40, 44-46, 251 A.2d 858, 861-862 (1969);\u201d when the landlord \"voluntarily undertakes to rectify a dangerous or defective condition within the leased premises, and does so negligently, the landlord is liable for resulting injuries. <em>Miller v.

It is limited to allowing the County to cite the landlord for violations of the Code which may have been created by the tenant, albeit tolerated by the landlord. Whether the landlord could be liable for damages to tenants or third parties caused by such conditions is left to the facts of those cases in which the issues may arise.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b208-5\">. <em>\"Liberty Nursing v.

We recognize that the Court has come to a different conclusion in another case. In <em>Schmerling, 368 </em>Md. at 451 n. 9, 795 A.2d at 725 n. 9, the Court interpreted a statute stating: \"Any telephone or telegraph instrument, equipment or <em>other </em>facility <em>for the transmission of electronic communications.\" </em>The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-7\">\"While the qualifying clause only affects the immediately preceding word, the use of the word \u2018other\u2019 before \u2018facility\u2019 indicates that the \u2018facility\u2019 is <em>of the same kind as </em>'equipment' and \u2018instrument.\u2019 As petitioner points out, it would be nonsensical to use the word \u2018other\u2019 to modify \u2018facility\u2019 if the terms did not have some relation to each other. Therefore, while we agree with the Court of Special Appeals that the prepositional phrase, \u2018for the transmission of ... \u2019 only modifies \u2018facility,\u2019 we agree with petitioners that the use of the word 'other' connotes a similarity in the types of equipment listed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-8\"><em>Id. </em>In the case <em>sub judice, </em>restricting the qualifying clause to \"other person\u201d does not result in a nonsensical reading of the statute. Furthermore, petitioners\u2019 interpretation would render the use of the words owner, operator, occupant, and agent superfluous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b217-7\">.
