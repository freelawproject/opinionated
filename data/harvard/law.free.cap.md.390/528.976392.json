The tax credit may be applied only to reduce the amount of an individual\u2019s state income tax liability. In so holding, we reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County that, for the purposes of the tax credit in \u00a7 10-703(a), \u201cState income tax\u201d includes both State and local income taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Edward L. Blanton, Jr., and his wife, Estelle E. Blanton (collectively \u201cthe Blantons\u201d) contested their 2001 income tax assessment by filing a complaint with the Maryland Comptroller of the Treasury (hereafter \u201cComptroller\u201d). A hearing officer from the Comptroller\u2019s office determined that the tax credit applied exclusively to reduce state income taxes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Blantons appealed to the Maryland Tax Court and that administrative body affirmed the Comptroller\u2019s decision. The Blantons filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. After a hearing in the Circuit Court, the hearing judge reversed the decision of the Tax Court. On November 10, 2004, the Comptroller appealed that decision to the Court of Special Appeals. Before that court could decide the appeal, we issued, on our initiative, a writ of certiorari. <em>Comptroller v. Blanton, </em>387 Md. 122, 874 A.2d 917 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">The underlying facts in this case are largely undisputed. In 2001, the Blantons, as residents of Baltimore County, Maryland, held property interests in North Carolina and paid income taxes in both states. On August 15, 2002, the Blantons filed a 2001 Form 502 Resident Maryland Tax Return (\u201cForm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>502\u201d). The Blantons\u2019 federal adjusted gross income was $360,036.00 and their Maryland taxable net income was $287,676.00. The Maryland State income tax was $13,754.44 and the local Baltimore County tax was $8,026.16, for a combined total of $21,780.60. The Blantons were allowed a credit of $10,905.60, calculated under the Maryland tax formula, for taxes paid to North Carolina for North Carolina income tax. After application of the credit, the Blantons owed $2,849.44 for State income tax, while the local income tax portion remained at $8,026.16. The total combined amount of Maryland and local tax owed was $10,875.60. The amount owed after prior payments, taxes withheld, and all credits and offsets was $4,637.60, not including interest and penalties. Instead of paying the amount of tax assessed by this State, the Blantons subtracted the North Carolina income tax amount of $16,782.00 from $21,780.60, which yielded a difference of taxes owed as $4,998.00.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Further, the Blantons enclosed a letter with their Maryland income taxes in which they challenged the layout of Form 502. Specifically, they argued that the flaw in Form 502 exists in the fact that the State and local income taxes are calculated independently of each other. The Comptroller disregarded the letter and sent a letter to the Blantons, requiring them to pay the outstanding tax balance of $4,637.60.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In a letter dated October 22, 2002, the Blantons requested an informal hearing on the assessment. A hearing was later held. In the Notice of Final Determination, dated January 13, 2003, the Comptroller affirmed the assessment, finding that the Legislature intended a credit against the State income tax only.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Among other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>things, the Comptroller stated that the definition of \u201cState\u201d under \u00a7 1-101 (u) excluded counties or local districts.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">On January 28, 2003, the Blantons filed a \u201cPetition of Appeal\u201d with the Maryland Tax Court. On December 3, 2003, a hearing was held where both parties presented oral arguments. The Tax Court determined that the Legislature defined State tax and local tax as two distinct taxes, and, as such, they \u201care not the same, they are two separate ideas.\u201d Further, the Tax Court concluded that \u00a7 10-703(a) of the Tax-General Article that states \u201ca resident may claim a credit only against the State income tax\u201d directs a credit against the State income tax only. In addition, on December 18, 2003, the Tax Court affirmed the Comptroller\u2019s decision and held that the Legislature intended for the credit to apply against the State income tax and not the local income tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">On January 7, 2004, the Blantons filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. On July 23, 2004, a hearing was held. Thereafter, on October 15, 2004, the Circuit Court reversed the decision of the Tax Court and held that an ambiguity existed with the term \u201cState income tax.\u201d The Circuit Court further held that the definition of \u201cState income tax\u201d also includes local income tax for purposes of the tax credit under \u00a7 10-703(a) of the Tax \u2014 General Article.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">This Court recently examined, in detail, a court\u2019s role in reviewing an administrative agency\u2019s adjudicatory decision, and held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-8\">a court\u2019s task on review is <em>not </em>to \u201csubstitute its judgment for the expertise of those persons who constitute the admin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>istrative agency,\u201d <em>United, Parcel v. People\u2019s Counsel, </em>... 336 Md. [569,] ... 576-577, 650 A.2d [226,] ... 230 [(1990)], quoting <em>Bulluck v. Pelham Wood Apts., ... </em>283 Md. [505,] ... 513, 390 A.2d [1119,] ... 1124 [(1978)]. Even with regard to some legal issues, a degree of deference should often be accorded the position of the administrative agency. Thus, an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers should ordinarily be given considerable weight by reviewing courts. <em>Lussier v. Md. Racing Commission, </em>343 Md. 681, 696-697, 684 A.2d 804, 811-812 (1996), and cases there cited; <em>McCullough v. Wittner, </em>314 Md. 602, 612, 552 A.2d 881, 886 (1989) (\u201cThe interpretation of a statute by those officials charged with administering the statute is ... entitled to weight.\u201d). Furthermore, the expertise of the agency in its own field should be respected. <em>Fogle v. H &amp; G Restaurant, </em>337 Md. 441, 455, 654 A.2d 449, 456 (1995); <em>Christ v. Department of Natural Resources, </em>335 Md. 427, 445, 644 A.2d 34, 42 (1994) (legislative delegations of authority to administrative agencies will often include the authority to make \u201csignificant discretionary policy determinations\u201d); <em>Bd. of Ed. for Dorchester Co. v. Hubbard, </em>305 Md. 774, 792, 506 A.2d 625, 634 (1986) (\u201capplication of the State Board of Education\u2019s expertise would clearly be desirable before a court attempts to resolve the\u201d legal issues).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-5\"><em>Maryland Aviation Administration v.

Comptroller, </em>319 Md. 687, 697-98, 575 A.2d 324, 329 (1990) (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">The issue in this case is whether the language of \u00a7 10-703(a) of the Tax \u2014 General Article allows for a credit solely toward the State income tax, or allows for a credit toward both State and local income taxes. We hold that the statute refers only to the State income tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">The Comptroller maintains that the Circuit Court erred when it failed to recognize that only non-substantive changes wei'e made to \u00a7 10-703(a) of the Tax-General Article during the Legislature\u2019s revision of the tax code in 1988.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Comptroller argues that when the Legislature undertakes code recodification, any modifications or enactments ordinarily are non-substantive, unless the Legislature denotes otherwise. Further, the Comptroller contends that the plain language of \u00a7 10-703(a), which states that a taxpayer may \u201cclaim a credit only against the State income tax,\u201d explicitly means that the local tax is not available for the credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\"> The Blantons argue that the Legislature intended that \u00a7 10-703(a) of the Tax \u2014 General Article include both State and local income tax; thus, the Maryland Tax Return, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>Form 502, which separates computation of State and local taxes, is inaccurate.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">The issue <em>sub judice </em>is one of statutory interpretation. The cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent. <em>O\u2019Connor v. Baltimore County, </em>382 Md. 102, 113, 854 A.2d 1191, 1198 (2004); <em>Privette v. State, </em>320 Md. 738, 744, 580 A.2d 188, 191 (1990) (citations omitted). We may consider the general purpose and aim of a statute in an effort to discern legislative intent. <em>Kaczorowski v. City of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 513, 525 A.2d 628, 632 (1987). Our long-standing rule is that if the language used in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>the statute is clear, unambiguous, and consistent with its objective, the words will be accorded their ordinary meaning. <em>Ayres v. Townsend, </em>324 Md. 666, 672, 598 A.2d 470, 473 (1991) (citations omitted); <em>see G. Heileman Brewing Co. Inc. v.

Further, Maryland has long accepted the doctrine of <em>expressio (or inclusio) unius est exclusio alterius, </em>or the expression of one thing is the exclusion of another. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1717 (8th ed.2004). <em>Baltimore Harbor v.

Further, it is well-settled that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-7\">\u201c[Recodification] of statutes is presumed to be for the purpose of clarity rather than change of meaning and, thus, even a change in the phraseology of a statute by a codification will not ordinarily modify the law unless the change is so radical and material that the intention of the Legislature to modify the law appears unmistakably from the language of the Code.\u201d <em>Hoffman v.

It did not. Instead, the Legislature used the words \u201conly ... State income tax.\u201d In its expression of one narrow objective (a credit against only the State income tax), it canceled out all other possibilities. The word \u201conly\u201d is limited by what it expresses, the credit applies only toward the State portion of the income tax, not the local income tax. The plain meaning of the statute is that the local tax is excluded, and only State tax may be offset or reduced. We hold that \u00a7 10-703(a) of the Tax-General Article shows a clear legislative intent to limit the credit to State income tax to Maryland residents who also pay income tax to another state.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">The language in Maryland Code (1988, 2004 RepLVol.), \u00a7 10-706 of the Tax \u2014 General Article is further support for the proposition that \u00a7 10-703(a) of the Tax \u2014 General Article limits the credit to State income tax. Section 10-706, when read in conjunction with Section 10-703, specifically allocates how the credit should be applied. Section 10-706, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-7\">\u00a7 10-706.

The Legislature clearly enumerated the sections to which a credit against county taxes applies in \u00a7 10-706(b) and (c)(2); it is illogical to interpret the language in \u00a7 10-703(a) to include a county tax credit if that section was not included in the specific exceptions set forth by the Legislature. <em>See Frost v. State, </em>336 Md. 125, 137, 647 A.2d 106, 112 (1994) (noting that we seek to avoid illogical statutory constructions) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">Prior to the revision in 1996, \u00a7 10-703 was specifically referred to in former \u00a7 10-706, which stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-10\">\u00a7 10-706.

The Drafter\u2019s Note stated that the reason \u00a7 10-703 was removed from the statute was for stylistic reasons only, to correct \u201cawkward section structure in \u00a7 10-706 of the Tax\u2014General Article.\u201d Ch. 10 of the Acts of 1996. The statutory modification was not for substantive reasons. It is clear by the plain and unambiguous language of former \u00a7\u00a7 10-706(b)(1) and (2) that the Legislature intended that the credit allowed against State income tax is separate and apart from any credit allowed against county tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">The Blantons also rely on <em>Stern v. Comptroller, </em>271 Md. 310, 316 A.2d 240 (1974), wherein this Court held that the \u201cState income tax,\u201d for purposes of a credit, included both State and local tax. At that time, the applicable statute that stated a taxpayer shall receive a credit toward the State income tax if the taxpayer paid income tax to another state was Article 81, \u00a7 290.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Section 290 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-5\">\u00a7 290.

Section 290(a) and (b) became Maryland Code (1988), \u00a7 10-703(a) of the Tax-General Article. During the revision of \u00a7 290, the language of \u00a7 290(a) was revised and \u00a7 290(b) was deleted.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">The Blantons acknowledged that soon after the <em>Stem </em>decision the Legislature \u201cquickly\u201d amended Art. 81, \u00a7 290 to include Art. 81, \u00a7 290(b), which specifically excluded local tax from the credit. The Blantons argue, however, that in 1988 when the Legislature revised the tax code to its current form (from Art. 81 \u00a7 290 to \u00a7 10-703(a) of the Tax \u2014 General Article) and omitted \u00a7 290(b), its intent was to restore the holding of <em>Stem, </em>which allowed a credit against both local and State income tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">The Circuit Court pointed out that \u201c[njeither party submitted any legislative history on this question. [The trial judge reasoned that hjad the Maryland Legislature kept the original language contained in Art. 81 \u00a7 2[90](b), th[e trial] court\u2019s ruling would support the Comptroller\u2019s position.\u201d Although the Circuit Court noted a lack of legislative history submitted by the parties regarding \u00a7 10-703(a), the court apparently overlooked the Revisor\u2019s Notes which are, indeed, part of the legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">Here, the Legislature intended that the addition of the word \u201conly\u201d in \u00a7 290(a) would replace \u00a7 290(b). Further, \u00a7 290(b) was deemed \u201cunnecessary.\u201d The Revisor\u2019s Notes for Art. 81 \u00a7 290, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-10\">In subsection (a) of this section, the defined term \u201cState income tax\u201d and the word \u201conly\u201d are substituted for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>former references to \u201cincome payable ... under this subtitle,\u201d to limit the credit. Therefore, former Art. 81, \u00a7 290(b), which precluded reduction of \u201cany local income tax imposed under \u00a7 283 of this article,\u201d is deleted as unnecessary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">Further, when Article 81 was revised, a report was prepared by the Department of Legislative Reference which stated that, \u201c[e]very effort is made to ensure that the proposed revision conforms as nearly as possible to the intent of the General Assembly, and all these revisions are highlighted in the appropriate [Rjevisor\u2019s [Njotes.... These [Rjevisor\u2019s [Njotes also explain all significant changes made in the revision process.\u201d Department of Legislative Reference Report, <em>Report on Senate Bill 1, Tax </em>\u2014 General <em>Article </em>(January 14, 1988). It is clear that the Legislature, as a \u201chousekeeping\u201d measure, intended to eliminate \u00a7 290(b) and replace it with the word \u201conly\u201d in \u00a7 290(a). The Legislature found \u00a7 290(b) to be superfluous. Moreover, had the Legislature intended to substantively change the statute, that intent would more than likely have been made plain.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">In conclusion, we hold that the Legislature did not intend the term \u201conly against the State income tax\u201d to include local income tax for purposes of credits under \u00a7 10-703(a) of the Tax \u2014 General Article. After a review of the plain language of the statute, a review of both the Revisor\u2019s Notes, and the Legislative Report, we conclude the Legislature did not make any substantive changes to the statute. Moreover, we defer to the decision by the Comptroller\u2019s office and its interpretation of \u00a7 10-703(a). Therefore, the Blantons are not absolved from paying the local income tax to the Comptroller, including any penalties and interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY REVERSED.

Although \u00a7 10-703 was enacted to allow taxpayers to avoid double taxation to some extent, it also required that Maryland receive, at the least, the income tax on the income attributable to Maryland, regardless of the amount paid to another state. <em>See Comptroller v.
