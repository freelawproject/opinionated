The court initially established a child support obligation at the July 22, 2004, hearing in response to the father, Robert C.\u2019s, Motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>Determine (and Allocate) Child Support. The resulting order relieved Victoria C. (hereinafter appellant), of any child support obligation. On March 21, 2005, the Circuit Court held a permanency plan review hearing at which, without prior notice to the parties that the hearing would concern issues of support, it re-evaluated the child support situation of Katherine C., applied the child support guidelines under Md.Code (1984, 1999 Repl.Vol., 2004 Supp.), \u00a7 12-204 of the Family Law Article, and entered an order<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> providing that appellant, the child\u2019s mother, \u201cshall pay $282 per month in child support ... to begin on May 1, 2005____\u201d On March 24, 2005, appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the order to pay child support stating that she was a destitute parent as defined in Md.Code (1984, 1999 RepLVol.), \u00a7 13-101(c) of the Family Law Article.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On April 13, 2005, the Circuit Court entered an order denying appellant\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration. On July 7, 2005, appellant noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. This Court, on its own initiative and prior to any proceedings in the intermediate appellate court, granted certiorari. <em>In re Katherine C., </em>388 Md. 97, 879 A.2d 42 (2005). Appellant submits three questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-5\">1. \u201cMay a juvenile court exercising jurisdiction in a CINA[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] case use the Maryland Child-Support Guidelines to calculate the child-support amount, where the child is in the custody of a government agency?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>2. \u201cMay a juvenile court exercising continuing jurisdiction in a CINA case at a permanency-plan-review hearing enter an order establishing or modifying a parent\u2019s obligation to pay child support, and may it do so in the absence of a pleading filed by any party requesting the entry or modification of a child-support order, and <em>without affording adequate notice to the parent? </em>\u201d [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-4\">3. \u201cIf so, did the juvenile court err or abuse its discretion in ordering the mother to pay child support to a government agency, where the mother met the statutory definition of an adult destitute child or parent, in that she is mentally retarded, was unemployed, her monthly expenses exceeded her monthly income, and where the child was in the custody of a government agency as the result of sexual abuse by the father, who is serving a sentence of imprisonment as a result of that abuse?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">We decline to answer question three as it does not plainly appear in the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Md. Rule 8-131(a). We find that a juvenile court exercising jurisdiction in a CINA case may use the Guidelines to calculate the child support amount, where the child is in the custody of a government agency but, in such a circumstance, the actual total support awarded may not exceed the actual costs expended by the governmental agency. As to question two, however, we hold that adequate notice of the child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>support hearing was not provided to the appellant, and therefore, we vacate the decision of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County requiring appellant to pay child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">' Appellant and her ex-husband, Robert C. (hereinafter referred to as the husband or father), are the biological parents of Katherine C., born March 6, 1988. On October 3, 2003, at the age of fifteen, Katherine was removed from the care of her parents after the Montgomery County Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cMCDHHS\u201d) filed a petition in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County alleging that Katherine was a Child in Need of Assistance (CINA).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On November 3, 2003, the Circuit Court found Katherine to be a CINA after it was established that her father began having sexual relations with her on an ongoing basis when she was eight years old, and that her mother, appellant, had failed to protect the child. As a result of this finding, Katherine was placed in the John L. Gildner Regional Institute for Children and Adolescents (RICA), a residential treatment program for children and adolescents with severe emotional disabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">On June 21, 2004, the father filed a Motion to Determine (and Allocate) Child Support.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The motion suggested that $10,500.00 he had paid into his attorney\u2019s trust account be used to support Katherine at the rate of $700.00 a month for the 15 months running retroactively from October 1, 2003, when Katherine went into care, through December 31, 2004. On July 21, 2004, appellant filed her own Motion for Establishment of Child Support.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Both motions calculated support using the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>On July 22, 2004, the Circuit Court conducted a CINA review hearing and a hearing to determine the amount of child support payable by Katherine\u2019s parents. On August 5, 2004, the Circuit Court entered a <em>pendente lite </em>order directing that the $10,500.00, minus $150.00 which had already been expended on behalf of Katherine, paid by the father to his attorney\u2019s trust account, be used to satisfy his obligation of $700.00 per month in child support. Of the $700.00 per month, $500.00 was payable to MCDHHS as reimbursement for the cost of Katherine\u2019s care and $200.00, to be administered by MCDHHS, would be utilized for Katherine\u2019s future expenses. The total amount of $10,350.00 satisfied the father\u2019s child support obli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>gation retroactive from October 1, 2008 through December 31, 2004. It was further ordered at that hearing that appellant would not be obligated to pay child support because of her marginal income. Finally, the order stated \u201cthat the matter of the parents\u2019 respective child support obligations on behalf of [Katherine C.] shall be subject to further review by th[e] [Circuit] Court after December 31, 2004.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">On March 21, 2005, the Circuit Court held a regular permanency plan review hearing and, without prior notice to appellant that it was going to do so, revisited the child support issue. At the time, the father was incarcerated for charges relating to the child abuse of Katherine and therefore, unable to pay child support.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The court inquired at the review hearing as to whether appellant was in a position to pay child support at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Counsel for appellant stated that \u201cmy client is operating with an IQ of about 62, and she needs a lot of help, ...\u201d but \u201cshe wants her daughter to have as much support as she can to get all of the money that she possibly can ...\u201d and that \u201c[a]s soon as her record is expunged, she is going to be able to go back to work at the daycare.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Counsel stated that: \u201cShe does have a driver\u2019s license. She is actually amazingly high-functioning given her intellectual abilities.\u201d The court asked whether appellant had a job and counsel replied: \u2018Tes, she says, in two weeks. That is what she has told me.\u201d Counsel continued, stating that \u201c[appellant] would like to give every penny she has to her daughter, Your Honor.\u201d The colloquy continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>563</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-4\">\u201c[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: \u2014 and this is the issue that we had when we were in here with Judge Savage and my client had a divorce attorney who represented her and did the child support. And he explained to Judge Savage that my client\u2019s desire is to give every penny she has to her daughter, but Judge Savage recognized, because of my client\u2019s limitations, that she is going to have some trouble supporting herself and that she shouldn\u2019t be ordered to pay child support.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-5\">THE COURT: Well, the fact that she is wanting to give every penny is nice, but it really doesn\u2019t get to the heart of the issue. The heart of the issue is, is there an ability to pay support.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Appellant testified that she would be starting back at work in a few weeks. She stated that she would be making $9.25 an hour and working forty hours a week, netting $400.00 every two weeks. She also testified that she owned a car and would drive herself to and from work. The court determined that, based upon these facts, appellant should pay child support. Applying the Guidelines, the court found that with an income of $19,240.00 a year, or $9.25 an hour, taking into account a $200.00 per month credit for health insurance payments, the guidelines provided for child support payments of $282.00 a month.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">Counsel for appellant objected, stating that \u201cbecause of her cognitive limitations, I don\u2019t think it is fair to base any order on her representations.... <em>She doesn\u2019t ham her child support </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number><em>attorney here, and we weren\u2019t scheduled to be here to determine whether she has a child support obligation.\u201d </em>[Emphasis added]. In consideration of the objection, the court made the order <em>pendente lite, </em>stating, however, \u201c[b]ut, if I felt that she didn\u2019t have the ability to pay and I felt she didn\u2019t understand, she has done very well, she has answered every question perfectly____\u201d The court then, over continuing objection, set the order for $282.00 in child support per month to begin on May 1, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">On March 24, 2005, appellant filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the order to pay child support. She alleged that she is a disabled or destitute parent as defined by Md.Code (1984, 1999 Repl.Vol., 2004 Supp.), \u00a7 13-101(c) of the Family Law Article. The motion also alleged that appellant was unemployed and that her testimony at the March 21, 2005, hearing concerning her job prospects was not credible. In addition, the motion alleged that a child support obligation of $282.00 per month was not in accordance with \u00a7 12-201(d) of the Family Law Article, that it was unjust, would pose a substantial hardship upon appellant, and was not in the best interests of Katherine, the minor child. On April 13, 2005, the Circuit Court denied appellant\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">A. Maryland Child Support Guidelines</p>\n<p id=\"b612-10\">This Court first addressed the Guidelines in <em>Voishan v. Palma, </em>327 Md. 318, 609 A.2d 319 (1992). There, the Court explained why the Legislature enacted the Guidelines set forth in Md.Code (1984, 1999 Repl.Vol., 2004 Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 12-101 <em>et seq. </em>of the Family Law Article:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-11\">\u201cThe General Assembly enacted these guidelines in 1989 to comply with federal law and regulations. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 651-667 (1982 &amp; 1984 Supp. II) and 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 302.56 (1989). The federal mandate required that the guidelines be established and \u2018based on specific descriptive and numeric criteria and result in a computation of the support obligation.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>When drafting the guidelines, the Maryland Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee had before it <em>Devel</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number><em>opment of Guidelines For Child Support Orders: Advisory Panel Recommendations and Final Report, </em>U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office of Child Support Enforcement. This report explained that the need for the guidelines was threefold: (1) to \u2018remedy a shortfall in the level of awards\u2019 that do not reflect the actual costs of raising children, (2) to \u2018improve the consistency, and therefore the equity, of child support awards,\u2019 and (3) to \u2018improve the efficiency of court processes for adjudicating child support. ...\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-4\"><em>Voishan, </em>327 Md. at 322, 609 A.2d at 321.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Section 12-101(a) of the Family Law Article provides Maryland courts with the authority to award child support to a custodial parent or child support agency. <em>See Wills v. Jones, </em>340 Md. 480, 484, 667 A.2d 331, 333 (1995). Section 12-104(a) states that \u201c[t]he court may modify a child support award subsequent to the filing of a motion for modification and upon a showing of a material change of circumstance.\u201d Use of the Guidelines is mandatory in most instances, as \u00a7 12-202(a) provides that \u201cin any proceeding to establish or modify child support, whether pendente lite or permanent, the court <em>shall </em>use the child support guidelines set forth in this subtitle.\u201d (Emphasis added). Section 12-202(a)(2)(i) further provides that \u201c[tjhere is a rebuttable presumption that the amount of child support which would result from the application of the child support guidelines ... is the correct amount of child support to be awarded.\u201d \u201cThe presumption may be rebutted by evidence that the application of the guidelines would be unjust or inappropriate in a particular case.\u201d \u00a7 12-202(a)(2)(ii). Courts may consider a number of factors in determining whether the application of the Guidelines would be unjust or inappropriate in a particular case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-6\">\u201c1. the terms of any existing separation or property settlement agreement or court order, including any provisions for payment of mortgages or marital debts, payment of college education expenses, the terms of any use and possession order or right to occupy to the family home under an agreement, any direct payments made for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>benefit of the children required by agreement or order, or any other financial considerations set out in an existing separation or property settlement agreement or court order; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-5\">2. the presence in the household of either parent of other children to whom that parent owes a duty of support and the expenses for whom that parent is directly contributing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">\u00a7 12 \u2014 202(a)(2) (iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">If the court finds that the application of the Guidelines would be unjust or inappropriate in a particular case, the court must make a \u201cwritten finding or specific finding on the record stating the reasons for departing from the guidelines\u201d and the finding must state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-8\">\u201cA. the amount of child support that would have been required under the guidelines;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-9\">B. how the order varies from the guidelines;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-10\">C. how the finding <em>serves the best interests of the child; </em>and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-11\">D. in cases in which items of value are conveyed instead of a portion of the support presumed under the guidelines, the estimated value of the items conveyed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-12\">\u00a7 12-202(a)(2)(v)(2) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-13\">Use of the Guidelines to determine child support when the child is in the custody of a government agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-14\">Appellant argues that a juvenile court exercising jurisdiction in a CI\u00d1A case may not use the Guidelines to calculate child support, where the child is in the custody of a government agency rather than in the custody of one of the parents. We find appellant\u2019s argument to be unpersuasive and hold that courts in CINA proceedings may apply the Guidelines as codified in \u00a7\u00a7 12-101 <em>et seq. </em>of the Family Law Article even when the child support monies will go towards the reimbursement of State care.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-15\">Md.Code (1973, 2002 Repl.Vol., 2004 Supp.), \u00a7 3-819(Z) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article expressly provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>authorization for courts to order a parent to reimburse the State for the costs of a CINA child\u2019s commitment:<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ags\">\u201cAfter giving the parent a reasonable opportunity to be heard, and determining the income of the parent, the court may order either parent or both parents to pay a sum in the amount the court directs to cover wholly or partly the support of the child under this subtitle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">This provision applies in CINA and non-CINA cases.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>See </em>2001 Md. Laws, ch. 415.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">One of the main purposes of the Guidelines is to \u201c \u2018improve the consistency, and therefore the equity, of child support awards.\u2019 \u201d <em>Voishan, </em>327 Md. at 322, 609 A.2d at 321. Applying the Guidelines \u201cacross the board,\u201d regardless of whether a child is in the care of one of their parents or the State helps to ensure this consistency. A parent that meets the Guidelines should not benefit by being released of their obligation to pay child support just because it is determined that their child is a CINA and removed from parental custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">The Court of Special Appeals addressed the situation of child support being paid to the State in <em>In re Joshua W., </em>94 Md.App. 486, 617 A.2d 1154 (1993). <em>In re Joshua W. </em>concerned a number of children that, like Katherine in the case <em>sub judice, </em>were adjudicated CINA and placed under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>protective custody of the State. <em>Id. </em>at 488-89, 617 A.2d at 1155. The Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County held a hearing to determine if the mother and father of the children (at that time divorced) should pay support for the children. <em>Id. </em>at 489, 617 A.2d at 1155-56. The court determined and ordered that the father should pay $300 per week in child support on behalf of the children to the Anne Arundel County Department of Social Services (\u201cDSS\u201d). <em>Id. </em>at 489, 617 A.2d at 1156. The focus of the appeal was \u201cwhether the circuit court erred in ordering [the father] to reimburse DSS for the support of [the children].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 490, 617 A.2d at 1155.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Judge Motz, writing for the Court of Special Appeals, first set out to determine whether the trial court was obliged to use the Guidelines as set forth in Md.Code (1984, 1999 Repl.Vol., 2004 Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 12-101 <em>et seq. </em>of the Family Law Article. <em>In re Joshua W., </em>94 Md.App. at 494, 617 A.2d at 1158. The court looked at the predecessor statute to \u00a7 3-8A-29, Md.Code (1973, 1989 RepLVol.), \u00a7 3-830 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. Section 3-830 states that, \u201c[a]fter giving the parent a reasonable opportunity to be heard, the court may order either parent or both parents to pay a sum in the amount the court directs to cover the support of the child in whole or in part.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The court found that nothing in the language of \u00a7 3-830 or in its legislative history placed a limit on the amount the court could direct a parent to pay based on the Guidelines. <em>In re Joshua W., </em>94 Md.App. at 495, 617 A.2d at 1158. Rather, the court looked to the Guidelines themselves to determine their applicability: \u201cThe guideline legislation does specifically provide, in pertinent part, that \u2018in <em>any proceeding to establish or modify child support, </em>whether pendente lite or permanent, the court <em>shall </em>use the child support guidelines set forth in this subtitle.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting \u00a7 12-202(a) of the Family Law Article).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">The Court of Special Appeals, however, recognized that the facts in <em>In re Joshua W., </em>as with the case <em>sub judice, </em>are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>like most actions for child support. <em>In re Joshua W., </em>94 Md.App. at 495, 617 A.2d at 1158. In most cases of child support actions one custodial parent is seeking child support from the non-custodial parent. In contrast, both <em>In re Joshua W. </em>and the case <em>sub judice </em>involve two non-custodial parents and a third party, the State. In both cases the circuit courts ordered a parent to pay child support to the State for reimbursement of custodial care. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">The court in <em>In re Joshua W. </em>examined the development of the Guidelines and found that the language of the Guidelines emphasized custodial and non-custodial parents, failing to directly address the factual situation at hand. <em>In re Joshua W., </em>94 Md.App. at 496-97, 617 A.2d at 1159. The court, however, elucidated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-5\">\u201cDespite this emphasis on custodial and noncustodial parents and sole and shared physical custody in the guidelines, there is nothing in the statute or its legislative history to suggest that the General Assembly intended that the child support guidelines <em>only </em>be applied to the usual child support cases.... Rather, as noted above, Fam. Law. \u00a7 12-202(a) expressly provides that the guidelines \u2018shall\u2019 be used \u2018in <em>any </em>proceeding to establish child support.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-6\"><em>In re Joshua W., </em>94 Md.App. at 497-98, 617 A.2d at 1159-60. The Court of Special Appeals found further support for the conclusion that the Guidelines are to be, or may be, used in all child support cases, by referencing the federal legislation <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> that spurred the creation of Maryland\u2019s Guidelines as well as Maryland\u2019s foster care regulations.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>In re Joshua W., </em>94 Md.App. at 498, 617 A.2d at 1160.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>Ultimately, based on the above factors, the court in <em>In re Joshua W. </em>concluded that \u201cthe General Assembly intended that these child support guidelines be used in all child support cases, including those, like the one at hand, involving government financed child care and no custodial parent.\u201d <em>In re Joshua W., </em>94 Md.App. at 500, 617 A.2d at 1161.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">That finding is consistent with the State of Maryland\u2019s policies regarding child support and children generally. A parent has both a common law and statutory duty to support his or her minor children. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1984, 2004 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 5-203(b)<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> of the Family Law Article; <em>Drummond v. Drummond, </em>350 Md. 502, 520, 714 A.2d 163, 172 (1998); <em>Garay v. Overholtzer, </em>332 Md. 339, 368-69, 631 A.2d 429, 432 (1993); <em>Middleton v.

As the Court discussed in <em>Drummond:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-6\">\u201cWe previously have noted the rationale underlying a parent\u2019s obligation of support:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-7\">\u2018[T]he duty of parents to provide for the maintenance of their children, is a principle of natural law; an obligation laid on them not only by nature herself, but by their own proper act, in bringing them into the world: ... By begetting them therefore they have entered into a voluntary obligation to endeavor, as far as in them lies, that the life which they have bestowed shall be supported and preserved.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-8\"><em>Knill v. Knill, </em>306 Md. 527, 531-32, 510 A.2d 546, 548 (1986) (quoting 1 W. Blackstone, <em>Commentaries </em>* 447). <em>See also Warren v. Warren, </em>336 Md. 618, 629, 650 A.2d 252, 257 (1994) (quoting Knill). To relieve a parent entirely of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>or her support obligation because the child receives a benefit to which he or she is entitled from some other source would not ordinarily be consistent with this fundamental principle of family law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-4\"><em>Drummond, </em>350 Md. at 520, 714 A.2d at 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">It is evident that parents have an obligation to support their children. In a case such as the one <em>sub judice, </em>that obligation does not disappear when a child is adjudicated CI\u00d1A and removed from parental custody and care. The parents of the child, jointly and severally, have a responsibility and obligation to provide child support if they are capable of doing so. \u00a7 5-203(b). The proper method for a court to use in determining the amount of child support normally is the application of the Guidelines. As \u00a7 12-202(a) provides, \u201cin any proceeding to establish or modify child support, whether pendente lite or permanent, the court <em>shall </em>use the child support guidelines set forth in this subtitle.\u201d (Emphasis added). Therefore, a juvenile court exercising jurisdiction in a CI\u00d1A case <em>may </em>(or under some circumstances should) use the Guidelines to calculate child support even where the child is in the custody of a government agency, but, in such cases, the amount of the total payment from the parents to the governmental agency cannot exceed the actual costs to the agency,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> even if the guideline calculations might require a greater sum had the child been in the custody of a non-governmental entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">B. Notice</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Appellant argues further, that if a child support order may be entered at a permanency plan review hearing, it may only be entered subject to a pleading being filed by one of the parties requesting the entry of a child support order and <em>adequate notice being provided to the parties. </em>We find that adequate notice appropriate to the nature of the case was not provided to appellant that the matter of child support would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>be addressed at the March 21, 2005, hearing. Thus, we direct our attention to the due process concerns of appellant relating to lack of notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">In a case such as the one <em>sub judice, </em>the trial court must provide reasonable notice to the parties concerning <em>when </em>the matter of child support will be addressed. This Court has stated previously that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-6\">\u201cGenerally, due process requires that a party to a proceeding is entitled to both notice and an opportunity to be heard on the issues to be decided in a case. <em>Standard Oil Co. v.

The bank attempted to provide statutory notice by publishing notice in a newspaper, which \u201cset[ ] forth merely the name and address of the trust company, the name and the date of establishment of the common trust fund, and a list of all participating estates, trusts or funds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 310, 70 S.Ct. at 655. The Court found that, while such notice was sufficient for those beneficiaries that could not be ascertained, the notice was insufficient with respect to known beneficiaries \u201cbecause under the circumstances it [was] not reasonably calculated to reach those who could easily be informed by other means at hand.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 319, 70 S.Ct. at 660.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Discussing due process, the Court found that the \u201cabstract words of the Due Process Clause ... at a minimum [ ] require that deprivation of life, liberty or property by adjudication be preceded by notice and opportunity for hearing appropriate to the nature of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 313, 70 S.Ct. at 656-57. The Court found that the judicial settlement of the bank\u2019s accounts could deprive some beneficiaries of property rights and \u201chence notice and hearing must measure up to the standards of due process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 313, 70 S.Ct. at 657.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">The Court in <em>Mullane </em>balanced the interest of the State in the finality of the settlement against the individual interests of the beneficiaries as protected under the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-7\">\u201cThis is defined by our holding that \u2018The fundamental requisite of due process of law is the opportunity to be heard.\u2019 <em>Grannis v.

In the case <em>sub judice, </em>appellant received notice of a hearing, but not reasonable notice appropriate to the nature and facts of this particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Examining how to determine whether notice is reasonable or not, the Court in <em>Mullane </em>opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-7\">\u201cAn elementary and fundamental requirement of due process in any proceeding which is to be accorded finality is <em>notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.

Venker, </em>316 Md. 212, 557 A.2d 1338 (1989). <em>Phillips </em>concerned a personal injury action in which the judge ruled on a motion for summary judgment during a telephone conference hearing. The facts surrounding the telephone conference gave rise to the lack of notice. Plaintiffs counsel had called the court to determine whether any action had been taken on his request for a continuance. <em>Id. </em>at 214, 557 A.2d at 1339. Somehow the call was directed to the judge assigned to hearing the motion for summary judgment, who arranged an immediate telephone conference between the parties. <em>Id. </em>at 215, 557 A.2d at 1339. The judge expressed a reluctance to postpone the scheduled hearing and, even though this telephone call was not scheduled for that purpose, the judge immediately conducted a hearing on the motion for summary judgment over the phone. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">The Court found that under the circumstances of the telephone conference, the notice was not adequate. <em>Id. </em>at 221-22, 557 A.2d at 1343. The Court concluded, that \u201cit is axiomatic that [the parties] were entitled to adequate notice of the time, place, and nature of that hearing, so that they could adequately prepare.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 222, 557 A.2d at 1343; (citing <em>Sullivan v.

Bd. of Education, </em>245 Md. 464, 473, 226 A.2d 243 (1967)). Based on the lack of notice of <em>when </em>the hearing would take place, \u201cCounsel for the plaintiffs was not given any meaningful opportunity to review his file, collect his thoughts, or otherwise prepare for oral argument,\u201d and the fact \u201c[t]hat he was able to participate in some fashion in the argument the trial judge insisted be held does not suggest that he was able to participate effectively.\u201d <em>Phillips, </em>316 Md. at 222, 557 A.2d at 1343.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>The Court of Special Appeals addressed due process rights in relation to notice in <em>Van Schaik v. Van Schaik, </em>90 Md.App. 725, 603 A.2d 908 (1992). In <em>Van Schaik, </em>a case about custody modification, the court-appointed attorney for the child in question \u201crequested a hearing \u2018with regard to visitation and other issues.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 730, 603 A.2d at 910. The trial court scheduled the hearing and provided notice to the parents that stated: \u201cHEARING ON VISITATION AND CHILD\u2019S POSSESSIONS has been scheduled for March 18, 1991 from 9:00 a.m. to 11 a.m.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The parents attended the hearing without counsel, presumably because they didn\u2019t contest the visitation and property issues, and the only attorney present was the child\u2019s counsel. <em>Id. </em>The hearing transpired, and at its culmination the court terminated the father\u2019s joint custody rights. <em>Id. </em>at 730, 603 A.2d at 911. The court took this action even though neither of the parties, nor the child\u2019s attorney, had requested a change in custody. <em>Id. </em>at 730 n. 4, 603 A.2d at 911 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">The Court of Special Appeals found that the father \u201cwas not given proper notice that matters relating to custody were to be the subject of the hearing at issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 738, 603 A.2d at 914. The court stated that \u201c[t]he notice in the case at bar did not notify either parent that the court was contemplating making a custody decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 738-39, 603 A.2d at 915. In support of this holding, the court relied on the <em>Phillips </em>Court\u2019s holding, as discussed <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">The Court of Special Appeals more recently addressed this issue in <em>Burdick v. Brooks, </em>160 Md.App. 519, 864 A.2d 300 (2004), which, like <em>Van Schaik, </em>concerned child custody. In <em>Burdick, </em>the trial court sent the mother notice of a status conference, that was to last fifteen minutes. <em>Id. </em>at 527, 864 A.2d at 304. At the conference, however, the trial court announced a modification of custody, changing custody of three of the children from the mother to their father. <em>Id. </em>at 523, 864 A.2d at 303. The Court of Special Appeals, relying on the <em>Van Schaik </em>holding, found that \u201cthe notice letter sent to Burdick [the mother] failed to inform her that the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>could make a custody determination at the conference.\u201d <em>Burdick, </em>160 Md.App. at 527, 864 A.2d at 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">In order to determine whether adequate notice was provided in the case <em>sub judice </em>it is necessary to re-examine some of the factual circumstances leading up to the March 21, 2005, hearing. The court first addressed the issue of child support at the July 22, 2004, hearing. The resulting order, entered August 5, 2004, as discussed <em>supra, </em>directed the father to pay $700.00 per month retroactive to October 1, 2003 through December 31, 2004. Per the order, <em>\u201csubject, to further review and/or Order of this Court, </em>[Katherine\u2019s] Mother, [appellant], shall not be obligated to pay child support, either in arrears or prospectively because of her marginal income.... \u201d [Emphasis added]. In addition, the order provided \u201cthat the matter of the parents\u2019 respective child support obligations on behalf of the child shall be subject to further review by this Court after December 31, 2004.\u201d The schedule for the next hearing was stated as:</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\"><em>\u201cNext Hearing: </em>Permanency Planning hearing on September 22, 2004, at 11:30 a.m. in Courtroom 19\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">The permanency planning hearing was held on September 22, 2004,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and there is no evidence that the child support issue was addressed.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The resulting Permanency Planning Hearing and Order for Continued Commitment did not address the subject of child support at all. The order simply changed the permanency plan to \u201cAnother Planned Permanent Living Ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>rangement (AAPLA), with Independent Living Services.\u201d At the end of this order the schedule for the next hearing was stated as:</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">\u201cNEXT HEARING: March 21, 2005, 8:30 a.m., Courtroom</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">#19\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">This was the last \u201cnotice\u201d that appellant received prior to the March 21, 2005, hearing, concerning any hearing involving her daughter, Katherine. It did not provide any notice that the issue of child support would be addressed at that March 21, 2005, hearing. As evidenced by the subject matter (permanency planning) of the September 22, 2004, hearing and resulting order, the March 21, 2005, hearing was scheduled to be a permanency plan review hearing pursuant to \u00a7 3-823(h) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">The transcript from the March 21, 2005, hearing indicates the confusion resulting from the child support issue being raised without prior notice. Counsel for the father raised the issue of child support because the State still had not distributed the money from the August 5, 2004, <em>\u201cPendente Lite </em>Order.\u201d After a long, convoluted, discussion between the court, the father\u2019s counsel and the State,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> the court determined that the father\u2019s child support contribution as per the August 5, 2004, order would satisfy his obligation and that he would have no further obligation to pay child support due to his incarceration, which would last beyond Katherine turning twenty-one.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">The court then addressed appellant\u2019s counsel, asking whether appellant was \u201cin a position to pay child support\u201d at the time. Counsel for appellant stated that appellant was not in a position to pay child support, but after addressing appellant personally, the court determined that she would be able to pay child support per the Guidelines. As we have indicated, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>counsel for appellant objected, stating that <em>\u201cwe weren\u2019t scheduled to be here to determine whether she has a child support obligation.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). The court then entered the order over counsel\u2019s continuing objection. Finally, on April 13, 2005, the court denied appellant\u2019s March 24, 2005, Motion for Reconsideration of the order to pay child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">It is evident from the facts in the case <em>sub judice, </em>that appellant was not given adequate notice, appropriate to the facts and nature of the case, that the matter of child support would be addressed at the March 21, 2005, permanency plan review hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Appellee argues that appellant\u2019s July 21, 2004, Motion for Establishment of Child Support and the August 5, 2004, <em>\u201cPendente Lite </em>Order\u201d provide adequate notice that child support would be addressed. We disagree. The fact that appellant filed a Motion for Establishment of Child Support on July 21, 2004, does not put her on notice that the issue would be addressed at the March 21, 2005, hearing. That particular motion was addressed and disposed of at the July 22, 2004, hearing. In fact, the August 5, 2004, order indicates that the court found that \u201csubject to further review and/or Order of this Court, [Katherine\u2019s] Mother, <em>[appellant </em>], <em>shall not be obligated to pay child support,, either in arrears or prospectively because of her marginal income </em>...\u201d and \u201cthat the matter of the parents\u2019 respective child support obligations on behalf of the child shall be subject to further review by this Court after December 31, 2004.\u201d (Emphasis added). A court is required to provide adequate and sufficiently specific notice of when the matter of child support will be reviewed. It failed to do so in this case. That the order was <em>pendente lite </em>does not, in and of itself, provide notice <em>ad infinitum.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">In vacating the decision of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County requiring appellant to pay child support, we find that the notice in the case <em>sub judice </em>was not adequate to notify appellant that the court would be addressing the matter of child support at the March 21, 2005, hearing. Parties are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>entitled to adequate notice of the subject matter of a hearing, so that they may prepare to address the issues. The Circuit Court for Montgomery County, however, did not err in its application of the Guidelines in calculating child support, where the child is in the custody of a government agency except that in the use of such guidelines, the amount established may not exceed actual costs. A trial court may apply the Guidelines to calculate child support in CINA cases so long as the amount is capped at costs. For the reasons stated herein, we vacate the judgment of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County that requires appellant to pay child support. This holding is without prejudice for a trial court in future proceedings, upon proper notice, to address the child support issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY VACATED AS INDICATED ABOVE.

In determining the sum to be $282.00 per month, the court apparently forgot to deduct the $200.00 per month credit for health insurance payments from the alleged income of $19,240.00 per annum.

Applying $1,603.33 (it appears that the court used $1,600.00, rather than extrapolating to $1,650.00) to the Guidelines, we arrive at a monthly child support obligation for one child of $282.00. <em>See </em>\u00a7 12-204(e). If the $200.00 per month credit for health insurance payments had been applied, appellant\u2019s alleged monthly income would be applied to the Guidelines as $1,403.33, which, extrapolated to $1,450.00 as required by \u00a7 12-204(c), results in a monthly child support obligation for one child of $260.00. <em>See </em>\u00a7 12-204(e).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b615-8\">.
