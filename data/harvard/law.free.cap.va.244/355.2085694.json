Barbara J. Fried and B. Mark Fried own property in Springfield, Virginia, that they leased to M &amp; M Pontiac, Inc. in 1986. Steven C. Smith, chairman of the board of directors of M &amp; M Pontiac, executed a \u201cGuaranty of [the M &amp; M Pontiac] Lease\u201d with the Frieds dated May 3, 1986. The guaranty states, \u201cSteven C. Smith ([\u2019]Guarantor\u2019), hereby unconditionally and absolutely guarantees unto Landlord [the Frieds], its successors and assigns, the full, prompt and complete payment by Tenant of the rent and additional rents provided in Lease. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-11\">M &amp; M Pontiac filed a petition in bankruptcy in January 1989. Dave Perno Pontiac, Inc., with the approval of the bankruptcy court, purchased M &amp; M Pontiac\u2019s assets. The Frieds joined in the execution of an assignment of the M &amp; M Pontiac lease to Dave Perno Pontiac, but upon the express written condition that the assignment would not release Smith from his personal guaranty of the lease. Dave Pemo Pontiac was unable to pay its rent as required by the lease, and Mr. Fried sent a letter to Smith requesting that he honor his guaranty. Smith refused to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-12\">The Frieds filed a motion for judgment against Smith, seeking to recover damages they had incurred because of Dave Perno Pontiac\u2019s failure to make its lease payments. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment. The trial court granted Smith\u2019s motion, holding that a release provision contained in a stock purchase agreement, dated May 1988, among Steven Smith, the Frieds, and others, terminated Smith\u2019s obligation under the terms of the lease guaranty. Paragraph 6(a) of the stock purchase agreement states, in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b379-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>6. <em>Releases.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-4\">(a) As of the Closing Date, the Frieds . . . release and forever discharge the Smiths . . . <em>from any and all claims, demands or causes of action </em>that the Frieds . . . have or might have against them ... from the beginning of time to the date of Closing, <em>including, but not limited to, any and all liabilities, obligations and duties of the released parties </em>... to the Frieds . . . under written agreements or otherwise, but excluding specifically (i) the obligations of the Smiths under this Agreement [and certain other enumerated agreements not relevant here].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">On appeal, the Frieds argue that the language contained in paragraph 6(a) of the stock purchase agreement is ambiguous and that the trial court should have taken parol evidence to ascertain whether the Frieds and Smith intended to release Smith from the lease guaranty. Smith, however, argues that the release is not ambiguous and, therefore, parol evidence is not admissible to discern the intent of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">The word \u201cambiguity\u201d is defined as \u201cthe condition of admitting of two or more meanings, of being understood in more than one way, or of referring to two or more things at the same time. . . . Doubtfulness; doubleness of meaning ... of an expression used in a written instrument.\u201d <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Klinger, </em>225 Va. 201, 207, 300 S.E.2d 792, 796 (1983) (citations omitted); <em>see also Renner Plumbing </em>v. <em>Renner, 225 </em>Va. 508, 515, 303 S.E.2d 894, 898 (1983); <em>Ayres </em>v. <em>Harleysville Mut. Cas. Co., </em>172 Va. 383, 393, 2 S.E.2d 303, 307 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">We hold that the language found in the release is ambiguous because the phrase \u201cany and all claims, demands or causes of action\u201d is inconsistent with the phrase \u201cincluding, but not limited to, any and all liabilities, obligations and duties.\u201d A \u201cclaim\u201d is defined as \u201c \u2018an authoritative or challenging request,\u201ca demand of a right or supposed right,\u2019 or \u2018a calling on another for something due or supposed to be due.\u2019\u201d <em>Stamie E. Lyttle Co. </em>v. <em>County of Hanover, </em>231 Va. 21, 26 n.4, 341 S.E.2d 174, 178 n.4 (1986) (quoting Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 414 (1981)). A \u201cdemand\u201d is \u201c \u2018a thing or amount claimed to be due.\u2019\u201d <em>Lyttle Co. </em>at 26 n.4, 341 S.E.2d at 178 n.4 (quoting Webster\u2019s Third New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>International Dictionary at 598). In discussing a \u201ccause of action,\u201d we have stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-4\">The essential elements of a good cause of action, whether based on an alleged breach of contract or on a tortious act, are a legal obligation of a defendant to the plaintiff, a violation or breach of that right or duty, and a consequential injury or damage to the plaintiff. In the absence of injury or damage to a plaintiff or his property, he has no cause of action and no right of action can accrue to him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-5\"><em>Caudill </em>v. <em>Wise Rambler, </em>210 Va. 11, 13, 168 S.E.2d 257, 259 (1969) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">The legal concepts contained in the phrase \u2018 \u2018claims, demands or causes of action . . . from the beginning of time to the date of closing\u201d do not connote future or contingent liabilities, but refer to the legal ability to assert unconditionally an existing right. The phrase \u201cincluding, but not limited to, any and all liabilities, obligations and duties of the released parties\u201d can be interpreted to mean future or contingent events which are not \u201cclaims, demands or causes of action.\u201d For example, consider the definition of the word \u201cliability\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-7\">The word is a broad legal term. It has been referred to as of the most comprehensive significance, including almost every character of hazard or responsibility, absolute, contingent, or likely. It has been defined to mean: all character of debts and obligations; amenability or responsibility; an obligation one is bound in law or justice to perform; an obligation which may or may not ripen into a debt; any kind of debt or liability, either absolute or contingent, expressed or implied; condition of being actually or potentially subject to an obligation; condition of being responsible for a possible or actual loss, penalty, evil, expense, or burden; condition which creates a duty to perform an act immediately or in the future . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 914 (6th ed. 1990) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">These two phrases in the release are ambiguous because, when read together, they are capable of being understood in more than one way and their meaning is doubtful. The first phrase limits the release to \u201cclaims, demands or causes of action\u201d but the second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>phrase expands the scope of the release to include any \u201chazard or responsibility, absolute, contingent, or likely.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">Smith, recognizing the inconsistency between these two phrases, invites this Court to construe the term \u2018 \u2018including, but not limited to\u201d in such a fashion that it would mean \u201cand.\u201d Thus, Smith asserts that the language in the release means that the Frieds actually released him from all \u201cclaims, demands, causes of action <em>and </em>liabilities, obligations and duties.\u201d We decline Smith\u2019s invitation to amend his contract because it is not the province of this Court to rewrite contractual language. Rather, it is incumbent upon courts to construe the language drafted by the parties to determine whether the precise language used is ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment appealed from and remand this action so that the trial court can consider extrinsic evidence to interpret the ambiguous contractual provision. <em>See American Realty </em>v. <em>Chase Manhattan, </em>222 Va. 392, 403, 281 S.E.2d 825, 831 (1981).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b381-11\"> We do not consider Smith\u2019s argument that the Frieds\u2019 appeal is not timely. That argument was the subject of Smith\u2019s motion to dismiss which was denied by this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b381-7\">JUSTICE STEPHENSON, with whom JUSTICE COMPTON joins,</author>\n<p id=\"AOX\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">I find no ambiguity in the language in the release. It released and discharged Smith \u201cfrom any and all claims, demands or causes of action that the Frieds . . . have or might have against [Smith] . . . <em>including, but not limited to, </em>any and all liabilities, obligations and duties of [Smith] ... to the Frieds.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">As the majority points out, the word \u201cliability\u201d is a broad, comprehensive legal term that includes \u201c \u2018almost every character of hazard or responsibility, absolute, contingent, or likely.\u2019 \u201d The term means \u201c \u2018an obligation which may or may not ripen into a debt; any kind of debt or liability, either absolute or contingent, expressed or implied.\u2019 \u201d Clearly, therefore, Smith\u2019s guaranty of rent payment falls within the meaning of \u201cliability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">The majority, nonetheless, holds that the first phrase, \u201cclaims, demands or causes of action,\u201d and the second phrase, \u201cincluding, but not limited to, any and all liabilities, obligations and duties of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>[Smith],\u201d when read together, are susceptible of more than one meaning and, therefore, are ambiguous. I do not agree. I think the second phrase merely expands and clarifies the first by plainly stating that the terms in the first phrase <em>include </em>any and all liabilities, obligations, and duties of Smith to the Frieds.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">I agree with the majority that \u201cit is not the province of this Court to rewrite contractual language.\u201d However, by ignoring the clear language in the release and thereby refusing to give that language its plain meaning, I think the majority has rewritten contractual language. Accordingly, I would affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
