We conclude that the Circuit Court of Henrico County correctly denied the defendant\u2019s pre-trial motion to suppress his inculpatory statements to the police, and we will affirm its judgment and that of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">The relevant evidence is detailed in the transcript of the suppression hearing, and, under familiar principles, we will consider the testimony in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. In company with Thomas Freeman, also known as \u201cSlick\u201d, and his brother Ricky Freeman, Harrison was arrested September 9, 1988 and charged with conspiracy to distribute 14 ounces of cocaine. Investigator Robert T. Dickenson placed Harrison in his car, and reading from a printed card, advised him as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-5\">\n<em>MIRANDA WARNING</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-6\">1. You have the right to remain silent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-7\">2. Anything you say can and will be used against you in court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-8\">3. You have the right to talk to a lawyer and have him present while you are being questioned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-9\">4. If you cannot afford to hire a lawyer, one will be appointed to represent you, without cost, before any questioning, if you desire one.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-10\">Reading from another card, Dickenson then asked the defendant if he understood those rights, and Harrison answered, \u201cYes.\u201d When asked if he wished \u201cto waive them and talk to us now\u201d, Harrison \u201chung his head down and started to cry openly.\u201d During the trip to the Public Service Building, there was no conversation between the defendant and the police. Harrison rode with \u201chis eyes closed and his head back\u201d as if he were asleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-11\">Detective Brian P. Gaudiose testified that when Harrison arrived at the interview room, he \u201cwas wondering what was going to hap: pen to him\u201d. In reply to Harrison\u2019s question, Gaudiose told him that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t make him any promises, but if he cooperated with the Commonwealth, that would be brought to their attention\u201d and that \u201chis cooperation would help him\u201d. Gaudiose explained that the police \u201cwanted his cooperation against Mr. Freeman\u201d. In response, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>Harrison \u201cwent over the whole scenario\u201d of the day\u2019s events. He told the detective that \u201che was doing a \u2018coke\u2019 with . . . Mike\u201d; that \u201cthe Cocaine deal was supposed to go at Edward Meyers\u2019 house\u201d; that \u201che didn\u2019t have enough Cocaine to do the deal, so he contacted \u2018Slick\u2019 Freeman, and \u2018Slick\u2019 Freeman put the package together\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">In the course of the 45 minute interview, Harrison repeated this story \u201cat least three times\u201d. After the first account, Gaudiose and Harrison \u201ctalked about other people that he might be \u2018able to do\u2019.\u201d Harrison indicated his willingness to make a telephone call to his New Jersey drug \u201cconnection\u201d and to cooperate concerning \u201csomebody who had a connection with California.\u201d However, Harrison said that \u201che was afraid that Thomas Freeman would have him killed if he cooperated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Following Harrison\u2019s account of the day\u2019s events, Gaudiose sought to \u201ccalm him down\u201d by arranging an interview with an Assistant Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney. Gaudiose introduced him as \u201cthe man who would be prosecuting the case\u201d. Harrison \u201cnever indicated that he wanted to see an attorney.\u201d Gaudiose testified that \u201cthe Commonwealth sat down and explained his rights to him, explained to him that if he did give us a statement concerning \u2018Slick\u2019 Freeman, or if he testified against \u2018Slick\u2019 Freeman . . . that that couldn\u2019t be used against him at a later date\u201d because by giving \u2018 \u2018that testimony in that situation he became immune from that being used against him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">During that session, which lasted \u201c10 or 15 minutes\u201d, \u201cno promises were made by the Commonwealth.\u201d After the Assistant Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney left, the detectives attempted to make a tape recording of the conspiracy story Harrison had told Gaudiose in order \u2018 \u2018to get a statement memorialized ... in case, in fact, something did happen to him.\u201d The transcript of that recording shows that Detective Sipple read the contents of the <em>Miranda </em>card again, that Harrison said that he understood his rights, and that, in answer to the detective\u2019s question, he acknowledged that he was \u201cgoing to make this statement. . . because this is what [he] wish[ed] to do\u201d. However, when Sipple began the interview, Harrison asked, \u201cIs this going to be used against me in a court of law?\u201d Sipple replied, \u201cPossibly.\u201d Sipple reminded the defendant that the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney had \u201cexplained to you . . . that if you did what you told us you were going to do, that this couldn\u2019t be used against you. However, if that situation changes by your choice, then this could be evidence against you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>At that point, Harrison told Sipple to stop the tape recorder. Sipple complied and stated, \u201cI\u2019ll stop it because you want to stop it.\u201d Harrison then resumed his conversation with the detectives. Gaudiose testified that Harrison \u2018 \u2018reiterated the story . . . about what happened ... he was afraid of the tape, he was afraid of testifying against \u2018Slick\u2019 \u201d but he agreed again to cooperate in exposing his New Jersey \u2018 \u2018connection\u2019 \u2019. Two days later, Harrison \u2018 \u2018decided that he didn\u2019t want to cooperate\u201d and at trial the Commonwealth introduced the officers\u2019 testimony repeating the inculpatory statements Harrison had made.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">A jury convicted Harrison of conspiring to distribute cocaine and, confirming the verdict, the trial court sentenced him to the penitentiary for 15 years and to a fine of $1,000. The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment, and we awarded Harrison an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">In support of his pre-trial motion to suppress his statements to the police, Harrison argued that his statements were inadmissible because the Commonwealth failed to prove \u201ca knowing, intelligent, voluntary waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights.\u201d The trial court denied the motion. An essential predicate to that ruling was a finding that Harrison had made a valid waiver. On brief in this Court, the defendant says that \u201c[bjecause of the failure of the Commonwealth to prove the <em>Miranda </em>predicate, the defendant\u2019s statement should not have been admitted. It is the admission of the statement over the failure to prove a waiver that is the subject of this appeal.\u201d Pursuing that position in oral argument, Harrison urged us to reverse his conviction on the ground that \u2018 \u2018the confession should not have been admitted because the waiver had not been properly proven.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Absent a knowing and intelligent waiver of the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and the Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of legal counsel, a confession made by a suspect during in-custody interrogation is inadmissible in evidence against him. <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 (1966). Even when the suspect has made a valid waiver, a confession made later is inadmissible if it appears that it was made involuntarily. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Fenton, </em>474 U.S. 104 (1985). Whether such a confession was voluntary or the result of coercive police activity is a legal question to be determined from a review of the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">While the <em>Miller </em>Court reserved judgment on the question whether a waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights was a factual issue, <em>id. </em>at 108 n.3, the Court noted that a lower court\u2019s determination of a factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>issue is entitled to a presumption of correctness, <em>id. </em>at 112, and that \u201can issue does not lose its factual character merely because its resolution is dispositive of the ultimate constitutional question\u201d, <em>id. </em>at 113 (citation omitted). In an opinion rendered two years later, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals decided the question reserved by the Supreme Court in <em>Miller:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-4\">As a reviewing court, our inquiry as to whether a defendant has been forced to confess is best gleaned from the totality of the circumstances. However, this differs from the discrete inquiry of whether the waiver was voluntary. The former requires a determination of whether the procedure was fundamentally fair . . . while the latter requires only a factual inquiry.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-5\"><em>Bryan </em>v. <em>Warden, Indiana State Reformatory, </em>820 F.2d 217, 220 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 867 (1987); <em>accord Smith </em>v. <em>Duckworth, </em>856 F.2d 909, 911 (7th Cir. 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Unlike the voluntariness inquiry relevant to the admissibility of a confession where the question is one of law subject to an independent review by an appellate court, <em>Miller, </em>474 U.S. at 115, the inquiry whether a waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights was made knowingly and intelligently is a question of fact, and the trial court\u2019s resolution of that question is entitled on appeal to a presumption of correctness.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-7\">[The trial court] evaluates the credibility of the witnesses, resolves any conflicts in the testimony, and weighs the evidence as a whole. The court must decide whether the defendant knowingly and intelligently relinquished and abandoned his rights. The court\u2019s determination is a question of fact based upon the totality of the circumstances. This factual finding will not be disturbed on appeal unless plainly wrong.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-8\"><em>Watkins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 469, 477, 331 S.E.2d 422, 429-30 (1985) (citations omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>475 U.S. 1099 (1986); <em>accord Mu\u2019Min </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>239 Va. 433, 440, 389 S.E.2d 886, 891 (1990), <em>aff\u2019d on other grounds, </em>500 U.S._, 111 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>1899 (1991); <em>see also Goodwin </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>3 Va. App. 249, 253, 349 S.E.2d 161, 163 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">Reaffirming that rule and applying that standard of appellate review, we consider the facts relevant to the trial court\u2019s ruling on the motion to suppress. Harrison never made a specific waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. In response to the question by the arresting officer if he wanted to do so, he began to cry and remained silent on the trip to the Public Service Building. \u201c[A] valid waiver will not be presumed simply from the silence of the accused after warnings are given or simply from the fact that a confession was in fact eventually obtained.\u201d <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 475. However, <em>Miranda </em>does not require a waiver to be in writing or to be verbalized expressly.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-5\">An express written or oral statement of waiver of the right to remain silent or of the right to counsel is usually strong proof of the validity of that waiver, but is not inevitably either necessary or sufficient to establish waiver. The question is not one of form, but rather whether the defendant in fact knowingly and voluntarily waived the rights delineated in the <em>Miranda </em>case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-6\">As was unequivocally said in <em>Miranda, </em>mere silence is not enough. That does not mean that the defendant\u2019s silence, coupled with an understanding of his rights and a course of conduct indicating waiver, may never support a conclusion that a defendant has waived his rights. The courts must presume that a defendant did not waive his rights; the prosecution\u2019s burden is great; but in at least some cases waiver can be clearly inferred from the actions and words of the person interrogated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-7\"><em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>441 U.S. 369, 373 (1979) (footnote omitted) (waiver upheld when defendant expressly refused to sign form); <em>accord, Cheng </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>240 Va. 26, 35, 393 S.E.2d 599, 604 (1990); <em>Eaton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>240 Va. 236, 251, 397 S.E.2d 385, 394 (1990); <em>Blackmon </em>v. <em>Blackledge, </em>541 F.2d 1070, 1072 (4th Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">Harrison suggests, and for purposes of this opinion we will assume, that his silence following his acknowledgement that he understood his <em>Miranda </em>rights was an implicit invocation of those rights. The record shows that whatever dialogue occurred between the defendant and the police during the arrest procedure stopped when Harrison began to cry. No conversation occurred during the trip to the Public Service Building. Upon arrival, Harrison reopened <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>the dialogue by inquiring \u2018 \u2018what was going to happen to him\u2019 \u2019. <em>See Oregon </em>v. <em>Bradshaw, </em>462 U.S. 1039, 1045-46 (1983) (valid waiver occurred after accused reopened dialogue by inquiring, \u201c \u2018Well, what is going to happen to me now?\u2019 \u201d). If \u201cthe accused, not the police, [reopens] the dialogue with the authorities\u201d, a court, upon consideration of that fact and \u201cthe totality of the circumstances\u201d, may reasonably find that the accused has made a \u201cknowing and intelligent\u201d waiver of his rights. <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>451 U.S. 477, 486 n.9 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">Considering whether Harrison then made a valid waiver, we turn now to the other facts and circumstances attending his first confession. Harrison argues on brief that the police \u2018 \u2018misled him as to his rights\u201d, that \u201cthe explanation . . . was confusing\u201d, and that they \u201coffered overbearing inducements for the defendant\u2019s waiver of his rights\u201d at a time when he \u201cwas extremely upset, sobbing heavily, and in tremendous fear of what the Freemans, his co-defendants, would do to him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">It is true that Harrison was visibly depressed when he reopened the dialogue with the police. However, although a waiver, like a confession, made by an accused while insane is involuntary and inadmissible in evidence against him, <em>see Townsend </em>v. <em>Sain, </em>372 U.S. 293, 309 (1963), \u201cmere emotionalism, confusion, or depression do not dictate a finding of mental incompetence or insanity.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rouco, </em>765 F.2d 983, 993 (11th Cir.) (citations omitted), <em>cert. denied </em>475 U.S. 1124 (1985); <em>see also United States </em>v. <em>Feola, </em>651 F. Supp. 1068, 1119 (S.D.N.Y. 1987), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>875 F.2d 857 (2d Cir.) (unpublished opinion), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Marin </em>v. <em>United States, </em>493 U.S. 834 (1989) (\u201cthis Court... will not find official coercion in the mere fact of questioning an arrested suspect who is visibly distressed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">We agree that the methods used to induce a waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights, like those used to induce a confession, may sometimes constitute coercive police activity. <em>See, e.g., Jackson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>116 Va. 1015, 1020, 81 S.E. 192, 194 (1914); <em>Colorado </em>v. <em>Connelly, </em>479 U.S. 157, 167 (1986) (\u201cCoercive police activity is a necessary predicate to the finding that a confession is not \u2018voluntary\u2019 . . . .\u201d). Upon a review of the facts of this case, we find nothing of that nature. When Harrison remained mute in response to the question whether he wanted to waive his rights, the arresting officers discontinued interrogation. Later, when Harrison asked what was going to happen to him, the detectives told him that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>wanted his assistance in prosecuting one of his co-conspirators; that his cooperation would be brought to the attention of the Commonwealth; and that his cooperation could help him. Without more, and advised that the police could make no promises of help, Harrison proceeded to make a detailed narrative statement admitting his participation in the criminal offense committed that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">He made that statement even though he freely acknowledged that he understood that he had a right to say nothing and the right to the advice of legal counsel. He did so as a 23-year-old high school graduate and a veteran of three years\u2019 service in the United States Marine Corps. He did so without any promise, threat, \u201coverbearing inducement\u201d, or any other coercive police activity.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">We hold, therefore, that implicit in the making of Harrison\u2019s first confession was a knowing and intelligent waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and that the Court of Appeals correctly concluded that the confession was voluntary and properly admitted in evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">We turn now to the other inculpatory statements which Harrison contends the trial court should have suppressed. The <em>Miranda </em>warnings were repeated, and Harrison made \u201cat least three\u201d confessions during his conversations with the police.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-7\">[W]here a person, after receiving <em>Miranda </em>warnings, has once given a knowing and intelligent waiver of his constitutional rights, such waiver will be presumed to continue in effect throughout subsequent custodial interrogations until the suspect manifests, in some way which would be apparent to a reasonable person, his desire to revoke it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-8\"><em>Washington </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 535, 548-49, 323 S.E.2d 577, 586 (1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>471 U.S. 1111 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">Yet, citing the detective\u2019s testimony that the prosecutor had explained that if Harrison \u201cdid give us a statement concerning \u2018Slick\u2019 Freeman, or if he testified against \u2018Slick\u2019 Freeman . . . that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>that couldn\u2019t be used against him\u201d, Harrison argues that the confession he made following the abortive attempt to tape record his statement was improperly induced and that all of his inculpatory statements should have been suppressed. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">We have held that the original waiver was valid and that the first confession was voluntary and properly admitted in evidence. The record discloses no difference between the facts stated in that confession and the facts stated in the second and third confessions. Hence, the incriminating effect of the latter was merely repetitious and cumulative of that of the former. It is well settled in this jurisdiction that the exclusion of evidence favorable to a party in a civil action on the ground that it is repetitious and cumulative is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court and that its ruling is entitled on review to a presumption of correctness. <em>Philip Morris Incorporated </em>v. <em>Emerson, </em>235 Va. 380, 410, 368 S.E.2d 268, 284 (1988); <em>Eason </em>v. <em>Eason, </em>203 Va. 246, 254, 123 S.E.2d 361, 367 (1962); <em>Mawyer </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>199 Va. 897, 902, 103 Va. 217, 221 (1958). We see no reason why the same rule and the same standard of appellate review should not apply to the admission of Harrison\u2019s confessions of criminal conduct. <em>See Little </em>v. <em>State, </em>413 N.E.2d 639, 644 (Ind. App. 1980) (citing <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>State, </em>253 Ind. 650, 654, 256 N.E.2d 557, 559 (1970)) (\u201cThe admission or exclusion of cumulative evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Finding no prejudice to the defendant and no abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion in its ruling on the motion to suppress, we will affirm the judgments entered below.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b603-9\"> The Court of Appeals determined the case by reframing the question presented as one of voluntariness of the confessions.
