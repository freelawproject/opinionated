Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b163-13\">Ronald Stephen Bowers, Kathy D. Bowers, David Micah Bowers (an infant suing by his mother and next friend), and Justin Anthony Bowers (an infant suing by his father and next friend) filed their \u201cConsolidated Amended Motion for Judgment and Third Amended Bill of Complaint\u201d against Westvaco Corporation, Jennings &amp; Webb, Inc., and Pounding Mill, Inc. (collectively referred to as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>defendants).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Bowers alleged, among other things, that the defendants had created and maintained a private nuisance. The Bowers sought compensatory and punitive damages. The defendants filed responsive pleadings in which they denied liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">The chancellor granted the Bowers\u2019 motion requesting an issue out of chancery on the question of damages, and the jury returned verdicts in favor of the Bowers. Even though the chancellor declined to enter a judgment confirming the quantum of the verdicts, he awarded damages to the Bowers. Both sides appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">II. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Ronald Stephen Bowers and Kathy D. Bowers, husband and wife, have owned and occupied a house located in Alleghany County since September 1986. Their two young children, David Micah Bowers and Justin Anthony Bowers, reside with them. The house is located in an area which has a business zoning classification. Mr. Bowers operates a heating and air conditioning business from his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">Pounding Mill acquired property, identified in the record as Lots 1 and 2, adjacent to the Bowers\u2019 property in November 1989. Pounding Mill executed a lease with Westvaco Corporation, the owner of a paper mill in Covington which produces approximately 2,500 tons of paper product daily. Pursuant to the terms of the lease, Westvaco utilizes the lots for the location of a truck staging operation. Westvaco retained defendant Jennings &amp; Webb to conduct the truck staging operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">Jerry L. Webb, president of Jennings &amp; Webb, described the truck staging operation. First, an \u201coff-the-road driver\u201d will park a tractor and an empty trailer on Lot 1 or 2. Next, the driver disconnects the empty trailer and connects his tractor to a loaded trailer. He then takes the loaded trailer to an off-site destination. Jennings &amp; Webb transports the empty trailer to Westvaco\u2019s paper mill where the trailer is loaded with paper product. The loaded trailer is returned to Lot 1 or 2 and the cycle begins again, an \u201coff-the-road driver\u2019 \u2019 connects his tractor to a loaded trailer and transports it to an off-site destination.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>Jennings &amp; Webb conducts the truck staging operation 24 hours a day, every day of the year. During the period covering March 1990 through November 1990, Jennings &amp; Webb transported over 28,000 trailers between Lots 1 and 2 and the paper mill.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">The truck staging operation is located approximately 25 feet from the Bowers\u2019 living room window. One entrance to the truck staging operation is located 10 to 20 feet away from the Bowers\u2019 driveway.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Mr. Bowers testified that the \u201chissing\u201d of the air brakes and the \u201chitching of the [tractor-trailers\u2019] fifth wheels\u201d sound \u201clike a shotgun going off 20 or 30 times a night right near your home.\u201d The Bowers hear the sounds of the tractor-trailer horns \u201cat all hours of the night.\u201d The sound of the horns interrupts the family\u2019s sleep. Lights from the tractors constantly shine into the Bowers\u2019 bedrooms and illuminate the living room. \u2018 \u2018It is like living in an interstate median,\u201d Bowers said. The Bowers are unable to rest properly because of the constant noise.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">The tractors\u2019 engines are constantly idling. Vibrations, created by moving trucks, shake the Bowers\u2019 house. The vibrations have cracked the concrete pad on the rear porch.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">The truck staging operation created dust which covered the exterior of the Bowers\u2019 home and settled on their cars. The Bowers are unable to utilize their side porch because of the dust, confusion, and noise. James C. Forsythe, the owner of an appraisal company, testified that the Bowers incurred a diminution in the value of their home because of the existence of the truck staging operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">Pounding Mill made changes in the grading of Lots 1 and 2 to accommodate the truck staging operation. These changes have caused water to run off the lots onto the Bowers\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">Karen McCulley Bowles, a property owner who lives near the truck staging operation, testified that the truck operation \u201csounds a whole lot like a chain saw running. It\u2019s just a roar and then it sounds like thunder.\u201d Thomas D. Lair, another property owner who lives in the vicinity of the truck staging operation, observed the noise, dust, and pollution created by the trucks.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">Kathy Bowers has incurred medical expenses as a result of the conditions created by the truck staging operation. She was treated by Dr. Deborah G. Allen, an internist, who described Mrs. Bowers as distraught, depressed, and very nervous. Dr. Allen prescribed antidepressant medication for her. Dr. Lewis Richard Sutton, a psychiatrist, also treated Mrs. Bowers, and diagnosed her condition as one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>of major depression which was caused, in part, by the truck staging operation. He also prescribed\u2019medication for her.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">Dr. Harry P. Kornhiser, an asthenic physician specializing in neurology and psychiatry, examined David and Justin Bowers. He testified that both boys experienced adjustment disorders associated with the conditions caused by the truck staging operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">III. Private Nuisance</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">At the request of defendant Pounding Mill, the Board of Supervisors of Alleghany County rezoned Lots 1 and 2 to a zoning classification which permits the truck staging operation. The Board imposed certain conditions in an attempt to decrease the impact of the truck staging operation upon the Bowers\u2019 property. Therefore, defendants argued, both in the trial court and here, that \u201cwhen the Board of Supervisors, after reviewing a particular activity and imposing conditions designed to minimize its effect on neighbors, has rezoned a property to accommodate that activity, the court may not superimpose its judgment by declaring the activity a nuisance.\u201d The trial court, rejecting the defendants\u2019 argument, held that the truck staging operation constituted a private nuisance because it unreasonably interfered with the Bowers\u2019 use and enjoyment of their property.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">We have, on numerous occasions, discussed the law of private nuisance. In <em>National Energy Corp. </em>v. <em>O\u2019Quinn, </em>223 Va. 83, 286 S.E.2d 181 (1982), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-8\">When a business enterprise, even though lawful, becomes obnoxious to occupants of neighboring dwellings and renders enjoyment of the structures uncomfortable by virtue of, for example, smoke, cinders, dust, noise, offensive odors, or noxious gases, the operation of such business is a nuisance. <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Quarries, Inc., </em>204 Va. 414, 417, 132 S.E.2d 395, 397 (1963). The term \u2018nuisance\u2019 includes \u2018everything that endangers life or health, or obstructs the reasonable and comfortable use of property.\u2019 <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">223 Va. at 85, 286 S.E.2d at 182.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">In <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>223 Va. 20, 286 S.E.2d 186 (1982), we said that we broadly construe an occupant\u2019s right to the \u201cuse and enjoyment of land.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 28, 286 S.E.2d at 190.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>The phrase \u2018use and enjoyment of land\u2019 is broad. It comprehends the pleasure, comfort and enjoyment that a person normally derives from the occupancy of land. Freedom from discomfort and annoyance while using land, which inevitably involves an element of personal tastes and sensibilities, is often as important to a person as freedom from physical interruption with use of the land itself. The discomfort and annoyance must, however, be significant and of a kind that would be suffered by a normal person in the community.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 28, 286 S.E.2d at 190-91 (citations omitted). Additionally, the location of a business enterprise, or the zoning classification of the property on which the business is located, cannot immunize the business from a nuisance action.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-5\">It is generally held that the location of an industry in an industrial area and its importance to the wealth and prosperity of the community do not give to it rights superior to the primary or natural rights of those who live nearby. Locality and surroundings are to be taken into consideration only in determining whether the business or industry is so conducted as to constitute a nuisance as a matter of fact. It is of no consequence that an industry or a business is a useful or necessary one, or that it promotes the development of the community.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-6\">The issue [is] not whether [the business enterprise is] located in an industrial area, nor whether plaintiff\u2019s damage was unsubstantial, \u2018because of the industrial use being made of nearby properties,\u2019 nor whether the operation of defendant\u2019s plant was \u2018reasonable when the character of the area is considered,\u2019 but whether or not its operation caused substantial damage to the plaintiff, regardless of the location of the plant and the nature and importance of its operation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-7\"><em>Smith </em>v. <em>The Pittston Company, </em>203 Va. 711, 717, 127 S.E.2d 79, 83-84 (1962) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">In <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Quarries, Inc., </em>204 Va. 414, 132 S.E.2d 395 (1963), the owners of a quarry, just as the defendants here, argued that their activities could not constitute a private nuisance because those activities were permitted by a local zoning ordinance. Rejecting that argument, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>Respondent contends that in this instance it is shielded from liability for a nuisance because it has secured a use permit for its operation pursuant to Fairfax County\u2019s zoning ordinance. This contention is without merit. The permit did no more than allow the respondent to do what the zoning law otherwise prohibited. ... It is beyond the power of a county or municipality to authorize the maintenance of a nuisance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 417, 132 S.E.2d at 397 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">We hold that the trial court did not err by finding that the acts of the defendants constituted a private nuisance. The court properly considered the zoning classification of the property as an important factor in determining whether the business is so conducted as to constitute a nuisance. <em>See Smith </em>v. <em>The Pittston Co., </em>203 Va. at <em>717, </em>127 S.E.2d at 84. However, the chancellor also considered the unreasonable conditions created by the truck staging operation and the impact of those conditions upon the Bowers\u2019 right to the use and enjoyment of their property. As we stated in <em>O\u2019Quinn, </em>\u201c[t]he law does not allow an individual to be driven from his home, or to be forced to live in it in positive discomfort, even though the obnoxious condition may be caused by a lawful, useful business carried on in his neighborhood.\u201d 223 Va. at 91, 286 S.E.2d at 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">IV. Issue Out of Chancery</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">The jury which heard the issue out of chancery returned the following verdicts: Ronald Stephen Bowers \u2014 $358,800; Kathy D. Bowers \u2014 $462,800; David Micah Bowers \u2014 $201,000; and Justin Anthony Bowers \u2014 $201,000. The defendants moved to set aside the verdicts as excessive. The chancellor, in its final decree, reduced the awards: Ronald Stephen Bowers \u2014 $158,800; Kathy D. Bowers \u2014 $212,800; David Micah Bowers \u2014 $51,000; and Justin Anthony Bowers \u2014 $51,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">The Bowers argue that the trial court erred by reducing the verdicts. The Bowers advanced numerous arguments in their brief, challenging the chancellor\u2019s failure to confirm the verdicts. We find it unnecessary to respond to each argument raised by the Bowers because those arguments ignore the unique role of the chancellor and the purpose of the issue out of chancery. As we recently stated in <em>Gibbens </em>v. <em>Hardin, </em>239 Va. 425, 389 S.E.2d 478 (1990), \u201c \u2018[t]he chancellor is the keeper of his own conscience and the purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>the issue is to satisfy him. ... [T]he verdict... is not binding but is merely persuasive.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 429, 389 S.E.2d at 479 (quoting <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Citizens Bank, etc., Co., </em>172 Va. 111, 133, 200 S.E. 652, 660 (1939)).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">Here, the verdicts shocked the chancellor\u2019s conscience. Furthermore, the chancellor wrote in his memorandum opinion that \u201cthe jury was motivated by passion, misconceived the law and [the awards are] so out of proportion to the injuries] suffered to suggest that [they are] not the product of a fair and impartial decision.\u201d We hold that the chancellor did not err by refusing to confirm the verdicts of the issue out of chancery because such verdicts, unlike verdicts in law actions, are merely advisory.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">V. Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">The defendants contend that the trial court erred by allowing recovery for emotional distress as an element of damages in the nuisance suit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> They argue that, in a suit to recover damages caused by a private nuisance, compensable damages are limited to \u201ccompensation for loss or deprivation of rights associated with property and for harm resulting therefrom.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">In <em>Bragg </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>149 Va. 482, 140 S.E. 656 (1927), we stated that \u201c \u2018the term nuisance, in legal parlance, extends to everything that endangers life or health, gives offense to the senses, violates the laws of decency, or obstructs the reasonable and comfortable use of property.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 497, 140 S.E. at 660 (citation omitted). Later, in <em>Barnes, </em>204 Va. at 417, 132 S.E.2d at 397 (1963), we held \u201cthat the term \u2018nuisance\u2019 embraces everything that endangers life or health, or obstructs the reasonable and comfortable use of property.\u201d 204 Va. at 417, 132 S.E.2d at 397 (citing <em>Bragg, </em>149 Va. at 497, 140 S.E. at 660). In <em>Newport News </em>v. <em>Hertzler, </em>216 Va. 587, 221 S.E.2d 146 (1976), we again stated that \u201cthe term \u2018nuisance\u2019 embraces everything that endangers life or health, or obstructs the reasonable and comfortable use of property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 592, 221 S.E.2d at 150. In <em>O\u2019Quinn, </em>we repeated that \u201cthe term \u2018nuisance\u2019 includes \u2018everything that endangers life or health, or obstructs the reasonable and comfortable use of property.\u2019 \u201d 223 Va. at 85, 286 S.E.2d at 182 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>In view of this established precedent, it is clear that a litigant in this type of case is entitled to recover, as an element of damages, compensation for physical or emotional injuries resulting from a nuisance which has endangered \u201clife or health.\u201d <em>See also Cohen </em>v. <em>Bellenot, </em>2 Va. Dec. 639, 642, 32 S.E. 455, 456 (1899). We also note that our longstanding precedent is consistent with the Restatement (Second) of Torts, \u00a7 821D comment a, which states, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-4\">It is obvious from the history of the action for private nuisance that the interests originally protected were interests in the use and enjoyment of land, including interests in the use and enjoyment of easements and profits. These interests continue to be the interests that are protected by actions for private nuisance. When there is an invasion of these interests, the plaintiff may recover not only for harm arising from acts that affect the land itself and the comfortable enjoyment of it, but also for harm to members of his family and to his chattels..</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Our review of the record discloses clear and convincing evidence that each member of the Bowers family incurred emotional injuries as a proximate result of the defendants\u2019 acts. For example, Mrs. Bowers required psychiatric care, David and Justin Bowers were diagnosed as having certain negative psychological conditions, and each member of the family suffered severe sleep deprivation.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">The defendants also argue that David and Justin Bowers are not entitled to recover damages for the nuisance because they have no ownership interest in the property owned by their parents. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">We have repeatedly held that an owner <em>or </em>occupant of land has a right to recover against the operator of a private nuisance. In <em>Virginian Railway Co. </em>v. London, 114 Va. 334, 76 S.E. 306 (1912), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-8\">\u2018A private nuisance is the using, or authorizing the use of, one\u2019s property, or of anything under one\u2019s control, so as to injuriously affect an owner or occupier of property (1) by diminishing the value of that property; (2) by continuously interfering with his power of control or enjoyment of that property; (3) by causing material disturbance or annoyance to him in his use or occupation of that property.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 344-45, 76 S.E. at 308 (citation omitted). Additionally, we stated in <em>O\u2019Quinn:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-4\">When a business enterprise, even though lawful, becomes obnoxious to occupants of neighboring dwellings and renders enjoyment of the structures uncomfortable by virtue of, for example, smoke, cinders, dust, noise, offensive odors, or noxious gases, the operation of such business is a nuisance. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-5\">A nuisance may diminish value of realty. The condition also may interfere with some right incident to the ownership or possession of real property. Such interference may be accomplished by substantially impairing the occupant\u2019s comfort, convenience, and enjoyment of the property, causing a material disturbance or annoyance in the use of the realty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">223 Va. at 85, 286 S.E.2d at 182 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">Accordingly, we hold that the Bowers\u2019 children, as lawful occupants of the land, are entitled to recover damages for injuries they incurred as a result of the defendants\u2019 maintenance of the private nuisance. This holding is consistent with the Restatement (Second) of Torts, \u00a7 821E comment d, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-8\">Members of the family. \u2018Possession\u2019 is not limited to occupancy under a claim of some other interest in the land, but occupancy is a sufficient interest in itself to permit recovery for invasions of the interest in the use and enjoyment of the land. Thus members of the family of the possessor of a dwelling who occupy it along with him may properly be regarded as sharing occupancy with intent to control the land and hence as possessors, as defined in \u00a7 328E. When there is interference with their use and enjoyment of the dwelling they can therefore maintain an action for private nuisance. Although there are decisions to the contrary, the considerable majority of the cases dealing with the question have so held.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">VI. Excessiveness of the Awards</p>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">The defendants argue that the trial court\u2019s award of $473,000 is excessive because, they say, the Bowers\u2019 evidence does not support the award. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>Although the chancellor heard this case with a jury on an issue out of chancery, the chancellor did not approve its verdict but, rather, entered a decree based upon the evidence. When the chancellor hears the evidence <em>ore terms, </em>his decree is entitled to the same weight as the verdict of a jury. <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Craig, </em>202 Va. 229, 234, 117 S.E.2d 63, 67 (1960). Thus, the chancellor\u2019s decree will not be disturbed unless it is clearly wrong or without evidence to support it. Code \u00a7 8.01-680; <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>223 Va. 505, 508-09, 291 S.E.2d 218, 220 (1982). In view of the facts summarized in Part II of this opinion, we cannot say as a matter of law that the decree is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">VII. Punitive Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The Bowers alleged in their \u201cConsolidated Motion for Judgment and Third Amended Bill of Complaint\u2019 \u2019 that they are entitled to recover punitive damages because of the defendants\u2019 operation of a private nuisance. The chancellor struck the Bowers\u2019 claims for punitive damages at the conclusion of their evidence. The Bowers argue that they presented sufficient evidence for the jury to consider their claims of punitive damages. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">We have repeatedly stated that an award of punitive damages is not favored generally because punitive damages are in the nature of a penalty and should be awarded only in cases involving the most egregious conduct. <em>Owens-Coming Fiberglas Corp. </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>243 Va. 128, 144, 413 S.E.2d 630, 639 (1992); <em>Philip Morris Incorporated </em>v. <em>Emerson, </em>235 Va. 380, 407, 368 S.E.2d 268, 283 (1988). A litigant, who seeks an award of punitive damages, must present evidence that the defendant\u2019s acts were \u201cso willful or wanton as to evince a conscious disregard of the rights of others, as well as malicious conduct. ...\u201d <em>Booth </em>v. <em>Robertson, </em>236 Va. 269, 273, 374 S.E.2d 1, 3 (1988). We have discussed the type of conduct which would support an award of punitive damages.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-7\">\u2018 \u2018In order that one may be held guilty of wilful or wanton conduct, it must be shown that he was conscious of his conduct, and conscious, from his knowledge of existing conditions, that injury would likely or probably result from his conduct, and that with reckless indifference to consequences he consciously and intentionally did some wrongful act or omitted some known duty which produced the injurious result.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number><em>Infant C. </em>v. <em>Boy Scouts of America, </em>239 Va. 572, 581, 391 S.E.2d 322, 327 (1990) (quoting <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Snow, </em>162 Va. 654, 660, 174 S.E. 837, 839 (1934)).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">We hold that the Bowers failed to present sufficient evidence which would support an award of punitive damages. The truck staging operation was a use permitted by the existing zoning classification. Jennings &amp; Webb installed sound controls and mufflers on their trucks in an effort to reduce the level of noise. Westvaco sought to reduce the amount of fugitive dust which was created by the truck staging operation by \u201cwetting\u201d the parking area. Certain portions of Lots 1 and 2 were paved in an effort to reduce the levels of dust.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Westvaco forwarded letters to all the \u201cover-the-road\u201d trucking companies and requested that drivers conduct themselves in a proper manner when traveling to and from the truck staging operation.
