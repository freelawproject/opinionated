State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (State Farm) issued Mary E. Clatterbuck (Clatterbuck) a policy providing liability, comprehensive physical damage, and uninsured motorist coverages on her Pontiac automobile. The insured vehicle was stolen by an unknown thief, damaged in an accident, and recovered by the owner. In response to Clatterbuck\u2019s claim under the comprehensive theft coverage clause of her policy, State Farm paid $4,408.44 for the cost of repairs and $522.42 for the expense of a rental car used while the Pontiac was being repaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-13\">Clatterbuck then filed a motion for judgment against \u201cJohn Doe\u201d, alleging that, when her car was stolen and damaged, it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>being operated by an uninsured driver. Clatterbuck demanded $10,000 in compensatory damages for \u201crepair, . . . loss of value . . . , loss of use of the vehicle, . . . [and] potential loss of the warranty\u201d of the Pontiac and $100,000 in punitive damages for \u201cthe Defendant\u2019s willful, wanton and recklessness [sic] conduct.\u201d Served with process in that suit, State Farm filed a separate motion for declaratory judgment against Clatterbuck and John Doe, asking the court to declare that its \u2018 \u2018uninsured motorist coverage is inapplicable and . . . that State Farm is not obligated to pay any judgment which Mary K. Clatterbuck may obtain against \u2018John Doe\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-3\">In a letter opinion the trial court ruled that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-4\">there is nothing in the statute or the policy that would preclude Ms. Clatterbuck from invoking uninsured motorist coverage. All of this assumes that she will be legally entitled to and be able to recover a monetary judgment from \u201cJohn Doe\u201d having already received payment for damage to her vehicle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">In a final declaratory judgment order, the court reaffirmed that ruling and dismissed the case from the docket. We awarded State Farm an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">The dispositive issue framed by the parties requires an analysis of Clatterbuck\u2019s State Farm automobile insurance policy. In effect, the trial court concluded that an automobile involved in an accident can be both insured and uninsured against damages sustained in that accident and that the insured owner is entitled to a recovery under both types of coverage. In our view, such a conclusion was not within the contemplation of the contracting parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">As stated on brief, Clatterbuck\u2019s sole argument in support of the trial court\u2019s ruling is that \u201c[ujnder the uninsured motorist provisions of Clatterbuck\u2019s policy, an insured motor vehicle is defined as one \u2018registered in Virginia with respect to which the bodily injury and property damage liability coverage of the policy applies <em>but shall not include a vehicle while being used without the permission of the </em>owner.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis in original). Specifically, she contends that, \u201c[a] thief is simply a non-permissive user, and . . . under the definitions of State Farm\u2019s own policy, a non-permissive user operating the vehicle makes it an uninsured vehicle during that period of time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">It is true that the UM coverage endorsement in State Farm\u2019s policy defines the term \u201cinsured motor vehicle\u201d to exclude \u201ca <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>vehicle while being used without the permission of the owner.\u201d However, Clatterbuck misconceives the purpose and effect of the exclusionary language. The definition of an \u201cinsured\u201d contained in the UM coverage endorsement includes any person \u201cwhile occupying an insured motor vehicle.\u201d Obviously, the function of the exclusion is to disqualify a non-permissive user (such as a thief) as an insured for purposes of UM coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-3\">Moreover, even if, as Clatterbuck seems to suggest, the effect of the exclusion is to make the Pontiac an <em>uninsured </em>motor vehicle for all purposes while it is being operated by a thief, she is not entitled to UM coverage for the damages she seeks because the very UM coverage endorsement she invokes defines the term \u201cproperty damage\u201d as \u201cinjury to or destruction of... an <em>insured </em>motor vehicle [emphasis added].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment entered below and enter final judgment declaring that Clatterbuck\u2019s automobile is not an uninsured motor vehicle within the contemplation of the parties to the insurance contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
