Wise-man as a part of the same act or transaction of killing James Baxter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>Wiseman, II, Code \u00a7 18.2-31(7).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thomas was also charged with two offenses of using a firearm in the killing of the victims. Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">In a written instrument signed by Thomas and his counsel, Thomas waived both a preliminary hearing and a transfer hearing. As a result, the matter was transferred to circuit court, where, on January 28, 1991, Thomas was indicted for the four offenses with which he had been charged in juvenile court.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">Trial on all four charges was set for May 29, 1991, and then continued to August 21 of the same year. Upon arraignment on August 21, Thomas entered pleas of guilty to the charges of first degree murder and use of a firearm in the killing of Mr. Wiseman and pleas of not guilty to the charges of capital murder and use of a firearm in the killing of Mrs. Wiseman.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">The trial court announced that it would accept Thomas\u2019s pleas of guilty to the charges involving the death of Mr. Wiseman and that it would order a pre-sentence report with respect to those charges. The trial court also accepted Thomas\u2019s pleas of not guilty to the charges involving Mrs. Wiseman\u2019s death, and trial proceeded before a jury on those charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">In the first phase of the trial, the jury convicted Thomas of capital murder and use of a firearm in the commission of the killing of Kathy Wiseman and fixed punishment on the weapons charge at four years in the penitentiary. In the second phase, the jury fixed Thomas\u2019s punishment for capital murder at death, based upon a finding of \u201cvileness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b27-8\">Following receipt of the report of a probation officer, the trial court held a sentencing hearing and imposed the sentences fixed by the jury in the death of Mrs. Wiseman. At the same hearing, the court sentenced Thomas to sixty-five years\u2019 imprisonment for the first degree murder of Mr. Wiseman and two years\u2019 imprisonment for the use of a firearm in that killing.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-9\">Thomas is before this Court for automatic review of his death sentence, and we have consolidated that review with the appeal of his capital murder conviction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Code \u00a7 17-110.1. In accordance with Code \u00a7 17-110.2, we have given the matter priority on our docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>THE FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">The record shows that Thomas lived with his aunt and uncle, Brenda and Herbert Marshall, at Piankatank Shores in Middlesex County. Lanie Creech, Mrs. Marshall\u2019s twelve-year-old niece, also lived in the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">Thomas had been involved for some time in a \u201c[v]ery intimate\u201d relationship with fourteen-year-old Jessica Wiseman, who lived with her parents, \u201cJ. B.\u201d and Kathy Wiseman, several blocks from the Marshall residence. Jessica\u2019s parents were threatening to break up the relationship. Jessica had been wearing Thomas\u2019s class ring \u201cfor a long time,\u201d but Mrs. Wiseman made Jessica \u201cgive it back.\u201d Some three months before the murders occurred, Jessica was heard to say that she \u201cwished to get rid of [her parents].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">Mr. and Mrs. Wiseman were murdered in the early morning hours of November 10, 1990, a Saturday. On the preceding Tuesday, Lanie Creech overheard a conversation between Thomas and Jessica in which the two discussed \u201c[g]etting rid of her parents.\u201d Jessica asked Thomas \u201cif he had enough bullets,\u201d and he replied in the affirmative. He asked Jessica \u201cwhat time he should come over.\u201d She replied, \u201c[m]idnight,\u201d and said that \u201cif the window is down to go away ... it\u2019s off\u201d but \u201cif the window is up to come on in.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AW\">On Thursday evening, Lanie had a conversation with Thomas. She asked him why \u201che was so nervous.\u201d He replied that he had \u201cto kill two people, and that he was real nervous.\u201d On Friday evening, just before midnight, Lanie observed Thomas putting on camouflage clothing and saw that he had a shotgun. He told Lanie the plan was that \u201cafter the shootings were over,\u201d he was to return home, \u201cgo in through his window and act like he was sleeping.\u201d Jessica would then come and \u201cbang on the door.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">Thomas and Lanie left the house together and walked to a nearby recreation area, where he smoked some \u201cpot\u201d and told Lanie he was \u201cgoing over to Jessica\u2019s . . . [t]o kill two people.\u201d With Lanie carrying the shotgun, the two walked to a point \u2018 \u2018a few hundred feet away from [Jessica\u2019s] house.\u201d Lanie then returned home.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">Later, Mrs. Marshall was awakened by someone \u201cbanging on the door.\u201d Lanie opened the door, and Jessica ran straight to Mrs. Marshall\u2019s bedroom, screaming that \u201csomeone had shot her father and that her mother was dead.\u201d Thomas was in his bedroom, and Mrs. Marshall asked him to \u201cget dressed\u201d and comfort Jessica while she called \u201cthe authorities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b29-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>Don F. Rhea, deputy sheriff of Middlesex County, was dispatched to the Wiseman home, and he arrived on the scene at 4:27 a.m. He entered through the unlocked front door and discovered the bodies of Mr. and Mrs. Wiseman.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">Later in the day, Special Agent Larry A. Johnson of the Virginia State Police conducted two interviews with Thomas at the Marshall house. In the second interview, Thomas confessed to killing Mr. and Mrs. Wiseman.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">PRETRIAL MATTERS</p>\n<p id=\"A9\">\n<em>Transfer Hearing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">Following Thomas\u2019s waiver of the transfer hearing and his indictment in circuit court, Benton H. Pollok, his court-appointed attorney, was relieved as counsel in the case. The trial court appointed new counsel, who moved to remand the proceeding to juvenile court \u201cfor a full and impartial transfer hearing.\u201d The trial court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">Thomas recognizes that in <em>Stanford </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>492 U.S. 361 (1989), the Supreme Court held that the imposition of capital punishment upon a person who commits murder at the age of 16 or 17 does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. Yet, Thomas argues that a transfer hearing is necessary to \u201cprovide the individualized consideration that the Constitution requires before a state may impose the death penalty\u201d upon a juvenile and, therefore, that a transfer hearing cannot be waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">As the Attorney General points out, however, the Constitution \u201cdoes not require juvenile transfer hearings nor does it require additional procedural safeguards for juveniles tried [for] capital crimes.\u201d Besides, Virginia\u2019s death penalty statutes provide for individualized consideration of all those tried on capital charges, with \u201cthe age of the defendant at the time of . . . the capital offense\u201d a statutorily prescribed mitigating factor the jury may consider in determining whether to fix punishment at death or life imprisonment. Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4(B)(v).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-9\">Thomas argues further that the juvenile transfer statute, Code \u00a7 16.1-270, does not permit a juvenile charged with capital murder to waive the jurisdiction of the juvenile court and have his case transferred to circuit court. The Code section provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>At any time prior to commencement of the adjudicatory hearing, a child fifteen years of age or older charged with an offense which if committed by an adult could be punishable by confinement in a state correctional facility, with the written consent of his counsel, may elect in writing to waive the jurisdiction of the juvenile court and have his case transferred to the appropriate circuit court ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-4\">Thomas says the waiver provision, by its \u201cplain language,\u201d applies only to offenses that are punishable by confinement in a state correctional facility and not to those punishable by death. We disagree with Thomas. While capital murder may be punishable by death, it \u201ccould be\u201d punishable by imprisonment for life in a state correctional facility. Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4. Hence, the waiver provision is clearly applicable where a juvenile is charged with a capital offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">\n<em>Double Jeopardy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">Immediately after Thomas entered his plea of guilty to first degree murder in the death of Mr. Wiseman, he moved to dismiss the capital murder charge on the ground that its prosecution would constitute double jeopardy. The trial court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">Thomas contends the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss. He cites <em>Grady </em>v. <em>Corbin, </em>495 U.S. 508 (1990). In that case, following a fatal collision, Corbin was given traffic tickets charging him with driving while intoxicated and failing to keep to the right of the median. He plead guilty to these charges in town court. Subsequently, based upon the same conduct, a county court grand jury indicted Corbin for reckless manslaughter. His motion to dismiss the indictment on double jeopardy grounds was denied, and he sought a writ of prohibition. The lower court denied the writ, but the New York Court of Appeals reversed, holding that prosecution of the manslaughter indictment would constitute double jeopardy. 495 U.S. at 514-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">Affirming, the Supreme Court of the United States held that, even though a second prosecution may not be barred by the test <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>enunciated in <em>Blockburger </em>v. <em>United States, </em>284 U.S. 299 (1932),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a second prosecution is barred \u201cif, to establish an essential element of an offense charged in that prosecution, the government will prove conduct that constitutes an offense for which the defendant has already been prosecuted.\u201d <em>Corbin, </em>495 U.S. at 510.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">Thomas argues that an essential element of his prosecution for capital murder was the killing of more than one person. In establishing that element, Thomas submits, the Commonwealth had to prove the killing of Mr. Wiseman, this being the same conduct the Commonwealth used to support the first degree murder charge, for which, Thomas says, he had already been prosecuted. Hence, Thomas concludes, the prosecution for capital murder was barred under <em>Corbin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">Thomas\u2019s argument suffers from a fatal flaw, namely, that <em>Corbin </em>does not apply to the situation at hand. It is applicable only where, in a <em>subsequent </em>prosecution, conduct previously prosecuted is used to establish an essential element of an offense which is the subject of the second trial. <em>Corbin, </em>495 U.S. at 510; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Luskin, 926 </em>F.2d 372, 377 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. </em>denied,_U.S. _, 112 S.Ct. 68 (1991). <em>Corbin </em>has no application where the same conduct is used to support more than one conviction in a single proceeding; indeed, the Supreme Court stated that \u201c[wjith adequate preparation and foresight, the State could have prosecuted Corbin for the offenses charged in the traffic tickets and the subsequent indictment in a single proceeding, thereby avoiding this double jeopardy question.\u201d <em>Corbin, </em>495 U.S. at 524.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">Here, Thomas was prosecuted in a single proceeding for both of the murder charges involving the Wisemans. In such a setting, \u201c \u2018the role of the constitutional guarantee [against double jeopardy] is limited to assuring that the court does not exceed its legislative authorization by imposing multiple punishments for the same offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Blythe </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 222 </em>Va. 722, 725, 284 S.E.2d 796, 798 (1981) (quoting <em>Brown v. Ohio, </em>432 U.S. 161, 165 (1977)). In <em>Woodfin </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>236 Va. 89, 372 S.E.2d 377 (1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>490 U.S. 1009 (1989), a prosecution for capital murder involving the killing of \u2018 \u2018more than one person as a part of the same act or transaction\u201d under Code \u00a7 18.2-31(g) (now Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>\u00a7 18.2-31(7)), we held that the trial court had not exceeded its legislative authorization by imposing life sentences for both the \u2018 \u2018gradation crime\u201d and the capital murder conviction. <em>Woodfin, </em>236 Va. at 97, 372 S.E.2d at 382. We make the same holding here.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">\n<em>Change of Venue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">Thomas contends the trial court erred in refusing to order a change of venue. He says that Middlesex County was \u2018 \u2018bombarded by pre-trial publicity\u201d and, therefore, that he could not receive a fair trial in the county.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">In a hearing on the change-of-venue motion, Thomas submitted the testimony of Dr. Donald Hugh Smith, Associate Professor in the Department of Sociology and Criminal Justice at Old Dominion University. Dr. Smith testified that, from a random survey he conducted, he found that between 96.3% and 99.3% of the \u201csmall population\u201d of Middlesex County \u201creadily recognized\u201d the Thomas case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He testified further that, of those surveyed, 38.7% expressed the opinion that Thomas was guilty, 1.4% thought he was innocent, and 59.8% expressed no opinion. Dr. Smith opined that between 35% and 57% of those expressing no opinion were \u201ccontaminated,\u201d meaning they were \u201cmore likely to convict than those who [were not subjected to the pretrial publicity].\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">Thomas contends Dr. Smith\u2019s testimony was uncontradicted \u201cthat the jury pool in Middlesex County was biased and that . . . Thomas could not receive a fair trial by a jury selected from that community.\u201d Hence, Thomas concludes, a change of venue was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">We disagree. A review of the record reveals that Dr. Smith\u2019s testimony was contradicted. It was contradicted by affidavits the sheriff secured from 100 Middlesex residents, each of whom stated that he or she could give Thomas a fair and impartial trial. More important, the testimony was contradicted by the fact that a jury was selected with relative ease. It was necessary to examine on voir dire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>only fifty-one prospective jurors to secure a panel of twenty-one, from which twelve jurors and one alternate were chosen. Of the thirty excused for cause, only sixteen, or 31% of those examined, were disqualified because of preformed opinion or bias resulting from pretrial publicity, seven, or 13%, were discharged for opposition to the death penalty, and seven, or another 13%, were dismissed for other reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">The 31% figure, representing the sixteen prospective jurors dismissed because of pretrial publicity, compares favorably with the 20% dismissed for similar reasons in <em>George </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>242 Va. 264, 275, 411 S.E.2d 12, 18 (1991), <em>cert. denied, </em>503 U.S. _, 112 S.Ct. 1591 (1992), the 37.84% in <em>Greenfield </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>214 Va. 710, 717, 204 S.E.2d 414, 420 (1974), the 18% in <em>Wansley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>210 Va. 462, 468, 171 S.E.2d 678, 682-83 (1970), and the 26% in <em>Beck </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>369 U.S. 541, 556 (1962). In all four of these previous cases, motions for change of venue were denied by the trial courts, and the denials were affirmed on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Thomas argues, however, reflecting the view of Dr. Smith, that voir dire examination of prospective jurors is inadequate to identify those who may have preformed opinions or bias as a result of pretrial publicity. We disagree with this view. Rather, we agree with what the trial judge said in denying the motion for change of venue: \u201c[T]he best tool for searching for the truth is a voir dire examination conducted under oath in a judicial atmosphere in all its [inherent sublimity].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">Whether venue should be changed is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court, and its decision on the matter will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of a showing of abuse. <em>Stockton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 124, 137, 314 S.E.2d 371, 379, <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 873 (1984). Furthermore, there is a presumption that a defendant can receive a fair trial in the county or city where the offense occurred. To overcome this presumption, the burden is upon the accused to establish clearly that \u201cthere is such a widespread feeling of prejudice on the part of the citizenry as will be reasonably certain to prevent a fair and impartial trial.\u201d <em>Coppola </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 220 </em>Va. 243, 248, 257 S.E.2d 797, 801 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1103 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">Thomas has shown neither an abuse of discretion nor the existence of a widespread feeling of prejudice among the citizenry of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>Middlesex County. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court did not err in refusing to order a change of venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">\n<em>Denial of Continuance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">Upon Thomas\u2019s indictment by the grand jury on January 28, 1991, the trial court set the case for trial on May 29 of that year. As indicated previously, at the time of indictment, Benton Pollok was serving as Thomas\u2019s court-appointed counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">In an oral motion made April 5 and in a written motion filed April 9, Pollok moved for a continuance of Thomas\u2019s case. Pollok represented to the court that he had been retained to defend a murder case in Gloucester County, which was scheduled for a three-week trial commencing on April 22 and continuing to within two weeks of Thomas\u2019s trial date. Pollok also represented that an effort to secure a continuance of the other case had been unsuccessful and, hence, insufficient time would be left for Pollok to prepare for.Thomas\u2019s trial, \u201cthus causing ineffective representation of . . . Thomas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">At the conclusion of a hearing on the motion for continuance, the trial judge noted that Pollok knew of his involvement in the Thomas case at the time he accepted employment in the other matter and that it was obvious Pollok was \u201cnot going to be ready to try [Thomas\u2019sjcase.\u201d The judge stated he would not continue the case but would allow Pollok to withdraw. \u201cIn fact,\u201d the judge said, \u201cI am going to enter an order requiring him to withdraw and I am going to ask [Damian T. Horne] to take this case.\u201d In an order entered on April 16, the trial court denied the motion for continuance, \u201crelieved\u201d Pollok as court-appointed counsel for Thomas, and appointed Home and Sydney K. L. West as co-counsel to represent Thomas.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">Thomas acknowledges that an indigent has no right to counsel of his choice, but he contends the trial court erred \u2018 \u2018in denying [Pollok\u2019s] motion for a continuance and requiring [Pollok] to withdraw from the case in midstream.\u201d Pollok was not only the attorney of his choice, Thomas says, but also one he trusted and was familiar with, since Pollok had represented him on several previous occasions. There is \u201cno acceptable reason,\u201d Thomas maintains, for discharging an experienced attorney who had been on the case for months and replacing him with attorneys who would not be fully prepared to participate in the adversarial fact-finding process.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>We do not think the trial court erred in denying the motion for continuance. When the trial judge set the case for trial, he made it clear to counsel that he was setting the matter \u201cfar enough in advance so everyone would have plenty of time to prepare\u201d and there would be no need for a continuance. Yet, with full knowledge of the situation, Pollok accepted employment in another case, admittedly jeopardizing his ability to prepare for trial of Thomas\u2019s case, and then expected the trial court to extricate him from his predicament by continuing the Thomas matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">Furthermore, when the trial judge announced the appointment of Horne to replace Pollok, he asked Home if there was \u201cany doubt in [his] mind that [he could] fully represent [Thomas].\u201d Horne replied: \u201cNo, sir.\u201d Nothing appears of record to indicate that Horne was unprepared for trial or that Thomas was prejudiced in any way by the denial of the motion for continuance. Indeed, all that Thomas has to say on the subject of prejudice is this vague sentence in his brief: \u201cObviously, replacement of counsel at such late date denies [a defendant the] opportunity to exercise his attorney-client relationship and schackles the very legal maneuvering of counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">Whether a continuance should be granted or denied is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court, and a decision one way or the other will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of a showing that the discretion has been abused. <em>Quintana </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>224 Va. 127, 135, 295 S.E.2d 643, 646 (1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>460 U.S. 1029 (1983); <em>Shiflett </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 25, 30, 235 S.E.2d 316, 319 (1977). We find no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s denial of a continuance in this case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">\n<em>Admissibility of Confession</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">By pretrial motion, Thomas sought to suppress the confession he made to Special Agent Larry Johnson on the day of the murders. After a hearing, the trial court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">In his confession, Thomas stated that, on the night in question, he went to Jessica\u2019s home and found her window open. He handed the shotgun to her through the window, then climbed through himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">Jessica\u2019s parents were asleep. Thomas loaded the gun, and Jessica put it on her bed. He lay on the bed beside Jessica \u201ca long time.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>Jessica then got a \u201cbox of drugs\u201d and put it on the floor \u201cto make it look like a drug rip off.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">For about ten or fifteen minutes, Thomas and Jessica \u201csat talking about killing [her parents].\u201d In \u201cthe very end,\u201d Thomas \u201cdidn\u2019t want to do it,\u201d but \u201c[Jessica] said she wanted it done.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">Thomas fired two shots at the Wisemans from the doorway of their bedroom, although, he claimed, he \u201creally couldn\u2019t see [Mr. and Mrs. Wiseman].\u201d He returned to Jessica\u2019s bedroom and was lying on the floor \u201con the opposite side of [the] bed\u201d when Mrs. Wiseman appeared in the doorway. Jessica said: \u201cOh God Chris please shoot her again.\u201d Thomas shot her again.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">Thomas contends that his confession was involuntary because he was only seventeen years old at the time of the offense,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> was a high-school dropout, had slept only two hours in the forty-hour period preceding his interrogation, and was beset by people he thought held great ill will toward him. In addition, Thomas says, the police initiated all conversations, and he felt surrounded by authorities who obviously wanted him to confess.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">Furthermore, Thomas continues, the testimony of Dr. Earl H. Williams, II, a clinical psychologist, confirmed that Thomas\u2019s ability to make an informed decision about waiving his <em>Miranda </em>rights had been compromised because he was \u201cdevelopmentally immature,\u201d was unable \u201cto make decisions at an adult level,\u201d was \u201cat the lower end\u201d of the \u201caverage range of intellectual function,\u201d and was sleep-deprived. \u201cIt is unreasonable to believe,\u201d Thomas concludes, \u201cthat under these circumstances [his]confession . . . was obtained by anything other than coercion and duress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">We disagree with Thomas. The evidence at the suppression hearing shows that Special Agent Johnson, who took Thomas\u2019s confession, first talked to Thomas in the Marshall home about 2:00 p.m. on the- afternoon of the murders. At that time, Johnson found Thomas \u201c[v]ery alert and very calm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">After interviewing Jessica, Johnson returned to the Marshall home about 9:30 p.m. and questioned Thomas about his involvement in the murders. Mrs. Marshall, who was \u201cacting as [Thomas\u2019s] guardian,\u201d was present during the entire interview, except for \u201ca few seconds\u201d when she went to the kitchen to get a drink of water. Thomas appeared alert and responsive, had no odor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>of alcohol about him, had not had \u201canything to drink,\u201d and had not taken any drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">Before the interrogation commenced, Johnson gave Thomas the warnings required by <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 (1966), \u201cvery slow[ly] and very deliberately].\u201d Thomas stated he understood his rights, took time to read the waiver form for himself, and then signed it. Johnson testified that he made no threats to Thomas and offered him no promises. Mrs. Marshall confirmed this aspect of Johnson\u2019s testimony while she was on the witness stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">The Commonwealth called Dr. Henry O. Gwaltney, Jr., a clinical psychologist, as a witness at the suppression hearing. Dr. Gwaltney was asked to state his conclusion \u201cas to [Thomas\u2019s] capacity to understand his Miranda rights.\u201d The doctor replied it was his conclusion that Thomas had made the confession \u201cknowingly[,] intelligently[,]and voluntarily.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">In ruling the confession admissible, the trial court rejected Dr. Williams\u2019s testimony, accepted Dr. Gwaltney\u2019s, and found that Thomas was \u201csufficiently mature\u201d to comprehend the <em>Miranda </em>warnings. The court found further that \u201cthe mandate of Miranda was certainly met\u201d; that the required warnings were \u201cclearly [and unequivocally] given\u2019 \u2019; and that the waiver of rights was in writing and signed by Thomas. The court also found there was no evidence that \u201cthe will of the interrogators was substituted for [the will of Thomas]\u201d or that Thomas was \u201canything other than alert.\u201d The court concluded that Thomas\u2019s \u201crights were fully protected and that he made an effective [,] voluntary decision to make the statement he did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">In <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>233 Va. 313, 356 S.E.2d 157, <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 873 (1987), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-8\">A defendant\u2019s waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights is valid only if the waiver is made knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently. <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 475. Whether a statement is voluntary is ultimately a legal rather than factual question. <em>See Miller </em>v. <em>Fenton, </em>474 U.S. 104, 110, 106 S.Ct. 445, 450 (1985). Subsidiary factual [findings], however, are entitled to a presumption of correctness. <em>Id. </em>at 112, 106 S.Ct. at 451. The test to be applied in determining voluntariness is whether the .statement is the \u201cproduct of an essentially free and unconstrained choice by its maker,\u201d or whether the maker\u2019s will \u201chas been overborne and his capacity for self-determination critically impaired.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number><em>Schneckloth </em>v. <em>Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 225 (1973). In determining whether a defendant\u2019s will has been overborne, courts look to \u201cthe totality of all the surrounding circumstances,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 226, including the defendant\u2019s background and experience and the conduct of the police, <em>Correll </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>232 Va. 454, 464, 352 S.E.2d 352, 357 (1987); <em>Stockton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. [124,] 140, 314 S.E.2d [371,] 381 [, <em>cert. denied, </em>460 U.S. 873 (1984)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 324, 356 S.E.2d at 163. Guided by these standards, we hold the evidence amply supports the trial court\u2019s finding that Thomas\u2019s \u201crights were fully protected and that he made an effective [,] voluntary decision to make the statement he did.\u201d Accordingly, we will not disturb the court\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">\n<em>Destruction of Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">On August 6, 1991, approximately 2-1/2 weeks before trial, Thomas made a motion for \u201cdismissal of all charges pending against him.\u201d The motion alleged that the Commonwealth had intentionally destroyed marijuana that had been found among Thomas\u2019s possessions even though the Commonwealth had information indicating \u2018 \u2018that [Thomas] had smoked marijuana laced with PCP\u201d on the night of the murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">The motion also alleged that the destruction of the marijuana constituted the willful concealment of evidence in violation of Thomas\u2019s due process rights under <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83 (1963). Other portions of the motion alleged that destruction of the marijuana deprived Thomas of evidence he could have used in defense of the charges against him and in mitigation of punishment. Finally, it was alleged that defense counsel had not learned about the marijuana until the day before the motion was filed. The trial court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">Evidence taken at a hearing on the motion shows that around December 28, 1990, some six weeks after Thomas was arrested and incarcerated for the Wiseman murders, his aunt, Brenda Marshall, discovered in his closet a small plastic \u201cbaggie\u201d containing green <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>plant material. Mrs. Marshall delivered the \u201cbaggie\u201d to Dawn Alexander, an associate of Benton Pollok, who, at the time, was Thomas\u2019s court-appointed counsel.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">Ms. Alexander turned the \u201cbaggie\u201d over to the sheriff. She explained to him the circumstances surrounding its discovery and told him she thought there was \u201csome possibility it might have some bearing on [Thomas\u2019s] mental state at the time of the crime.\u201d Ms. Alexander also told Pollok about the discovery of the marijuana. The sheriff informed the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney of his receipt of the \u201cbaggie\u201d and recommended that it be destroyed because it was not \u201cevidence [of] any crime or [related to] any suspect\u201d and did not have \u201cany legitimate relation or . nexus to [the Thomas] case.\u201d The sheriff considered the material contraband that should be destroyed; under current criteria, he could not \u201ceven submit it to the state lab\u201d for analysis. The Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney did not object to the sheriff\u2019s recommendation, and the material was \u201cjust put . . . down the commode.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">Testifying at the hearing on his motion to dismiss, Thomas said that Jessica gave him the marijuana the day before the murders occurred and that he took it home and put it in his closet. The next night, he smoked some of the marijuana while Lanie Creech was with him \u201con the way to the Wiseman\u2019s.\u201d Ms. Marshall, Thomas\u2019s aunt, testified, however, that she talked with Thomas after she found the marijuana. He told her that the marijuana she found had been brought from the Wiseman house after the murders and that the marijuana he smoked on the way to the Wiseman\u2019s came from a different source.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">We think, as the trial judge held, that <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Young-blood, </em>488 U.S. 51 (1988), is dispositive of the issues raised by Thomas\u2019s motion to dismiss. There, in a prosecution for child molestation, sexual assault, and kidnapping, the police negligently failed to preserve evidence consisting of semen samples from the victim\u2019s body and clothing, making it impossible for the defense to have tests performed on the evidence. The defendant was convicted in the trial court, despite his claim that the failure to refrigerate the evidentiary material denied him the right to exonerate himself. The Supreme Court of Arizona reversed the conviction. The Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>Court of the United States reversed the holding of the Arizona court.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">Distinguishing the situation where evidence is lost or destroyed from the circumstance where evidence is concealed, the Supreme Court held that, \u2018 \u2018unless a criminal defendant can show bad faith on the part of the police, failure to preserve potentially useful evidence does not constitute a denial of due process of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 58. Continuing, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-5\">The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, as interpreted in <em>Brady, </em>makes the good or bad faith of the State irrelevant when the State fails to disclose to the defendant material exculpatory evidence. But we think the Due Process Clause requires a different result when we deal with the failure of the State to preserve evidentiary material of which no more can be said than that it could have been subjected to tests, the results of which might have exonerated the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 57. Here, the trial court found there was \u201cnothing corrupt or in bad faith\u201d in the destruction of the marijuana, and the evidence supports that finding. Thomas does not question the finding; indeed, he told the trial court during argument on the motion to dismiss that he was \u201cnot alleging bad faith\u201d in the destruction of the marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">Furthermore, this is clearly a case of failure to preserve evidentiary material, rather than one of concealment. When Ms. Alexander became Thomas\u2019s co-counsel, she already had knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the discovery of the marijuana, and she told Benton Pollok, Thomas\u2019s co-counsel, about the discovery of the drug.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">More important, with the possible exception of Jessica Wise-man, Thomas himself knew more than anyone else about the role the marijuana played in the murder scenario, and he also knew early on that Mrs. Marshall had discovered the marijuana in his closet. While Attorneys Horne and West, later appointed to represent Thomas, may not have learned about the marijuana until the trial date approached, Thomas is as much to blame for their ignorance as anyone connected with the case. Under these circumstances, it would be unrealistic to say that the Commonwealth concealed or withheld evidence from Thomas and, hence, was guilty of violating the principles enunciated in <em>Brady. See United States </em>v. <em>Valera, </em>845 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>F.2d 923, 927-28 (11th Cir. 1988), <em>cert.denied, </em>490 U.S. 1046 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">Furthermore, we do not think that Thomas has established any prejudice resulting from the destruction of the marijuana. As noted at the outset of this discussion, Thomas claims that the destruction deprived him of evidence he could have used in defense of the charges against him and in mitigation of punishment. He further argues this deprivation interfered with his right to the effective assistance of counsel and denied him a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">Like that of the defendant in <em>Youngblood, </em>Thomas\u2019s argument assumes that had the marijuana not been destroyed, tests would have revealed it was laced with PCP and that he then could have shown his \u201cmental state at the time of the crime\u201d was affected by ingestion of the drug. But no claim was made during the trial, either in the guilt phase or the sentencing phase, that the marijuana Thomas smoked was laced with PCP or, more significant, that his conduct was affected in any manner by whatever substance he smoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Nor do we think Thomas established that, had the marijuana been subjected to tests, the results \u201cmight have exonerated [him].\u201d <em>Youngblood, </em>488 U.S. at 57. Even if tests had shown that the marijuana was laced with PCP and that the PCP affected Thomas\u2019s mental state at the time of the crime, the only possible materiality of such a showing would have concerned Thomas\u2019s ability to form the intent to kill and to premeditate. But the evidence was uncontradicted that the intent to kill and the premeditation incident to the Wise-man murders had existed for several days before Thomas ever smoked the marijuana he now claims might have been laced with PCP. Hence, there was not \u201ca reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 682 (1985). We conclude, therefore, that the trial court did not err in denying Thomas\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">GUILT PHASE</p>\n<p id=\"A5\">\n<em>Jury Selection</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">Thomas contends that the trial court erred in failing to disqualify six persons who served as jurors in this case. He argues that, because the six admitted they were friends or business associates of the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney, they were disqualified from jury service.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>Thomas acknowledges that in <em>Calhoun </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 256, 307 S.E.2d 896 (1983), we said former clients of the prosecutor were not disqualified from jury service, that in <em>Elam </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 113, 326 S.E.2d 685 (1985), we held a sister of a former prosecutor and four former clients of the then present prosecutor not disqualified, and that in <em>Wise </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 322, 337 S.E.2d 715 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>475 U.S. 1112 (1986), we ruled a long-time friend and golfing buddy of the prosecutor not disqualified. Thomas maintains, however, that his case is distinguishable because the relationships involved are current and the fact there were as many as six jurors associated with the prosecutor \u201cincreases the likelihood of prejudice or bias, whether conscious or subconscious.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">On voir dire, prospective juror Gregory Felton said he and the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney knew each other. Gloria Farrar stated she knew of the prosecutor. Vivian Milby told the court the prosecutor was a friend. Lee Roberts said he knew the prosecutor. William Lee advised the court he was a cabinetmaker and had done work for the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney. Garland Harrow said he and the prosecutor grew up together.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">None of these jurors indicated a present relationship with the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney so close as to require a per se finding of disqualification, either singly or in combination. Each person clearly disavowed any sense of bias or prejudice, and there is nothing in the voir dire responses from which an inference of \u201csubconscious\u201d bias can be drawn. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court did not err in seating the six jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">\n<em>Admissibility of Photographs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">Thomas contends the trial court erred in admitting photographs of the crime scene showing damage to the bodies of the murder victims. Thomas says the damage portrayed \u201cwas extreme and gruesome and only served to arouse the jurors\u2019 passion against [him].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">The trial court admitted a portion of the photographs offered by the Commonwealth and rejected others, indicating that those admitted were sufficient to show the condition of the bodies of the victims. Rejecting the remaining photographs, the trial judge stated: \u201cWe have to balance demonstrative evidence between that which is inflamm[atory]and that which is helpful to the jury, and I think we have reached that stage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>In striking this balance, the trial court demonstrated a careful exercise of the discretion with which it was vested in determining what was admissible and what was not. In <em>Clozza </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 124, 135, 321 S.E.2d 273, 280 (1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 1230 (1985), we approved the trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion in admitting photographs which \u201c \u2018portrayed more graphically, but not more inflammatorily, than the testimony of [the witnesses] the methodical manner in which the killing . . . was accomplished.\u2019 \u201d (Quoting <em>Waye </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 683, 692, 251 S.E.2d 202, 208, <em>cert. denied, </em>442 U.S. 924 (1979)). The photographs in question here portrayed similar methodical action on Thomas\u2019s part. It was not error, therefore, to admit the photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">PENALTY PHASE</p>\n<p id=\"A0\">\n<em>Judge or Jury Sentencing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">In <em>Ballard </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 213, 321 S.E.2d 284 (1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>470 U.S. 1085 (1985), this Court decided that a juvenile who is transferred to circuit court and prosecuted for capital murder, but convicted by a jury of first degree murder, was properly sentenced by the judge rather than the jury. We specifically reserved decision on the question presented here, <em>viz., </em>whether a juvenile who is convicted by a jury of capital murder should be sentenced by the judge in accordance with Code \u00a7 16.1-272, part of the juvenile law, or by the jury pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-264.3 and -264.4, two of the death penalty statutes. <em>Ballard, </em>228 Va. at 215 n. 3, 321 S.E.2d at 285 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">In pertinent part, Code \u00a7 16.1-272 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-7\">A. In the hearing and disposition of felony cases properly before a circuit court having criminal jurisdiction of such offenses if committed by an adult, the court, after giving the juvenile the right to a trial by jury on the issue of guilt or innocence and upon a finding of guilty, may sentence or commit the juvenile offender in accordance with the criminal laws of this Commonwealth or may in its discretion deal with the juvenile in the manner prescribed in this law for the hearing and disposition of cases in the juvenile court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">Code \u00a7 19.2-264.3 provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>A. In any case in which the offense may be punishable by death which is tried before a jury the court shall first submit to the jury the issue of guilt or innocence of the defendant of the offense charged in the indictment ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-4\">C. If the jury finds the defendant guilty of an offense which may be punishable by death, then a separate proceeding before the same jury shall be held as soon as is practicable on the issue of the penalty, which shall be fixed as is provided in \u00a7 19.2-264.4.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">As pertinent here, Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-6\">A. Upon a finding that the defendant is guilty of an offense which may be punishable by death, a proceeding shall be held which shall be limited to a determination as to whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death or life imprisonment. In case of trial by jury, where a sentence of death is not recommended, the defendant shall be sentenced to imprisonment for life.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">Thomas contends he should have been sentenced by the judge, rather than the jury. He recognizes that jury sentencing is the general rule in Virginia and that, in capital cases, Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-264.3 and -264.4 provide for jury sentencing in a separate penalty trial. He argues, however, that Code \u00a7 16.1-272 provides a specific exception to the general rule of jury sentencing. This exception, he says, accords with the state\u2019s policy in dealing with juveniles in criminal cases \u2014 rehabilitation, not retribution, is the goal.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">We disagree with Thomas\u2019s interpretation of the cited statutes. Code \u00a7 19.2-264.3(A) and (C) provide that, in <em>any </em>case tried by a jury in which the offense may be punishable by death, the jury shall fix the penalty. Read alone, this language permits no exceptions, even where the accused is a juvenile who has been certified for trial on a capital case as an adult.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">But if, when Code \u00a7 16.1-272 is read along with \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-264.3 and -264.4, a conflict may appear, an ordinary rule of statutory construction serves to resolve the conflict. The rule is that \u201cwhen one statute speaks to a subject in a general way and another deals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>with a part of the same subject in a more specific manner, the two should be harmonized, if possible, and where they conflict, the latter prevails.\u201d <em>Va. National Bank </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>220 Va. 336, 340, 257 S.E.2d 867, 870 (1979). <em>See also Hudler </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>236 Va. 389, 393, 374 S.E.2d 39, 42 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">Sections 16.1-272, 19.2-264.3, and 19.2-264.4 all deal with the subject of punishment of criminal offenders. Section 16.1-272 speaks to the subject in a general way, referring to the broad class of \u201cfelony cases\u201d and prescribing no set penalty, while \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-264.3 and -264.4 speak to the subject in a specific way, confining their range to the narrow class of capital cases and prescribing definite penalties. We think a conflict does exist between \u00a7 16.1-272, on the one hand, and \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-264.3 and -264.4, on the other, so far as the punishment of juveniles certified for trial on capital cases is concerned, and, therefore, that the latter statutes prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">\n<em>Lack of Remorse</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">The Commonwealth called Thomas\u2019s uncle, Herbert Marshall, as a witness in the penalty phase. Marshall testified that he was at work about 4:00 a.m. on November 10, the date of the Wiseman murders, when Mrs. Marshall called to tell him about the killings. He arrived home between 7:00 and 7:30 a.m. and found Thomas and Jessica asleep \u201cclose together\u201d on the sofa. Defense counsel objected on relevance grounds, and the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney stated that the fact \u2018 \u2018these two . . . right after the murder . . . were there just lying on the sofa asleep\u201d was evidence of Thomas\u2019s lack of remorse sufficient to support a finding of \u2018 \u2018future dangerousness or vileness.\u201d Defense counsel moved for a mistrial. The trial court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">Thomas argues that the prosecutor\u2019s remark about lack of remorse \u201chad no relevance . . . and only served to further inflame and prejudice the jury.\u201d We disagree with Thomas. In <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 220 </em>Va. 201, 257 S.E.2d 784 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1049 (1980), we said that it is \u201cobviously proper\u201d for a jury in a capital case to consider testimony of the defendant\u2019s lack of \u201cregret or remorse\u201d in determining \u201cdangerousness,\u201d <em>viz., </em>whether the defendant \u201cwould in all probability commit criminal acts of violence in the future.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 210, 257 S.E.2d at 790. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>have also recognized that such testimony may be considered in determining \u201cvileness.\u201d <em>Bunch </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 225 </em>Va. 423, 443, 304 S.E.2d 271, 282, <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 977 (1983).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">\n<em>Vileness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">As noted previously, the jury based its sentence of death upon the aggravating factor of \u201cvileness,\u201d <em>viz-, </em>Thomas\u2019s conduct in committing the offense was \u201coutrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman in that it involved torture, depravity of mind or an aggravated battery to the victim.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-264.2. Thomas argues that the evidence was insufficient to establish vileness. We disagree. We think the evidence clearly shows that Mrs. Wiseman\u2019s murder involved both aggravated battery and depravity of mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">We have defined the term \u201caggravated battery\u201d to mean \u201ca battery which, qualitatively and quantitatively, is more culpable than the minimum necessary to accomplish an act of murder.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 455, 478, 248 S.E.2d 135, 149 (1978), <em>cert, denied, </em>441 U.S. 967 (1979). While a single gunshot wound, causing instantaneous death, does not constitute an aggravated battery, <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 225 </em>Va. 289, 296, 302 S.E.2d 520, 525, <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 865 (1983), \u201cmultiple gunshot wounds may constitute an \u2018aggravated battery\u2019. . . where there is an appreciable lapse of time between the first shot and the last, and where death does not result instantaneously from the first.\u201d <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 130, 139-40, 360 S.E.2d 196, 203 (1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 1036 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">Although Thomas stated in his confession that he shot at the Wisemans from the doorway of their bedroom and \u201ccouldn\u2019t see them,\u201d medical evidence shows that both victims were shot in the face from close range and that both shots would have been fatal. Mrs. Wiseman, however, was able to get out of her bed and walk to Jessica\u2019s bedroom, where she was again struck in the face by a blast from Thomas\u2019s shotgun, this one killing her instantaneously. Hence, it is clear beyond any doubt that there was \u201can appreciable lapse of time between the first shot [that struck Mrs. Wiseman] and the last [and that death did] not result instantaneously from the first.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>is just as clear that the battery to Mrs. Wiseman was \u201cmore culpable than the minimum necessary to accomplish [her murder],\u201d <em>Smith, </em>219 Va. at 478, 248 S.E.2d at 149, and, therefore, that the battery was aggravated.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">We have defined depravity of mind as \u201ca degree of moral turpitude and psychical debasement surpassing that inherent in the definition of ordinary legal malice and premeditation.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Only a person of depraved mind could plan and commit the execution-style killings this record reveals yet show no remorse or regret for his actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">SENTENCE REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"AU\">\n<em>Passion and Prejudice</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">Code \u00a7 17-110.1(C)(1) requires this Court to determine \u201c[w]hether the sentence of death was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor.\u201d Thomas contends that his death sentence was imposed under the influence of these factors. His entire argument on the subject is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-7\">The crime was certainly the most notorious event that had transpired in Middlesex County in recent memory. The coverage the event received by a frantic press could only have contributed to a lynch-mob mentality and vigilante sense of justice that was impossible to cure with anything other than a change of venue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">Earlier in this opinion, we held that the trial court did not err in denying Thomas\u2019s motion for a change of venue. Implicit in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>holding is the determination that Thomas failed to establish the existence of \u201ca lynch-mob mentality and vigilante sense of justice\u201d in Middlesex County. Therefore, his entire argument on this subject collapses of its own weight. Be that as it may, our independent examination of the record reveals nothing to indicate that the sentence of death was the product of passion, prejudice, or other arbitrary factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">\n<em>Excessiveness and Disproportionality</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">Code \u00a7 17-110.1(C)(2) requires this Court to consider and determine \u201c[wjhether.the sentence of death is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant.\u201d Thomas\u2019s entire argument on this subject involves a comparison of his punishment with Jessica\u2019s, which consisted of her commitment to the custody of the Department of Youth and Family Services until she reaches her twenty-first birthday. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-285.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">In determining excessiveness and disproportionality, we have consistently rejected efforts by defendants to compare their sentences with those received by confederates. <em>King </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>243 Va. 353, 371, 416 S.E.2d 669, 679 (1992); <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 766, 780, 284 S.E.2d 816, 823 (1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 1038 (1982), <em>aff\u2019d on remand, </em>228 Va. 468, 323 S.E.2d 114 (1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>471 U.S. 1025 (1985); <em>Stamper </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 220 </em>Va. 260, 283-84, 257 S.E.2d 808, 824 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>445 U.S. 972 (1980); <em>Coppola, 220 </em>Va. at 258-59, 257 S.E.2d at 807-08; <em>Clark, </em>220 Va. at 220-21, 257 S.E.2d at 796-97. We reject Thomas\u2019s effort to make a similar comparison here.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">The true test in determining excessiveness or disproportionality is whether \u201cjuries in this jurisdiction generally approve the supreme penalty for comparable or similar crimes.\u201d <em>Stamper, 220 </em>Va. at 284, 257 S.E.2d at 824. Applying this test, we have examined the records of all capital murder cases previously reviewed by this Court where, as here, the death sentence was based upon the \u201cvileness\u201d predicate alone. <em>Buchanan </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>238 Va. 389, 384 S.E.2d 757 (1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>493 U.S. 1063 (1990); <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>236 Va. 448, 374 S.E.2d 303 (1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>490 U.S. 1028 (1989); <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 130, 360 S.E.2d 196 (1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 1036 (1988); <em>Payne </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>233 Va. 460, 357 S.E.2d 500, <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 933 (1987); <em>Correll </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>232 Va. 454, 352 S.E.2d 352, <em>cert. denied, </em>482 U.S. 931 (1987); <em>Wise </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 322, 337 S.E.2d 715 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>475 U.S. 1112 (1986); <em>Boggs </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 501, 331 S.E.2d 407 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>475 U.S. 1031 (1986); <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 535, 323 S.E.2d 577 (1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>471 U.S. 1111 (1985); <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 427, 323 S.E.2d 554 (1984), <em>cert. denied, All </em>U.S. 1012 (1985). Cases reviewed prior to 1984 are listed in <em>Jones, </em>228 Va. at 450 n. 3, 323 S.E.2d at 567 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">Our examination of these decisions, as well as capital cases resulting in life imprisonment, leads us to the conclusion that Thomas\u2019s sentence of death is not excessive or disproportionate when compared to sentences generally imposed by sentencing bodies in this jurisdiction for crimes of a similar nature. Mrs. Wise-man\u2019s murder at least equals in vileness a number of the killings involved in the decisions listed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Finding no error in any of the issues raised by Thomas and perceiving no reason to disturb the death sentence, we will affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b27-10\"> Under Code \u00a7 18.2-31(7), the willful, deliberate, and premeditated killing of more than one person as a part of the same act or transaction is capital murder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b27-11\"> Thomas has not appealed any of his non-capital convictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b31-9\"> Under <em>Blockburger, </em>the second of two prosecutions is not barred if each offense \u201crequires proof of a fact which the other does not.\u201d <em>Blockburger </em>v. <em>United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 304 (1932).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b32-9\"> According to the 1990 Census Report, the population of Middlesex County consists of 8,653 persons. 1991-92 Report of the Secretary of the Commonwealth 455.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b32-10\"> Other than general statements by Smith about \u201cthe kind of publicity that this case has had,\u201d Thomas did not introduce into evidence any newspaper articles or other matter to support his claim that Middlesex County was \u201cbombarded\u201d by pretrial publicity. However, Thomas attached thirteen newspaper articles to a trial memorandum he filed in support of his motion for change of venue. We have examined the articles and find them not inflammatory.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b35-10\"> Trial of the case was ultimately continued to enable the defense to seek psychiatric evaluation of Thomas. The order continuing the case set a new trial date of August 21, 1991.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b36-10\"> Thomas was born May 29, 1973.

However, this point was not raised in the trial court, and, accordingly, we will not consider it now. Rule 5:25.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b47-9\"> Evidence of extraordinary planning and premeditation on Thomas\u2019s part is provided in the record. Early in the week during which the murders occurred, Mr. and Mrs. Marshall, with whom Thomas lived, were in Roanoke on a hunting trip and staying at the home of a cousin. Thomas knew where the Marshalls would be staying. One morning, when Marshall got into his pickup truck to go hunting, he \u201cdidn\u2019t have any brakes\u201d and discovered that the brake line had been \u201ccut... to the point that all of the brake fluid in one half of the master cylinder was drained.\u201d On Thursday afternoon of the same week, Lanie Creech asked Thomas when the Marshalls would be returning, and he said \u201cthey wouldn\u2019t get back until . . . some time later because they had truck problems.\u201d When the Marshalls returned on Thursday evening, Thomas expressed surprise. He told Lanie he \u201choped he [wouldn\u2019t] get in trouble for going up to Roanoke [with Jessica and] cutting the brake line.\u201d From this evidence, the jury was entitled to infer that Thomas cut the brake line in order to delay the Marshalls\u2019 return until after he had carried out the plan to murder Jessica\u2019s parents.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
