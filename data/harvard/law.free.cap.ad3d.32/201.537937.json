A cause of action for deceptive business practices (General Business Law \u00a7 349) requires proof that the defendant engaged in consumer-oriented conduct that was materially deceptive or misleading, causing injury <em>(see Gaidon v Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>94 NY2d 330, 344 [1999]). Even assuming that defendant is chargeable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>with the advertisement that led plaintiff to his medical office, a conclusion the motion court seemed to reject in its dismissal of the separate false advertising claim under General Business Law \u00a7 350, the General Business Law \u00a7 349 cause of action fails because said advertisement was not materially deceptive or misleading.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Unlike <em>Karlin v IVF Am. </em>(93 NY2d 282, 288 [1999]), nothing in this advertisement has been shown to be false or misleading, such as a guarantee of results, misleading statistics on success rates or an assertion that there are no risks to the procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">However, the causes of action for lack of informed consent and malpractice were properly sustained. Notwithstanding plaintiffs signature on a consent form moments before going into surgery, he presented expert opinion that the document he executed was insufficient to satisfy defendant\u2019s medical obligations under the circumstances. In addition, the parties offer distinctly different versions of what defendant verbally told plaintiff about the risks of the procedure. Therefore, the evidence does not conclusively establish that plaintiff was fully informed of the potential complications associated with this surgical procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Further, defendant, as the proponent of summary dismissal, had the burden of establishing that there was no issue of fact as to whether he committed medical malpractice <em>(see Alvarez v Prospect Hosp., </em>68 NY2d 320, 324 [1986]). Even assuming defendant\u2019s affidavit was sufficient to satisfy this burden, the expert opinion offered by plaintiffs\u2019 expert, that cutting the suspensory ligament and grafting the fat around the patient\u2019s penis were inherently risky and constituted departures from acceptable medical practice, was sufficient to raise a triable issue of fact. The motion court appropriately rejected defendant\u2019s attack on the qualifications of plaintiffs\u2019 expert, since such qualifications generally go to the weight of the expert\u2019s testimony, not its admissibility <em>(see Adamy v Ziriakus, </em>92 NY2d 396, 402 [1998]).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">We have considered defendant\u2019s remaining arguments and find them unavailing.
