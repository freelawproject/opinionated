Co., </em>5 AD3d 712 [2004]; <em>Aronov v Leybovich, </em>3 AD3d 511 [2004]). Since the appellants failed to establish, prima facie, their entitlement to judgment as a matter of law, the sufficiency of the papers submitted in opposition to the motion need not be considered <em>(see Coscia v 938 Trading Corp., </em>283 AD2d 538 [2001]). Schmidt, J.P., Crane, Krausman, Skelos and Lunn, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
