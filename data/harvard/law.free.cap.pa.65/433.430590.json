Exceptions were filed to the account, viz., that the guardian should be charged with the increase on the sale of certain real estate of the decedent purchased by him at an Orphans\u2019 Court sale before he became guardian, and that he should not be credited with the costs of the citation. The whole case is so fully stated in the opinion of Mr. Justice Read, that any further statement is unnecessary. The matter was referred to H. L. Baer, Esq., who sustained the exceptions, and charged the accountant with the costs of the audit. The guardian filed these exceptions:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-13\">\u201c 1. The counsel for the said Francis Hayman pray the court to dismiss the proceedings in this case for the reason that they are not cognisable by this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-14\">\u201c 2. The auditor finds as facts: first, that Francis Hayman pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>chased the land which in part forms the subject of controversy, from the administrator of Charles Alburn, bn the 7th January 1865, for $700, and that a deed was made to Francis Hayman for the premises. He also finds that Francis Hayman was appointed guardian of Henry and William Alburn on the 24th April 1865, months after the purchase and date of the deed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-6\">\u201c 3.

Upon this announcement, one certainly of the bidders ceased bidding, who would have given <em>more, </em>but did not think it right to bid against the children. It was knocked down to Hayman for $700, and he immediately turned around and addressed the boys, Henry' and William Alburn, and said, \u201c the place is yours.\u201d In different conversations he said the farm was bought for the boys.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-13\">On the 6th February 1865 the sale was confirmed, and on the 4th April the administrator made a deed to Francis Hayman for the premises, Hayman paying $600 in cash, and giving his obligation for the remaining $100. The administrator also testified that \u201c on the 31st March 1865, when I came up to make my return, Hayman told me to tell J. O. Kimmel, Esq., to make the deed to the Alburn boys (William and Henry): I told J. O. Kimmel, and he said that could not be; it must be made to correspond to the return; when I delivered the deed in J. O. Kimmel\u2019s office, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>Hayman said he did not buy the place for himself, but for the Alburn boys, and turned around and pointed to the boys. William and Henry were present.\u201d \u201c I paid Hayman the share of the two boys, of whom he was guardian.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">On the 24th April 1865, Francis Hayman was appointed guardian of the two minors, William and Henry, and on the 12th March 1867 sold the farm to Frederick Bodie for $1200 \u2014 $800 on the 1st April 1867, and the balance in two annual payments without interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">Upon citation, the guardian filed his account with Henry Al-burn, which was referred to an auditor, whose report was confirmed by the Orphans\u2019 Court, from whose decree this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">It also appears, that in 1864, the boys wanted Hayman to be their guardian, and that in November of that year he said he had rather agreed to be so ; and Henry Alburn testified: \u201c I did appoint Hayman my guardian, and he was to act as my guardian before the sale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">It is clear, therefore, that the appellant, before and at the time of the sale, and up to the time of his appointment as guardian by the court, stood in a fiduciary relation to the appellee, an infant, as <em>quasi </em>guardian or confidential adviser, and is bound to account for the profit made by him on the sale of the premises purchased by him for the'benefit of the two minors.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">The guardianship account has been settled by the court upon this principle, and we see no error in the decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-11\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed, at the costs of . the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
