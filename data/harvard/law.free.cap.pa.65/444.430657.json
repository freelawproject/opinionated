Rankin in 1785 granted to Allison, his heirs and assigns for ever, the partial use of a stream running between them.

W. Bhodes and others against Jacob B. Fleming, burgess, B. F. Winger and others, town council, and Daniel Hanbecker, constable of the borough of Greencastle. The plaintiffs were residents of Green-castle.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-14\">The facts in the case were, that one John Allison was the proprietor and founder of Greencastle, and that on March 8th 1785 one William Eankin delivered his bond to Allison in the penalty of 500?., with condition that Eankin would allow and grant unto Allison \u201c his heirs, executors, administrators or assigns * * * such quantity or proportion of his stream of water, at the line between said Eankin and Allison, where the watercourse now is of the breadth of two feet, and such a sufficient quantity as will run through one two-inch augur bore, with two inches and a-half head above the upper part of said bore, this quantity of water to be allowed to run from the 1st of March until the 1st of September, yearly and every year for ever, and then from the 1st day of September until the 1st day of March yearly and every year as much as will run through one four-inch augur bore, with the aforesaid quantity of head.\u201d In pursuance of this obligation the stream was allowed to flow through the streets of Greencastle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>and over the lots of the plaintiffs and others in Greencastle. The complainants were assignees of Allison of lots along the watercourse.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-6\">On the 28th of April 1857 a supplement (Pamph. L. 829) to the Act incorporating Greencastle was passed, providing:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-7\">Sect. 1. \u201c That the burgess and town council of the borough of Greencastle be authorized and empowered to take upon themselves the supervision of the water and watercourse in the borough aforesaid, to see that the proper quantity of water is at all times delivered by the heirs or assigns of William Rankin, deceased, and to enforce the delivery of the same by such suit or suits in their corporate name as may be necessary, and whenever they shall deem the same necessary, may by themselves, their agents, engineers, &amp;e., and with their tools, carts, &amp;c., enter upon any of the lands, lots and enclosures, streets, lanes, alleys and highways along the original or present course of the said stream for the purpose of examining the condition thereof, removing obstructions therefrom, repairing the bed or channel of the same or preventing the wasting of the water therefrom or its appropriation to uses not designed originally.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-8\">Sect. 2. \u201c The expenses incurred in repairing the said watercourse and keeping the same in good order shall be paid as follows, to wit: those incurred in the streets, lanes and alleys of the said borough shall be paid out of the borough funds, and those incurred on private property shall be taxed by the said borough and town council against the property through which the said stream passes, according to the amount expended upon each property, and shall be a lien thereon and collected as other borough taxes are by law collected.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-9\">Sect. 3. \u201c The burgess, &amp;c., may by ordinance provide what fines and penalties shall be enforced against any person who shall wilfully or maliciously do any damage to said water-course, or who shall obstruct, or divert, or use the water unlawfully, waste it or render it unfit for use.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-10\">The borough authorities entered on the lots of the plaintiffs without their consent, made repairs, &amp;c., and issued- their warrant to collect the costs and expenses incurred upon their lots.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-11\">The bill set out these facts, and further set out, that the stream was for the common benefit of all the residents of Greencastle, is used by all in common, that the plaintiffs had \u201cno special or greater interest in the water of said stream than is common to all the said citizens and residents of said borough, and your orators use said water in no other or different manner than it is used by said other citizens and residents;\u201d that until recently the stream had been kept clear of obstructions, &amp;c., at the expense of the borough, and the expenses were paid from the general taxation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-12\">The prayers were:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>1.

General relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-9\">The court awarded a preliminary injunction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-10\">The defendants filed an answer, admitting that the water was for the common benefit of all the residents of Greencastle, but denying that the plaintiffs had no special nor greater interest in the water beyond other residents ; they denied that the stream theretofore had been kept free from obstructions at the expense of the borough, and aver that it had been done at the expense of the lot-holders along the course of the stream.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-11\">The matter was referred to Theodore McGowan, Esq., as examiner, who reported the facts as above stated. He also reported that there were two public cisterns in the streets of Greencastle, on the line of the stream, placed there by the borough authorities. The stream, with some alterations made at the request of the lot-holders, passes through the borough from north to south, as when Rankin\u2019s obligation was executed, passing over streets and alleys, lots and enclosures; it ran for many years over the ground, but in 1857 was trunked for the first time, and dipping-boxes placed in the streets for the convenience of the residents and their cattle; the expenses of this work were paid by the borough for the portion in the streets, &amp;c., and by the lot-holders for the portion within the limits of their lots. In 1867 the repairs which gave rise to this complaint were made. He reported also that water was \u201c used by all, whether lot-holders or not, for the purposes of washing, scrubbing, watering stock and for building purposes by those near enough to the stream. The water is unfit for drinking or cooking, and is not used by any for those purposes, save perhaps the first lot-holders on the northern side, where the stream enters the town.* * * The uses by the public not lot-holders near the stream are the watering of stock, hauling away for building purposes, &amp;c., and in case of fires.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-12\">He also found:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-13\">1. \u201c That the plaintiffs the lot-holders have no special or greater interest, as a class, in the water of the stream than is common to all the citizens or residents of Greencastle.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-14\">2. \u201c It does not appear at all how the expenses, if any, incurred prior to 1857, were met, nor that any, in fact, were incurred.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-15\">The defendants excepted to the report of the examiner, that he had <em>\u201c </em>found as a fact that the owners of the lots through which the stream of water passes have no special or greater interest in said stream of water than the citizens of said borough generally.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-16\">After the hearing the court decreed: \u201c that the said Act of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>Assembly passed the 28th day of April, A. D., 1857 is unconstitutional and void so far as the same provides for the taxing of the lots through which said stream passes, for the improvement and repair of said stream; and therefore the assessment of taxes under and by order thereof upon the properties of the complainants is illegal and invalid. The preliminary injunction is hereby decreed perpetual.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-6\">The defendants appealed to the Supreme Court, and assigned for error:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-7\">1. Overruling the exceptions to the examiner\u2019s report.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-8\">2. Deciding the assessment of taxes for the repairing of said stream of 'water to be illegal and invalid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-9\">8. Deciding that \u201c the Act of Assembly, passed on the 28fch day of April 1857, is unconstitutional and void, so far as the same provides for the taxing of the lots through which said stream passes.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b447-10\"><em>W.

It can hardly be expected that we can reverse the decree on this ground in the dark. The other errors assigned all depend necessarily upon this first one. Had a map or plan been attached to the paper-book showing the course of the stream, it would have materially assisted us in arriving at a just and satisfactory decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-14\">From the master\u2019s report, however, it may be inferred that John Allison being the owner of the land upon which the borough of Greencastle is now built, laid it out in streets and lots, and, with a view to secure a supply of water to the grantees of the lots from him, purchased from William Rankin, who was the owner of a stream in the neighborhood, the right to draw therefrom a certain quantity for that purpose. On the 8th of March 1786, he took from him an obligation to that effect. A copy of this bond is not given in the paper-books. It would seem that an artificial watercourse must have been intended. The stream, with some alterations made many years ago in its channel at the request of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>residents near its line to suit their convenience, still flows through the corporate limits, passing over streets and' alleys, lots and enclosures. It ran over the ground originally, but in 1857 in pursuance it would seem of the Act of Assembly of that year, to be presently adverted to, it was trunked and dipping boxes placed at different points on the line in the streets, for the convenience of the residents and their cattle. The expenses of the work were paid by the borough for that portion of the trunk which crossed streets and alleys, and by the lot-holders for the portion included within their limits. What title or interest the borough had to any part of this stream does not appear. From the terms of Rankin\u2019s grant as recited, he was to deliver the water to John Allison and his assignees for ever \u2014 which undoubtedly meant the grantees of lots from him. If it crossed streets and alleys laid out by him for public use, as is perhaps to be inferred, then undoubtedly the borough, rightfully invested with the care and oversight of the public highways, may be considered as one of his assignees to whom the benefit of this gr'ant extended. If then this is an artificial stream of water, each proprietor of land over which it passes, and the borough so far as the highway is concerned, has a right to the enjoyment of it in the course marked out for it, either by its original designation or by subsequent agreement, and is under the obligation to keep his portion of it in such a condition of repair that the usual amount shall be transmitted to the other proprietors below and in its usual state of purity. If he fails in this duty he is liable to an action by any or all of the proprietors below, including the borough, for damages: Washburn on Easements 293. Had the entire stream been granted or dedicated by John Allison to public use before making any grants, so that his grantees would have derived title, subject to such grant or dedication, then indeed a question like that so much debated in Hammett <em>v. </em>The City of Philadelphia might have arisen. But upon the meagre facts reported, the case seems to stand entirely clear of that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">The Act of Assembly of April 8th 1857, Pamph. L. 329, authorized the borough authorities of Greencastle to take upon themselves the supervision of the water and watercourse in question, to see that the proper quantity of water is at all times delivered by the heirs or assignees of William Rankin, deceased, according to the terms of the contract between him and John Allison, and to enforce the delivery of the same by 'Such suit or suits in their corporate name as may be necessary. If the borough was in law or fact an assignee of John Allison this provision was unnecessary; to the extent of the damage suffered by the streets it had such a right and such a remedy. But if it was intended to vest in the borough the right to recover all the damages suffered by all Allison\u2019s other assignees \u2014 grantees of lots \u2014 it surely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>needs no argument to prove that it was entirely beyond legislative power. They could not take away the rights of the grantees derived under the contract between Rankin and Allison, nor could they assign their rights to the borough without their assent. But the act went further, and authorized the authorities, or a majority of them, \u201c whenever they may deem the same necessary by themselves, their agents, engineers, officers and workmen, and with their tools, carts, wagons and horses, to enter upon any of the lands, lots, enclosures, streets, lanes, alleys or highways, along the original or present course of the said stream, for the purpose of examining the condition thereof, removing obstructions therefrom, repairing the bed or channel of the same, or preventing the wasting of the water therefrom or its appropriation to uses not designed originally.\u201d Be it remembered, that these provisions relate not to a public easement, but to a private watercourse, secured by grant and contract to private lotholders, and in which, if the borough had any pretence of right, it could only be as assignee and custodian of the streets over which it passed. The borough is invested not with the power to take the stream for public use upon making compensation to the owners, the only constitutional and legitimate mode of accomplishing the object, which may have been useful and laudable, but with all the powers incident to such taking with no provision for compensation. Nay, proceeding a Step further, the act provides \u201cthat the expenses incurred in repairing the said watercourse and keeping the same in good order shall be paid as follows, to wit: those incurred in the streets, lanes and alleys of the said borough, shall he paid out of the borough funds, and those incurred on private property shall be taxed by the said burgess and town council against the property through which the said stream passes, according to the amount expended upon each property, and shall be a lien thereon, and collected as other borough taxes are by law collected.\u201d Now this power would have been well enough, if it had been preceded by the necessary preliminary step of taking and appropriating this private watercourse to public use, and if it had appeared that the private owners of property through which the stream flows were specially benefited by such repairs and improvements. The last section of the act is conceived in the same spirit, for it declares \u201c that the burgess and town council aforesaid may by ordinance provide what fines and penalties shall be enforced against any person who shall wilfully or maliciously do any injury or damage to the said watercourse, or who shall obstruct the same, divert or use the water unlawfully, waste it or render it impure or unfit for use.\u201d It is very evident that the legislature must have been informed or believed that this watercourse had been dedicated by John Allison for the public use of the inhabitants of the borough. On this supposition only can such legislation be accounted for. All that we can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>Say is, that if such was the fact, it has not been made to appear to us by anything upon this record. This invasion of private rights and property seems to have been submitted to in 1857, but that is no reason why it should continue to be, or why this or any other court should countenance its enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
