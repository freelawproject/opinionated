The question was one of boundary between the plaintiff on the south and the defendants on the north; Kellum being on the western part of the boundary and Cowell on the eastern. The land of all the parties originally belonged to Elisha Cole. On the 15th of July 1813 he conveyed the part owned by the defendants to B. Coolbaugh, and on the 29th of April 1814 he conveyed the part owned by the plaintiff to Moses Warford. Some time before 1840 the defendants became the owners of Coolbaugh\u2019s title.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-6\">On the trial before Streeter, P.

On the 2d of April 1853 she brought an action of ejectment against each of the defendants, covering the land in dispute. On the 6th of April 1854 the suits were settled by an agreement, the material parts of which were: <em>\u201c </em>all controversy as to the land for which said suits were brought, and also as to the division line between the plaintiff and defendants, is settled and terminated by a line running from a black-walnut sapling at the end of the fence on the Susquehanna river, north 84|- degs. west, &amp;e., * * about 245 rods to the line of John Cole\u2019s heirs\u2019 land, as run by James A.

Such abandonment (if it took place) was a matter of fact, and not of law. The legal effect of the compromise of 1854 would have been to avoid the Morgan line of 1848, had there been no imposition in procuring it. But the very question in the cause was the invalidity of that compromise on the ground of fraud. If invalid, the parties were thrown back upon their former boundary, and then the question arose on the Morgan line. According to Cowell\u2019s testimony, he and Warford having a dispute about the boundary line between them, agreed that Judge Morgan should take the deeds and drafts and run and make the line between their lands, and that this should be final. The proof is clear that Morgan did run and establish a line. The compromise of their dispute, according to \u2019 numerous cases, was a good ground to support the line established under the compromise: Bowen <em>v. </em>Cooper, 7 Watts 311; Perkins <em>v. </em>Gay, 3 S. &amp; R. 327; Brower <em>v. </em>Osterhout, 7 W. &amp; S. 344; Brown <em>v. </em>Caldwell, 10 S. &amp; R. 114; Hagey <em>v. </em>Detweiler, 11 Casey 409. The boundary thus fixed was conclusive and unaffected, even if by parol, by the Statute of Frauds and Perjuries. A new dispute having arisen, and ejectments brought by Emma J. Smith, the settlement of this litigation in 1854 by the running of the line by James A. Paine would have had the same effect in establishing that line in lieu of Morgan\u2019s had this settlement been fair and not procured by imposition. But the avoiding of that settlement by fraud remitted the parties to their former boundary, wherever it was. The defendant had a right to have submitted to the jury the question whether that boundary was not the Morgan line. It was error, therefore, to assume that the Morgan line was abandoned, as that was purely a question of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">The judgment is therefore reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
