Russell, to recover money which it was alleged the plaintiff had received as treasurer of the plaintiffs, and which he declined to pay over.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b10-6\">The defendant pleaded the general issue, and also a special plea, in which he averred that the money claimed in the suit \u201c came into his hands at the time he was acting in the double capacity of treasurer for said plaintiff, and also as treasurer for the Second Presbyterian Church of the borough of Pottsville. That the said money belonged to the said the Second Presbyterian Church, and not to said plaintiff, and that this defendant has been notified and required to pay over said money to said last-mentioned corporation, and a bill in equity filed in this court to compel him to do so, and he believes it is his legal and moral duty to do so.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b10-7\">The cause was tried, April 18th 1869, at a special court, before Elwell, P.

He gave evidence also that the Second Church had received from the church extension committee a donation of $750; also that at a meeting of the trustees of the First Church the defendant, in presenting his account, said that he was morally bound to refund the $750, which was acquiesced in without any formal resolution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b11-11\">The defendant offered the charter of Second Presbyterian Church of Pottsville, granted 7th June 1859, to show that there was a church organization .and corporation of that name, and to show the nature of such corporation.

That the said First Presbyterian Church claims the funds in suit on the ground that all the real estate, including the church edifice of said Second Presbyterian Church, became the property of said' First Church, by virtue of said alleged merger and consolidation. That said fund is part of the proceeds of sale of said church edifice. That said Second Church has no assets or means for the payment of its debts, except the property claimed and appropriated by said First Church as aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b12-11\">\u201c That said Second Church is indebted to said Thomas M.

It would be contrary to the. terms of his contract, to sound policy and good faith, to allow the treasurer of a corporation of his own motion, to acknowledge adverse claims to funds in his hands, and thereby compel his principal, whose interest he ought by all means in his power to protect, to establish its title.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b13-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>\u201c He was not appointed to distribute tbe assets of tbe cburcb, but to receive both on trust and pay out upon orders drawn by the proper officers, and at tbe expiration of bis office to band over to bis successor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b13-6\">\u201c It appears by tbe testimony of W.

But it is admitted that before tbe institution of this suit tbe plaintiff demanded, by its attorney, tbe funds in tbe bands of tbe defendant, and there being no evidence of payment at any time of said sum, tbe plaintiff is entitled to recover tbe same in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b13-8\">\u201c Tbe right of tbe plaintiff to recover depending upon tbe written documents in evidence, and tbe facts shown by tbe defendant failing to establish a defence, we instruct you, that tbe plaintiff is entitled to recover tbe sum of $2000, less tbe sum of $443.91 paid out by defendant, with interest from tbe commencement of this suit.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b13-9\">Tbe jury found a verdict for tbe plaintiffs for $1597.84.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b13-10\">Tbe defendant took a writ of error, and assigned for error,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b13-11\">1.

They applied by petition to that effect on the day of the trial. But it would have been contrary to all our practice on the subject of interpleading to have permitted it. Though admitted as a party to the record, they would not thereby have been made parties to the issue, nor could the jury have been sworn as to them. J[The only personal action in which the right of interpleader existed at common law was detinue: 3 Reeves 449. It was applied to a few other cases, such as <em>quare impedit, </em>and writs of right of ward: 2 Story\u2019s Eq. Juris. 804. The defendant in detinue could plead that the chattel for which suit was brought was held by him as bailee or depositary ; that it was claimed by a third person in privity with the plaintiff, and that he was willing to deliver it to the party who was legally entitled to it. Thereupon a process of garnishment issued to compel such third person to appear and defend, or else disclaim his title. ^This practice has been adopted by the courts of this state, and extended to other forms of action. The want of a court of chancery rendered this necessary to prevent a failure of justice. For although a defendant might protect himself by giving notice of the suit to the claimant, and calling upon him to appear and take defence in his name, yet the latter not being a party' to the record, would not be concluded by the judgment without [proof of the notice. If that proof should fail the defendant would be remediless, and thus might be subjected to two judgments against him for the same cause of action by two different plaintiffs. Hence the practice was early introduced of compelling such third person to become a party by rule or scire facias founded on a suggestion of the defendants, and no doubt he would be admitted to appear and plead <em>gratis </em>without order or process on. such suggestion: Coates <em>v. </em>Roberts, 4 Rawle 109; Wallace <em>v. </em>Clingen, 9 Barr 51; Tritt <em>v. </em>Crotzer, 1 Harris 458; McMann <em>v. </em>Caruthers, 2 Am. L. Jour. 133. It is the defendant, however, who is to be protected. He must, in due time, make the suggestion, show that the claimant is in privity with the plaintiff, state his willingness to pay the money to the one found entitled to recover it, and pray for the substitution. \\ Taking the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>special plea filed in this case to have been intended as a suggestion, it was defective in all these respects. In fact, as it after-wards appeared, the .defendant had a defence personal to himself, which he attempted to set up to the claim of the Second Presbyterian Church. There was no error, therefore, certainly not at that stage of the proceedings, in refusing to allow the Second Presbyterian Church to intervene and become a party to the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b15-6\">The 2d error assigned is in the rej\u00e9ction of an offer made by the defendant. The evidence produced on the part of the plaintiffs showed that the defendant had been elected their treasurer October 7th 1867, followed by a receipt signed by him as such treasurer, acknowledging to have received from the borough of Pottsville $1000, it being the first payment for the Second Church property, and another receipt of a subsequent date, signed by defendant, but not as treasurer, for a further sum of $1000, and three bonds of the borough of Pottsville for $2000 each, being the balance of the purchase-money received for the sale of the Second Church property. This certainly made out a prim\u00e1 facie case for the plaintiffs. The defendant then offered the charter of the Second Church, to be followed by evidence that he was the treasurer of the Second Church at the date of the receipts, that the money for which the said receipts were given belonged to said church, that he had signed the said receipt first named as treasurer of the First Church under the mistake that a merger of the two churches was about to take place, but that such merger never was consummated, and the Second Church held him answerable to them for the money. This offer was rejected. In this we think there was error. Admitting that the signature to the first receipt was evidence, not only that the first but the second payment was made to the defendant, and received by him as treasurer of the First Church, it was prim\u00e1 facie only, certainly not conclusive. There was nothing to work an estoppel in favor of the First Church. They had done nothing on the faith of it. It did not preclude the defendant from showing that in truth he received the money as the treasurer of the Second Church, and. that he signed the receipt as treasurer of the plaintiffs under a mistake of fact, that he supposed that the Second Church was or would be merged in the First Church. A receipt is like any other parol admission by the party, open to contradiction, explanation or correction. It may be shown that it was given under a mistake, either of fact or law: Thompson <em>v. </em>Faussat, Peters\u2019s C. C. R. 172; Moore <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth, 8 Barr 260; Bell <em>v. </em>Bell, 2 Jones 235; Grue <em>v. </em>Kline, 1 Harris 60. It would certainly be very inequitable if, in consequence of such a mistake, the defendant should be compelled to pay the money twice, as the Second Church could not have been prevented by his receipt from recovering the money from him, if the facts stated in his offer were, as we must assume, true.\"I The learned judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>was right in rejecting the evidence contained in the 8d assignment of error. The treasurer of a corporation cannot set off a debt or independent claim when sued for the money in his hands. He received the funds to hold at the order of the corporation as their officer, and without such order he cannot pay or appropriate them either to himself or others. There is fairly to be implied, from the relation he sustains, an undertaking not to plead a set-off, but to account and pay over whatever money came to his hands in that character: Middletown and Harrisburg Turnpike Co. <em>v. </em>Watson, 1 Rawle 330; Henniss <em>v. </em>Page, 3 Whart. 275; Bank of the United States <em>v. </em>Macalester, 9 Barr 475; Reed <em>v. </em>Penrose\u2019s Ex\u2019rs., 12 Casey 214.</p>\n<p id=\"b16-8\">Judgment reversed, and <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
