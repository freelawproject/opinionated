Perkins made an assignment for the benefit of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>bis creditors to James O. Perkins. On the 18th of October, the Becks obtained judgment against H. J. Perkins for $1058.48, and on the same day issued a fi. fa., on which the property assigned was levied on. The assignee claimed the goods and on the application of the sheriff, a feigned issue was directed October 18th.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-6\">On the trial before Gamble, P.

That the Act of Congress, approved March 2d 1867, and known as the Bankrupt Law, as soon as it went into operation <em>ipso facto </em>suspended all action upon future cases arising under the insolvent laws of this state. That as the assignment in this case was made since the passage of said Act of Congress, and as H. J. Perkins, the assignor, is amenable to the provisions of said act, the assignment so made by him is void, and the verdict must be for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-10\">2.

Perkins to the plaintiff is of all his estate, real, personal and mixed, and as it states that he is unable to pay his debts, the Bankrupt law is directly applicable to to the said Perkins, and to his assets, and the said act renders said assignment absolutely void, and the verdict must be for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-11\">The court (Gamble P.

A voluntary assignment, by a debtor in failing circumstances, to a trustee, for the benefit of creditors, does not depend for its validity upon any statute, and the Acts of Assembly which have been passed to regulate it, which require it to be recorded, which compel the assignee to file an inventory and appraisement, and to give security, and which provide for the settlement of his accounts and the distribution of the assets, are no parts of the insolvent laws. The effect of such assignment is not to discharge the assignor from his debts, or to relieve him from liability to imprisonment, except incidentally under the act providing for the abolishment of imprisonment for debt. Where no preference is given \u2014 and none can he effectually given under our Act of April 17th 1843, Pamph. L. 273, except for the payment of wages of labor \u2014 such assignments secure the equal distribution of all the property of a debtor <em>pro rata </em>among his creditors, and are not contrary to the spirit of the Bankrupt Act. To hold them to be void in a contest with execution-creditors, would be to give preferences, instead of preventing them. The answers of the learned judge below to the defendants\u2019 points were therefore correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">The remaining assignments of error complain of the rejection of five several offers of evidence by the defendants, all of which, however, depend upon the same principle. It was proposed to prove that in pursuance of an understanding or promise before the assignment, the assignor had, after its date, fraudulently executed and antedated an agreement to deliver to one of his creditors certain articles of property, which had passed under the assignment, and had actually delivered them as a preference or security for his indebtedness. It was not offered to show that the assignee was any party to this fraud, and surely no acts of the assignor, after the assignment, can invalidate it, or afford any evidence from which fraud in fact can be legitimately inferred. When a conveyance is not fraudulent at the time of the making of it, it shall never be said to be fraudulent for any matter <em>ex post facto, </em>Shepp. Touchst. 67. The agreement and delivery proposed to be proved, were clearly of no avail to accomplish the object alleged to have been intended. These offers, therefore, were rightfully rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
