The suggestion was filed, December 8d 1869, by the Attorney-General, setting forth that the respondent was exercising the office of Recorder of the Mayor\u2019s Court of the city of Scranton, in the county of Luzerne, without lawful authority, and the writ was to show by what warrant he exercised the office. &gt;\u00a1</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-18\">The answer, admitting that the respondent exercised the office, set forth as follows: That he had been elected and duly commissioned, on the 21st of November 1861, president judge of the 11th Judicial District, composed of the county of Luzerne, for ten years, from the first Monday of December then next; that he then entered upon the duties of that office and has continued to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>exercise them since; and that the residents of Scranton, being citizens of Luzerne county, voted at the election for president judge in 1861; that by an Act of Assembly, passed April 23d 1866, the inhabitants of certain territorial limits in Luzerne county were constituted \u201c The City of Scranton,\u201d which in June following was duly organized, and has since continued to be a municipal corporation; that by the said act, a mayor\u2019s court was constituted, to be held by the mayor or recorder and aldermen of the city, for the trial of crimes, &amp;c., and it was provided that the recorder should preside at all jury trials; that certain civil jurisdiction was also conferred upon the court, and proceedings on the civil side might be conducted by the recorder alone; that it was further provided by the act that the president judge of the 11th Judicial District should be recorder of said city. The answer averred that at the time of the organization of the city of Scranton the respondent was president judge of the 11th Judicial District, and was duly sworn to fulfil the duties of recorder of that city, entered upon the office, and has since continued to perform its duties, and claims the right to perform them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-6\">The Commonwealth craved oyer of the Act of April 23d 1866, which was granted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-7\">(The material parts of the act will be found in C.

The causes of demurrer were:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-9\">1. Because the Act of April 23d 1866 is unconstitutional, being repugnant to that part of the 11th section of 5th Article of the Constitution of Pennsylvania, which provides that \u201c The judges of the Supreme Court, of the several Courts of Common Pleas, and of such other courts of record as are or shall be established by law, shall be elected by the qualified electors of the Commonwealth in the manner following, to wit: The judges of the Supreme Court by the qualified electors of the Commonwealth at large; the president judges of the several Courts of Common Pleas, and of such other courts of record as are or shall be established by law, and all other judges required to be learned in the law, by the qualified electors of the respective districts over which they are to preside or act as judges.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-10\">2.

By section 1, of the schedule of 1838, that \u201c all laws of this Commonwealth * * * shall continue as if said alterations and amendments had not been made,\u201d it was the intention of the convention to leave the appointing power in the governor, who at that period exercised under the Constitution of 1790, the right to fill such vacancies as might happen, in the several \u201cmayors\u2019 courts:\u201d Art. 2 Const. 1790, \u00a7 8; John <em>v. </em>Nicholls, 1 Yeates 182; The Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Collins, 8 Watts 335; Id. 340.

Judgment was entered for the Commonwealth on the demurrer.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b80-10\">The opinion of the court was delivered, October 20th 1870, by</p>\n<author id=\"b80-11\">Thompson, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqc\">The writ in this case was issued upon the relation of the attorney-general, to test the right of the respondent to exercise the office of the recorder of the Mayor\u2019s Court of the city of Scranton, in Luzerne county, under the provisions of an'act incorporating said city, passed the 23d of April 1866, and the supplement thereto, of the 30th of March 1867. At our sitting in July last, in the Eastern District, having heard the arguments in the case previously, we entered judgment on the issue made in favor of the Commonwealth, and consequently of <em>ouster </em>against the respondent, and reserved to the present time the announcement of our reasons for the judgment So entered, some of which we propose now briefly to state.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-12\">By the first of the above-mentioned acts, \u201cthe inhabitants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>embraced and residing within the territorial limits of the township of Providence, the borough of Scranton, the borough of Hyde Park, and the borough of Providence, in the county of Luzerne,\u201d is constituted a corporation, by the name and style of the \u201c City of Scranton,\u201d and divided into twelve wards. In addition to the usual powers conferred on such municipal corporations, a Mayor\u2019s Court, is established by this act, to be holden quarterly by the mayor, recorder and aldermen, or any three of them, the mayor or recorder being one, \u201c with full power,\u201d says the act, \u201c to hold and keep a <em>court of record </em>within said city, four times in each year, to continue one week each,\u201d and longer by adjournment, if necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">The criminal jurisdiction of this, court is, by the act, extended to \u201c all such offences committed or arising within the limits embraced by the city, as are triable in other Courts of Quarter Sessions in the Commonwealth,\u201d with the power to forfeit and issue process for the recovery of all recognisances forfeited therein, and \u201cgenerally,\u201d says the act, \u201cto do all such matters and things within the said city, as any Court of Quarter Sessions of the peace, of and for any county within this Commonwealth, may or can do within any such county.\u201d Thus there is established, within the city, a Court of Quarter Sessions of general jurisdiction, as fully and clearly as any other court is or can be established within any county of the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">In addition to this general criminal jurisdiction, it is provided in the 15th section of the act as follows-</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-8\">\u201c That the Mayor\u2019s Court for the city of Scranton shall have original civil jurisdiction to the same extent as is conferred by law upon the Court of Common Pleas of Luzerne county, in all cases where the defendant shall reside within the limits of said city, and also, of all amicable actions where the parties shall, by writing, institute the same in said county, and the remedies, processes, pleadings and costs, shall be similar to like proceedings in the Court of Common Pleas in said county. And the said Mayor\u2019s Court shall also have the same chancery powers and jurisdiction, within the said city, as is now by law invested in the Courts of Common Pleas, and shall also have the same power and jurisdiction within the said city, as is now conferred by law upon the Orphans\u2019 Court of' Luzerne county.\u201d Jurisdiction of divorce cases was afterwards conferred by the supplement to the act of incorporation. Power is also given to this court to issue writs of certiorari to judgments of the aldermen of said city, as other Courts of Common Pleas do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABI\">It possesses all the machinery and officers of other courts of record, viz.: a clerk, seal and records, and its judgments are revisable on appeal and writs of error from this court as are the judgments of other courts of general jurisdiction. It is, there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>fore, a court of record of general, civil and criminal jurisdiction within its territorial boundaries, beyond a question, and is so expressly declared. Even without this express declaration, it would, from its constitution and powers, be a court of record. Furthermore, the 19th section of the act provides for the removal of all actions, prosecutions and appeals, at the election of the parties, or either of them, from the judgments of justices of the peace pending in the Common Pleas and Quarter Sessions of Luzerne county, having arisen within the limits of the city of Scranton, into the Mayor\u2019s Court for determination and the arbitration laws of the Commonwealth are extended to said court. These facts illustrate most clearly what we have already said, that the court in question is a court of record, of general jurisdiction, as well as a municipal court, and it follows that its judges are required by the Constitution of the Commonwealth, to be elected by the qualified electors included in the boundaries of the city, and cannot be designated and appointed by an- act of the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The respondent claimed to hold and exercise the office of recorder of the Mayor\u2019s Court thus established, under and by virtue of the 80th section of <em>the act, </em>which provides \u201cthat the president judge of the 11th Judicial District of the Commonwealth, or of that district of which the county of Luzerne shall form a part, shall be the recorder of the said city,\u201d and shall receive an annual salary of $500 for his services, payable one-half by the state and the other half by the city. This is the commission relied upon as the authority for exercising the office of recorder of the city by the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">We have shown that the Mayor\u2019s Court is not only a municipal court, but a court of general civil and criminal jurisdiction \u2014 is in fact a court of an independent judicial district. Now, in such a case, the Constitution expresses itself in no ambiguous terms. It says in sect. 2, art. 6 (Amendment of 1850):\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-8\">\u201c The judges of the Supreme Court, of the several Courts of Common Pleas, and of such other courts of record as are or shall be established by law, shall be elected by the qualified electors of the Commonwealth in the manner following, to wit, the judges of the Supreme Court by the qualified electors of the Commonwealth at large; the president judges of the several Courts of Common Pleas, and of such other courts of record as are or shall be established by law, and all other judges required to be learned in the law, by the qualified electors of the respective districts over which they are to preside or <em>to actas judges.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">Here is a distinct mandate of the Constitution, requiring the election of the recorder of this court by the people of the district or city, and whatever the Constitution enjoins to be done, in a particular way, amounts to a prohibition of all other modes and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>methods of doing the same thing: Page <em>v. </em>Allen, 8 P; F. Smith 388. We have shown this Mayor\u2019s Court of Scranton to be a court of record, not only from its nature and necessary inherent powers in view of its jurisdiction, but the express words of the act creating it. The Constitution requires the judges of \u201c such courts of record as are or shall be established by law, and all other judges required to be learned in. the law, to be elected by the qualified electors of the respective districts over which they are to preside or to act as judges.\u201d That the recorder is a judge, all text-writers who speak of the office affirm. The reference in the argument of the Attorney-General clearly establishes this. In 1 Bac. Abr. 657, it is said that in the Court of Hustings, at Guild Hall, before the lord mayor and sheriffs, \u201c when any matter is to be argued and determined, the recorder sits as a judge, with the mayor and sheriffs, and gives rules and judgments therein.\u201d In Respub. <em>v. </em>Dallas, 3 Yeates 300, Shippen, C. J., said: \u201cIn the strict legal sense of the word, the recorder is a judge; he is a justice of the peace, and he is a constituent and principal member of a court of record.\u201d In a constitutional view, the name is nothing. If it be the recorder\u2019s duty to act as a judge of a court, as it certainly is, under this act of incorporation, the Constitution requires that he be elected by the qualified citizens over whom he is to be the judge. In this state the recorders of the mayors\u2019 courts have always been appointed from persons learned in the law, and have ever been recognised as judges, with fixed salaries and specified terms of office. The act in question, by indirection, recognises this as a necessary qualification. No one can be recorder, by its terms, who is not- the president judge of the Court of Common Pleas of the judicial district, for the time being, in which the county of Luzerne shall be. As such president judge-is required by the Constitution to be learned in the law, it follows, that the recorder\u2019s office being filled by that incumbent, he will be learned in the law also.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Whether, therefore, we regard this Mayor\u2019s Court as within the constitutional category of \u201csuch other courts of record as shall be established by law,\u201d or that the recorder is to be regarded as a judge, or that he is required to be learned in the law, in either and all of these contingencies he, by the Constitution, must be elected. These requisites all co-exist in the constitution of this court. The provision, therefore, to confer the office of recorder upon the respondent, directly by Act of Assembly, was a clear violation of the constitutional mandate for an election. He could only fill that office by the choice of the people of the city at the polls. Nor would he have been eligible by election to have filled the office, holding, as he did, the office of president judge of the Common Pleas of Luzerne county. Section 2 of art. 5 of the Constitution prohibits judges holding \u201c any other office of profit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>under the Commonwealth\u201d during their continuance in office, and we have seen that a salary is attached to the office of recorder in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">But it was contended in argument that the respondent, having been elected president judge of the Common Pleas of Luzerne county, by the electors of the territory embraced by the city of Scranton, in common with the other portions of the county, he was therefore an elected recorder in the sense of the Constitution. This argument concedes the necessity of an election. But how, by one election, he could hold two distinct and independent offices, such as president judge of the Common Pleas and recorder of the Mayor\u2019s Court, is not so clear. We think the position totally inadmissible in its application to the question in hand, and needs no argument to refute it. By such a process every township in the county might be included in mayors\u2019 courts, and the judicial business, diverted from its legal centre, come to be administered in isolated portions of the county. We should not fully protect and conserve the Constitution of our Commonwealth, as we are bound to do, were we capable of yielding to such suggestions. Nor ought we to be deterred from giving full scope to every of its provisions by appeals to consequences arising from its misinterpretation and consequent violation. Were such considerations to prevail, the instrument in time would disappear altogether by attrition of repeated encroachments, and its very existence become traditionary. But we by no means concede the consequences anticipated and deprecated in the argument of the respondent\u2019s counsel. What they may be, is not before us. It is time enough to treat of them when they come before us. In nothing said in this opinion, is it in the least intended to refect on the learned and able president of the Common Pleas, who acted as recorder of the Mayor\u2019s Court of Scranton. That he was mistaken in assuming the discharge- of those duties, we believe, but we fully accord to him the utmost conscientiousness in so doing. Thus have we given some of the reasons inducing the entry of judgment in this case in July last; more might be added, but we regard further elaboration unnecessary. We felt ourselves constrained to decide that the respondent was not legally the recorder of the Mayor\u2019s Court of the city of Scranton, and entered judgment accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
