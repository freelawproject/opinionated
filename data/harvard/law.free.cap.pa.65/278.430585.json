None of the mortgages mentioned the 14 acre tract specifically. On the same day (March 31st 1857), the company executed to Longstreth and Maynard as trustees a mortgage of all their loco motive engines, cars and other movable stock described in a schedule attached to the mortgage, to secure $500,000 of bonds mentioned in the mortgage. This mortgage was called the \u201cchattel mortgage.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-7\">On the 17th of September 1859, Clarence H. Clark, a holder of bonds of the Williamsport and Elmira Railroad Company, secured by all the above-mentioned mortgages, as well for himself as others holding similar bonds, filed a bill in the Supreme Court against the Williamsport and Elmira Railroad Company, Charles M. Rockwell, trustee, William E. Lewis, trustee, William D. Longstreth and John W. Maynard, trustees, and Thomas Kimber and William E. Lewis.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-8\">The bill set out amongst other things, the ownership by the company of property both in Pennsylvania and New York, the execution of the several mortgages above mentioned, that all the bonds secured by them were outstanding, and that a large amount of interest was due on the bonds; that the company was heavily indebted for materials, labor and for floating liabilities to the amount of $350,000, which were secured by negotiable paper guaranteed by the president and directors of the company; that Kirnber and Lewis and other directors had individually and without consideration become liable for large sums of money procured for the company and lent to the company; that Kirnber and Lewis, &amp;c., claimed that in equity they should be refunded from the earnings of the company; that the holders of the floating debt and coupons had brought suit on their claims, and that the property of the company would be sold under judgments on these claims, and the security of the bondholders would be lessened; that the rights of the parties had not been settled, and will re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>quire for their adjustment the equitable interference of the court; that the circumstances will involve separate and independent litigation to the injury of the trust property; that the company is insolvent, and the property is in such condition that the rights of the parties should be defined before a sale of it; that the property in both states should be sold entire; and that there was danger that the persons employed on the road would leave the road and prevent its use, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-6\">The prayers were that the rights of all the parties might be defined and declared ; that the mortgaged premises might be sold as the court should direct; that a receiver be appointed. After filing the bill, Townsend Whelen was appointed trustee in the place of Judge Maynard. Rockwell and Whelen, trustees, filed an answer, declaring their belief that it would be for the benefit of all in interest that the property in Pennsylvania and New York should be sold entire, and prayed that no decree might be made which would prevent them from making sale of the mortgaged premises, but that the court would make an order authorizing a sale by them. Answers were filed by the other defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-7\">On the 29th of February 1860 the Supreme Court decreed that by reason of default in the company, the bonds secured by 1st and 2d mortgages had become due; that those mortgages were respectively the first and second liens on all the railroad constructed at their date, and which had afterwards been constructed on all railways, &amp;c., privileges, &amp;c., and all real property then belonging to the company or afterwards acquired; and declared the amount due on each of the mortgages. It was further decreed that the third mortgage was the third lien on the premises before described, and that all the property mentioned in the second and third mortgages is included in that mortgage, and that the property described in the chattel-mortgage is not included in either of the other three mortgages. The court further decreed that the trustees of the three mortgages sell at public sale, at the Philadelphia Exchange, on day of 1860, all the property and franchises mentioned in those mortgages, and all the said property should be put up and sold as one property, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-9\">The court further decreed that the proceeds of sale should be applied, first, to the payment of the bonds, &amp;c., secured by the first mortgage; then, if there were any excess, to the payment of the bonds, &amp;c., secured by the second mortgage, and any balance remaining to be applied to the bonds, &amp;c., secured by the third mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-10\">In the advertisements the 14-acre tract was described and designated as No. 1.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-11\">On the 12th of March 1860, a law was passed reciting the foregoing proceedings, and that \u201c all parties interested in the said company as stockholders and bondholders, or a large majority of them, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>have agreed upon an amicable settlement of their differences, and require the authority of law to carry the same into effectand enacting that in case the property, franchises, &amp;c., ofcthe company should he exposed to sale under the proceedings, the agent of the holders of more than, one-half of the bonds might purchase the whole property, and if the agent should purchase he should, on confirmation of the sale, &amp;c., have all the rights, franchises and appertenances of the company, for the use of the first mortgage bondholders who should by writing authorize him to act for them; that if William D..Lewis and others named, should within thirty days after the delivery of the deed, if that should be after the passage of the act, agree to accept its provisions, they should be a corporation under the name of \u201c The Elmira and Williamsport Railroad Company,\u201d and on the formation of the corporation, the said agent should convey to it all the property and franchises purchased by him for the price of $1,000,000, and the corporation should be vested with all the rights, franchises, &amp;c., of The Williamsport and Elmira Railroad Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-5\">On the 20th of April 1860, the trustees jointly returned that they had, on the 18th of April, sold all the mortgaged property which included specifically the 14 acre tract, to Edward S.

The title of the premises, it is agreed, was in Willard prior to August 2d 1856. On that day he conveyed to the Williamsport and Elmira Railroad Company. On the 31st of March 1857, this company executed a mortgage to trustees to secure certain bonds to be issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">On the 28th April 1860, these trustees united with the trustees under two prior mortgages, in a conveyance to Edward S. Whelen, who by deed dated May 11th 1860, conveyed to the Elmira and Williamsport Railroad Company, the plaintiff below.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">The defendant\u2019s title was grounded on a judgment recovered by John Jones against the Williamsport and Elmira Railroad Company, in the District Court for the city and county of Philadelphia, a testatum fieri facias issued thereon, and entered on the docket of Lycoming county January 16th 1860.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">The lien, therefore, upon which his title vested, and to which it must relate, was subsequent to the date of the mortgage of 1857.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-11\">Whether the sale made by the trustees under the mortgage was pursuant to the powers contained in that instrument, so as to bar and extinguish the equity of redemption of the mortgagor, is a question which does not arise on this record. The conveyance to Whelen was at least effectual as an assignment of the mortgage, and he and his assigns from that time stood in the shoes of the original mortgagees: 1 Washburne on Real Property 519. That a mortgagee or his assignee may maintain ejectment and recover possession of the mortgaged property before the condition is broken, unless there is a stipulation in the instrument to the contrary, is too well settled in this state to be any longer a subject of question: Lessee of Simpson <em>v. </em>Ammon, 1 Binn. 175; Smith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number><em>v. </em>Shuler, 12 S. &amp; R. 240; Knaub <em>v. </em>Esseck, 2 Watts 282; Martin <em>v. </em>Jackson, 3 Casey 504. The provision made in the mortgage of 1857, oh the subject of possession, plainly excludes the premises claimed' in this ejectment. The language is, \u201csubject nevertheless until default shall have occurred as hereinafter mentioned to the possession and use of the said party of the first part, their successors and assigns, and their president, managers, officers and agents, on the road of the said company, or on any other road, subject to this mortgage, according to the effect and meaning of the several acts and supplementary acts of the legislature, incorporating or concerning the said party of the first part.\u201d Now the contention of the plaintiffs in error must be and has been that the premises in dispute form no part of the road, else their title by the sheriff\u2019s sale under the testatum fails altogether. The road with all its appertenances being necessary to the exercise of the franchises granted by the sale, could not be levied on and sold under an execution on a judgment against the corporation: Ammant <em>v. </em>The New Alexandria and Pittsburg Turnpike Road, 13 S. &amp; R. 210; The Susquehanna Canal Co. <em>v. </em>Bonham, 9 W. &amp; S. 29; Shamokin Valley Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Livermore, 11 Wright 465. The lot in question then being no part of the road is left unaffected by this provision, and the right of the mortgagee to enforce his legal title by an ejectment remains as at common law. The plaintiffs in error having succeeded to the rights of the mortgagors, could doubtless have set up any equity in them to defeat the recovery. They could have shown that no bonds had been issued for the security of which the mortgage had been given, or that if issued they had been fully paid and satisfied; but then the onus was upon them to make this out, otherwise the primfi facie legal title of the assignees of the mortgage must succeed.1 Nothing of the sort was attempted or pretended.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">But it is contended that the mortgage of 1857 was extinguished by the decree of this court in equity, January Term 1860, No. 6, and the sale made under it, though at the same time it is most strenuously maintained that the court had no jurisdiction of that cash, and that the decree being <em>coram non judioe </em>was therefore a nullity. The plaintiffs in error are on the horns of a dilemma. If the court had jurisdiction, then the decree, however erroneous in law or in fact, was conclusive, and a valid title passed in pursuance of the sale made by the trustees under it; if the court had no jurisdiction, then its decree was a nullity, and the rights and titles of the parties remain as though it liad never been made. If a mortgagee were to proceed by scire facias in a court having no jurisdiction, the purchaser under such proceedings having in good faith paid his money, would be entitled in equity to be subrogated to the mortgage. It clearly would not be extin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>guished by a void proceeding. We have no question in this case of equitable subrogation; for there is a legal conveyance of the land, which in law is an assignment of the mortgage, duly executed by the mortgagees themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"AxN\">Here the cause might well be rested. This view concedes that the court had no jurisdiction of the bill in equity so as to decree a sale which would extinguish the mortgage of 1857 and the equity of redemption of the mortgagors. It is by no means clear, however, that this is so under the principles of the case of Bradley <em>v. </em>The Chester Valley Railroad Co., 12 Casey 141. It is there admitted, that if the mortgage create a trust and provide that the power of sale is to be executed by the trustee in certain contingencies, he may be controlled, restrained and directed by a court of equity at the suit of a party standing in the relation of a cestui que trust. Now it was for the court to decide whether the contingency had happened which gave them jurisdiction, and that decision could not be impeached collaterally, either by the parties, or those who, not being necessary parties, were bound by the decree. In this category was John Jones, the judgment creditor. He had no encumbrance on the property until after the commencement of the proceedings in this court. It is perfectly well settled, that encumbrancers who become such <em>pendente lite, </em>are not necessary parties to a bill to foreclose, although they are bound by the decree, for they can claim nothing except what belonged to the person under whom they assert title, since they have constructive notice; and there would be no end of such suits, if a mortgagor might by new encumbrances, created <em>pendente lite, </em>require all such encumbrancers to be made parties: Story\u2019s Eq. Pleadings, \u00a7 194; 1 Washburne on Real Property 593; Bishop of Winchester <em>v. </em>Paine, 11 Vesey 194, 197; Garth <em>v. </em>Ward, 2 Atk. 174; Adams <em>v. </em>Paynter, 1 Coll. 532. The vendee of the sheriff by deed acknowledged December 2d 1864, long subsequent to the decree, was of course bound by it if the judgment creditor was. But even if this were not so, the Act of Assembly of March 12th 1860, Pamph. L. 682, cures the defect. It would surely have been competent for the legislature to have authorized a sale by the trustees, even if the contingencies had not occurred. Nobody would have had any right to object but mortgagors and the cestuis que trust, the bondholders. They were parties consenting, as the act recites; at least we hear of none who dissented. They raised no voice against the sale. The legislature then ratified the jurisdiction of the court, authorized the attorney of the first mortgage bonds to become the purchaser at the sale, and to convey the title so acquired to the new company incorporated by the act under the name of the Elmira and Williamsport Railroad Company, the plaintiffs below in this eject<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>ment. We think, therefore, that the instruction of the learned judge below to the jury to render a verdict for the plaintiffs was right. Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
