J. There was evidence that Vanarsdale had stated to different persons that the plaintiff had whipped a son of John Pretz severely, and had Beaten his head against the floor, &amp;c. The plaintiff was examined, and gave evidence to sustain his case. He stated that there was no truth in Vanarsdale\u2019s statement that he had abused Pretz\u2019s son, and gave his account of a difficulty that there been between young Pretz and another boy in the school. The defendants called John Siever, a scholar, and proposed to ask him to tell about the transaction as to the difficulty with Pretz\u2019s son, as described by the plaintiff, for the purpose of contradicting him. Plaintiff objected to the offer, it was admitted and a bill of exceptions sealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b508-7\">The witness testified that he and the plaintiff\u2019s son had been out of school together during recess; that the son committed some offence; that the witness told the plaintiff that it was not he, witness, that did .it; that the plaintiff would not listen to him, but commenced kicking him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b508-8\">Much testimony was given on both sides.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b508-9\">The plaintiff\u2019s 1st and 3d points and their answers were:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b508-10\">1. To make a conspiracy does not require any actual meeting together for a common purpose; but if the parties charged, each separately contributed to a common purpose, and the object of that purpose is to injure one person improperly and without sufficient grounds, it is in law a conspiracy, and if the jury believe that the defendants are guilty in any of them of thus uniting with each other, the plaintiff is entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b508-11\">Answer: \u201c The law is correctly stated in this point, except that the evidence must satisfy you that two or more of the defendants contributed to the common purpose mentioned in this point. You cannot find one defendant alone guilty of a conspiracy. It requires two or more to join in a common purpose to injure another improperly and influenced by improper motives.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b508-12\">3. If any one of these defendants was actuated by a private and malicious feeling influencing his own action, and he induced others to give him their countenance and aid, to the injury of the plaintiff, the party so acting is liable, and the plaintiff may recover as against him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>Answer: \u201cWe cannot instruct you as requested in this point. There can be no recovery against one only. To justify a verdict for the plaintiff, the evidence must satisfy you that two or more of the defendants joined in the enterprise through feelings of animosity, hatred, ill will, or revenge for a real or supposed injury. If they acted through proper motives there can be no recovery.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-6\">In his general charge Judge Graham said:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-7\">\u201c To constitute a conspiracy in this case, it is necessary that the defendants, or two or more of them, should have been influenced and prompted by malice, envy, hatred or revenge to injure, harass or aggrieve the plaintiff; but if their actions were not induced by improper and malicious motives, there can be no recovery.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-8\">The verdict was for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-9\">The plaintiff took out a writ of error, and assigned for error the admission of Siever\u2019s testimony; the answers to his points, and the part of the charge given above.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b509-10\"><em>J. </em>Hays, <em>W.

The damage sustained by the plaintiff is the ground of the action, not the conspiracy. \u201c Where the action is brought against two or more, as concerned in the wrong done, it is necessary, in order to recover against all of them, to prove a combination or joint act of all. For this purpose it may be important to establish the allegation of a conspiracy. But if it turn out on the trial that only one was concerned, the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>may still recover, <em>the </em>same as if such one had been sued alone. The conspiracy or combination is nothing, so far as sustaining the action goes, the foundation of it being the actual damage done to the party:\u201d Hutchins <em>v. </em>Hutchins, 7 Hill 104; Jones <em>v. </em>Baker, 7 Cowen 445; Parker <em>v. </em>Huntington, 2 Gray 124.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">The court was therefore. clearly in error in saying there could be no recovery against one only.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">There was also error in the admission of the evidence mentioned in the 2d assignment of errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">Judgment reversed, and <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
