The first and fifth clauses of the will were as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-15\">\u201c First. I hereby constitute and appoint my wife, Rebecca W. Cleverly, to be my sole executrix of this my last will, hereby requesting that my executrix may be exempted from giving a surety or sureties on her bond, and directing my said executrix to pay all my just debts and funeral expenses and the legacies \u25a0hereinafter given out of my estate.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-16\">\u201c Fifth.

In the first clause of the will the testator \u201c appoints \u201d his wife, Rebecca W. Cleverly, sole executrix, requests that she may be exempt from giving sureties upon her bond, and directs her to pay debts, funeral expenses and the legacies thereinafter named. In the three following clauses he makes certain specific bequests, and in the fifth clause he gives and devises to his \u201c said executrix \u201d all the rest and residue of his property, both real and personal, \u201c for her sole use and benefit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">It seems too plain for discussion that the \u201csaid executrix\u201d named in the fifth clause is the' person \u201c appointed \u201d sole executrix in the first clause, and that the words \u201c for her sole use and benefit\u201d were not intended to cut down the legal effect of the preceding words, but were intended to emphasize his intention that she should have the full benefit of the property given, which included personal as well as real estate, and that the whole effect was to give the property absolutely and in fee to the devisee.
