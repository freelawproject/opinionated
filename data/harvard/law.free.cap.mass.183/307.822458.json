The judge ruled that a right of way to Nut Island existed, and that the petitioner was entitled to the larger amount with interest from the date of the verdict. He directed a verdict accordingly, and reported the case upon agreed facts and the findings of the jury for determination by this court. If the ruling was correct, judgment was to be entered on the verdict for the larger sum ; otherwise, for the smaller sum, with interest in either case from June 18, 1902.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b332-3\"><em>II.

The proceedizzgs therefore were not beyond the jurisdiction of the town, and the way appears to have been legally established. <em>Storer </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>6 Mass. 435, 439. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Charlestown, </em>1 Pick. 180, 182. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roxbury, </em>9 Gray, 451, 483, 491, and the authorities cited in the reporter\u2019s note, p. 503, <em>ad finem. </em>See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Weiher, </em>3 Met. 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">That way still exists in law, notwithstanding the fact that partly by the artificial removal of gravel and partly by the great storm of 1851, the surface of the land over which the way was laid out has been lowered so that since 1851 it has been below high water mai-k. See authorities cited in Gould on Waters, \u00a7\u00a7 158, 159. See also <em>Hopkins Academy </em>v. <em>Dickinson, </em>9 Cush, 544. <em>Macdonald </em>v. <em>Morrill, </em>154 Mass. 270. The result is that the ruling that there was a way from the island to the mainland was correct. The conclusion to which we have come upon this part of the case makes it unnecessary to consider the other grounds upon which it was claimed by the plaintiff that there was a way.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict for the larger sum.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
