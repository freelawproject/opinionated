High (\"High\"), appeals his convictions, resulting from a drive-by shooting in the city of Cleveland.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In March 2017, High was charged in a nineteen-count indictment. He was charged with participating in a criminal gang; improper discharge into a habitation; six counts of attempted murder; eight counts of felonious assault; two counts of discharging a firearm on or near prohibited premises; and improper handling firearms in a motor vehicle. Thirteen of the counts carried a criminal gang specification and seventeen of the counts carried multi-year firearm specifications with the \"drive-by shooting\" enhancement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On the day of trial, High waived his right to a jury and the matter proceeded before the bench. The following evidence was adduced at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On October 4, 2016, at approximately 10:30 p.m., P.J.D. was sitting outside on the front stairs of her Cleveland home with her three-year-old daughter, S.D., and P.J.D.'s eighteen-year-old sister, W.D. As they were outside, she observed two teenage males run across her front yard. P.J.D. testified that the males were searching through a purse they stole from an unknown female. As she told the teenagers that they need to leave her property, a four-door vehicle pulled up in front of her home. The driver's side of the vehicle faced her home. A black male in the rear driver's side seat started shooting a gun from his window. P.J.D. testified the gunman was trying to shoot at the two teenagers. When P.J.D. got back inside the house, she realized that S.D. was shot. P.J.D.'s grandmother was on the phone\n   with 911 while P.J.D. performed CPR on S.D. S.D. bled from the back of her head and was gasping for air. P.J.D. testified that the bullet went from the back to the front of S.D.'s head. EMS arrived and rushed S.D. to the hospital where she had emergency surgery and placed on life support. S.D. has required over 20 brain surgeries since the incident. At the time of trial, P.J.D. testified that S.D. has been in the hospital since the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} P.J.D.'s nine-year-old sister, E.D., while sitting in the living room, was also shot during this incident. P.J.D. testified that the bullet left a hole in E.D.'s lower back by her spine. E.D. was also taken to the hospital and required surgery to remove the bullet from her lower back.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Cleveland Police Detective Robert Beveridge (\"Detective Beveridge\") investigated the matter. Detective Beveridge obtained surveillance footage from a neighbor's house, which showed two vehicles driving toward P.J.D.'s house at the time of the shooting. One of the vehicles pictured in the surveillance footage was a Honda Accord, which was later determined to be stolen from Avon Lake, Ohio. The other vehicle was a white jaguar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The Honda Accord was recovered by Lakewood police on October 11, 2016. Upon recovery, Avon Lake Police Detective Justin Ludwig (\"Detective Ludwig\") processed the vehicle for forensic and physical evidence. Detective Ludwig recovered an android cell phone and a 9 mm bullet from the Honda Accord. The subscriber name associated with the android phone was \"Jay Doe,\" which is High's nickname. Detective Ludwig later learned from the owner of the Honda Accord that a different cell phone saved as \"Jaydoe's iPhone\" was synced to the car's Bluetooth function.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Codefendant, D.W., testified that he was friends with High and codefendant, J.J. On October 4, 2016, High, D.W., and J.J. drove around the westside of Cleveland in a Honda Accord that D.W. stole around October 3, 2016. D.W. was driving the vehicle, High was the front seat passenger, and J.J. was in the backseat. J.J. wanted to drive around the Denison Avenue area because he was looking for someone named \"Bo-Bo.\" D.W. testified that High, J.J., and himself were members of the \"Detroit Taking Over\" or \"DTO\" gang. DTO had a rivalry with a gang from Denison. D.W. testified there were multiple shootings between DTO and Denison members. D.W. further testified that J.J. kept saying \"let's go\" look for rival gang members, and he and High \"agreed to it after that.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Accompanying the Honda was a white Jaguar. B.Y., who is a also a member of DTO, was the driver of the white Jaguar and had three other males in the car with him. D.W. testified that both vehicles pulled into a gas station. D.W. initially testified that while at the gas station, J.J. got out of the Honda, walked over to the Jaguar, and began talking to B.Y. B.Y. then gave J.J. a gun. D.W. later testified, however, that he was mistaken and that B.Y. gave him the 9 mm handgun, which he placed in the middle of the vehicle. They then drove the two vehicles into Denison territory so that they could fight the \"dudes from Denison.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Eventually, both the Honda Accord and the Jaguar drove to the area of West 73rd and Dudley Avenue. D.W. was following B.Y. at the time. As D.W. was driving, J.J. said \"[t]here he go.\" J.J. was referring to \"Bo-Bo and them.\" D.W. then slammed on the brakes and J.J., who was in the back seat, grabbed the gun from between the driver and front passenger seat. D.W. acknowledged that he previously told law enforcement and testified in juvenile court that High passed the gun to\n   J.J. At High's trial, he testified that High did not pass J.J. the gun. D.W. testified that J.J. then started shooting towards the residence at 7316 Dudley Avenue. D.W. drove away after J.J. fired the gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} B.Y. testified that he is friends with J.J., D.W., and High. B.Y. testified that he was with J.J., D.W., and High on October 4, 2016. He was driving a Jaguar and D.W. was driving a Honda Accord. On that day, B.Y. was carrying a beige and black 9 mm handgun with a red beam and flashlight attached. B.Y. testified that he gave the gun to High prior to the shooting. B.Y. further testified that he gave High the gun because High had a \"little beef\" with Denison members and High knew Denison members \"don't fight. They shoot.\" B.Y. testified that the Denison members have shot at him before, along with J.J., and their friend, Deondre Arnold (\"Dre\"). When they approached the area of Dudley Avenue and West 73rd, the Honda Accord was following his vehicle. As he approached the street corner, he heard gun shots and thought somebody was shooting at his vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 12} The state presented evidence linking High to B.Y.'s 9 mm handgun. Detective Beveridge testified that High sent a private Facebook message to \"LOH Keese\" on October 15, 2016, with a photograph of a gun that was \"very similar\" to B.Y.'s 9 mm. B.Y. also identified his 9 mm handgun in a photograph of a firearm from High's Facebook page. In a photograph of High and D.W., B.Y. identified his 9 mm handgun, which High was displaying.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 13} The state also presented evidence on the DTO gang. Detective Beveridge testified to High's involvement in the DTO and the Heartless Felon criminal gangs. Detective Beveridge further testified that DTO's rival gang is the Denison Boys, also known as \"So Paid Entertainment\" or \"SPE.\" According to Detective Beveridge, there have been several shootings between members of the Denison Boys and DTO. One specific shooting involved Dre and Bo-Bo. Bo-Bo is believed to have shot Dre. In a September 9, 2016 private Facebook conversation between J.J. and High, they discussed \"going to war\" with Denison members. J.J. states to High \"we blowing Denison up you geeked me and Quano just went to war.\" High responded, \"[t]onight we trying to get armor dude\" and then sends J.J. a photograph of a large rifle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Detective Beveridge testified that High, B.Y., and J.J. were involved in a \"shoot-out\" with the Denison Boys on November 3, 2016, which was one month after the incident on Dudley Avenue. Detective Beveridge testified that High, J.J., B.Y., and another friend were in Denison territory near West 99th and Denison when the \"shoot-out\" occurred. B.Y. was shot at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Detective Beveridge further testified about a private Facebook conversation on November 3, 2016. In the conversation, High was told that B.Y. was in the hospital after being shot. High sent a message later that day to B.Y.'s account that it was \"SPE\" who shot B.Y. High knew \"for sure I seen them[,] I never ran.\" High and Antonio Diggs, a DTO member, also discussed the November 3rd \"shoot-out.\" High messaged Diggs \"[f]or sure SPE gotta die.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 16} The state also introduced several jail calls made by High as evidence at trial. In one jail call, High requested B.Y. fill out an affidavit and withdraw his previous statement to law enforcement. In another jail call, High asked an unknown party to deactivate his Facebook account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 17} At the conclusion of the bench trial, the court found High guilty of all counts and specifications. The trial court\n   sentenced High to an aggregate of 18 years in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 18} High now appeals, raising the following two assignments of error for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Assignment of Error One\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   [High's] convictions were based upon insufficient evidence to sustain the convictions. The trial court erred by denying [High's] Crim.R. 29 motion on all counts when the state failed to prove with sufficient evidence that [High] aided and abetted the offenses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Assignment of Error Two\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [High's] convictions were against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Sufficiency of the Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 19} In the first assignment of error, High argues the state failed to produce sufficient evidence that he aided and abetted in the charged offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 20} In\n   <em>\n    State v.

The Crips returned fire. No one was injured in the exchange. After this second exchange of gunfire, Johnson, McGaha, and other associates discussed how they were going to go after Boom for his involvement in the shooting.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 797-798.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Johnson was a passenger in a caravan of three vehicles filled with Crips members that drove to Bloods' territory. Johnson sat in the backseat of a stolen car. The front seat passenger had a .45 automatic handgun. They were looking for Boom and planned to shoot him if they found him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 798.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 27} The stolen car pulled up to an apartment complex that Boom was known to frequent. Three individuals were on the back porch of the apartment complex and individuals were inside the apartment. The passenger sitting next to Johnson asked \"where is Boom?\" One individual replied, \"he don't live here.\" The passenger said, \"well, tell Boom this\" and opened fire. Three individuals were wounded and a three-year-old child was killed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Johnson argued that since no witness pinpointed a specific statement by him of his intent to join the plan to kill Boom, there was insufficient evidence to support a conviction for complicity based on aiding and abetting.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 801. The Ohio Supreme Court disagreed, stating that Johnson's position \"defies not only the law but common sense.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 29} The court found that Johnson was more than a mere bystander-he intended to assist with the murder of Boom.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 800. Johnson was a member of the Crips gang involved in three separate gang-related shootings in a 24-hour period. The court stated, Johnson \"went along on that fateful night as protection and support for his fellow gang members who had recently been 'disrespected.' He also had his own reason for revenge, as he himself had been shot at earlier that day.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Johnson rode around town in areas known to be frequented by rival Bloods gang members for over an hour looking for Boom.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court emphasized that Johnson could have abandoned the plan to kill Boom at several points throughout the day, but instead chose to continue on with the three-car caravan in search of Boom.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Similarly, in the instant case, High argues there was no testimony or evidence that he incited, advised, encouraged, or shared in J.J.'s criminal intent and that he was an innocent bystander. A review of the record, however, reveals sufficient\n   evidence to conclude that High aided and abetted in the drive-by shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Here, High went along as protection and support for his fellow DTO gang members who had recently been \"disrespected\" by a rival gang-Denison Boys. DTO members believed that a Denison Boy member Bo-Bo shot Dre. Similar to\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , DTO members drove in a stolen vehicle to areas known to be frequented by Denison Boy gang members looking for Bo-Bo. D.W. testified it was J.J.'s idea to go to Denison territory. D.W. further testified that all occupants of the stolen Honda Accord, including High, agreed to drive around looking for rival Denison members, stating \"if one is looking, we're all looking\" for Denison Boy members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 32} High could have abandoned the plan to locate Bo-Bo, but instead agreed to continue on with the two-car caravan in search of Bo-Bo and other Denison Boy gang members. As the occupants of the Honda Accord drove around looking for Denison members, they had B.Y.'s loaded 9 mm handgun in their vehicle. A rational trier of fact could find that High provided \"protection and support\" to the principal and played a strong role in facilitating the commission of the offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Furthermore, the evidence at trial established that High's involvement in the November 3, 2016 shooting is strongly corroborative of his intent in the instant case. Detective Beveridge testified that High, B.Y., and J.J. were involved in a \"shoot-out\" with the Denison Boys approximately one month later. Detective Beveridge testified that B.Y. was shot during this encounter with Denison Boy members. Detective Beveridge described a Facebook message where High admitted to being present at the \"shoot-out\" with Denison Boy members. High's Facebook messages detailed DTO's rivalry with the Denison Boys and his direct participation in that rivalry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Based on the foregoing, the evidence established that High was more than a mere bystander. Like the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , High could have abandoned the plan to locate Bo-Bo, but instead agreed to continue on with the two-car caravan in search of Bo-Bo and other Denison gang members. High, with a loaded firearm next to him in the vehicle, drove around with other DTO gang members into areas frequented by Denison Boy members. Furthermore, High's Facebook records reveal that he shared the criminal intent of the principal during the shooting. The state presented sufficient evidence that High aided and abetted in the charged offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Accordingly, the first assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    Manifest Weight of the Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 36} In the second assignment of error, High argues that his convictions are against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 37} In contrast to a sufficiency argument, a manifest weight challenge questions whether the state met its burden of persuasion.\n   <em>\n    State v.
