Dunlap asserts that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment and not dismissing the case because NCSLT lacked standing to collect on the debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} However, NCSLT submitted an affidavit of an employee of the subservicer of the loan, with attached documentation, showing that the original lender transferred the loan to another entity, which in turn transferred it to NCSLT before the loan was in default. This evidence also established that there had been no payment on the loan since March 2011, it was in default, and that absent a viable defense, Dunlap owed the principal sum of $28,603.21, plus accrued interest of $5,830.37 as of March 2017. The employee of the subservicer was competent and the documentation attached to his affidavit was admissible as business records. Although NCSLT's amended complaint erroneously referred to an incorrect date for the loan, the error was corrected by its motion to amend its amended complaint to include the correct date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Moreover, Dunlap's defense that he paid the obligation was meritless. The $30,000 promissory note he executed and mailed to the entity that demanded payment of the loan did not suspend his obligation under R.C. 1303.39(B) because there was no evidence that NCSLT had \"taken\" the note for the underlying loan obligation. Based on these circumstances, the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of NCSLT on its claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In addition, the trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of NCSLT on Dunlap's counterclaims asserting that NCSLT was required to have a license to transact business in Ohio and was subject to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (\"FCDPA\"), 15 U.S.C. 1692 et seq. Dunlap did not contest this part of the summary judgment in his initial brief and we need not consider the attempt in his reply brief to argue that his counterclaims had merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Next Dunlap contends that the trial court erred by failing to issue findings of fact and conclusions of law on its judgment granting for summary judgment to NCSLT. We reject his contention because findings of fact and conclusions of law are unnecessary for rulings on motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Dunlap also claims that the trial court's entry of summary judgment for NCSLT violated his right to a jury trial. We reject Dunlap's claim because the proper entry of summary judgment does not violate an individual's right to a jury trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Next Dunlap argues that the trial court judge erred by denying the motion to recuse himself because of his personal bias or prejudice against Dunlap. But we lack jurisdiction to consider the trial court judge's failure to recuse himself when Dunlap could have-and did-file a timely affidavit of disqualification with the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court to resolve his claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Finally, Dunlap asserts that the trial court committed reversible error by ruling on various motions before he had the opportunity to respond, rendering the court's subsequent entry of summary judgment void. We agree it appears that under the civil rules of procedure and the local rules of the trial court, the trial court ruled\n   on certain motions before Dunlap had the opportunity to respond. But because he was given the opportunity to respond to NCSLT's motion for summary judgment, the trial court's judgment was not void or violative of his right to due process. He has not established that the trial court's error prejudiced his right to defend against summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Therefore, we find no error by the trial court in granting NCSLT's motion for summary judgment on its claim and Dunlap's counterclaims. We overrule Dunlap's assignments of error and affirm the court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   I. FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} In an amended complaint NCSLT sought to recover the amount due on a July 2005 defaulted college loan that Dunlap co-signed. After Dunlap filed an answer and counterclaims, he filed motions for summary judgment and to dismiss NCSLT's complaint, claiming that NCSLT lacked standing to collect on the loan because it had not established a proper assignment from the original lender, but the trial court denied the motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Dunlap also filed an emergency motion asking the trial judge to recuse himself based on bias and prejudice. After the judge denied the motion, Dunlap filed an affidavit of disqualification in the Supreme Court of Ohio, raising the same claims of bias and prejudice. The Chief Justice declined to disqualify the trial judge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 12} NCSLT filed a motion for summary judgment, supported by an affidavit of an employee of the subservicer of the student loan, which is the designated custodian of records for the loan. NCSLT also included documentation attempting to establish NCSLT's standing to collect on the loan, the loan default, and the amount due on the loan. Dunlap filed a response supported by his affidavit and documentation purporting to establish that he had paid off the loan by tendering a $30,000 promissory note to the entity that had sent him demand letters for payment. The trial court granted NCSLT's motion for summary judgment and awarded it $34,433.58 plus interest against Dunlap; it also entered summary judgment in NCSLT's favor on Dunlap's counterclaims. Other facts will appear under the assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   II.

In\n   <em>\n    Owusu\n   </em>\n   the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of NCSLT on a student loan that originated from Charter One, and allegedly was sold to NCSLT. The trial court determined that the loan balance\n   had been accelerated in accordance with the terms of the loan and that NCSLT had standing to collect on it, but the court of appeals reversed, finding at \u00b6 10-12 (footnote omitted), that the necessary documentation was missing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 10} After reviewing the record, we find that the trial court improperly granted summary judgment, as there remain genuine issues of material fact. The record is clear that NCSLT neglected to include documentation to prove that it is entitled to demand judgment on the note. Although the record contains reference to the pool agreement and an uncontested affidavit that Owusu is in default, NCSLT did not include specific documentation to directly link the pool of debts assigned to NCSLT from Charter One to the debt Owusu's incurred and had defaulted upon.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Nor does the record contain any indication as to the terms or conditions of the loan or consequences of default, most notably an acceleration clause. Despite the trial court's finding that the documentation included with NCSLT's complaint included specific reference to acceleration, no such document or reference is included in the record either by way of the loan agreement or affidavit from the custodian of NCSLT's records.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 12} The documentation of the direct link showing that Owusu's debt was included in the pool of debts assigned to NCSLT as well as the terms and conditions of the loan and default were not in the record before the trial court, and therefore could not provide any basis for the trial court's grant of summary judgment. We therefore find that the trial court's grant of summary judgment was improper given these missing pieces of evidence from the record. Our decision, however, should not be taken as any indication of the ultimate merits of this case given that NCSLT may supplement the trial court record upon remand.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Conversely, here, the documentation attached to the subservicer employee's affidavit included the specific reference to the Dunlaps' college loan with Charter One in Schedule 2 of the pool agreement, as well as the explicit reference that the loan was being transferred by Charter One to National Collegiate Funding and from National Collegiate Funding to NCSLT. In addition, unlike\n   <em>\n    NTL Collegiate Stndt Loan Trust 2005-1\n   </em>\n   , the documentation submitted by NCSLT here included the terms and conditions of the loan and the consequences of default. Therefore,\n   <em>\n    NTL Collegiate Stndt Loan Trust 2005-1\n   </em>\n   is inapposite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 24} We also find Dunlap's challenge to the propriety of NCSLT's affidavit is meritless. The employee stated under oath that his company, Transworld Systems, Inc., had been contracted to perform the duties of the subservicer for NCSLT by U.S. Bank, National Association, the special servicer for NCSLT; and an attached letter from the U.S. Bank National Association Vice-President confirmed that status.

But the mere fact that he might have co-signed other college loans that were not transferred to NCSLT did not raise a genuine issue of material fact about the one he did sign and that NCSLT held.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Next Dunlap contends that he was not liable to NCSLT because he paid\n   off the loan by presenting NCSLT with a $30,000 promissory note that suspended his payment under R.C. 1303.39(B). In his response to NCSLT's motion for summary judgment, Dunlap included an affidavit stating he had received letters demanding payment from an entity named National Collegiate Trust and that he mailed it a promissory note, which was delivered in January 2011, in the amount of $30,000 to pay the amount due under the college loan. Dunlap supported his claim that he made payment of the obligation with the promissory note by an affidavit to which he attached a letter to National Collegiate Trust and a promissory note in the amount of $30,000, as well as a certified mail receipt noting its delivery. This note and letter required the presentation of the note to Dunlap at his address for payment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 32} R.C. 1303.39(B) provides that \"if a note * * * is taken for an obligation, the obligation is suspended to the same extent the obligation would be discharged if an amount of money equal to the amount of the instrument were taken, and * * * (2) In the case of a note, suspension of the obligation continues until dishonor of the note or until it is paid.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 33} NCSLT argues on appeal, as it did in the trial court, that R.C. 1303.39 does not apply to Dunlap's promissory note because it is not a negotiable instrument under R.C. 1303.03(D). NCSLT cites the language from R.C. 1303.03(D) that \"a promise or order other than a check is not an instrument if, at the time it is issued or first comes into possession of a holder, it contains a conspicuous statement, however expressed, to the effect that the promise or order is not negotiable or is not an instrument governed by this chapter\"; NCSLT argues that because the loan agreement it is attempting to collect expressly stated that it was a \"non-negotiable credit agreement,\" it was not subject to R.C. 1303.39(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 34} But NCSLT's argument lacks merit. The loan agreement is the obligation and not the note attempting to pay the obligation; it is Dunlap's note, which promises to pay the obligation created by the loan, that must be negotiable under R.C. 1303.03(D) in order to suspend the obligation under R.C. 1303.39(B).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2 White, Summers, &amp; Hillman,\n   <em>\n    Uniform Commercial\n   </em>\n   Code, Section 17:41 (6th Ed.2017), construing the similar UCC 3-380 (\"The 'underlying obligation' is the original obligation between the parties which led to the issuance of the negotiable instrument in the first place\"). Dunlap's promissory note states on its face that it is a \"NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENT.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Nevertheless, the promissory note must be \"taken\" for the loan in order for R.C. 1303.39(B)(2) to suspend the obligation. The\n   <em>\n    Hawkland\n   </em>\n   UCC treatise explains the \"taken\" requirement in UCC Section 3-310(b) for a promissory note or uncertified check to suspend an obligation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   Regardless of the type of instrument, a condition to the application of Section 3-310 is that the instrument must be \"taken\" for the underlying obligation.\n   <strong>\n    \"Taking\" the instrument for the underlying obligation requires more than simply its delivery by the obligor to the obligee. The obligee must perform some act of accepting the instrument in either conditional or absolute payment of the obligation.\n   </strong>\n   Whether the obligee has accepted the instrument in payment of the obligation is often a difficult question of fact.\n   <strong>\n    Unless previously authorized by the obligee as an acceptable form of payment, the obligee's receipt by mail of an instrument does not constitute his taking of the instrument for the underlying obligation. If he promptly returns the instrument,\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    he is not be deemed to have taken the instrument for the obligation. However, if he deposits or negotiates the instrument, he will be deemed to have taken it for the obligation.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    Borderline situations arise where the obligee retains the instrument but does not negotiate or deposit it. In these situations, his intent to accept the instrument in payment determines whether he takes the instrument for the underlying obligation. Subjective intent is irrelevant. The court should examine what objectively appears to be the obligee's intent as evidenced by his actions. Where the obligee is an organization, questions will arise as to the actual or apparent authority of a particular agent to accept an instrument in payment of the obligation.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   5\n   <em>\n    Hawkland UCC Series\n   </em>\n   , Section 3-310:1 (Rev.Ed.2017) (Emphasis added and footnotes omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {\u00b6 36} Here, there is evidence that NCSLT's servicing agent signed for the certified mail containing Dunlap's promissory note. But there is no summary judgment evidence that the servicer was either authorized by NCSLT to accept Dunlap's instrument as payment of the loan or that the servicer actually accepted it as payment. This appears to be the \"[b]orderline situation\" where the servicer evidently retained the promissory note but neither it nor NCSLT negotiated or deposited it-there are simply no actions in the summary judgment evidence that would support a finding that Dunlap's note was taken so as to suspend his obligation under the loan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 37} It is true that Dunlap submitted an affidavit in the summary judgment materials claiming that NCSLT \"received and accepted payment in full for the [original] Note.\" Although he also attached a certified mail receipt indicating that NCSLT's agent received the envelope containing the promissory note, he did not include any support for his self-serving statement that NCSLT \"accepted\" the promissory note as \"payment in full\" for the college loan obligation.

Instead, by filing this action and seeking to collect on the obligation, NCSLT acted inconsistently with accepting the promissory note tendered by Dunlap.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bingman v.

Therefore, we dismiss this part of Dunlap's appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   E. Additional Trial Court Rulings\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   {\u00b6 52} In his first assignment of error Dunlap asserts that the trial court ruled on NCSLT's motions for leave to respond to his counterclaims and discovery, and to amend its amended complaint by interlineation, before affording him the time to respond under the applicable rules of procedure; and that the court also ruled on his motion to dismiss the amended complaint before he had the opportunity to reply to NCSLT's memorandum in opposition - all of which violated his due process right to be heard. In his seventh assignment of error Dunlap contends that the trial court erred by failing to apply various rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   {\u00b6 53} We agree with Dunlap that the trial court ruled on certain motions before giving him the opportunity to respond under Civ.R. 6(C) and Loc.R. 11.01 of the Ross County Common Pleas Court. But we disagree that any error in doing so resulted in automatic, reversible prejudice. His counterclaims and motion to dismiss based on lack of standing were meritless. And the trial court did not abuse its discretion by granting NCSLT's motion to amend its\n   amended complaint to include the correct date of the loan it was attempting to collect on.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Klocinski v. American States Co.\n   </em>\n   , 6th Dist. Lucas No. L-03-1353,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004-Ohio-6657\">\n    2004-Ohio-6657\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004%20WL%202849054\">\n    2004 WL 2849054\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 31 (premature grant of summary judgment before nonmoving party had an opportunity to respond did not constitute prejudicial error because even if given the opportunity to respond, he would not have prevailed).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   {\u00b6 54} Moreover, the preeminent rulings in this appeal involve NCSLT's motion for summary judgment, for which Dunlap was afforded the appropriate time to respond. The trial court's entry of judgment was not void or violative of his right to due process. He has not established that the trial court's error prejudiced his right to defend against summary judgment. We overrule Dunlap's first and seventh assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   V. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   {\u00b6 55} The trial court properly granted summary judgment on NCSLT's claim to collect on the college loan and denied Dunlap's motions for summary judgment and to dismiss. Having overruled Dunlap's first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, ninth, and tenth assignments are error, we affirm the summary judgment entered in NCSLT's favor on its claim and on Dunlap's motions for summary judgment and his counterclaims. We dismiss the eighth assignment of error that challenges the trial court's denial of Dunlap's motion to recuse the trial judge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   APPEAL DISMISSED IN PART AND JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Hoover, P.J., &amp; Abele, J.: Concur in Judgment and Opinion.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
