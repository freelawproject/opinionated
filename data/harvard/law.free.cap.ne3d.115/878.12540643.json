White, appeals pro se from the judgment of the Miami County Court of Common Pleas denying his \"Motion for the Return of Property,\" wherein White requested the return of property seized from his residence pursuant to a search warrant. For the reasons outlined below, the judgment of the trial court will be affirmed in part,\n   reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Course of Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On June 7, 2016, White was indicted for single counts of illegal manufacture of crack cocaine in violation of R.C. 2925.04(A) and possession of cocaine in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A). The indictment included forfeiture specifications for $1,487 in cash and a 2005 Chrysler Pacifica titled in White's name. The charges and specifications were filed after police officers from the City of Troy executed a search warrant at White's residence on April 8, 2016, during which time the officers found cocaine powder, crack cocaine, and cash. Various items of property, including White's Chrysler Pacifica, were seized as evidence during the search. Following the search, the police had White's vehicle towed to Jim's Towing and Recovery (\"Jim's Towing\") in Miami County where the vehicle was stored during the pendency of the criminal proceedings brought against White.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The State never instituted an action for the forfeiture of White's seized property. The State also dismissed all the charges against White without prejudice on December 20, 2016. Following the dismissal, on January 5, 2017, White, with the assistance of counsel, filed a \"Motion for Release of Property and Waiver of Storage and Tow Fees.\" In the motion, White explained that although the police had directed Jim's Towing to release White's vehicle to him, the tow yard refused to do so until the towing and storage fees were paid. White argued that since his criminal case was dismissed, he should not be responsible for the towing and storage fees, and he requested the trial court to order the release of his vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Approximately one month later, White and the State filed a \"Joint Notice of Stipulation of Facts for Release of Property Motion.\" In the notice, the parties stipulated to the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   (1) a search warrant was executed at White's residence on April 8, 2016;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   (2) a number of items were seized by the police, including White's Chrysler Pacifica;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (3) White is the title owner of the Chrysler Pacifica;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (4) White purchased the Chrysler Pacifica for $5,075 plus $367.58 in taxes and fees;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (5) the police had the Chrysler Pacifica towed to Jim's Towing in Miami County;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (6) the police placed a hold on the Chrysler Pacifica, which prohibited White from recovering the vehicle;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (7) the indictment filed against White was dismissed on December 20, 2016;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (8) the hold on White's vehicle was released following the dismissal of his case;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (9) when White attempted to retrieve his vehicle from the tow yard he was informed that he would have to pay Jim's Towing approximately $6,000;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (10) $6,000 exceeds the value of the Chrysler Pacifica;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (11) White filed a \"Motion for Release of Property and Waiver of Storage and Tow Fees\" on January 5, 2017; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (12) the Kelly Blue Book fair market value/trade-in value of the Chrysler Pacifica is between $1,859 and $2,264.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 5} White thereafter filed a supplemental brief supporting his \"Motion for Release of Property and Waiver of Storage and Tow Fees.\" In the supplemental brief, White again requested the trial court to order the release of his vehicle from Jim's Towing and for him not to be held responsible for the towing and storage fees owed. The State did not file a response in opposition to White's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 6} After taking the matter under advisement, on February 15, 2017, the trial court issued a written decision denying White's motion. In denying the motion, the trial court found, based on the parties' stipulations, that White's vehicle was seized by the police as evidence in a criminal matter, which was dismissed, and was not seized or held under the court's authority. The trial court also found that the State had not sought forfeiture of the vehicle under R.C. Chapter 2981 and that the vehicle was not impounded pursuant to any chapter under R.C. Title 45. As a result, the trial court found it had no jurisdiction over the right of possession of the vehicle. Rather, the trial court explained that there were other civil remedies available for White to obtain possession of his vehicle against the claim of Jim's Towing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Instead of appealing from the trial court's decision, on August 23, 2017, White filed a pro se \"Motion for the Return of Property.\" In that motion, White sought relief under R.C. Chapter 2981 and requested the trial court to issue an order for the police to return the property seized from his residence on April 8, 2016. White attached an affidavit to the motion listing all the property that he wanted returned, which included his Chrysler Pacifica, two Samsung cell phones, two trays, an iPad, a First Alarm monitor, $1,504 in cash, a Brinks safe, and two lap top computers. White's motion did not address the towing and storage fees for his vehicle nor did it request the trial court to waive the imposition of those fees. White simply argued that the aforementioned property should be returned to him since his criminal case was dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On October 17, 2017, the trial court held a hearing on White's \"Motion for the Return of Property.\" Following the hearing, on October 25, 2017, the trial court issued a written decision denying White's motion. In denying the motion, the trial court once again concluded that it did not have jurisdiction over the right of possession of the vehicle since no forfeiture action was ever filed by the State. With regards to the other items of property, the trial court held that although R.C. 2981.11(A)(1) requires lawfully seized property to be kept safely by police, the means of disposal provided in that statute (as described in R.C. 2981.12 and R.C. 2981.13 ) did not apply to White's property because the property was neither unclaimed nor forfeited property. The trial court found that it did not have jurisdiction to grant the release of the property because the City of Troy (as the legal entity overseeing the Troy Police Department) was not a party to the action and that R.C. Chapter 2981 did not provide the trial court with post-conviction jurisdiction to order the release of property or to join other parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 9} White now appeals from the trial court's judgment denying his pro se \"Motion for the Return of Property,\" asserting one assignment of error for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    Assignment of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 10} White's sole assignment of error is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   THE [TRIAL] COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION WHEN IT MADE A RULING THAT WAS CONTRARY TO LAW.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Under his assignment of error, White contends that the trial court's written decision issued on October 25, 2017, did not conform to the trial court's ruling provided at the October 17, 2017 hearing. Unlike the written decision, White claims the trial court, at the hearing, ordered all of the property he sought in his motion to be returned to him, excluding his vehicle, which the trial court found it lacked jurisdiction to release. In his reply brief, White also argues that because all the charges\n   against him in the underlying criminal matter were dismissed and no forfeiture proceedings were initiated, all of his property, including his vehicle, should be returned to him. White further asks this court to order the State to pay for his vehicle's towing and storage fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Given that White has not fulfilled his duty under App.R. 9(B) to provide a transcript of the October 17, 2017 hearing, we must presume the regularity of the trial court proceedings unless the limited record before us affirmatively demonstrates error.\n   <em>\n    Banks v. Regan\n   </em>\n   , 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 21929,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008-Ohio-188\">\n    2008-Ohio-188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%20186831\">\n    2008 WL 186831\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 2 ;\n   <em>\n    Knapp v. Edwards Laboratories\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1803352\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-2d/61/197/#p199\">\n    61 Ohio St.2d 197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 199,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=400%20N.E.2d%20384\">\n    400 N.E.2d 384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1980). After a full and thorough review of the available record, we find nothing indicating that the ruling announced by the trial court at the October 17, 2017 hearing was different from the ruling set forth in the written decision of October 25, 2017. As a result, we will presume the regularity of the October 17, 2017 hearing. Therefore, White's claim that the trial court issued different rulings at the hearing and in the corresponding written decision is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Also lacking merit is White's claim that the trial court erred in failing to order the return of his vehicle. We note that the portion of White's \"Motion for the Return of Property\" requesting the release of his vehicle is barred by res judicata because White previously requested such relief in a prior motion and then failed to appeal from the trial court's decision denying the prior motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Saxon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5551189\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/109/176/\">\n    109 Ohio St.3d 176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006-Ohio-1245\">\n    2006-Ohio-1245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=846%20N.E.2d%20824\">\n    846 N.E.2d 824\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 16 (\"any issue that could have been raised on direct appeal and was not is res judicata and not subject to review in subsequent proceedings\").\n   <em>\n    Accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Woullard\n   </em>\n   , 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 27216,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017-Ohio-2614\">\n    2017-Ohio-2614\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201592719\">\n    2017 WL 1592719\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 12. Despite the application of res judicata, the trial court ruled on White's second request for the release of his vehicle and concluded, for a second time, that it did not have jurisdiction over the right of possession of the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Although it was unnecessary for the trial court to rule on the issue a second time, we ultimately agree with the trial court's conclusion. The joint stipulations filed by the parties established that White's vehicle was in the possession of Jim's Towing, a third-party tow yard. The stipulations further established that Jim's Towing would not release the vehicle to White until the towing and storage fees were paid. Although the trial court has jurisdiction over third-party claims to property in forfeiture proceedings,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R.C. 2981.03, no forfeiture proceeding was ever filed in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 15} In a criminal proceeding, the trial court does not have authority to deprive a third party, such as Jim's Towing, of the possession of property in which it has asserted an interest, as Jim's Towing cannot be afforded an opportunity to assert its rights in a criminal proceeding to which it is not a party.\n   <em>\n    State v. Estep\n   </em>\n   , 4th Dist.

Harrell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1766448,1766465\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st/174/338/\">\n    174 Ohio St. 338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 342,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=189%20N.E.2d%20146\">\n    189 N.E.2d 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1963) (a criminal court cannot deprive non-party towing company of property interest, where defendant asked for return of seized property). White's remedy with respect to his vehicle must be in an appropriate civil proceeding.\n   <em>\n    Labriola\n   </em>\n   at *2. Accordingly,\n   the trial court did not err in finding that it lacked jurisdiction to order Jim's Towing to return the vehicle to White.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 16} We now turn to the other items of property that White requests to have returned. According to White, the other items of property were seized by police during the April 8, 2016 search of his home and are currently in the possession of the police. Other than the affidavit attached to White's \"Motion for the Return of Property,\" there is nothing in the record properly before this court indicating that the police have any of the items White requests to have returned to him. However, given that the trial court addressed the return of the property on the merits, in the interests of judicial economy, we will presume the items are indeed in the possession of the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 17} As previously noted, the trial court held that R.C. Chapter 2981 did not provide it with jurisdiction to order the police to return White's property to him. In reaching this conclusion, the trial court reviewed R.C. 2981.11(A), which provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Any property that has been lost, abandoned, stolen, seized pursuant to a search warrant, or otherwise lawfully seized or forfeited and that is in the custody of a law enforcement agency shall be kept safely by the agency, pending the time it no longer is needed as evidence or for another lawful purpose, and shall be disposed of pursuant to sections 2981.12 and 2981.13 of the Revised Code.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 18} While R.C. 2981.11(A) sets forth the law enforcement agency's duty to safely keep seized property until it is no longer needed as evidence or for another lawful purpose, it does not provide any clarity on the issue of whether a trial court has authority in a dismissed criminal case to order a law enforcement agency to return seized property when forfeiture has not been pursued. We note that the methods of disposing the property in R.C. 2981.12 and R.C. 2981.13 apply to \"unclaimed or forfeited property in the custody of a law enforcement agency\" and \"property ordered forfeited as contraband, proceeds, or an instrumentality.\" White's property is neither unclaimed nor forfeited; accordingly, we agree with the trial court's conclusion that the provisions in R.C. 2981.12 and R.C. 2981.13 do not apply to the case at bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Under R.C. 2981.03(A)(4), \"a person aggrieved by an alleged unlawful seizure of property may seek relief from the seizure by filing a motion in the appropriate court that shows the person's interest in the property, states why the seizure was unlawful, and requests the property's return.\" While we have held that R.C. 2981.03(A)(4) encompasses claims for the return of seized property even when the State has not pursued forfeiture,\n   <em>\n    State v. Moreno\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017-Ohio-479\">\n    2017-Ohio-479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=85%20N.E.3d%20238\">\n    85 N.E.3d 238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 26 (2d Dist.), R.C. 2981.03(A)(4) still does not apply here because White does not allege that his property was unlawfully seized. Accordingly, R.C. 2981.03(A)(4) also does not clarify whether a trial court has authority in a dismissed criminal case to order a law enforcement agency to return seized property when forfeiture has not been pursued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 20} We also point out that there is an issue as to whether White's \"Motion for the Return of Property\" was even properly before the trial court. There is a body of case law indicating that an action in replevin is the appropriate procedure for a defendant to reclaim possession of property seized by police after the defendant has been convicted or when the charges against the defendant have been dismissed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

In\n   <em>\n    Bolton\n   </em>\n   , the trial court denied the defendant's motion for return of property, which was filed after he was convicted and after he served his sentence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5. Like the instant case, the property at issue was seized from the defendant's residence pursuant to a search warrant and remained in the possession of the police.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3. Also like the instant case, the State failed to pursue either criminal or civil forfeiture of the property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13. Instead of holding that the motion for return of property was not properly before the trial court, we reversed the judgment of the trial court and held that \"where the statutory requirements for forfeiture have not been met, we have no choice but to reverse the decision of the trial court and remand for further proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17. Although not explicit, this court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Bolton\n   </em>\n   indirectly indicates that the trial court had authority to rule on the motion for return of property. Otherwise, this court would have affirmed the trial court's denial of the motion on the ground that it lacked jurisdiction to rule on the motion. Stare decisis requires this court to adhere to this court's precedent in\n   <em>\n    Bolton\n   </em>\n   , which supports the notion that White's \"Motion for the Return of Property\" was a viable means to request the return of his property and that the motion was properly before the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Although the trial court was correct in that there was nothing in R.C.
