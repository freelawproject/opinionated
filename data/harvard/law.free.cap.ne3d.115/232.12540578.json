Richards. McManus challenges the court's (1) decision to assign the contract's term \"cause\" its simple dictionary meaning rather that \"its established and precise legal meaning\" and (2) finding that Richards gave her proper written notice of her intent to disassociate. McManus also challenges the court's grant of the motion for summary judgment on the grounds that it failed to consider her claims regarding breach of fiduciary duty or breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing. Finally, she asserts that the court erred to the extent that it failed to consider the applicability of the buy-sell agreement as it relates to the purchase of her membership interest in the practice. We reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b6 2 FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 3 The parties are orthodontists. McManus began working at Richards's practice, Quad City Orthodontic Group, LLC (the practice), as an associate in 2010. The practice has an office in Rock Island, Illinois, and another in Bettendorf, Iowa.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 4 On January 1, 2012, the parties entered into an \"Agreement for Sale of Membership Interest in Limited Liability Company and Agreement for the Conducting of Professional Business Operations\" (Operations Agreement). The parties amended the agreement in December 2012. The agreement provided that Richards, then the sole owner of the practice, would sell a 50% membership interest to McManus, who agreed to purchase her interest over a five-year period. The Agreement further provided for the dissolution of the practice and for the repurchase of McManus's membership interest. In relevant part, it provided for McManus's voluntary disassociation as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   \"In the event that [McManus] should voluntarily elect to no longer practice dentistry under the joint dental practice with Dr. Richards, all percentages of Membership Interest purchased by [McManus] from [Richards], by way of this Agreement, shall be sold back to [Richards], under the terms of this Agreement, for a discounted price of fifty percent (50%) of the Purchase Price heretofore paid by [McManus] to [Richards].\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Operations Agreement also provided McManus's involuntary disassociation from the practice as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \"In the event that Richards finds cause to involuntarily disassociate McManus from the Company's dental practice, Richards shall give written notice to [McManus] of said involuntary disassociation decision setting for the last day of McManus' association with the Company and the joint dental practice. [Richards] then, within ninety (90) days of the last day of McManus' association, shall repurchase all of [McManus's] Membership Interest at one hundred percent (100%) of the Purchase Price heretofore paid to [Richards] by [McManus]. [Richards\n   ]\n   reserves the right, at her sole discretion, to pay the price to [McManus], for the repurchase of [McManus's] Membership Interest, either as a single payment, or quarterly over a period of three years.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 The parties also signed an \"Insured Purchase Agreement and Member Interest Redemption Plan for Quad City Orthodontic Group L.L.C.\" (Buy-Sell Agreement), which set out the specific details regarding the sale and purchase of the practice's membership interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 Over time, tensions developed between the parties. On April 27, 2016, Richards and the practice's office manager, Denise Coyne, met with McManus and informed her of Richards's intent to disassociate her from the practice. At that time, Richards owned a 55% interest in the practice and McManus a 45% interest. During the meeting, Richards gave McManus a \"Purchase and Sale Agreement\" and a document titled \"Appendix A Dissolution of Purchase Agreement Entered January 1, 2012[,] by Seller Anne Bronwen Richards and Purchaser Michelle McManus.\" Following the meeting, Coyne changed the locks on both offices, reset the passwords to all computer-based information, and excluded McManus's access to patient records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 In May 2016, McManus filed a complaint in the circuit court of Rock Island County, requesting injunctive relief (count I) and alleging breach of contract (count II), breach of fiduciary duty (count III), and breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing (count IV) against Richards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8 In June 2016, Richards filed a motion for summary judgment. She asserted that the issue before the court involved \"mere contract interpretation\" as to whether she satisfied the provisions required by the Operations Agreement to disassociate McManus from the practice. Richards maintained that she satisfied those provisions, and thus, did not breach the parties' contract, fiduciary duties, or the duty of good faith and fair dealing. Accordingly, she maintained \"there are no genuine issues of material fact that are disputed by the parties that would preclude an entry of this Motion for Summary Judgment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 9 In November 2016, McManus filed a \"Resistance to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment,\" asserting, in relevant part, that Richards (1) breached the Operations Agreement by not providing written notice of the involuntary disassociation and by expelling McManus from the practice without cause and (2) violated her fiduciary duties of loyalty and care and her duty of good faith and fair dealing. In the alternative, McManus argued if the court found no genuine issue of material fact, Richards should be required to purchase her interest in the practice pursuant to the Buy-Sell Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 10 Later that month, the trial court conducted a hearing on the motion for summary judgment. The central disagreement between the parties revolved around whether Richards had \"cause\" to involuntarily disassociate McManus from the practice, since the term was not defined in the Operations Agreement. According to Richards, the agreement did not \"require any finding of wrongdoing in order for [her] to find cause for disassociation,\" and it did not \"impose any requirements or standards that first must be satisfied for [her] to find cause to disassociate McManus.\" Richards maintained that \"[c]ause under the [a]greement is just meaning a reason\" and \"the [a]greement clearly states that cause is determined by Richards, not a trier of fact or objective standard.\" In contrast, McManus asserted that the term \"cause\" must be given its legally significant meaning, not a simple dictionary\n   definition. Ultimately, the trial court agreed with Richards's interpretation of \"cause\" and granted her motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 11 In December 2016, McManus filed an amendment to her complaint, pursuant to a November 2016 order allowing her leave to do so in which she added a request for declaratory judgment (count V) and an accounting (count VI). McManus also filed a motion for a finding pursuant to Illinois Supreme Court Rule 304(a) (eff. Mar. 8, 2016). The trial court granted McManus's motion. She appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 12 ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 13 On appeal, McManus asserts that the trial court erred in granting Richards's motion for summary judgment. Specifically, she challenges the court's (1) decision to assign the contract's term \"cause\" its simple dictionary meaning rather that \"its established and precise legal meaning\" and (2) finding that Richards gave her proper written notice of her intent to disassociate. McManus also challenges the court's grant of the motion for summary judgment on the grounds that it failed to consider her claims regarding breach of fiduciary duty or breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing. Finally, she asserts that the court erred to the extent that it failed to consider the applicability of the Buy-Sell Agreement as it relates to the purchase of her membership interest in the practice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 14 A.

Thus, she contends that \"the contract as written sets forth a subjective standard and vested [her] with the contractual discretion to make the determination of whether she found a reason to disassociate McManus and, thereby end their contractual relationship.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 21 On the other hand, McManus argues that the term \"cause\" must be given its \"established and precise legal meaning\" as \"this is a complicated contract between two sophisticated people.\" She asserts that while cases defining \"cause\" in the employment context are instructive, the standard for \"cause\" in cases concerning limited liability companies must be even stricter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 22 After reviewing the Operations Agreement, considering each provision of the agreement in light of the others, we find the agreement requires Richards to possess more than a subjective reason for involuntarily disassociating McManus from the practice. Were we to accept Richards's definition of \"cause,\" we would have to conclude that the agreement essentially permits Richards to exploit McManus's financial investment and professional services in order to build up her business, expel McManus from the practice one day shy of receiving her last payment, and then hold on to a portion of McManus's money over the next three years. Such a result is not only inequitable but absurd.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 23 In the employment context, \"cause\" is defined as \" 'some substantial shortcoming, recognized by law and public opinion as a good reason for termination.' \"\n   <em>\n    Bishop v.

In other words, an employer\n   must often possess more than a subjective reason to discharge an employee. In this case, the parties do not have an employer-employee relationship but are members of a limited liability company. As such, we agree with McManus that the term \"cause\" as it is used in the Operations Agreement requires a higher standard than that which is typical in the employment context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 24 To that end, we are guided by subsection 35-45(6) of the Limited Liability Company Act (Act) ( 805 ILCS 180/35-45(6) (West 2016) ). That section delineates events that may result in a member's involuntary expulsion by the court. Specifically, section 35-45(6) provides for a \"member's expulsion by judicial determination\" if the member (1) \"engaged in wrongful conduct that adversely and materially affected the company's business\"; (2) \"willfully or persistently committed a material breach of the operating agreement or of a duty owed to the company or the other members under Section 15-3\"; or (3) \"engaged in conduct relating to the company's business that makes it not reasonably practicable to carry on the business with the member.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=461%20N.E.2d%20612\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, the record is devoid of any indication that McManus engaged in wrongful conduct or willfully or persistently committed a material breach of the operations agreement or of a duty she owed. In fact, the trial court never considered the issue, finding that any reason would do. We conclude, however, that whether Richards possessed sufficient cause to involuntarily disassociate McManus from the parties' practice depends on whether McManus's conduct made it unreasonable for the two to continue working together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 25 After reviewing the record, including the affidavits and depositions of the parties and staff, we find a genuine issue of material fact exists such that summary judgment is precluded. We note that while Richards testified to a number of conflicts between the parties, McManus was of the opinion that they \"came up with solutions that accommodated or addressed all of [Richards] concerns\" and that Richards \"was getting everything she was asking for.\" Whether the status of the parties' relationship and/or McManus's conduct makes it not reasonably practicable or unreasonable for the two to continue working together, despite evidence of an otherwise profitable orthodontics practice, is a material fact that they dispute. Accordingly we reverse the trial court's grant of summary judgment and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 26 C.
