Harper, appeals a decision of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas entered on September 29, 2017 denying his motion for the trial court to consider void his previously imposed post-release control term and to order his immediate release. Because the judgment entry in Harper's case insufficiently notified him of consequences he could face if he violates conditions of post-release control on his release from prison, we remand the decision to the trial court for it to correct its entry nunc pro tunc in accordance with R.C. 2929.19(B)(2)(e) and\n   <em>\n    State v.

FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On April 12, 2012, a Franklin County Grand Jury indicted Harper for two counts of robbery, felonies of the second and third degree respectively. (Apr. 12, 2012 Indictment.) Harper was charged for attempting to steal approximately $1,800 worth of merchandise from Macy's. (Feb. 13, 2013 Sentencing &amp; Plea Tr. at 4-5, filed Dec. 1, 2017.) Loss prevention officers at Macy's apparently apprehended him during his attempt but, in the course of being apprehended, Harper bit one male officer on the shoulder and bit a female office once on the hand and twice on the face.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=85%20N.E.3d%20700\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Harper initially pled \"not guilty.\" (Apr. 16, 2012 Plea Form.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 3} After a number of pre-trial proceedings, including one at which Harper failed to appear and was subsequently arrested on a capias order, he agreed to plead guilty to a third-degree felony robbery charge with a recommended sentence of three years in exchange for dismissal of the second-degree robbery charge and time served on his failure to appear case. (Nov. 2, 2012 Capias; Nov. 19, 2012 Capias Return; Feb. 15, 2013 Plea Form.) The trial court held a combined plea and sentencing hearing on February 13, 2013. At this hearing, the trial court heard testimony that was not transcribed until after the trial court issued its decision now under review and for which we declined to allow Harper to supplement the appellate record with the hearing transcript. (Sentencing &amp; Plea Tr. at 12-14; Dec. 27, 2017 Entry Denying Supplement.) We thus presume the regularity of proceedings and that Harper was appropriately orally notified of post-release control.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

The prison term(s) for all post-release control violations may not exceed one-half of the prison term originally imposed. I understand that I may be prosecuted, convicted, and sentenced to an additional prison term for a violation that is a felony. I also understand that such felony violation may result in a consecutive prison term of twelve months or the maximum period of unserved post-release control, whichever is greater.

However, because a court is generally said to speak only through its journal, the trial court, in addition to oral notification at the sentencing hearing, is \"required to incorporate that notice into its journal entry imposing sentence.\"\n   <em>\n    Jordan\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 6, 17, paragraph one of the syllabus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 10} During the combined sentencing and plea hearing, Harper was appropriately notified both orally and in writing of the three-year mandatory term of post-release control and the consequences for violating its terms. (Feb. 15, 2013 Notice; Feb. 15, 2013 Plea Form at 2.)\n   <em>\n    Bardwell\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14 ;\n   <em>\n    Knapp\n   </em>\n   at 199,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=400%20N.E.2d%20384\">\n    400 N.E.2d 384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The real question in this case is whether the trial court's journal entry sufficiently and lawfully incorporated notice of post-release control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Notification and incorporation in the judgment entry of the post-release control sanction are necessary to \"empower[ ] the executive branch of government to exercise its discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Jordan\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22. Accordingly, \"to validly impose postrelease control, a minimally compliant entry must provide the [Adult Parole Authority] the information it needs to execute the postrelease-control portion of the sentence.\"\n   <em>\n    Grimes\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13. The Supreme Court of Ohio has explained that a \"sentencing entry must contain the following information: (1) whether postrelease control is discretionary or mandatory, (2) the duration of the postrelease-control period, and (3) a statement to the effect that the Adult Parole Authority (\"APA\") will administer the postrelease control pursuant to R.C. 2967.28 and that any violation by the offender of the conditions of postrelease control will subject the offender to the consequences set forth in that statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 12} In Harper's case, the trial court's entry only included language that \"[t]he Court also notified the Defendant of the applicable period of\n   <strong>\n    3 years mandatory post-release control\n   </strong>\n   pursuant to R.C. 2929.19(B)(3)(c), (d) and (e).\" (Emphasis sic.) (Feb. 15, 2013 Jgmt. Entry at 2.) The entry clearly specified the length of the term and the mandatory nature of the term. But whether the reference alone to \" R.C. 2929.19(B)(3)(c), (d) and (e)\" was sufficient notice to Harper and to instruct the APA is the issue for determination. Language should be included that informs the APA that it \"will administer the postrelease control pursuant to R.C. 2967.28 and that any violation by the offender of the conditions of postrelease control will subject the offender to the consequences set forth in that statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Grimes\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 13} In\n   <em>\n    Grimes\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court found the following judgment entry language sufficient:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   The Court further notified the Defendant that\n   <strong>\n    'Post Release Control'\n   </strong>\n   is\n   <strong>\n    mandatory\n   </strong>\n   in this case for\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     three (03) years\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   as well as the consequences for violating conditions of post release control imposed by Parole Board under Revised Code \u00a7 2967.28.

By contrast, the Eighth District Court of Appeals, relying on\n   <em>\n    Grimes\n   </em>\n   , found the following trial court language to be insufficient: \"Postrelease control is part of this prison sentence for 3 years for the above felony(s) under R.C. 2967.28.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The trial court did not at all mention in its entry the consequences of violating the terms of post-release control and did not cite the statute that establishes the consequences for violation, R.C. 2967.28. (Feb. 15, 2013 Jgmt. Entry at 2.) Harper's judgment entry did cite R.C. 2929.19 and, in denying Harper's motion to vacate, the trial court noted that R.C. 2929.19 includes references to supervision pursuant to R.C. 2967.28. (Sept. 29, 2017 Decision at 2.)\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   R.C. 2929.19(B)(2)(c) through (e). Even if we were to hold that language to be sufficient, the trial court's entry in Harper's case did not cite the proper division of R.C. 2929.19. The trial court cited \" R.C. 2929.19(B)(3)(c), (d) and (e),\" but the proper division, both at the time Harper was sentenced, and now, is R.C. 2929.19(B)(2).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2011 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 86.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the trial court's judgment entry in Harper's case did not mention consequences of any kind, did not cite the statute that provides for such consequences, and referenced the wrong division of the sentencing statute as applicable to Harper. Under\n   <em>\n    Grimes\n   </em>\n   , the trial court's judgment entry insufficiently incorporated notice of post-release control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 15} The State argues that the\n   <em>\n    Grimes\n   </em>\n   decision should not be applied \"retroactively\" to Harper's case.

(Harper's Brief at 18.) The Supreme Court has \"recognize[d]\" that \"unless a sentencing entry that did not include notification of the imposition of postrelease control is corrected before the defendant completed the prison term for the offense for which postrelease control was to be imposed, postrelease control cannot be imposed.\"\n   <em>\n    Qualls\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16, citing\n   <em>\n    Hernandez v.

We note that principle from\n   <em>\n    Qualls\n   </em>\n   is based on a case where post-release control was not imposed at all in the entry and no notification was given.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hernandez\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 1, 28. In Harper's case, a mandatory three-year term of post-release control was duly imposed and Harper received repeated notices both in writing and orally about the terms of post-release control. (Sentencing &amp; Plea Tr. at 12-14; Feb. 15, 2013 Notice; Feb. 15, 2013 Plea Form at 2; Feb. 15, 2013 Jgmt. Entry at 2.) The only problem with Harper's sentencing entry is that the consequences of violating post-release control were not specifically mentioned in the judgment entry. (Feb. 15, 2013 Jgmt. Entry at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 17} The situation in this case is therefore not on all fours with\n   <em>\n    Hernandez\n   </em>\n   and is more analogous to the situation in\n   <em>\n    Watkins\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Watkins\n   </em>\n   , multiple prisoners, all of whom had finished their original prison sentences but were still under post-release control, sought writs of habeas corpus because the judgment entries that imposed post-release control were ambiguous about whether it was mandatory or discretionary.\n   <em>\n    Watkins\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 25, 42, 50. In that circumstance, the Supreme Court distinguished\n   <em>\n    Hernandez\n   </em>\n   and declined to grant the writ ordering the prisoners' release because it found that they could have raised the issue in a direct appeal and that post-release control was validly imposed following completion of their original prison terms, notwithstanding the problems in the entries.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=844%20N.E.2d%20301\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 49-53 ;\n   <em>\n    Qualls\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 18} In Harper's case, although the imposition of post-release control in the judgment entry was defective under\n   <em>\n    Grimes\n   </em>\n   , it stated enough information (length and mandatory nature of the post-release control term) to impose post-release control and permit the APA to begin administering it after he completed his original prison term. As a consequence, like those in\n   <em>\n    Watkins\n   </em>\n   and unlike the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Hernandez\n   </em>\n   , Harper remains validly under sentence, even though it may not have been perfectly imposed. This finding is also consistent with R.C. 2929.19(B)(2)(e), which provides in relevant part, \"the failure of a court to notify the offender * * * that the parole board may\n   impose a prison term * * * for a violation of that supervision or a condition of post-release control * * * or to include in the judgment of conviction * * * a statement to that effect does not negate, limit, or otherwise affect the authority of the parole board to so impose a prison term for a violation of that nature.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Harper's assignment of error is sustained insofar as the judgment entry should be corrected. Releasing him is not warranted under the circumstances, because we conclude that the appropriate remedy in this case is that a nunc pro tunc entry be issued correcting the deficiency in the judgment entry as defined in\n   <em>\n    Grimes\n   </em>\n   . Accordingly, we remand the matter to the trial court to correct Harper's judgment entry nunc pro tunc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Supreme Court of Ohio precedent renders judgment entries partially void if post-release control is not appropriately imposed and consequently enables the relevant parts of such entries to be challenged at any time. Because challenge may occur at any time concerning this issue, and because the judgment entry in this case imposes the appropriate term of mandatory post-release control but does not at all mention the consequences to the offender for violating post-release control, we remand to the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas for the issuance of a nunc pro tunc entry that complies with\n   <em>\n    Grimes\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    Judgment affirmed and cause remanded for nunc pro tunc entry.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   HORTON, J., concurs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   SADLER, J., dissents.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    We note that this presumption is a reasonable one because, although it is not technically before us, the transcript reflects the following exchange:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n    THE COURT: Now, the three years in prison is not the end of your problems with the legal system for this crime.

To me, a\n   judgment entry that is void under the law at the time it was imposed, and therefore correctable at any time, is different conceptually from a judgment entry that was properly imposed under the law at the time but at odds with a later judicial opinion.
