Hunter and David G. Hunter, appeal from the July 18, 2016 judgment entry of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas granting the motion to dismiss filed by defendant-appellee AmCoat Industries, Inc., for lack of personal jurisdiction, denying appellants' motion for sanctions, and denying appellants' motions for default judgment and renewed supplemental motion for default judgment and sanctions as moot, and appeal from the April 25, 2017 judgment entry denying appellants' motion for reconsideration. For the following reasons, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} This case concerns whether appellants established that an Ohio trial court had personal jurisdiction over appellee AmCoat Industries, Inc., a Florida corporation, in order to litigate claims arising from an Indiana entity's allegedly faulty application of the Rhino Shield ceramic coating product on appellants' Ohio residence and subsequent failure to adequately make promised repairs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On December 31, 2012, appellants signed a contract for the application of a ceramic coating to their Ohio residence, along with preparation and repair work including pressure washing, caulking and sealing as necessary, filling in stucco cracks, and masking/shielding certain areas to prevent over-spraying. The header of the contract contains a \"Rhino Shield\" logo with \"By Tri-State Coating, Inc.\" stated directly underneath the logo. (Sept. 4, 2014 Am. Compl., Ex. B at 1.) In the header, phone numbers are provided with 317 area codes and for 888-RHINO41, and website addresses are provided with names indicating Indiana, Kentucky, and Ohio. The sales representative is listed as Rudy Pallone, who provides a 614 area-code phone number. Appellant David Hunter signed the contract. The price\n   agreed on in the contract is a total of $11,998 with a $1,200 down payment, a partial payment of $5,399, and $5,399 due on completion, with all checks made payable to \"RhinoShield.\" (Sept. 4, 2014 Am. Compl., Ex. B at 1.) The body of the contract states the customer shall pay certain fees and costs should \"Tri-State Coatings\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   file a legal action to collect amounts due, and cancellation and any other written notices should be sent to Tri-State Coating, Inc. (\"Tri-State\") at a particular Indianapolis address. (Sept. 4, 2014 Am. Compl., Ex. B at 1.) The contract continues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Tri-State Coating Limited warranty: Tri-State Coating warrants the material is of the quality specified and will transfer to the Customer all manufacturer's written warranties. Tri-State Coating warrants workmanship for two (2) years after the date of completion and will remedy substantial defects without charge to the Customer, on written notice from Customer within such period. Tri-State Coating and Customer agree that all implied warranties including, without limitations, warranties of habitability, fitness for a particular purpose and merchant ability [sic] are hereby excluded and there are no warranties or representations which extend beyond those expressly set forth in this agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Tri-State Coatings makes no warranties express or implied regarding any of the products or services except the express warranties provided herein. TRI-STATE COATING EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES EXCEPT AS PROVIDED HEREIN. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, THERE IS NO WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR USE OR PURPOSE WITH RESPECT TO THE GOODS OR SERVICES SOLD.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Entire Understanding: Tri-State Coating is not liable or bound by any warranties, guarantees, statement, or representations made by any broker, agent, employee, or other persons representing or proposing to represent to Tri-State Coating unless expressly set forth in the Agreement. It is understood and agrees [sic] that all prior understanding and agreement between the parties are merged in the Agreement, and that Agreement alone fully and completely constitute the Final Agreement. Any subsequent changes or modification hereto shall not be binding on either party unless in writing and signed by both parties hereto.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (Sept. 4, 2014 Am. Compl., Ex. B at 2.) The December 31, 2012 contract further states that Tri-State will not be responsible for indirect or consequential damages, the buyer's remedy is limited to the price actually paid, and that \"[a]ny questions, disputes, controversies, or litigation arising either directly or indirectly from [the December 31, 2012] contract\" shall be submitted to arbitration conducted in Marion County, Indiana. (Sept. 4, 2014 Am. Compl., Ex. B at 2.) The contract footer states: \"7745 E. 89th St. Indianapolis, IN 46256 indyrhinoshield@yahoo.com.\" (Sept. 4, 2014 Am. Compl., Ex. B at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On February 6, 2014, appellants filed a complaint alleging violations of the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act (\"CSPA\"), negligent and/or false misrepresentation, breach of contract, and violations of the Ohio Home Sales Solicitation\n   Act (\"HSSA\") arising from claimed problems with the project. Appellants cited failures of inspection, preparation and repair work, application of the coating, and clean up as well as subsequent failures to honor warranties and remedy those problems as promised. Appellants named as defendants \"Rhino Shield\" under a Columbus, Ohio address, \"Tri-State Coatings and Repair LLC\" under a West Chester, Ohio address, \"Tri-State Coating, Inc.\" under an Indianapolis, Indiana address, \"John D. Robertson,\" \"Cleveland Coatings, Inc.,\" \"Jim Williams,\" and \"Rudy Pallone.\" (Feb. 6, 2014 Compl. at 1.) Tri-State answered and asserted a third-party complaint against Alexandre Dgebuadze, a contractor hired by Tri-State to perform services on appellants' home. (Mar. 11, 2014 Answer and Third-Party Compl. at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On September 4, 2014, appellants moved for leave to file an amended complaint, and the trial court granted appellants' motion. In the amended complaint, appellants named several new defendants: \"Rhino Shield\" under an Indianapolis, Indiana address, \"Aleksandre Dgebuadze,\" \"Timeless Coatings LLC\", \"Rhino Shield Florida\" under a Destin, Florida address, \"Rhino Shield\" under a Brighton, Michigan address, and appellee in the instant case, \"AmCoat Industries, Inc.\" Regarding the nature of the complaint, appellants alleged the \"case arises from an agreement for home exterior painting and repair services which the defendants, who are collectively and individually known as 'Rhino Shield,' agreed to perform for [appellant] David Hunter pursuant to written contract on December 31, 2012.\" (Sept. 4, 2014 Am. Compl. at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Addressing jurisdiction and the parties, the amended complaint asserts in pertinent part that \"[d]efendants are collectively and individually known as 'Rhino Shield' in one form or another, and are believed to be a loosely organized group of foreign and domestic corporations, limited liability companies, and/or individuals based in Indiana, Kentucky, Florida, Michigan, or perhaps some other state\" and that \" 'Rhino Shield' is now believed to also be known as AmCoat Industries Inc. and/or Rhino Shield Florida,\" entities allegedly licensed to conduct business in Michigan and not Ohio. (Sept. 4, 2014 Am. Compl. at 3.) Appellants assert that Rhino Shield conducts business nationwide through an extensive mass marketing strategy without revealing the true parent company, has \"reformed information about how it conducts business, now claiming to be a nationwide network of 'distributors,' \" and held itself out as Rhino Shield when contracting with consumers but actually had the services performed and product application done by subcontractors or others. (Sept. 4, 2014 Am. Compl. at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The causes of action in the amended complaint remained the same as stated in the original complaint. In Counts 1 and 4, appellants allege the defendants violated two Ohio consumer protection statutes: the CSPA and the HSSA. In Count 2 of the amended complaint, appellants allege the defendants negligently and/or intentionally made misrepresentations to appellants on which they relied to their detriment. In Count 3, appellants allege the defendants breached the written contract of December 31, 2012 by failing to complete the agreement, failing to perform services and repair, and failing to honor warranties and guarantees, including the written warranty in the December 31, 2012 agreement (previously stated in this opinion) and a separate \"25 Year Non-Prorated Transferable Limited Warranty\" for the Rhino Shield ceramic coating. (Sept. 4, 2014 Am. Compl., Ex. E at 1.) The 25-year transferable warranty, which covers only the replacement of the coating material, bears the Rhino Shield name and logo with an\n   Indianapolis address, indicates \"Tri-State Coatings, Inc.\" as \"[d]ealer,\" and states that it is \"valid only when the Rhino Shield Ceramic Coat Material is applied * * * in accordance with the Manufacturer's approved methods.\" (Sept. 4, 2014 Am. Compl., Ex. E at 1.) Appellants demanded judgment against the defendants jointly and severally \"where applicable,\" in an amount exceeding $25,000 for both compensatory and punitive damages, treble damages where appropriate, interest, attorney fees, costs of the action, and further relief as deemed just and appropriate. (Sept. 4, 2014 Am. Compl. at 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On January 13, 2015, appellee filed a notice of improper service, indicating that \"[t]he proper service address for AmCoat is 4012 West Commons Drive, Unit 116, Destin, Florida 32541, which is the address listed with the Florida Department of State, Division of Corporation.\" (Jan. 13, 2015 Notice at 1.) Attached to the notice is an affidavit of AmCoat officer Steve Dominique, averring \"AmCoat is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the state of Florida\" with a principal address at that Destin address as well as a print out of the state of Florida entity search for AmCoat. Appellee filed a second notice of improper service on January 26, 2015, noting the continued impropriety of service by ordinary mail under the circumstances. Appellants filed a motion for default judgment on February 10, 2015, and appellee filed a motion for sanctions against appellants and their attorney on February 12, 2015 for doing so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The case was temporarily stayed pending a decision on arbitration involving Tri-State.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The case was reinstated to the court's active docket on November 10, 2015. The trial court then granted appellants' motion for default judgment against Dgebuadze on November 10, 2015 and denied Tri-State's motion for partial summary judgment on January 25, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 10} On April 7, 2016, appellee filed an amended motion to dismiss due to failure of appellants to obtain service within one year as required under Civ.R. 3(A). Appellee noted it entered an appearance solely for the purpose of moving the court to dismiss the case against it. On April 17, 2016, appellants filed a memorandum contra appellee's motion to dismiss, as well as a renewed supplemental motion for default judgment against appellee and for sanctions pursuant to R.C. 2323.51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Appellee filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted on April 26, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellee argued it distributes the product Rhino Shield to the Indiana corporation Tri-State, the allegations are based on conduct between Tri-State and appellants and appellee has had no participation in any of the transactions that form the basis of the allegations, appellants had not asserted any product liability claims, and appellee has no business transactions or contacts with the state of Ohio. Thus, appellee asserts that Ohio's long-arm jurisdiction rule and statute- Civ.R. 4.3 and R.C. 2307.382 -cannot be used to confer personal jurisdiction on appellee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Appellee argued, in the alternative, that appellants had failed to state a claim against appellee on which relief can be granted pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6). Appellee attached the dealership/supply agreement between Tri-State and appellee, information on appellee's registered trademark for the product Rhino Shield and state of Florida corporate registration information, Tri-State's certificate of incorporation and certificate of assumed business name of Rhino Shield, both in the state of Indiana, and the contract between Tri-State and appellants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Various additional motions and memoranda ensued. On April 29, 2016, appellants moved for partial summary judgment on \"their claims for breaches of various written and verbal warranties * * * and related violations of the Ohio [CSPA] relative to the separate warranties provided by defendants Tri-State Coating, Inc., James Williams, Rudolph Pallone, and AmCoat Industries, Inc. arising from painting and repair services at [appellants'] home\" and on their claims for breach of contract and related violations of the CSPA as to Tri-State, Williams, and Pallone. (Apr. 29, 2016 Pls.' Mot. for Partial Summ. Jgmt. (# 5) at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 13} On May 10, 2016, appellants filed a memorandum contra appellee's motion to dismiss. Within it, appellants argued that appellee is in default and, alternatively, appellee's other arguments lack merit. Specifically, appellants allege that appellee, a distributor who buys Rhino Shield from a manufacturer, \"is actually 'Rhino Shield' \" and \"merely allows Messrs. Dominique and Williams and Pallone, and their shell entities, AmCoat and Tri-State and Cleveland Coatings, to conduct business on their behalves in Ohio.\" (May 10, 2016 Memo. Contra Mot. to Dismiss at 2-3.) Appellants point to Williams' deposition discussing that he began working with Dominique at AmCoat in 2002, running a branch of AmCoat in Indianapolis, until 2005 when Williams started a new \"S\" Corporation, Tri-State Coating, and purchased from AmCoat the exclusive rights to market Rhino Shield in three states. Williams later set up another entity, Cleveland Coatings, which filed a trade name registration for \"Rhino Shield\" in Ohio. Appellants also point to Dominique's deposition in a separate 2005 case filed by appellee in a federal district court in which Dominique discusses his history with Williams and a previous company and product and a 2002 Federal Trade Commission decision and order regarding the previous company. Appellants conclude that \"[a]s is obvious from the foregoing, AmCoat has extensive connections and contacts with Ohio * * * [s]tarting with * * * Williams as its registered agent, AmCoat aka Rhino Shield has conducted business in Ohio since at least 2010 according to Jim Williams, and likely earlier * * *. There is simply no basis at law for AmCoat to argue that it has no contacts with Ohio or that a claim has not been sufficiently alleged against it in this case.\" (May 10, 2016 Memo. Contra Mot. to Dismiss at 15-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 14} On May 13, 2016, appellee entered an appearance limited to the purpose of replying to appellants' memorandum contra and renewing its motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted. Appellee argued that service was deficient, that appellants listed appellee as a party but failed to assert a basis for a cause of action against it, and that appellants' arguments regarding the entities all essentially being the same is an unsupported attempt at redirection to meaningless points which have no bearing on the identities of the separate defendants identified in the complaint. Appellee asserted appellants ignored the only legitimate\n   issue: whether appellee had sufficient contacts with Ohio to permit the court to exercise personal jurisdiction over it and, specifically, how appellee might fit the criteria under Civ.R. 4.3 and/or R.C. 2307.382.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 15} On July 18, 2016, the trial court entered judgment granting appellee's motion to dismiss the amended complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction. The trial court noted that neither party cited to particular subsections of Civ.R. 4.3(A) or R.C. 2307.382 to support its argument. After reviewing Civ.R. 4.3(A) or R.C. 2307.382 and all the evidence and allegations before it, construing the evidence and pleadings in favor of appellants, the trial court found appellants had failed to make a prima facie showing of personal jurisdiction. Therefore, the trial court dismissed appellants' amended complaint as to appellee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Since the trial court found lack of personal jurisdiction dispositive, it did not rule on appellee's motion regarding Civ.R. 12(B)(6) and found appellants' February 10, 2015 and April 17, 2016 motions for default judgment, appellee's April 7, 2016 motions to dismiss, and Rhino Shield's April 27, 2016 motion to strike to be moot. The trial court additionally denied appellee's February 12, 2015 motion for sanctions but decided to strike appellants' seven pending motions for summary judgment on the docket while allowing appellants leave to file one consolidated summary judgment motion within 30 days of the date of the entry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Appellants filed a motion to reconsider on July 21, 2016, this time arguing that appellee is subject to specific personal jurisdiction under Civ.R. 4.3(A)(1), (2), (3), and (4), and further arguing personal jurisdiction over appellee is reasonable and comports with due process. Appellants additionally reference the existence of general personal jurisdiction over appellee without providing a specific argument to support that contention. Appellants attached the dealership/supply agreement and amendments between appellee and Tri-State, Ohio Secretary of State certificates as to the foreign/designated appointment of agent and foreign license/for profit assumed name of \"Rhino Shield (Tri-State Coating, Inc.)\" including Tri-State's incorporation status in Indiana, and Tri-State's certificate of existence as a for-profit corporation in Indiana. (July 21, 2016 Mot. for Recons., Ex. B at 1.) Appellee filed a memorandum contra arguing it has no agents in the state of Ohio, did not act directly within the state of Ohio to cause any of the events to occur out of which the claims arose, and simply delivered exterior coating to Tri-State. Therefore, appellee argued no causal link exists between appellee's activities and the causes of action to establish personal jurisdiction, and subjecting appellee to jurisdiction in these circumstances offends due process. On April 25, 2017, the trial court denied appellants' motion for reconsideration, stating it had \"previously reviewed and considered all subsections of Civ.R. 4.3(A) and R.C. 2307.382 before determining that [appellants] had failed to make a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   showing of jurisdiction in this case,\" and \"[u]pon thorough review of the parties' filings, the Court does not find any basis to reconsider that decision.\" (Emphasis sic.) (Apr. 25, 2017 Trial Ct. Decision at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 18} On September 22, 2017, appellants filed a notice, pursuant to Civ.R 41(A)(1)(a), of the voluntary dismissal of the action without prejudice as to \"the remaining defendants Rhino Shield, James H. Williams, Rudolph J. Pallone, and Tri-State Coating, Inc.\" (Sept. 22, 2017 Notice of Dismissal at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Appellants filed a timely appeal to this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Faced with the new arguments, the trial court did not find any basis to reconsider its decision since it had already reviewed and considered all subsections of Civ.R. 4.3(A) and R.C. 2307.382 before determining appellants had failed to make a prima facie showing of jurisdiction. Considering the trial court did not address the new arguments posed by appellants as a basis for reconsideration, and in light of appellants' burden of establishing the trial court has personal jurisdiction over appellee, appellants' initial failure to present arguments under Ohio's long-arm statute alone justifies finding in favor of appellee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 27} However, even if appellants properly raised Ohio's long-arm statute and civil rule in their motion for reconsideration in the trial court, appellants have not demonstrated reversible error in this case. Appellants argue that Civ.R. 4.3(A)(1) applies because appellee \"transact[s] any business in this state\" under the broad definition of this phrase adopted by Ohio courts by virtue of (1) its dealership/supply agreement with Tri-State which enables Tri-State to sell Rhino Shield services to Ohio consumers, and (2) by virtue of the 25-year written warranty. Appellants argue Civ.R. 4.3(A)(2) applies because, through its dealership/supply agreement with Tri-State, appellee \"has an agreement with Tri-State to supply its coating product 'Rhino Shield' in Ohio,\" such agreement requires Tri-State to use a standard warranty agreement, and, according to appellants, appellee \"uses a contracted agent to supply both its product and product warranty in Ohio to Ohio consumers.\" (Appellants' Brief at 42, 46.) Appellants argue Civ.R. 4.3(A)(4) applies because appellee caused tortious injury in Ohio by an act or omission outside Ohio by refusing to honor its own written warranty provided directly to appellants, along with the fact that appellee derives substantial revenue from its products used, sold, and consumed in this state. Appellants provide no argument in support of Civ.R. 4.3(A)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Appellee counters the single reference to appellee within the amended complaint states that \" 'Rhino Shield' is now believed to also be known as AmCoat Industries,\" an entity not licensed to do business in Ohio. (Sept. 4, 2014 Am. Compl. at 3.) Appellee argues that its only contact with the state of Ohio is through the supply of the Rhino Shield product to Tri-State, an Indiana corporation. Appellee notes that appellants made \"vague references\" in their brief suggesting appellee provided defective coating but contends that appellants made no product liability or defect claims made in the amended complaint, and there are no clear allegations as to the basis of their claims against appellee in their filings with the trial court. (Appellee's Brief at 12.) Finally, appellee contends it is not a party to any written warranty, appellants made no request and appellee did not fail to honor the warranty, and appellants' claimed damages have nothing to do with the supply or product. As a result, appellee suggests there is no \"nexus\" between appellee's supply of the Rhino Shield product to Tri-State and appellants' causes of action. (Appellee's Brief at 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 29} We agree with appellee, because at the outset, \"[t]he burden of affirmatively demonstrating error on appeal\n   rests with the [appellant].\"\n   <em>\n    Miller v.

We decline to find appellants have not met their burden of demonstrating error on appeal in this regard.\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2002-Ohio-3681\">\n    2002-Ohio-3681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; App.R. 16(A)(7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Regarding Civ.R. 4.3(A)(1) and (2), even if we were to find, for sake of argument, that appellants demonstrated appellee transacted business in this state or contracted to supply services or goods in this state, appellants have not demonstrated a connection between these acts and the claims giving rise to the complaint to support reversal in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 32} In Ohio, personal jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant may be properly exercised where there is a causal connection between the defendant's act as enumerated in the statute and/or rule and the causes of action asserted against him or her. Civ.R. 4.3(A) ; R.C. 2307.382(C) (\"When jurisdiction over a person is based solely upon this section, only a cause of action arising from acts enumerated in this section may be asserted against him.\");\n   <em>\n    Simmons\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16, 19, 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 33} First, as noted by appellee, it is unclear what causes of action appellants assert against appellee. In appellants' own words, this \"case arises from an agreement for home exterior painting and repair services which the defendants, who are collectively and individually known as 'Rhino Shield,' agreed to perform for [appellant] David Hunter pursuant to written contract on December 31, 2012.\" (Sept. 4, 2014 Am. Compl. at 2.) Appellants' only reference to appellee in the amended complaint is to note that they believe appellee is now Rhino Shield. Complicating things further, appellants dismissed \"Rhino Shield\" as a defendant. (Sept. 22, 2017 Notice of Dismissal at 1.) Although appellants essentially contend Tri-State, the company who appellants directly contracted with to do the work on their house and promised to repair the work, is one in the same as appellee, information provided by appellants themselves, such as the dealership agreement and certificate of incorporation, specifically state otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Second, the bulk of the amended complaint is related to allegations of faulty application of the coating product, including applying the coating product in incorrect and varying thicknesses and damages resulting from over-spray and the subsequent failure to repair the work as promised. A cause of action regarding the product being defective is not stated in the amended complaint, and the factual allegation regarding the paint chipping and peeling is stated in relation to the faulty and inconsistent application of the product. For\n   example, the complaint states \"[t]he coating was also not applied at the proper mil thickness and continues to peel, split, crack, blister, and break.\" (Sept. 4, 2014 Am. Compl. at 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Third, several problems bog down appellants' assertions of personal jurisdiction by way of alleged causes of action related to the 25-year transferrable warranty. The warranty, which is attached to the amended complaint, does not include appellee's name, specifically states it is only valid when the material is applied in accordance with the manufacturer's approved methods (which appellants allege did not happen), and does not extend beyond the replacement of the coating material, which is not sought by appellants in their suit. Moreover, there is no allegation that appellants demanded appellee replace the coating material pursuant to the warranty and that appellee subsequently refused to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 36} Overall, reviewing the allegations in the pleadings and the evidence in the light most favorable to appellants and making all reasonable inferences in appellants' favor, we find appellants have not met their burden to demonstrate a causal connection between appellee's alleged activities under Civ.R. 4.3(A)(1) and (2) and the claims asserted against appellee to support personal jurisdiction over appellee in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Finally, although appellants mention general jurisdiction and cite to\n   <em>\n    Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia v.

The appellate court reversed, noting that \"[a]lthough a party may raise the defense of failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted up to and including trial, it must do so in accordance with the civil rules.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 43} Both\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1804267\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-2d/62/209/\">\n    62 Ohio St.2d 209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=404%20N.E.2d%20752\">\n    404 N.E.2d 752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    PSE Credit Union\n   </em>\n   do not involve issues of personal jurisdiction and, as such, are readily distinguishable from this case.
