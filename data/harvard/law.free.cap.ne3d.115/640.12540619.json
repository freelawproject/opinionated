For the reasons stated, we dismiss this appeal as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Appellee represented appellant in a real estate matter. Appellee filed a partition action on appellant's behalf in the Geauga County Court of Common Pleas, Case No. 13 M 001055. Appellant was the successful bidder at the auction for the property. Appellee performed all necessary work for appellant in connection with the transaction. However, appellant failed to pay appellee for services rendered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On February 16, 2017, appellee filed a complaint for the unpaid account in the Chardon Municipal Court, Small Claims Division, Case No. 2017 CVI 00143. Attached to the complaint were invoices revealing the total balance due in the amount of $769.29. (\"Exhibit A\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The case was tried before a magistrate on June 1, 2017. One week later, the magistrate issued a decision recommending judgment in favor of appellee in the amount of $769.29 plus interest and costs. Appellant filed objections to the magistrate's decision. Appellee filed a response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On August 18, 2017, the municipal court adopted the magistrate's decision ordering appellee to recover $769.29 plus interest at the rate of four percent per annum and $93.00 in costs, which is the subject of appellant's appeal. Appellant did not file a motion for stay with the municipal court or with this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Garnishment proceedings were instituted and ordered in the municipal court on October 10, 2017. Appellee received a check from the municipal court on November 2, 2017, representing funds received from JPMorgan Chase, i.e., the garnishee bank, for payment in full of the judgment. On November 7, 2017, appellee filed a notice of satisfaction of judgment with the municipal court. The next day, appellee filed a certificate of release of judgment lien with the common pleas court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On appeal, appellant raises the following assignment of error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 8} \"The trial court erred by affirming the magistrate's decision in favor of appellee where appellee sued for services rendered on account and failed to attach an accounting.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 9} \" ' \"It is a well-established principle of law that a satisfaction of judgment renders an appeal from that judgment moot.\" '\n   <em>\n    Kogler v.
