The trial court does not maintain continuing jurisdiction to modify a division of property or retirement benefits after a divorce decree.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   [A] division of marital property is not subject to modification through the continuing jurisdiction of the court. Therefore, a trial court lacks continuing jurisdiction to modify a division of pension or retirement benefits. Put another way, a court has control over the division of property at the time of the divorce decree, but not thereafter. A trial court, however, always retains the power to enforce the provisions of a divorce decree.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (Internal citations and quotations omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Green\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12. While normally the decree of divorce would end the court's jurisdiction, the trial court specifically maintained jurisdiction for a limited time and purpose\n   in this case to allow time for a third-party consultant to equalize all the defined benefit retirement plans.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   [T]he parties stipulated and agreed that QDRO Consultants would equalize all their defined benefit retirement plans. The Court further orders that Plaintiff shall cause QDRO Consultants to prepare any Qualified Domestic Relations Order or Division of Property Order necessary to effectuate this agreement. The parties shall equally split the cost of QDRO Consultants.\n   <em>\n    The Court retains jurisdiction to sign any QDRO or DOPO in accordance with this division of the retirement accounts\n   </em>\n   . Because the amounts will be equalized, the Court finds this to be an equal division and therefore will not include any amounts for these items on the balance sheet.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (Emphasis added.) (June 29, 2016 Divorce Decree at 12.) Since the divorce decree contemplated issuing a qualified domestic relations order or division of property order in the future and did not resolve the division of the retirement accounts including the military benefits, the divorce decree was not a final appealable order.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   A final order determines the whole case, or a distinct branch thereof, and reserves nothing for future determination, so that it will not be necessary to bring the cause before the court for further proceedings.

A DOPO is inconsistent with a decree when it modifies the division of retirement benefits ordered in the decree, and a DOPO modifies a division of retirement benefits when the DOPO varies from, enlarges, or diminishes the awards the court ordered in the decree.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n   <em>\n    Cameron\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13. The October 2, 2017 Military Retired Pay Division Order, therefore, is a final appealable order as to the division of retirement accounts as it resolves the final issue of the division of retirement benefits. Mr. Taylor's October 30, 2017 notice of appeal is therefore timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Mr. Taylor argues, in his assignment of error, that the trial court erred in assigning Ms. Taylor as the irrevocable beneficiary under the SBP. Mr. Taylor argues that the language of the divorce decree is not ambiguous and does not contain any indication about the SBP and therefore the trial court erred in modifying the divorce decree by assigning Ms. Taylor as beneficiary. However, Ms. Taylor was already the beneficiary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Mr. Taylor cites\n   <em>\n    Robins\n   </em>\n   to argue that the divorce decree cannot be modified at a later date, or clarified, interpreted, or enforced.\n   <em>\n    Robins\n   </em>\n   , however, goes on to state that a court may reserve continuing jurisdiction over the distribution of vested pension or retirement benefits that have not matured. As discussed previously, the trial court specifically reserved jurisdiction to sign any DOPO, \"The Court\n   retains jurisdiction to sign any QDRO or DOPO in accordance with this division of the retirement accounts.\" (June 29, 2016 Divorce Decree at 12.) \"A domestic relations court lacks jurisdiction to revisit the division of property in a divorce or dissolution unless its final judgment or decree contains an express reservation of continuing jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Schrader v.

The trial court was within its jurisdiction in affirming survivorship benefits for Ms. Taylor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Robins\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 10} When a decree that contains terms ordered by the trial court and not reached by agreement of the parties, a determination that such a decree is or is not ambiguous will be overturned on appeal only if the trial court abused its discretion.\n   <em>\n    Robins\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14 ; see\n   <em>\n    Blakemore\n   </em>\n   . The stipulations between the parties did not contain any provisions about the assignment of survivorship benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Mr. Taylor further argues that under federal law military survivor benefits may only be awarded in the original divorce decree. Mr. Taylor quotes\n   <em>\n    Rafferty v. Office of Personnel Mgt.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8975743\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/407/1317/\">\n    407 F.3d 1317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fed.Cir.2005) extensively and argues that because there was no mention of survivor benefits in the stipulations or the June 29, 2016 divorce decree then the trial court erred as a matter of law by violating 5 U.S.C. 8341(H)(4). The argument is that the Office of Personnel Management will not follow the October 2, 2017 order as it is not the first order dividing property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 12} It appears that federal law is clear that a first order dividing marital property cannot be modified after the retirement or death of the employee. This remains true even if a state court specifically retains jurisdiction to issue a QDRO or DOPO.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hinojosa v.
