WRIGHT, P.J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   {\u00b6 1} Appellant, Alison Ward, appeals the September 19, 2017 judgment terminating her parental rights and granting permanent custody of her four minor children to the Geauga County Department of Job and Family Services (\"GCDJFS\"). We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On June 10, 2014, GCDJFS filed a complaint alleging that appellant's children, J.W., M.W., L.W., and K.W., were neglected and dependent children and that L.W. was also an abused child. The complaint alleged that in June of 2014, appellant was intoxicated and contacted the police seeking the removal of her children from the home. She had threatened the children causing them to be fearful for their safety. The police removed the children and placed them into temporary custody of GCDJFS. Appellant was arrested and charged with domestic violence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Dotty Ciciretto was appointed guardian ad litem (\"GAL\") for the children. On October 31, 2014, the children were adjudicated dependent and L.W. was also found to be abused. The children were placed together in a foster home in central Ohio, moved to a second in Geauga County, and finally a third in Bowling Green, Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Appellant was convicted of attempted child endangering, and in October 2015, she violated the terms of her probation. Thereafter, she successfully completed treatment for alcohol addiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 5} In December of 2015, the children's father, James Ward, moved for legal custody of the children. He was represented by counsel at the time, but his attorney moved to withdraw in January of 2016 citing fundamental disagreements with her client's directives. The trial court granted counsel's motion to withdraw and noted in part, \"the Court will not appoint a third free lawyer to father to pursue his private custody claim.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On May 5, 2016, GCDJFS moved the court to grant legal custody of the children to their paternal aunt and uncle, Susan and Steven Manning (\"the Mannings\"). The children's father is listed on the certificate of service as residing in South Carolina. He did not file anything in opposition to this motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Father also filed a motion for a Thanksgiving visit that states in part that he does not have a driver's license, but that he owns a four-bedroom home that he would like the children to visit and \"see the home that they would be living in.\" The trial court noted that it would address his motion for a Thanksgiving visit at the upcoming motions hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Thereafter, father moved for an eight-week continuance of the hearing explaining that he was physically unable to attend due to his physical injuries. He states he is unable to work, travel, and is \"medicated\" due to tremendous pain. He also moved for copies of all court records and another motion for court-appointed counsel on November 28, 2016. His motion for counsel was denied because he failed to complete the necessary paperwork and provide copies of his 2015 tax returns and 2016 pay stubs. The trial court also overruled father's motion for a continuance because he failed to provide anything from a doctor validating his injuries. Notwithstanding, the trial court permitted father to participate in the upcoming proceedings via Skype or telephone and ordered him to provide his current contact information to the court to facilitate his participation in the proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 9} At the December 5, 2016 hearing the trial court noted that father failed to appear and that it attempted to contact him via phone without success. Notwithstanding his absence, the trial court again considered his motions and found that he had not produced the necessary documentation to establish indigency for court-appointed counsel and likewise failed to provide the court with documentation verifying his injuries and inability to attend the court proceedings. Thus, his motions to continue and appointed counsel were denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The parties present at the hearing agreed for legal custody of the children to be placed with the Mannings, finding in part:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 11} \"The Court hereby finds that in the best interests of the children, legal custody of J.W., M.W., L.W., &amp; K.W. is granted to Susan and Steven Manning effective June 15, 2017. GCJFS shall continue to maintain temporary custody of J.W., M.W., L.W., &amp; K.W. until June 15, 2017. GCJFS shall continue to maintain J.W., M.W., L.W., &amp; K.W. in their current foster\n   home placement with Mr. &amp; Mrs. Brown through the end of the 2016-2017 schoolyear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 12} \"Marty Gelfand, counsel for [appellant], indicated that [she] wishes to withdraw her Motion for Dispositional Order Returning Children to mother at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 13} \"* * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 14} \"The Case Plan shall continue as previously Ordered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 15} \"[Appellant's] visitation with the children shall continue as previously Ordered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 16} \"The children shall continue to attend individual counseling services as recommended by their counselor(s).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 17} \"GCJFS shall make a referral to initiate family counseling services for [appellant] and the children. GCJFS shall use its best efforts to facilitate ongoing family counseling for [appellant] and the children as recommended by the children's counselor(s) and the family counselor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 18} \"[Appellant] is permitted to exchange text messages with the children; said text messages are subject to monitoring by GCJFS and the foster parents.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 19} In this decision, the trial court likewise ordered all contact between the children and their father be suspended and ordered him to have no contact with appellant, the Mannings, or the foster parents. Father did not appeal this decision or file any other motions or pleadings after this December 2016 decision, and his last visitation with the children was approximately January of 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Pursuant to the foregoing, appellant communicated with the children via text messages. On January 31, 2017, appellant and J.W., the oldest child, engaged in a back and forth text communication during which appellant referred to continued phone calls she had been receiving from the GAL and complained of J.W.'s attitude. Appellant told J.W. she was glad she was not with her. The exchange ended after appellant stated: \"you want to be an idiot I tried three and a half hours so you can be a b****,\" and appellant told J.W. that she would not be visiting the following weekend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Appellant contacted a GCDJFS case worker the following day indicating that she no longer wished to have visitation with the children because they had bad attitudes, were too critical of her, and showed her no respect. As a result, GCDJFS filed a motion to suspend contact. In March of 2017, the trial court suspended contact between appellant and her children, except in writing through greeting cards. Thereafter, appellant had a change of heart and filed three motions to restore supervised visitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 22} The two oldest children, J.W. and M.W., subsequently expressed concerns to the GAL that they do not want to live with the Mannings. However, the two youngest children, L.W. and K.W., still wanted to live with the Mannings. The GAL obtained letters from the children's case worker in which J.W. and M.W. expressed their wishes to remain in their Bowling Green foster home. The GAL attached the letters to her March 3, 2017 report. The GAL attempted to arrange a meeting with Mrs. Manning to discuss the fact that the two oldest children now wished to remain in foster care even though the trial court had already granted legal custody of all four to the Mannings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 23} According to Mrs. Manning, beginning January 2017, she began feeling intimidated by the GAL and Attorney Jeffrey Orndorff, counsel for J.W., to step aside as legal custodians despite the fact that the trial court had already granted the Mannings custody. At an April 4, 2017\n   meeting, which included representatives from GCDJFS, the GAL and Attorney Orndorff informed Mrs. Manning that if she and her husband stepped aside and decided not to accept legal custody of the children, GCDJFS would be left with no kinship placement. Thus, GCDJFS would have no choice but to file for permanent custody of the children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 24} On April 18, 2017, appellant filed a motion to remove the GAL based on her unwillingness to follow the trial court's December 16, 2016 order granting legal custody to the Mannings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 25} At an April 19, 2017 meeting with GCDJFS representatives, the Mannings informed them that they no longer wanted to serve as the children's legal custodians, given the statements of the two oldest children. On April 27, 2017, Attorney Orndorff filed a motion to modify placement and requested the trial court vacate its December 16, 2016 order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Following a status hearing, the trial court granted appellant's motion to remove the GAL and appointed two new GALs, one for the two older children and another for the two younger ones. On May 24, 2017, appellant filed a motion requesting a dispositional order returning the children to her. The GCDJFS also filed a motion requesting permanent custody of all four children. On June 30, 2017, the court vacated its December 16, 2016 judgment granting legal custody to the Mannings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Following a permanent custody hearing in August of 2017, the trial court granted GCDJFS's motion for permanent custody on September 19, 2017. Neither father nor his representative appeared at the hearing. The trial court found he abandoned the children, and he is not a party to this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Appellant raises four assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 29} \"[1.] The trial court committed reversible, plain error by acting outside the bounds of its jurisdiction when it extended temporary custody of the children to the Geauga County Department of Job and Family Services beyond the two-year limitation mandated by R.C. 2151.415(D)(4) in its judgment issued December 16, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 30} \"[2.] The trial court committed plain, reversible error by acting outside the bounds of its jurisdiction when it proceeded to entertain custodial motions after it had ostensibly vacated its December 16, 2016 judgment entry granting legal custody to the Mannings, and failed to return the children into either their mother's custody, or into the legal custody of the Mannings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 31} \"[3.] The court committed reversible error when it found that the Geauga County Department of Job and Family Services had engaged in reasonable case planning and diligent efforts to assist Ms. Ward in repairing her relationships with her children and to finalize permanency for the children after those efforts were subverted by a rogue GAL, acting beyond the scope of her appointment, and assisted by the children's counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 32} \"[4.] The court committed reversible error when it permitted counsel for the Department of Job and Family Services to prosecute the permanent custody motion despite the fact that the same attorney had previously represented mother during the pendency of the proceedings pursuant to an indigent court appointment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 33} \"[I]t is well established that a parent's right to raise a child is an essential and basic civil right.\n   <em>\n    In re Hayes\n   </em>\n   (1997),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"278453\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/79/46/\">\n    79 Ohio St.3d 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 48 * * *,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=679%20N.E.2d%20680\">\n    679 N.E.2d 680\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

While the trial court found that appellant is addressing her issues with alcoholism, it also found that her mental abuse of the children was ongoing. Appellant's February 2017 text messages to the children demonstrate that she continues to blame the children for her problems and continues her destructive verbal abuse toward them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 47} Thus, appellant's first and second assigned errors lack merit since the trial\n   court continued to have jurisdiction to issue a dispositional order in the best interest of the children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 48} In her third assigned error, appellant asserts the trial court erred in finding that GCDJFS had engaged in reasonable case planning and diligent efforts to assist her in repairing her relationships with her children and to finalize permanency for the children after those efforts were subverted by a rogue GAL, acting beyond the scope of her appointment, and assisted by the children's counsel. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 49} As alleged, the trial court found that the children's prior GAL acted inappropriately by conveying the two older children's wishes that they did not want to reside with the Mannings. Consequently, the Mannings eventually withdrew their request for custody even though custody had already been awarded to them, but had not yet become effective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 50} The Manning's withdrawal of their custody request, however, does not establish that GCDJFS failed to make reasonable efforts to make it possible for the children to return home. As found by the trial court, GCDJFS was not complicit in this conduct, and instead attempted to maintain the grant of custody to the Mannings to no avail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 51} R.C. 2151.419(A)(1) provides that when a child is removed from a home or continues to be removed, the children services agency must show it made \"reasonable efforts to prevent the removal of the child from the child's home, to eliminate the continued removal of the child from the child's home, or to make it possible for the child to return safely home.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 52} However, \" R.C. 2151.419(A)(1) does not apply in a hearing on a motion for permanent custody filed pursuant to R.C. 2151.413.\"\n   <em>\n    In re C.F.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5805729\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/113/73/\">\n    113 Ohio St.3d 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007-Ohio-1104\">\n    2007-Ohio-1104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=862%20N.E.2d%20816\">\n    862 N.E.2d 816\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 53} Here, GCDJFS moved for permanent custody pursuant to R.C. 2151.413(D)(1) because the children had been in its custody for 12 or more months of a consecutive 22-month period, and as such, the trial court did not have to assess the reasonable efforts put forth by GCDJFS at the permanent custody hearing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=862%20N.E.2d%20816\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Notwithstanding, the court found in its decision granting permanent custody that GCDJFS made reasonable efforts to reunify the family.

She contends the trial court erred in permitting Donovan DeLuca, counsel for GCDJFS, to prosecute the permanent custody motion even though he had previously represented appellant during the\n   pendency of the proceedings pursuant to court appointment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 58} Attorney DeLuca was appointed by the trial court on August 4, 2014 as appellant's co-counsel along with the Geauga County Assistant Public Defender, Colleen R. Del Balso, to represent her at an adjudicatory hearing set seven days later, August 11, 2014. The next day, August 5, 2014, the Geauga County Assistant Public Defender moved for leave to withdraw as counsel for appellant. For cause, Del Balso details her efforts to meet with appellant, and appellant's responses in which she cancels the prescheduled meetings. Del Balso also advises the court of appellant's repeated statements that she is hiring Attorney Paul Mooney to represent her. The trial court granted Del Balso's motion on the same day it was filed. Attorney Paul Mooney filed his notice of appearance for appellant, a motion for discovery, and a motion to continue the adjudicatory hearing on August 7, 2014. Attorney DeLuca is not listed as co-counsel and is likewise not listed in the certificate of service. The trial court granted appellant's motions on August 8, 2014 and does not list Attorney DeLuca as an attorney receiving a copy of the judgment via Civ.R. 58(B). On August 13, 2014, the trial court sua sponte \"dismisses\" Attorney DeLuca as appellant's attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 59} There are no pleadings filed on appellant's behalf by Attorney DeLuca, and appellant does not direct our attention to any resulting prejudice from DeLuca's limited appearance.

The Supreme Court held that there was a clear\n   <em>\n    possibility\n   </em>\n   of a conflict of interest and that the trial court knew or should have known that a possible conflict of interest existed that could have affected counsel's representation.
