Timothy Abraham and the Estate of Raymond Bechtel appeal the trial court's orders that granted summary judgment to Anthony Bonkoski, Trustee of the Bonkoski Family Trust, on his trespass claim, and subsequently granted a permanent injunction. This Court reverses with respect to all appellants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 2} The Bonkoski Family Trust owns land that lies west of Vermillion Road. The Estate of Raymond Bechtel owns farmland east of Vermillion Road, and Timothy Abraham farms that property under a lease. Since the early 1900s, the Bechtel property and other land east of Vermillion Road have drained to the west toward Vermillion Road and the Bonkoski property. Sometime between 1900 and 1950, a system of drainage tiles was installed on the Bechtel property. In 1951, the former owners of the Bonkoski property created a man-made lake located at the bottom of a steep ravine just west of Vermillion Road. Around 1970, Lorain County constructed a thirty-six-inch culvert underneath Vermillion Road that drains the water that flows east to west from the Bechtel property and other properties toward Vermillion Road and onto the Bonkoski property. Around 2005, Lorain County installed a new cap on\n   the side of the culvert that also measured thirty-six inches in diameter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Mr. Bonkoski filed a complaint on behalf of the Bonkoski Family Trust against Raymond Bechtel (now deceased), Timothy Abraham, who farms the Bechtel property, and Lorain County, alleging negligence and trespass and seeking a permanent injunction to stop the flow of water through the culvert and onto the Bonkoski property. Lorain County moved for summary judgment, alleging that it was immune from suit under R.C. Chapter 2744. Mr. Bonkoski moved for summary judgment as to liability against each defendant; Mr. Bechtel and Mr. Abraham, in turn, moved for summary judgment on each of Mr. Bonkoski's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On January 26, 2017, the trial court ruled on the parties' motions for summary judgment. The trial court dismissed Mr. Bonkoski's negligence claims against each defendant based on the statute of limitations. With respect to Lorain County, the trial court determined that various aspects of Ohio law imposed liability upon the County for trespass and denied the County's motion for summary judgment on that basis. With respect to all defendants, the trial court concluded that the water that flows from the Bechtel property through the culvert is not \"surface water\" and granted summary judgment on liability to Mr. Bonkoski. Lorain County immediately appealed the trial court's decision regarding immunity under R.C. 2744.02(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 5} After the trial court granted the motion for summary judgment on the defendants' liability for trespass, Mr. Bonkoski moved for a permanent injunction against all defendants. Lorain County opposed the motion because, among other reasons, its immunity appeal was pending in this Court at the time. On March 20, 2017, the trial court entered a permanent injunction against all defendants:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Therefore, it is hereby Ordered that the Defendants immediately stop the drain tile water from the Bechtel property from entering Lorain County's catch basin and flowing onto [Mr. Bonkonski's] property. It is hereby Ordered that Defendants Timothy Abraham and Raymond Bechtel immediately disconnect or plug the drain tile pipes that flow into Lorain County's catch basin.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Mr. Bechtel and Mr. Abraham appealed, and on April 28, 2017, the trial court journalized an order providing that there is no just cause for delay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wisintainer v.

CHAPTER 2744 AND SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON PLAINTIFF/APPELLEE'S TRESPASS CLAIM.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 6} In its first assignment of error, Lorain County argues that the trial court erred by considering immunity issues related to claims that Mr. Bonkoski did not assert, by determining that the County did not have a prescriptive easement to drain water onto the Bonkoski land, and by concluding that civil liability\n   was expressly imposed upon the County by a section of the Ohio Revised Code under R.C. 2744.02(B)(5). Because Lorain County has appealed from an order denying summary judgment under R.C. 2744.02(C), its argument regarding the existence of a prescriptive easement is beyond the scope of this appeal. Our discussion is limited to Lorain County's arguments regarding immunity, and in that respect, we agree with the County's final argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Under Civ.R. 56(C), \"[s]ummary judgment will be granted only when there remains no genuine issue of material fact and, when construing the evidence most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party, reasonable minds can only conclude that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Byrd v.

This water did not lose its character as surface water when it percolated below ground, drained across the subsurface drainage tile, or reached the culvert from which it flowed toward a natural outlet. The trial court erred by concluding that the water in this case lost its character as surface water and, consequently, erred by granting summary judgment to Mr. Bonkoski on his trespass claims against Mr. Bechtel and Mr. Abraham without analyzing those claims under the reasonable use standard set forth above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Mr. Bechtel's first assignment of error and Mr. Abraham's third assignment of error are sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   MR.

Lorain County's appeal under R.C. 2744.02(C) pertained to whether the County was immune from liability altogether. The trial court's order that purported to enter a permanent injunction notwithstanding the pending appeal was an ultimate disposition of the merits of Bonkoski's claims-the very claims from which Lorain County sought to be immune. As such, the trial court's permanent injunction was void from its inception with respect to Lorain County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 20} All outstanding motions are denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Lorain County's first assignment of error is sustained, and the trial court's judgment that denied immunity to Lorain County is reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Mr. Bechtel's first assignment of error and Mr. Abraham's third assignment of error are sustained.
