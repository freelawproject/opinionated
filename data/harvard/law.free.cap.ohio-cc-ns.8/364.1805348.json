The fact that the petition filed with the auditor included laterals and only part of said township ditch does not constitute a new ditch.</p><p id=\"b373-6\">Where proceedings are instituted to widen, deepen, etc., any ditch, drain, etc., if to accomplish the purpose of the improvement laterals are necessary, they are a part of the improvement, and therefore when included do not constitute an improvement different from that set forth'in the petition.</p><p id=\"b373-7\">The county commissioners, therefore, not having acquired jurisdiction over the subject-matter set forth in the petition filed with the auditor, the proceedings had by them were a nullity.</p><p id=\"b373-8\">Being a nullity, the probate court acquired no jurisdiction over the subject-matter on appeal, and hence all the proceedings had before said court were a nullity.</p><p id=\"b373-9\">The common pleas court in reversing the judgment of the probate court entered a correct judgment, except it should not' only have reversed the judgment of the probate court, but set aside the proceedings before the county commissioners, and dismissed the petition filed with the auditor. That court having failed to 'enter such judgment the judgment of that court is affirmed as to the reversal of the judgment of the probate court, the proceedings before the county commissioners will be set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>aside, and the petition bled with the auditor by the petitioners for the improvement dismissed.</p><p id=\"b374-4\">If the judgment .rendered by the common pleas court includes costs of proceedings before the county commissioners and probate court, that part of its judgment is reversed; with that exception its judgment will be affirmed. The judgment of this court includes only the costs of the proceedings in error in this court and the cause is remanded to the common pleas court to carry the judgment into execution.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
