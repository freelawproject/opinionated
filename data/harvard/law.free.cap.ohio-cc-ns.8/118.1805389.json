Conard v. Almira Bare.</parties>\n<decisiondate id=\"b126-6\">Decided, April, 1904.</decisiondate>\n\n\n<headnotes id=\"b126-9\">Dustin, J.; Sullivan, J., and Wilson, J., concur.</headnotes>\n\n<summary id=\"b126-11\">\u201cThis agreement entered into this ninth day of October, 1903, between William II. Conard and Almira Bare, both of Miami county, Ohio, witnesseth:</summary>\n\n\n<summary id=\"b126-14\">\u201cWilliam H. Conard.</summary>\n<summary id=\"AfW\">\u201cAlmira Bare.\u201d</summary>\n\n\n\n<summary id=\"b127-6\">We are of the opinion that the demurrer was rightly sustained upon the authority of <em>Frost </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>8th Ohio, 393, and <em>Bloomer </em>v. <em>Gist, </em>4 N. P., 411-415, as well as upon the general principle governing accord and satisfaction.</summary>\n\n<attorneys id=\"b127-8\"><em>Bobert J. Smith, </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b127-9\"><em>A. F. Broomhall, </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion><p id=\"b126-3\">COMPROMISE AGREEMENT AS TO BREACH OF PROMISE TO MARRY.</p><p id=\"b126-7\">\n<em>Accord and Satisfaction\u2014And Accord without Satisfaction\u2014Neither Party Bound by Such an Agreement\u2014Until He has Yielded Some Right or Advantage.</em>\n</p><p id=\"b126-8\">An agreement of accord and satisfaction in full release of a promise of marriage is witliout binding force so long as it remains unexecuted, or-so long as tbe party complaining of the'failure to execute the agreement of accord is unable to show a surrender of anything or the loss of .any right by reason of entering into the agreement.</p><p id=\"b126-10\">October 9, 1903, plaintiff and defendant executed the following :</p><p id=\"b126-12\">\u201cThat whereas said parties have heretofore on or about February 15, 1903, entered into a contract of marriage, and on or about September 19, 1903, said Almira Bare did notify said William H. Conard that she refused to carry out said contract of marriage with him, by reason of which said William H. Conard claims to be injured in his feelings and property, etc., and the parties hereto having mutually agreed to the amount of compensation to be paid said William IT. Conard for his damages sustained by reason of the breaking of said contract, in the sum of four thousand dollars, which sum is now paid or secured to be paid to said Conard, the receipt of which he hereby acknowledges, they herewith release each other from all obligations under said contract of marriage.</p><p id=\"b126-13\">\u201cSigned in duplicate this 9th day of October, 1903.</p><p id=\"b126-16\">Almira\u2019s cash not being forthcoming to William, he brought this action on the above agreement for $4,000, with interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>from October 9th, 1903, alleging that said agreement on her part was \u201cin consideration of a full release from <em>all consequences </em>of defendant\u2019s breach of a promise to marry plaintiff\u201d; also alleging \u201cthat relying upon the verbal promise o\u00ed defendant to immediately deliver to him four thousand dollars or its equivalent, he signed and delivered to her, the defendant, one of the aforesaid copies of their agreement, but that defendant had refused to pay him the said $4,000 or any part thereof,\u201d etc.</p><p id=\"b127-4\">Defendant demurred on the ground that the petition shows an \u201caccord\u201d but no satisfaction, and hence is not sufficient foundation for an action.</p><p id=\"b127-5\">The common pleas court sustained the demurrer, and plaintiff not wishing to plead further, the petition was dismissed,' and plaintiff prosecuted error to this court.</p><p id=\"b127-7\">Nothing was done by either party to carry out the agreement. Of course plaintiff was not bound by it until defendant paid or tendered the money, and she was not bound until he had yielded some right or advantage'. But he had given up nothing, mot even the love letters of his late sweetheart. I-Ie was in <em>statu quo. </em>If he had brought suit and in consideration of the agreement had dismissed it, the situation would have been different. If, relying on the agreement, he had lost the right to sue within the statutory limit, he might probably bring this action. But he gave up nothing; lost nothing, except of course the affections of the defendant. His civil rights are the same as they were before the violation of the agreement, and he can sue for breach of the promise of marriage, the same as if nothing had occurred. It is, therefore, in our opinion a clear case of accord without satisfaction, and the judgment of the common pleas court is affirmed.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
