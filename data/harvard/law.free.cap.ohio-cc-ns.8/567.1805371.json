We think it is clear that the statute under which bids were received for the public moneys, confines the bidders to those banking corporations which have their <em>situs </em>in the county, and that the Cleveland Trust Company is situate, not in this county, though it has a bank here, but the corporation is located elsewhere.</summary>\n\n<attorneys id=\"b575-14\"><em>Slabaugh &amp; Seiberling, </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b575-15\"><em>H.

We do not think we can improve upon that opinion, and we reach the conclusion reached by him. The same order will be made here as ivas made in the court below.</p><p id=\"b575-13\">Upon the opinion announced by Judge Wanamaker in the court of common pleas we pronounce the judgment that the injunction prayed for in the suit by Alexander be allowed, and the mandamus brought by the trust company be dismissed.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
