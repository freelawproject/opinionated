Hence it was beyond the pale of George R. Griffiths\u2019 official duties to receive the money as alleged in the petition.</p><p id=\"b128-11\">We do not think this is a case of acts done <em>colore officii </em>because there were no other similar acts pertaining to his office prescribed by law.</p><p id=\"b128-12\">It is different in this respect from levies made by constables and sheriffs on strangers\u2019 goods.</p><p id=\"b128-13\">The contention made by Mr. Waite that there was a breach of duty in failing to order the person paying the money to pay the same to the treasurer, is entitled to some weight. There are two objections to this:</p><p id=\"b128-15\">Second. This did not cause the loss; the loss was made by Griffiths unlawfully appropriating the money to his own use after it had improperly come into his hands.</p><p id=\"b128-16\">Applying the principles <em>strictissimi juris </em>shielding sureties we think the court below did right in sustaining the demurrer to the third amended petition against said sureties.</p><p id=\"b128-17\">Judgment affirmed.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
