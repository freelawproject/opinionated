Dale, </em>for the motion.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b496-16\"><em>Maxwell &amp; Bamsey, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b496-17\"> Affirmed by the Supreme Court .without report, 73 O. S., 381.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion><p id=\"b496-7\">JURISDICTION IN EQUITY.</p><p id=\"b496-14\">The motion to dismiss the appeal in this case should be overruled. Plaintiff\u2019s cause of action is purely equitable. No right to a jury existed. The right to have the deed declared a mortgage and the right to have the transaction declared a loan for $15,000 was wholly within the jurisdiction of a court of equity, and could not be tried to a jury. Whether or not a case is appealable depends upon the relief sought, and here it is equitable.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
