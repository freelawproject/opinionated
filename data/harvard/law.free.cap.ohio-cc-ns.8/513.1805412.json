Under Section 546 of the Revised Statutes, probate judges are entitled to receive six cents for each one hundred words of orders entered on the journal.</p><p id=\"b521-11\">2. Under the same section they are not entitled to thirty-five cents for each certificate under the seal of the court to the copies of the certificate of the medical witness and of his findings in the case as required by Section 705.</p><p id=\"b521-14\">Error to Columbiana Common Pleas Court.</p><p id=\"b521-15\">Plaintiff in error is the probate judge of this county and he brought a suit in mandamus to compel the auditor to allow two claims for fees which the inspector had instructed the auditor to reject and in accordance with which instruction ,the auditor did reject.</p><p id=\"b521-16\">The common pleas court sustained a demurrer to the petition. The first claim was for entering orders upon his journal in inquests of insanity.</p><p id=\"b521-17\">Section 546 of the Revised Statutes provides for the fees of probate judges in counties having twenty-two thousand five hundred inhabitants or more, and for services of this character the language is: \u201cEntering order on journal, six cents; each one hundred words,\u201d etc.</p><p id=\"b521-18\">The claim of plaintiff is that he is entitled to six cents for each one hundred words contained in the order entered upon the journal, while the claim of defendant in error is that he is only entitled to six cents for entering the entire order independent of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>its length. We are of the opinion that the plaintiff is right in his contention.</p><p id=\"b522-4\">Defendant relies principally upon the punctuation of the statute to support his claim. It will be observed that the services performed are first mentioned, then the fee he is entitled to receive. For instance: \u2018 \u2018 Issuing a subpoena where there is but one witness named, eight cents, and for each additional name, three cents; entering attendance of each witness, five cents; indexing each cause, eight cents; entering judgment on journal, eight cents; recording general verdict, eight cents; entering order on journal, six cents; each one hundred words, for transcribing judgment or order on the docket, eight cents. \u2019 \u2019 Clearly the semicolon is in the wrong place; likewise the comma. The semi-colon should have been placed after \u201ceach one hundred words\u201d and the comma after \u201csix cents.\u201d</p><p id=\"b522-5\">It is true the same punctuation has been carried through the various revisions of the statutes for many years. That is unimportant, as it could easily arise from a clerical error. That the punctuation is wrong in this section is made clear when we turn to Section 1260, providing for the fees of clerks of court, which are of the same character: \u201cFor entering an order, verdict, rule or judgment on the journal, eight cents for each one hundred words. <em>\u201d</em></p><p id=\"b522-6\">\u201cPunctuating ought never to vary the true sense or the general object, and the courts can disregard or repudiate it.\u201d</p><p id=\"b522-7\">The other claim which was rejected by the auditor was for fees for certificates attached to copies of his findings, and also attached to the certificate of the medical witnesses.</p><p id=\"b522-8\">Section 546, to which we have referred, provides that he shall receive for \u201ceach certificate, to which the seal of the court is required, and not herein provided for, thirty-five cents.\u201d It further provides: \u201cMaking out copies of records of any proceedings in a cause, when required by either party or the law, with seal annexed, eight cents for each one hundred words. \u2019 \u2019</p><p id=\"b522-9\">Section 705 provides:</p><p id=\"b522-10\">\u201cThe probate judge, upon receiving the certificate of the medical witness, made out according to the provisions of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>preceding section, shall forthwith apply to the superintendent of the asylum for the insane, situated in the district in which such patient resides; he shall, at the same time, transmit copies under his official seal of the certificate of the medcal witness, and of his findings in the case; upon receiving the application and certificate, the superintendent shall immediately advise the probate judge whether the patient can be received, and if so, at what time. \u2019 \u2019</p><p id=\"b523-5\">Section 714 provides:</p><p id=\"b523-6\">\u201cIn all cases of inquests held under the provisions of this chapter, the probate judge shall file and preserve all papers left with him, and shall make such entries upon his docket as will, together with the papers so filed, preserve a perfect record of each case tried by him.\u201d</p><p id=\"b523-7\">From these provisions it would seem that the certificate of the medical witness and his findings are part of the record in the proceeding and, as payment is provided for the same under Section - 546 at eight cents for each one hundred words, he is not entitled to be paid for the certificates in addition to the eight cents for each one hundred words.</p><p id=\"b523-8\">Judgment of common pleas court is reversed and cause remanded for further proceedings.</p><p id=\"b523-10\"><em>.C. S. Speaker, </em>for defendant in error.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
