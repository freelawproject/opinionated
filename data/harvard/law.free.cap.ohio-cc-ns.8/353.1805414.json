A traveler is never wholly absolved from using bis faculties to avoid danger, and in an action growing out of an accident at a grade crossing, a charge to the jury is erroneous which makes the railroad company liable on account of the negligence of the watchman in failing to signal danger, independent of the fact that the decedent and her- husband, who was riding with her, depended on the watchman more than on their own faculties to discover whether a train was coming.</p><p id=\"b361-11\">2. In such a case the extent to which the decedent and her husband used their senses to discover whether a train was approaching, or the degree of negligence, if any, of Which they were guilty, are Questions for the jury.</p><p id=\"b361-13\">3. While it is true that the burden of proving contributory-negligence is on the defendant, an exception arises to the rule where the plaintiff\u2019s own testimony raises a presumption of contributory negligence.</p><p id=\"b361-16\">This action arose from an accident that occurred at a railroad crossing where a flagman was maintained. Dr. Taylor, the husband of the deceased, testified that he had frequently observed a flagman seated in his box when no train was approaching the crossing; that on the occasion of the accident, he saw no flagman on the track; that-the door of the flagman\u2019s box faced the east; that he approached the track from the west, his horse moving on a slow trot; that his view of the track in the direction from which the train was running was obstructed.</p><p id=\"b362-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>The jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of $3,500, which the court reduced to the sum of $3,000, and rendered judgment therefor.</p><p id=\"b362-4\">It is claimed that the court erred in overruling the motion to arrest the case from the jury at the conclusion of plaintiff\u2019s testimony. In the case of <em>The Cincinnati, Hamilton </em>c&amp; <em>Dayton Railway Company </em>v. <em>Walter F. Taylor, </em>growing out of the same accident, this court held upon a- like motion that the court properly overruled a similar motion. The evidence in this case is substantially the same, and a like ruling will be made in this case.</p><p id=\"b362-5\">It is further claimed that the court erred in giving the following instruction in its general charge:</p><p id=\"b362-6\">\u201cIf the flagman was absent from his place of duty, or was not giving any signal or warning when she attempted to pass over the crossing, it is not contributory negligence on her part to drive through without stopping to look or listen, though the view is obstructed, in order that the cars' could have been seen a few feet away. \u2019 \u2019</p><p id=\"b362-7\">It will be observed that the decedent was not relieved by this charge of the duty of looking and listening only of the duty of stopping for that purpose. It is not entirely clear what is meant by \u201cthe absence of the flagman from his place of duty,\u201d but inasmuch as the testimony discloses that the flagman was in the box at the side of 'the crossing, it must be inferred that the court intended to state only if the flagman was not on the crossing or not visible, so that any signal given by him could be seen by the decedent or her husband. Applying the charge to the evidence in the case, there is no error in giving it. See the case of <em>Railroad </em>v. <em>Schneider, </em>45 O. S., 678.</p><p id=\"b362-8\">The following paragraph in the general charge is also claimed to be erroneous:</p><p id=\"b362-9\">\u201cIf you find from a preponderance of the evidence that the decedent knew there was a flagman at this crossing, that he was absent from his place of duty upon this occasion, or failed to give the signal of danger, and she had no other knowledge of the danger, the railroad company would be liable providing you find from the evidence the collision was the proximate cause of her death. \u2019 \u2019</p><p id=\"b363-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>This charge makes the railroad company liable for the negligence of the flagman provided the decedent knew that a flagman was maintained at this crossing, and had no other knowledge of the danger, independent of whether she or her husband looked or listened for an approaching train. In the former case we said:</p><p id=\"b363-5\">\u201cA traveler is never wholly absolved from using his faculties to avoid danger, and what would or would not amount to the exercise'of ordinary care depends upon the circumstances of each case, and is properly one 'of fact to be determined by the jury.\u201d</p><p id=\"b363-7\">\u201cIf it is customary for a railroad corporation to have a flagman at a crossing at grade of a highway by the railroad, and he is absent, this does not excuse a traveler on the highway from looking to see if a train is coming before he attempts to cross the railroad tracks, where there is no obstacle to prevent his seeing.\u201d</p><p id=\"b363-9\">\u201cIf it is customary to have one (flagman) at a crossing, and he \u00a1is absent, a traveler has a right to rely to some extent on this fact; but this does not excuse his not looking at all to see if a train is coming, Avhen there are no obstacles to prevent his seeing if he looks.\u201d</p><p id=\"b363-11\">\u201cOne Avho approaches a railroad crossing with which he is familiar, and attempts to cross without looking and listening for approaching trains, where it is possible to do so, is guilty of such contributory negligence as precludes him from a recovery if he is injured, although the crossing Avas supplied Avith a flagman, and the flagman did not give notice of the approach of danger. A person attempting to cross should not have the right to assume, from that circumstance, that no danger existed, and enter upon the railroad track Avithout looking. Had the flagman done anything to induce the appellant to attempt the crossing at the time she Avas hurt, or anything to throw her off <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>her guard, then the question of her negligence would have been a question for the jury.\u201d</p><p id=\"b364-4\">It does not appear from the testimony that the doctor or his wife wholly failed to use their senses to ascertain whether a train was approaching. The extent to which they did use them, or the degree of negligence, if any, in not using them, were questions for the jury which were excluded by that part of the general charge last quoted. It seems, therefore, that the charge was clearly erroneous and'prejudicial.</p><p id=\"b364-5\">The court also charged that the burden of proving contributory negligence is on the defendant. While this is true ordinarily, it is not so when the plaintiff\u2019s own testimony raises the presumption of contributory negligence. We think in this ease the court should have qualified the charge in this respect. The evidence was sufficient to show that death resulted from the accident.</p><p id=\"b364-6\">It is also claimed that the testimony of the actuary pertained to the expectation of Doctor Taylor\u2019s life alone, whereas the joint expectation of the doctor and his wife must control. It appears, however, from the bill of exceptions, at page 51, that the actuary did give the expectation of,the joint lives of a woman 45 years old and a man 84 years old. We think the doctor was qualified to testify as to the value of his wife\u2019s services, although we may not agree with him in the amount fixed, nor were the jury bound by it.</p><p id=\"b364-7\">We are not disposed to disturb the judgment upon the ground that the damages are excessive, although it is not free from doubt.</p><p id=\"b364-8\">Judgment reversed, and cause remanded for a new trial.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
