The intervening decision by the Supreme Court in <em>Bush v. Lucas, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 2404, 76 L.Ed.2d 648 (1983), requires the recall of our original opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-17\">In <em>Bush v. Lucas, </em>the Supreme Court declined \u201cto authorize a new nonstatutory damages remedy for federal employees whose First Amendment rights are violated by their superiors,\u201d because the claims there presented arose out of \u201can employment relationship governed by comprehensive procedural and substantive provisions.\u201d Id., \u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 103 S.Ct. at 2406, 76 L.Ed. at 651. <em>Bush v. Lucas </em>involved an employee complaining of an adverse personnel action allegedly triggered by public statements of the employee. Administrative remedies were available and were exercised. The instant case involves a former employee who complains of mistreatment in reemployment because of union activity during the prior period of employment. A measure of administrative remedies was available and was exercised.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-21\">We cannot make a principled distinction between an employee and a former employee seeking re-employment, in the context as here presented, sufficient to base a holding that the teachings of <em>Bush v. Lucas </em>do not control. We consider <em>Bush </em>v. <em>Lucas </em>disposi-tive.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-22\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
