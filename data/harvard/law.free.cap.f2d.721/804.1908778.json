Department of Justice, </em>MSPB Docket No. DA315H8210001. We hold that we do not, and accordingly, we dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b875-13\">Petitioner, Johnny Granado, Jr., was formerly employed as a border patrol agent with the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). By a letter dated August 27, 1981, petitioner was informed that he was being terminated effective September 11, 1981, prior to the completion of his one year probationary period, due to deficiencies in his work performance. The letter advised petitioner that he could appeal the removal decision to the MSPB if he believed the discharge was based upon discrimination because of partisan political reasons or marital status. If he felt the termination was due to discrimination because of race or national origin, he was advised to consult an INS Equal Employment Opportunity Counselor within 30 days of the effective date of the termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-20\">Petitioner filed a complaint with an INS Equal Employment Opportunity Counselor on September 29,1981, alleging that he was discharged because of his national origin. On September 30, 1981, he filed an appeal with the Dallas Regional Office of the MSPB, also alleging discrimination based on national origin. Petitioner contended that the MSPB had jurisdiction of such a complaint under Section 8-4a(5) of Chapter 315 of the Federal Personnel Manual (FPM). The Dallas Regional Office dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, holding that under 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.806(b) and (d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a probationary employee could allege discrimination based on national origin only if he raised such discrimination in addition to alleging discrimination based on partisan political reasons or marital status. By an order dated March 23, 1982, the MSPB denied petitioner\u2019s petition for review of the initial decision, after which petitioner brought this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-21\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b875-22\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b875-23\">The jurisdiction of this court over appeals from the MSPB is governed by 28 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>\u00a7 1295(a)(9) (Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1982 (\u201cthe Act\u201d), Pub.L. No. 97-164, \u00a7 127(a), 96 Stat. 25) and by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(b) and (d) (as <em>amended </em>by the Act, \u00a7 144). 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9) gives the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit exclusive jurisdiction \u201cof an appeal from a final order or final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 7703(b)(1) and 7703(d) of title 5 * * <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Section 7703(b)(1) of title 5 states that \u201cexcept as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, a petition to review a final order or final decision of the board (MSPB) shall be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.\u201d Paragraph (2) of \u00a7 7703(b) provides that \u201ccases of discrimination subject to the provisions of \u00a7 7702 of this title shall be filed under \u00a7 717(c) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 <em>* * </em>Section 7702 of title 5 and \u00a7 717(c) of the Civil Rights Act provide a very elaborate and detailed procedure to follow in actions dealing with discrimination, which involves the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the federal district courts, but not the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. <em>Williams v. Department of the Army, </em>715 F.2d 1485 (Fed.Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">In this case, petitioner\u2019s claim of discrimination based upon national origin would have brought him under the provisions of \u00a7 7702 if he had not been a probationary employee. However, as a probationary employee his rights of appeal were restricted by statute and regulation. Although 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(a) grants an employee in the competitive service who is not serving a probationary period the right to appeal to the MSPB, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7501(1) and 7511(a)(1) specifically exclude individuals in their probationary period from the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d for purposes of the type of removal action involved here. A limited right of appeal is granted to a probationary employee, however, by the regulation quoted at note 1, <em>supra. </em>As noted above, the MSPB dismissed petitioner\u2019s appeal because of failure to comply with this regulation. It is clear from the statutes and regulations quoted above, that we have jurisdiction to review the MSPB\u2019s decision only if it is granted to us by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-11\">\u2019 Prior to the enactment of the Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1982, appeals from decisions of the MSPB could be filed under \u00a7 7703(b)(1) in either the Court of Claims or one of the courts of appeal. The same exception for cases of discrimination applied then as applies now. Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(b)(2), those cases followed an entirely different route of appeal. The Court of Claims had the opportunity on more than one occasion to rule upon its jurisdiction in discrimination cases involving probationary employees. In the case of <em>Hadley v. Department of the Navy, </em>Ct.Cl. App. No. 7-80 (order of November 13, 1981), a probationary employee alleged that he was dismissed in violation of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, because he was a reformed alcoholic.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court held in <em>Had-ley </em>that it not only lacked jurisdiction to review an order of the MSPB on the merits, but it also lacked jurisdiction to review the MSPB\u2019s order dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The court relied principally on the Supreme Court case of <em>Brown v. General Services Administration, </em>425 U.S. 820, 96 S.Ct. 1961, 48 L.Ed.2d 402 (1976). In that case, the Supreme Court held that \u00a7 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(c) (1976), (which section is referred to by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(b)(2)) \u201cprovides the exclusive judicial remedy for claims of discrimination in federal employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 835, 96 S.Ct. at 1969. This remedy permits an employee to file suit in a district court to review his claim of employment discrimination. Because of the exclusiveness of this remedy, the Court of Claims held in <em>Hadley </em>that it was barred from reviewing <em>any order </em>of the MSPB in this type of case.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>The Court of Claims followed <em>Hadley </em>in the subsequent case of <em>Richardson v. Department of Justice, Bureau of Prisons, </em>Ct.Cl.App. No. 40-81 (order of January 29, 1982). In that case a probationary employee was removed from his job as a correctional officer at a prison. He appealed to the MSPB, alleging that his dismissal was unlawful because it was due to his race. The MSPB dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The court, citing <em>Hadley </em>and <em>Brown, </em>held that it, too, was without jurisdiction to review the case. It noted that since <em>Brown, </em>it had \u201cconsistently held that \u2018any jurisdiction this court may have had over back pay claims based on racial discrimination has been divested by the Equal Employment Act of 1972,\u2019 \u201d which added \u00a7 717 to the Civil Rights Act. <em>Richardson, supra </em>at 3, <em>citing Clark v. United States, </em>212 Ct.Cl. 590, 553 F.2d 104 (1970). It is clear, therefore, that the Court of Claims did not have jurisdiction to review this type of discrimination claim under old \u00a7 7703(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">The facts in the instant case are so similar to the facts in <em>Hadley </em>and <em>Richardson </em>that the decisions in those cases are dispositive of the issue involved here, unless the Act changed some critical aspect of our jurisdiction that renders these precedents inapplicable.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Act gives our court exclusive jurisdiction of appeals from the MSPB under new \u00a7 7703(b)(1) of title 5, except \u00a7 7702 discrimination eases. However, the grant of \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d to this court in \u00a7 1295(a)(9) of the Act does not create any new rights in petitioner, but merely grants jurisdiction to this court if the petitioner already has such a right. <em>Williams v. Department of the Army, supra. </em>The Act allocates jurisdiction <em>between circuits </em>by combining the jurisdictions of the Court of Claims and that of the various courts of appeals in MSPB eases, other than those involving discrimination, into the jurisdiction of this court. <em>Williams, supra. </em>But both before and after the passage of the Act, jurisdiction of discrimination cases was placed in the district courts. The Act does not evidence an intent by Congress to extend our jurisdiction to appeals from the MSPB involving claims of discrimination. We find nothing in the Act which would change the result mandated by <em>Hadley </em>and <em>Richardson. </em>Therefore, in accordance with these precedents, which we are required to follow, we hold that we have no jurisdiction under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(b)(1) to review the MSPB\u2019s decision in this case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because petitioner has pursued his administrative remedy separately by filing a complaint with an INS Equal Employment Opportunity Counselor, we do not find it necessary in the interests of justice to transfer the case to the district court. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-9\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b875-14\">. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.806(b) and (d), referring to employees in a probationary period, provide, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-17\">(b) On <em>discrimination. </em>An employee may appeal under this paragraph a termination not required by statute which he or she alleges was based on partisan political reasons or marital status.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-18\">(d) an employee may appeal to the Board under this section a termination which the employee alleges was based on discrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin; or age, provided that at the time of the alleged discriminatory action the employee was at least 40 years of age; or physical handicap, only if such discrimination is raised in addition to one of the issues stated in paragraph (b) * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b875-25\">A probationary employee is one who in his first year of service is in one of the several categories listed in 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.801.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b876-8\">. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(d) is not applicable to this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b876-12\">.

Department of the Navy, </em>699 F.2d 1315, 1318 (Fed.Cir.1983), is clear precedent for my position that this court has jurisdiction to entertain appeals from MSPB dismissals for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-4\">Resolution of this case turns on the correctness of the board\u2019s determination that the board did not have jurisdiction of the case. It is to that question we now turn, for, <em>however the board or the court resolves it, this court has the power and duty to make that determination. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b878-5\"><em>See also Mastriano v. Federal Aviation Administration, </em>714 F.2d 1152 (Fed.Cir.1983), in which Judge Skelton joined the court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">The majority opinion relies on <em>Hadley v. Department of the Navy, </em>No. 7-80, order (Ct.Cl. Nov. 13, 1981). There the Court of Claims held that it had no jurisdiction over back pay claims based on discrimination. It relied on <em>Dunn v. United States Department of Agriculture, </em>654 F.2d 64 (Ct.Cl. 1981), for the proposition that the Court of Claims did not have jurisdiction over cases not involving a claim for money, and on <em>Brown v. General Services Administration, </em>425 U.S. 820, 96 S.Ct. 1961, 48 L.Ed.2d 402 (1976), for the proposition that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 provided the exclusive remedy for discrimination cases. I recognize that the Civil Rights Act, referred to by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(b)(2), provides the correct route for resolving discrimination cases on the merits. However, that act does not resolve such threshold questions as what constitutes a \u201cdiscrimination case\u2019\u2019 and how the limits of MSPB jurisdiction should be defined. With respect to the <em>Dunn </em>case, it is clear from <em>Rosano </em>and from the Federal Courts Improvement Act that the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is not limited to rendering money judgments and that <em>Dunn </em>is not applicable to this court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b878-9\">In both <em>Hadley </em>and <em>Richardson v. Department of Justice, Bureau of Prisons, </em>No. 40-81, order (Ct.Cl. Jan. 29, 1982), which followed the rationale of <em>Hadley </em>that the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims was governed by the Tucker Act, the court declined to dismiss where dismissal by the MSPB for lack of jurisdiction was appealed, but, instead, transferred the cases to circuit courts of appeals. This was consistent with the former version of \u00a7 7703(b)(1), which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-10\">Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, a petition to review a final order or final decision of the Board shall be filed in the <em>Court of Claims or a United States court of appeals </em>.... [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b878-11\">In transferring these cases, the Court of Claims recognized the limits placed upon its jurisdiction by the Tucker Act, as enunciated by <em>Dunn. </em>However, <em>Dunn </em>is not applicable to this court, just as it was not applicable to a transferee circuit court of appeals. This is not a situation in which jurisdiction has been clearly placed in the district courts in the past. Further, the Court of Claims appears to have recognized that courts of appeals were not divested of their jurisdiction over appeals from MSPB final decisions by the reference in section 7703(b)(1) to the exception of paragraph (2) for \u201c[c]ases of discrimination.\u201d Contrary to the majority view, the Federal Courts Improvement Act <em>did </em>change a critical aspect of our jurisdiction. It expressly replaced the \u201cCourt of Claims or a United States court of appeals\u201d with a single court \u2014 the \u201cCourt of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.\u201d This court, as the statutory successor in MSPB appeals to the \u201cCourt of Claims or a United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>States court of appeals,\u201d is equally empowered to review MSPB appeals dealing solely with jurisdictional issues, unhampered by the section 7702(b)(2) exception for \u201c[cjases of discrimination.\u201d Thus, our jurisdiction is <em>not </em>identical to that of the old Court of Claims, but has been expanded to encompass appeals which were formerly taken from the MSPB to the other circuit courts of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">The majority opinion would deprive petitioner and others similarly situated from a previously available judicial review. Prior to the Federal Courts Improvement Act, MSPB appeals that were dismissed by the Court of Claims because of its own peculiar jurisdictional limitations could be transferred to a circuit court of appeals, despite the presence of an allegation of discrimination, for judicial review of the narrow question of whether the MSPB had properly dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. The majority opinion says that now, due to enactment of that Act, such judicial review has simply disappeared. In <em>Rosano, </em>this court responded to a similar argument as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-6\">If <em>Dunn </em>applied, then by removing all jurisdiction over board appeals from the other circuits and granting it exclusively to the Federal Circuit, the Federal Courts Improvement Act would have created a situation in which there is no judicial review available for non-monetary board cases. Putting aside any constitutional problems with this arrangement, there is a strong presumption against unreviewability in the absence of a specific congressional directive. <em>Dunlop v. Bachowski, </em>421 U.S. 560, 567, 95 S.Ct. 1851, 1857, 44 L.Ed.2d 377 (1975); <em>Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, </em>387 U.S. 136, 140, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 1511, 18 L.Ed.2d 681 (1967).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b879-7\"><em>Rosano, </em>699 F.2d at 1318 n. 13. There is no evidence that Congress intended that a class of petitioners who wish to contest the MSPB's dismissal of their cases for lack of jurisdiction would be deprived by the Federal Courts Improvement Act of the judicial review they once had.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-11\">The majority cites <em>Williams v. Department of the Army, </em>715 F.2d 1485 (Fed.Cir.1983), as strengthening its position, when, in fact, all that <em>Williams </em>holds is that a <em>mixed </em>case having a discrimination claim and a non-discrimination claim must be tried as a whole in a district court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A case under section 7702, according to <em>Williams </em>must involve a specific type of action against an employee which may be appealed to the MSPB <em>and </em>an allegation of discrimination. Here, we have neither. The majority admits that petitioner\u2019s probationary status precludes him from bringing a claim of discrimination based on national origin under section 7702. Further, petitioner cannot contest the merits of his removal (appealable adverse action) because he has not yet been able to argue it below. All that is on appeal here is the threshold question of MSPB jurisdiction. Therefore, this cannot be a mixed case under section 7702.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-12\">This view is consistent with the interpretation by <em>Williams </em>of <em>Poppos v. Department of the Navy, </em>No. 81-81, order (Ct.Cl. August 20, 1982), involving the question of jurisdiction over a probationary employee\u2019s appeal. (Racial and age discrimination were alleged, as well as discrimination for partisan political reasons.) <em>Williams </em>states that <em>Poppos </em>\u201cdid not become a mixed case under \u00a7 7702 because it failed to pass the first criterion of \u2018an action which the employee ... may appeal to the board.\u2019 \u201d <em>Williams, </em>715 F.2d at 1488.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-13\">The majority\u2019s view seemingly rests on the theory that a petitioner, whose case is wrongfully dismissed for lack of jurisdiction by the MSPB, still, at least theoretically,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> can pursue the administrative remedies nec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>essary to support filing suit in federal district court. Thus, petitioners with the slightest jurisdictional doubts would be encouraged to simultaneously pursue both avenues, leading to an increase in the workload for the MSPB, federal district courts, and federal agencies. Moreover, once a petitioner, whose ease was wrongfully dismissed by the MSPB, reached the district court, that court might feel constrained to transfer the case back to the MSPB, resulting not only in a waste of time and resources, but also in lack of uniformity as each of some 94 different federal district courts (with appeals to their respective circuits) proceeds to define, the metes and bounds of MSPB jurisdiction. Congress sought to avoid such consequences by consolidating appellate jurisdiction over MSPB cases in a single court \u2014 the Federal Circuit.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">The decision of the board should be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b877-14\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b877-15\">.

United States Postal Service, </em>718 F.2d 1069 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>(Fed.Cir.1983), this court determined that a mere statement on a standard MSPB appeal form that complainant was working in a \u201cpredominantly black facility\u201d did not rise to the level of a \u201ccontention\u201d of racial discrimination; further, that no evidence of racial discrimination was present. The court concluded that it had jurisdiction over the appeal since the case involved only \u201cnondiscrimination\u201d issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b878-12\">. <em>\u201cDunn </em>applies to an aspect of Court of Claims jurisdiction which was expressly changed by the Federal Courts Improvement Act in creating the Federal Circuit. <em>Dunn </em>need not be overruled for it is simply inapplicable; to the extent that it is overruled, Congress has done it.\u201d <em>Rosano, </em>699 F.2d at 1318.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b879-8\">. <em>Williams </em>cautions that its holding \u201cis limited to situations in which the employee is challenging judicially the board\u2019s determinations of <em>both </em>the discrimination and non-discrimination issues.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>715 F.2d at 1491.
