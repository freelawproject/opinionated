In this consolidated appeal, he asserts that because the aliens he was transporting were citizens of El Salvador the aliens had a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>right to (and did) apply for political asylum in the United States,- and that, thus, the Government could hot prove an essential element of its burden of proof, that the aliens were not lawfully entitled to enter or reside within the United States. We affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Jose Leonel Pereira-Pineda, the defendant, is a Guatemalan national and permanent resident alien in this country. On August 29 and November 22, 1982, he was caught and arrested for transporting undocumented aliens in his car, knowing that the aliens were in the United States in violation of the law and having reasonable grounds to believe that the aliens had last entered the United States less than three years earlier, a violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was separately indicted for and tried on a total of seven counts of violating \u00a7 1324(a)(2). Before both his trials, Pereira stipulated as to the testimony of the aliens which he had been caught transporting.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>He was convicted in separate bench trials on November 9, 1982 and January 28, 1983 on five of the seven counts, was sentenced to a total of three years m prison and a subsequent five year period of probation, and filed a timely notice of appeal His sole point on appeal is that the Trial Judge erred m refusing to grant his pretrial motions to dismiss the indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"AIm\">Pereira re-urges essentially the same arguments before this Court that he put forth in his motions to dismiss. He points out that in order to obtain a conviction for violating \u00a7 1324(a)(2), the Government must prove that the transported alien was not \u201clawfully entitled to enter or remain in the United States under the terms of any law relating to immigration, citing <em>United States v. Mount Fuji Japanese Steak House, Inc., </em>435 F.Supp. 1194, 1197 (E.D.N.Y.1977). He argues that the aliens he was transport-mg were from El Salvador and were automatically entitled to seek political asylum, and that they had at all times the right to remain m the United States until they had fully ascertained and explored their right to apply for asylum, citing as support <em>Orantes-Hernandez v. Smith, </em>541 F.Supp. 351 (C.D.Cal.1982), and <em>Nunez v. Boldin, </em>537 F.Supp. 578 (S.D.Tex.), <em>dism\u2019d </em>692 F.2d 755 (1982). Quite simply, in Pereira\u2019s view, once here the Salvadorans would have the <em>right </em>to remain to pursue their potential asylum applications, and thus the Government could not prove that the aliens were \u201cnot lawfully entitled to ... reside within the United States\u201d \u2014 one element of a \u00a7 1324(a)(2) violation. <em>See </em>note 1, <em>supra. </em>In support, he emphasizes the result in <em>United States v. Zayas-Morales, </em>685 F.2d 1272 (11th Cir. 1982). We are not, however, persuaded by Pereira\u2019s argument,</p>\n<p id=\"ApU\">We have said before that knowledge is an essential element of &amp; \u00a7 1324(a)(2) violation. <em>See United </em>States v. <em>Madrid, </em>510 F.2d 554, 556 (5th Cir.), reversed on <em>other </em>grounds <em>and remanded, </em>517 F.2d 937 (1975), cert. <em>denied, </em>429 U.S. 940 97 S.Ct. 355, 50 L.Ed.2d 309 (1976). Pereira stipulated that he knew the aliens he was transporting were, in the terms of \u00a7 1324(a)(2), \u201cin the United states in violation of the law,\u201d and that their \u201clast entry into the United States occurred less than three years prior\u201d to the incidents involved here. <em>See </em>notes 1, 2, <em>supra </em>He conceded that they were \u201cnot duly admitted by an immigration officer,\u201d and bbab bbey bad no\u00a3 been \u201ciawfuuy entitled to entered\u00bb the United States. If, however, the aliens were \u201clawfully entitled to res\u00edde within the United States under the terms of ... . law relatin to ^ immi ation or expulsion <em>of aliens&gt;&gt; </em>pereira could not haye violated \u00a7 1324(a)(2)- We find that the aiiens were not so ent\u00ed\u00fced ,and that he did violate the , aw.</p>\n<p id=\"Acr\">The mere possibility that El Salvadorans may file asylum applications at some point in the future, and thus be allowed to remain at liberty under bond or parole while their right to asylum is determined, does not make them \u2014 from the moment they enter this country \u2014 entitled to \u201creside\u201d here for the purposes of \u00a7 1324(a)(2). Rejecting a similar argument in a slightly different context, this Court stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"acr-dedup-0\">It would be a misuse of the parole concept to conclude that one who physically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>transports into the United States persons not otherwise entitled to come in cannot be guilty under \u00a7 1324(a)(4) if the United States grants parole to those brought in while it determines whether they should be given asylum.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-4\"><em>United States v. Hanna, </em>639 F.2d 192, 196 (5th Cir.1980); <em>contra United States v. Ka-vazanjian, </em>623 F.2d 730, 739 (1st Cir.1980). It would be no less of a misuse here, where Pereira was fully aware that the aliens he was transporting had not been admitted to this country by an immigration officer and did not possess proper entry documents. Further, there is no contention that the illicit transportation was in any way intended to facilitate efforts by the Salvadorans to file applications for asylum; Pereira stipulated to that fact. <em>See </em>note 2, <em>supra; cf. United States v. Zayas-Morales, </em>685 F.2d 1272, 1277-78 (11th Cir.1982) (the general criminal intent necessary for a \u00a7 1324(a)(1) violation was not present where defendants presented aliens to the proper officials <em>specifically </em>so that aliens could seek legal status). We do not agree that every El Salvadoran has an absolute right to \u201creside\u201d within the United States from the moment, and no matter in what manner, he arrives. As our Ninth Circuit colleagues opined under similar circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-5\">If we were to agree with the petitioner\u2019s contention that no person should be returned to El Salvador because of the reported anarchy present there now, it would permit the whole population, if they could enter this country some way, to stay here indefinitely.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKEX\"><em>Martinez-Romero v.

You had really no particular interest in what they were going to do once they got there. Is that the case? Is that what you\u2019re stipulating to?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A20\">The Defendant: Of course, yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-22\">Although it was not worded expressly as such, it is clear that the stipulation for the November 9 trial, which was adopted virtually unchanged for the second, January 28 trial, was understood by the Court, defendant and Government to mean that the defendant in transporting the aliens had no intent to aid them in any efforts to apply for legal status. This is clear from an exchange at the second trial:</p>\n<p id=\"b210-23\">The Court: ...</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-24\">You see, my ruling in the last [November 9] case [denying defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss] was based on the proposition that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>the defense he\u2019s raising could be a defense on the right fact situation. In other words, if a person is bringing people into this country for the idea of rescuing them from oppression, for the purpose of driving them to the nearest immigration officer to turn themselves in for asylum, I think that is a defense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADX\">I was convinced at the time that that was not what he was pleading. He was simply saying that because they themselves are eligible for asylum, that that gives him carte blanche to transport them, which I think is not right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"alx-dedup-0\">.....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_v\">[Defendant\u2019s counsel]: We made the same motion [to dismiss] [in the January 28 case] as we made in the last case, your Honor, and you denied it. It\u2019s the first part of it. Part \u201cd\u201d of the stipulation, I think, certainly covers the intent element sufficiently ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATB\">.....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9AY\">I think that we can stipulate, and I think the proof at trial would show, your Honor, that the defendant\u2019s intent was not to immediately transport these people to an immigration officer.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
