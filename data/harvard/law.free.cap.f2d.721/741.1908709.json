With respect to the suggestion for rehearing en banc, no member of this panel nor judge in regular active service on the court having requested that the court be polled on rehearing en banc (Rule 35, Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure; Eleventh Circuit Rule 26), the Suggestion for Rehearing En Banc is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-13\">In its petition for rehearing, the government contends that in our opinion in this case, 714 F.2d 1510 (11th Cir.1983), the court erred in construing a \u201cstaff instruction\u201d as an agency \u201cregulation\u201d because the \u201cinstruction\u201d was published in 39 Fed.Reg. 7569 (1974). The government urges that grave consequences may flow from our interpretation of its \u201cinstruction\u201d as a \u201cregulation.\u201d With admirable candor, the government points out in its petition that its arguments before the panel did not address the proper categorization of the publication in question. Government\u2019s Brief at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-15\">\u201cAgency action\u201d contemplates a vast range of administrative functions, <em>see Batterton v. Marshall, </em>648 F.2d 694, 702-03 (D.C.Cir.1980), and we recognize that proper classification of such action is often essential. <em>See, e.g., </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b)(3)(A) (no requirement of advance publication and opportunity for public participation for \u201cinterpretative rules, general statements of policy, or rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice\u201d). The panel\u2019s conclusion, however, was not based upon any rigid label attached to the material published on February 27, 1974 in the Federal Register. We stated that government agencies have to follow the law and their regulations but, relying upon <em>Morton v. Ruiz, </em>415 U.S. 199, 94 S.Ct. 1055, 39 L.Ed.2d 270 (1974), <em>United States ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, </em>347 U.S. 260, 74 S.Ct. 499, 98 L.Ed. 681 (1954), and <em>United States v. Heffner, </em>420 F.2d 809 (4th Cir.1970), held that where the rights of individuals are affected, agencies may not depart from established procedures.. Furthermore, whether those procedures are published or not is not determinative. <em>See Gulf States Mfgrs. v. NLRB, </em>579 F.2d 1298, 1308-09 (5th Cir.1978). Suffice it to say that while any language categorizing the publication as a regulation may have been overbroad, the government\u2019s label of \u201cstaff instruction\u201d does not persuade us that the agency action in question is governed by <em>Schweiker v. Hansen, </em>450 U.S. 785, 101 S.Ct. 1468, 67 L.Ed.2d 685 (1981). The publication in the instant case is not a \u201csimple administrative directive to agency employees,\u201d <em>Kirkland Masonry, Inc. v. Commissioner, </em>614 F.2d 532, 534 (5th Cir.1980), and is more like the action involved in <em>Morton </em>and <em>Gulf States, supra. Cf. </em>K. Davis, <em>Administrative Law, </em>\u00a7 7:4, p. 167 (1982 Supp.) (legal effect of a Treasury Department Handbook, which was not a regulation, should be determined in accordance \u201cwith the elementary idea that the government should be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>have responsibly\u201d). \u201c[L]egal characterization [of agency action] cannot be accomplished merely ... by semantic play,\u201d <em>Bat-terton, supra, </em>648 F.2d at 703, and the government\u2019s argument is nothing more than that. Thus, our opinion about the case is unchanged.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">To hold otherwise would go to the very core of our democratic government and permit agencies to ignore congressional actions and internal administrative procedures, and, in a case such as this, make loans to \u201cfavored friends of the agency,\u201d \u201cmembers of the political party in power,\u201d or by some \u25a0other autocratic method distribute government benefits. Since that is not our system, we cannot approve agency actions contrary to congressional or administrative mandates which frustrate benefit programs statutorily authorized and funded by Congress. We do not suggest that in this instance the agency had any improper motives.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">The panel opinion is adhered to as modified herein.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
