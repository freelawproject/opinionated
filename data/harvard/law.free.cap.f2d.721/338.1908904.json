Finding that the complaint was timely filed, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Eva Suarez was employed by the Little Havana Community Center as a social services coordinator. Rafel Valleverde is the executive director of Little Havana Activities (Little Havana) and Nutrition Centers of Dade County, Incorporated. In September, 1979, Valleverde terminated Suarez. Although Valleverde cited lack of funding as the reason for Suarez\u2019s termination, Suarez contends that she was fired because she resisted Valleverde\u2019s sexual advances.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">In February, 1980, Suarez filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). On March 9, 1981, the EEOC sent Suarez a \u201cNotice of Right to Sue\u201d letter. The ninety-day statutory period in Title 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(l)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> provides that an aggrieved party must file a civil action against the respondents named in the charge within ninety days after receipt of the \u201cNotice of Right to Sue.\u201d Thus, Suarez\u2019s complaint had to be filed not later than June 8, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">It is undisputed that on June 6, 1981, Suarez\u2019s lawyer, in Miami, Florida, mailed the complaint and summons to the Clerk of the District Court for the Southern District of Florida at Miami, Florida. The Clerk\u2019s office did not <em>file </em>the complaint until June 10, 1981. The record is silent as to where the complaint was between June 6 and June 10. In January, 1982, the District Court for the Southern District of Florida dismissed Suarez\u2019s complaint for lack of jurisdiction, stating that timely filing was essential under section 2000e, and that mailing of the complaint a reasonable time before the deadline could not be considered a substitute for filing so as to justify an equitable tolling of the ninety-day period.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">The sole issue we are called upon to decide is whether the filing provisions in 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2000e-5 are absolute, or whether they may be liberally construed under the circumstances. Suarez contends that although the clerk filed her complaint ninety-two days after she received her \u201cRight to Sue\u201d letter from the EEOC, no jurisdictional bar exists because Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that three days are to be added to the prescribed limitation period whenever the mails are used. In effect, Suarez contends that Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is applicable to Title VII cases. If applicable, Suarez\u2019s case would not be time barred because her complaint was filed within ninety-three days after receipt of the \u201cRight to Sue\u201d letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-12\">Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-13\">Whenever a party has the right or is required to do some act or take some proceedings within a prescribed period after the service of a notice or other paper upon him and the notice or paper is served upon them by mail, 3 days shall be added to the prescribed period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-14\">Suarez asserts that the Eleventh Circuit should adopt the approach of the district court in <em>Tavernaris v. Beaver Area School District, </em>454 F.Supp. 355, 357 (W.D.Pa.1978). In <em>Tavernaris, </em>the district court held Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure applicable to the ninety-day period in which suit must be filed under Title VII. Consequently, in that case, plaintiff\u2019s complaint, filed within ninety-two days after notice of right to sue, was held to be timely. In so holding, the district court noted that the filing requirements in a Title VII action are to be given liberal construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-15\">No Eleventh Circuit case is directly on point. The Fifth Circuit, however, has consistently employed a strict interpretation of the filing requirement in Title VII cases. In <em>Wrenn v. American Cast Iron Pipe, </em>575 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>F.2d 544, <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>578 F.2d 871 (5th Cir.1978), the Fifth Circuit held that the ninety-day limitation period for bringing a Title VII action following receipt of the \u201cRight to Sue\u201d letter is mandatory, and that a plaintiff who does nothing to call the case to the attention of the district court is time barred and will suffer dismissal. Additionally, in determining whether or not rule 6(e) applies to other statutorily prescribed civil remedies, the Fifth Circuit in <em>Carr v. Veteran\u2019s Administration, </em>522 F.2d 1355, 1357 (5th Cir.1975), held that rule 6(e) is not applicable to tort suits against the federal government employing Title 28 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 2401(b) as the statute of limitations. Section 2401(b) by its language commences the period of limitations with the date of the mailing of the torts claim, while rule 6(e) commences the period of limitations with the service of a notice or other paper.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\"><em>Carr </em>is decided within the context of a tort suit against the federal government, rather than as a Title VII action; its holding, therefore, is not directly applicable to this Title VII case. We need not decide whether <em>Carr </em>is also applicable to Title VII cases. Unlike the plaintiff in <em>Wrenn, </em>Suarez actively sought to file her action within the statutorily prescribed limitation period.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">In <em>Franks v. Bowman Transportation, </em>495 F.2d 398 (5th Cir.1974), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>424 U.S. 747, 96 S.Ct. 1251, 47 L.Ed.2d 444 (1976), the Fifth Circuit applied equitable tolling to a Title VII action, holding that the limitations period did not begin to run until the plaintiff had actual, rather than constructive, receipt of the \u201cRight to Sue\u201d letter. In holding that the statute of limitations had been equitably tolled, the court stated that Congress did not intend to make a claimant\u2019s statutory right to sue subject to \u201csuch fortuitous variables as workload, mistakes, or possible lack of diligence of EEOC personnel.\u201d <em>Bowman, </em>495 F.2d at 405. If Congress did not intend to make a statutory right subject to the mistakes of EEOC personnel, surely Congress did not intend to make a claimant\u2019s statutory right to sue subject to the mistakes of either United States Postal workers or the staff of a clerk\u2019s office. We do not know what happened to Suarez\u2019s complaint between the time of its mailing and the time of its filing. Perhaps the complaint was delivered to the Clerk\u2019s Office within the ninety-day limitation period. In the usual course of events, Suarez\u2019s complaint would have been delivered and filed within the ninety-day period. We only know that the complaint was not <em>filed; </em>we do not know why it was not filed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, Suarez mailed the complaint in Miami to a Miami address; it was reasonable for her to expect delivery and filing of her complaint within forty-eight hours of its mailing. To hold otherwise would require personal delivery of every complaint to the clerk\u2019s office and personal attention to its filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">The Fifth Circuit, by which we are bound, has generally adopted equitable tolling of the limitations period in Title VII cases. <em>See Coke v. General Adjustment Bureau, </em>640 F.2d 584, 594 (5th Cir.1981) (en banc). We, therefore, consider it in this context. Suarez\u2019s actions showed neither a lack of diligence nor carelessness or a lack of intent to actually file the complaint. The respondents were not surprised by the charges or otherwise prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-10\">Accordingly, we reject the rule 6(e) contention, but in the spirit of Fifth Circuit precedent, hold that the statute of limitations period prescribed by section 2000e-5 was equitably tolled under the circumstances in this case. We reverse the decision of the district court and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-11\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b409-9\">. The statute states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-10\">If ... the Commission has not entered into a conciliation agreement to which the person aggrieved is a party, the Commission ... shall so notify the person aggrieved and <em>within ninety days after the giving of such a civil action may be brought against the respondent named in the charge </em>.... [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b410-6\">. From our supervisory position, we note that physical as well as other changes were occurring in the Clerk\u2019s office in the Southern District of Florida during this period. We also note that the Southern District of Florida has one of the heaviest civil caseloads in the nation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
