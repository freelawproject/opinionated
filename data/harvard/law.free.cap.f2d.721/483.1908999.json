The district court\u2019s dismissal of appellant\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus under Rule 9(b) without a hearing and on the basis of what is, in effect, a one sentence order is reversed. The case is remanded to the district court with instructions to hold a hearing on the issue of abuse of the writ. Without intending to foreclose an independent and careful consideration by the district court of that issue, this court notes that it has serious misgivings about whether an order holding that appellant had abused the writ would be sustainable' if appellant is able to establish at that hearing the facts suggested in his motions to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-22\">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that appellant\u2019s motion for a stay of execution is granted pending further order of this court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
