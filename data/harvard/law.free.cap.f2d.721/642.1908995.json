Stephens, then an air traffic controller with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), filed a claim with the FAA, seeking compensation for an alleged high frequency hearing loss. This claim was submitted to the Department of Labor\u2019s Office of Worker\u2019s Compensation Programs (OWCP). The OWCP denied the claim. Following the denial, Stephens brought suit in district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> against the OWCP, the Department of Labor, and two individual government employees, alleging that certain communications between the FAA and the OWCP while his claim was pending violated his right to due process and 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 10.140. Stephens sought a declaratory judgment to that effect and an injunction ordering the OWCP to reconsider his claim without reference to any material placed in his file after the first <em>ex parte </em>communication.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-18\">Following a non-jury trial, the district court determined that it lacked jurisdiction to review the Secretary of Labor\u2019s decision denying Stephens\u2019 claim. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8128(b) (1982). It did conclude, however, that neither the applicable regulations nor Stephens\u2019 due process rights were violated as a result of the investigation and adjudication of his claim for compensation. Accordingly, the court dismissed Stephens\u2019 complaint and assessed costs against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-19\">After reviewing the record, we conclude that the district court made no error of law or fact in dismissing Stephens\u2019 action and properly awarded costs. Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir.R. 14.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b712-13\">.
