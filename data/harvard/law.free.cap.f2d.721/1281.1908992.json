News Company (News), is a wholesale and retail distributor of periodicals and publications in Wichita, Kansas.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It appeals from dismissal of its action for injunctive and declaratory relief against enforcement of a portion of a Wichita ordinance. The ordinance, Number 36-172, amended sections 5.68.150 and 5.68.155 of the Code of the City of Wichita and created 5.68.156. This section prohibits the promotion of sexually oriented materials to minors. It is the sole portion of the ordinance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1285\">*1285</page-number>at issue in this action, and it is reproduced as an appendix to this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-5\">The Wichita ordinance is designed to prevent minors from being exposed to sexually oriented materials that are harmful to them. The ordinance defines \u201charmful to minors\u201d and makes it an offense to display such material to minors if, as a part of the invited general public, they will be exposed to it. It further proscribes, <em>inter alia, </em>selling, furnishing or presenting to minors any material or performance that is harmful to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-6\">The controlling facts are not in dispute. By early August 1979, plaintiff News became aware of the impending passage of the subject ordinance. On August 20, News brought this action against all members of the Board of Commissioners, the Chief of Police, and the City Attorney of Wichita. It sought a declaratory judgment that Section 5.68.156 \u201cis unconstitutional on its face and as applied,\u201d and injunctive relief restraining the defendants from enforcing the section. The district judge promptly issued a temporary restraining order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-7\">Defendants filed a motion to dismiss with a supporting brief claiming, <em>inter alia, </em>that the complaint failed to state a cause of action. News then filed a reply brief contesting the motion. The district court held a hearing to consider plaintiff\u2019s request for a permanent injunction and the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, heard argument, and took the matter under advisement. The judge shortly thereafter dissolved the temporary restraining order, denied the request for preliminary and permanent injunctive relief and granted defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. Plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-10\">Plaintiff makes four main arguments on appeal, contending that the ordinance: (1) goes beyond the permissible scope of <em>Ginsberg v. New York, </em>390 U.S. 629, 88 S.Ct. 1274, 20 L.Ed.2d 195 (1968), and is overbroad and vague both on its face and as applied;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (2) violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; (3) creates a prior restraint in violation of the First Amendment; and (4) deprives defendants of their Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial. We will consider each of these contentions in turn.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1351-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-12\">' FACIAL OVERBREADTH AND VAGUENESS</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-13\">Plaintiff News challenges the ordinance for overbreadth and vagueness. It essentially says that the realistic effect of the ordinance will be to limit, by its overbroad application, the access of adults, and minors approaching adulthood, to constitutionally permissible material. News further argues that' the ordinance is vague in that it neither affords fair warning to those within its reach, nor provides explicit standards for those who enforce it. Brief of Appellant at 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-14\"><em>Ginsberg v. New York, </em>390 U.S. 629, 88 S.Ct. 1274, 20 L.Ed.2d 195 (1968), rejected a vagueness challenge to a New York statute similar to the Wichita ordinance. The Supreme Court there held that it is constitutional to proscribe the sale of \u201cgirlie magazines\u201d to minors, where the magazines contained defined forms of sexually oriented material, even though such material was not obscene for adults. The Wichita ordinance at issue is almost identical to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1286\">*1286</page-number>statute upheld in <em>Ginsberg. Ginsberg, supra, </em>390 U.S. at 645-47, 88 S.Ct. at 1283-84. Plaintiff attempts to distinguish <em>Ginsberg </em>by pointing out differences between the two laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-4\">There are two principal differences between the Wichita ordinance and the statute in <em>Ginsberg </em>that are relevant to the constitutionality of the Wichita ordinance on its face. First, the Wichita ordinance uses the <em>Miller v. California, </em>413 U.S. 15, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973), obscenity test,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and second, it proscribes not just the dissemination of material harmful to minors, as <em>Ginsberg </em>did, but also the display of such material.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We find no constitutional infirmity in the ordinance resulting from either of these changes, or in any of the prohibitions of display, sale or presentation of proscribed materials to minors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-5\">A. <em>Application of the Miller test</em></p>\n<p id=\"AlWp\">We are unable to discern any substance to plaintiff\u2019s argument that replacing the <em>Memoirs </em>test with the <em>Miller </em>test creates either an overbreadth or vagueness problem. The ordinance in <em>Ginsberg </em>prohibited distribution to minors of material that was \u201charmful to minors.\u201d In defining \u201charmful to minors,\u201d the <em>Memoirs </em>obscenity test was adapted so that material could not be distributed to minors if it: (1) appealed to the prurient interest of minors; (2) was patently offensive to what the adult community believed was suitable for minors; and (3) was utterly without social importance for minors. <em>Ginsberg, supra, </em>390 U.S. at 646, 88 S.Ct. at 1284. The Wichita ordinance is virtually identical to that upheld in <em>Ginsberg </em>except that the <em>Miller </em>obscenity test is used rather than the <em>Memoirs </em>test. Although the ordinance alters the <em>Miller </em>test so that it can be used for determining what material is harmful to minors, this is precisely what the ordinance in <em>Ginsberg </em>did with the old <em>Memoirs </em>test. We reject the argument that the use of the <em>Miller </em>test <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1287\">*1287</page-number>rendered the ordinance overbroad or vagne.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1353-5\">B. <em>The prohibitions of the ordinance protecting minors</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1353-6\">The Wichita ordinance prohibits (a) displaying material \u201charmful to minors,\u201d (b) selling, furnishing or presenting such material to minors; and (c) presenting to a minor any \u201cperformance\u201d harmful to him. We feel that <em>Ginsberg </em>has already upheld all such prohibitions except that of display. We therefore focus on the overbreadth and vagueness challenges to the display prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-7\">The ordinance prohibits displaying materials harmful to minors when minors \u201cas a part of the invited general public, will be exposed to view such material.\u201d The ordinance provides that such material is not displayed if it is \u201ckept behind devices commonly known as \u2018blinder racks\u2019 so that the lower two-thirds of the material is not exposed t\u00f3 view.\u201d We believe this provision is neither vague nor overbroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-10\">Although First Amendment challenges to legislation under the overbreadth and vagueness doctrines are related,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> they are distinct. The vagueness doctrine is anchored in the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and protects against legislation lacking sufficient clarity of purpose and precision in drafting. <em>See Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville, supra, </em>422 U.S. at 217-18, 95 S.Ct. at 2276-77; <em>Grayned v. City of Rockford, </em>408 U.S. 104, 108-14 &amp; n. 5, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 2298-302 &amp; n. 5, 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972). Overbroad legislation need not be vague, indeed it may be too clear; its constitutional infirmity is that it sweeps protected activity within its proscription. <em>See Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville, supra, </em>422 U.S. at 212-13, 95 S.Ct. at 2274-75; <em>Grayned v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1288\">*1288</page-number><em>City of Rockford, supra, </em>408 U.S. at 114, 92 S.Ct. at 2302. We consider the overbreadth and vagueness issues separately.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1354-4\">1. <em>Overbreadth</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1354-5\">As noted, plaintiff News argues that the Wichita ordinance is overbroad, restricting the access of adults and minors approaching adulthood to constitutionally permissible publications. Brief of Appellant at 17. News says that as commercial enterprises seek to avoid violating the ordinance, the natural tendency will be to limit materials available for view by anyone. <em>Id. </em>at 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-6\">We disagree. First, as noted, with respect to the sale or distribution of materials \u201charmful to minors,\u201d the ordinance has a clear and acceptable standard that will permit sale or distribution to adults of such materials. Second, the portion of the ordinance dealing with display of material \u201charmful to minors\u201d is reasonably structured. It is true that compliance with the ordinance will to some degree restrict the viewing by adults of materials which are, as to adults, constitutionally protected. However, the restriction is reasonable and does not offend the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-7\">Reasonable time, place and manner regulations are permissible where the regulations are necessary to further significant governmental interests, <em>Young v. American Mini Theatres, </em>427 U.S. 50, 63 &amp; n. 18, 96 S.Ct. 2440, 2448 &amp; n. 18, 49 L.Ed.2d 310 (1976) (plurality), and are narrowly tailored to further the State\u2019s legitimate interest. <em>Grayned v. City of Rockford, supra, </em>408 U.S. at 116-17, 92 S.Ct. at 2303-04.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We find <em>Young, supra, </em>instructive. In <em>Young </em>the plurality held that Detroit zoning ordinances providing that an adult theatre may not be located within 1000 feet of any two other adult theatres (or other \u201cregulated uses\u201d) or within 500 feet of a residential area, was consistent with the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The plurality recognized that this was content-based regulation but upheld it because the city had a sufficient interest in preserving the quality of urban life and the ordinance did not suppress or greatly restrict access to lawful speech. <em>Young, supra, </em>427 U.S. at 63-72 &amp; n. 35, 96 S.Ct. at 2448-53 &amp; n. 35 (plurality). Similarly the display provision of the Wichita ordinance is a regulation based on content. We believe that it is likewise justified by the substantial governmental interest in protecting minors from exposure to harmful adult material.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>See supra </em>note 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-11\">Moreover, the proscription on display of material harmful to minors does not unreasonably restrict adults\u2019 access to material which is not obscene as to them.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1289\">*1289</page-number>ordinance permits the \u201cdisplay\u201d of material harmful to minors if it is in blinder racks which conceal the lower two-thirds of the material. Thus, adults may still have some access to materials not obscene as to them, and they may purchase such material.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-5\">In considering News\u2019s claim of overbreadth,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> we must remember that invalidating legislation as overbroad on its face is \u201cmanifestly strong medicine\u201d and is employed sparingly and \u201conly as a last resort.\u201d <em>New York v. Ferber, </em>458 U.S. 747, 769, 102 S.Ct. 3348, 3361, 73 L.Ed.2d 1113 (1982); <em>Broadrick v. Oklahoma, </em>413 U.S. 601, 613, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 2916, 37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973). In <em>Ferber, </em>the court implied that when conduct plus speech is involved, the overbreadth \u201c \u2018must not only be real, but substantial as well, judged in relation to the statute\u2019s plainly legitimate sweep.\u2019 \u201d <em>New York v. Ferber, supra, </em>458 U.S. at 770, 102 S.Ct. at 3362 <em>(quoting Broadrick v. Oklahoma, supra, </em>413 U.S. at 615, 93 S.Ct. at 2917). Moreover, legislation should not be held facially overbroad unless it is not readily subject to a narrowing construction, and the deterrent effect on speech is real and substantial. <em>Young v. American Mini Theatres, supra, </em>427 U.S. at 60, 96 S.Ct. at 2447; <em>Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville, supra, </em>422 U.S. at 216, 95 S.Ct. at 2276.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1355-6\">The portion of the Wichita ordinance proscribing display to minors is conduct plus speech because it regulates the manner in which material with a particular content can be disseminated; it does not regulate pure speech itself. Thus, there must be substantial overbreadth for the ordinance to be held overbroad on its face. We find no such infirmity. As noted, the display portion of the ordinance does not restrict minors\u2019 access to materials which they have a constitutional right to obtain. <em>See Ginsberg, supra, </em>390 U.S. at 634-43, 88 S.Ct. at 1277-82. The ordinance only prohibits displaying material \u201charmful to minors,\u201d and this term is defined to include only material that is obscene as to minors under the <em>Miller </em>test as adapted to evaluate whether material is harmful to minors. Although minors are entitled to a significant measure of First Amendment protection, <em>Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville, supra, </em>422 U.S. at 212-13, 95 S.Ct. at 2274-75; <em>Tinker </em>v. <em>Des Moines School District, </em>393 U.S. 503, 89 S.Ct. 733, 21 L.Ed.2d 731 (1969), a narrowly drawn ordinance restricting their access to sexually oriented material does not abridge their First Amendment rights. <em>See Ginsberg, supra, </em>390 U.S. at 634-43, 88 S.Ct. at 1277-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-10\">We therefore hold that the display provision of the ordinance is not overbroad on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1290\">*1290</page-number>2. <em>Vagueness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1356-4\">If a law threatens to inhibit First Amendment freedoms a more stringent vagueness test is used. <em>See Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., supra, </em>455 U.S. at 499, 102 S.Ct. at 1193; <em>Hynes </em>v. <em>Mayor of Oradell, </em>425 U.S. 610, 620, 96 S.Ct. 1755, 1760, 48 L.Ed.2d 243 (1976). In the First Amendment area vague laws offend three important values. First, they do not give individuals fair warning of what is prohibited. Second, lack of precise standards permits arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. Finally, vague statutes encroach upon First Amendment freedoms by causing citizens to forsake activity protected by the First Amendment for fear it may be prohibited.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Grayned v. City of Rockford, supra, </em>408 U.S. at 108-09, 92 S.Ct. at 2298-99; <em>see Hynes v. Mayor of Oradell, supra, </em>425 U.S. at 620-22, 96 S.Ct. at 1760-61; <em>see also General Stores, Inc. v. Bingaman, </em>695 F.2d 502, 503 (10th Cir.1982). <em>Hejira Corp. v. MacFarlane, </em>660 F.2d 1356, 1365 (10th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-5\">We find no vagueness defect in the Wichita ordinance. First, the ordinance provides fair warning of what is prohibited. It plainly prohibits displaying material harmful to minors in a manner so that minors will be exposed to it. Although it is not \u201can answer to an argument that a particular regulation of expression is vague to say that it was adopted for the salutary purpose of protecting children,\u201d <em>Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. Dallas, </em>390 U.S. 676, 689, 88 S.Ct. 1298, 1306, 20 L.Ed.2d 225 (1968), \u201c \u2018.. . the Constitution does not require impossible standards\u2019; all that is required is that the language \u2018conveys sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practices ....\u2019\u201d <em>Roth v. United States, </em>354 U.S. 476, 491, 77 S.Ct. 1304, 1312, 1 L.Ed.2d 1498 (1957) (quoting <em>United States v. Petrillo, </em>332 U.S. 1, 7-8, 67 S.Ct. 1538, 1541-42, (1947)). We believe that the ordinance does this. The obscenity standard as to minors is clearly defined. Common understanding and practices provide commercial establishments with sufficient notice of the type of display the ordinance is designed to prohibit. <em>See Broadrick v. Oklahoma, supra, </em>413 U.S. at 608, 93 S.Ct. at 2913; <em>Miller, supra, </em>413 U.S. at 27, 93 S.Ct. at 2616.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-9\">Furthermore, whatever imprecision is present is mitigated by the ordinance\u2019s scienter provision. <em>See Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., supra, </em>455 U.S. at 499, 102 S.Ct. at 1193 (\u201c[Sjcienter requirement may mitigate a law\u2019s vagueness, especially with respect to the adequacy of notice to the complainant that his conduct is proscribed.\u201d) (footnote omitted). The ordinance defines knowingly in terms almost identical to the definition approved in <em>Ginsberg. See Ginsberg, supra, </em>390 U.S. at 646, 88 S.Ct. at 1284. In addition to the degree of scienter that the Constitution requires be shown to obtain a conviction for violating obscenity laws,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the Wichita ordinance, as <em>Ginsberg </em>did, makes it an excuse from liability if one makes an honest mistake .as to a minor\u2019s age.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1357-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1291\">*1291</page-number>Second, we do not perceive any real danger of arbitrary enforcement. To violate the ordinance, one must display material which, taken as a whole, must fail the <em>Miller </em>test as applied to minors. This sufficiently constrains the discretion of the authorities. The ordinance adopts the correct standard for evaluating whether material is harmful to minors and we will not assume that the authorities will act in bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-5\">Third, we are not persuaded that the ordinance will lead citizens to forsake activity protected by the First Amendment. The ordinance is narrowly drawn within the confines of the <em>Miller </em>and <em>Ginsberg </em>standards. It provides fair warning of what is prohibited, and sufficiently constrains the discretion of the authorities. In such circumstances we do not believe it chills the exercise of First Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-6\">In sum, we are not persuaded to hold the Wichita ordinance invalid for vagueness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-8\">EQUAL PROTECTION</p>\n<p id=\"A9p\">The Wichita ordinance provides that it is an affirmative defense if the material or performance was \u201cdisplayed,' presented or disseminated to a minor at a recognized and established school, church, museum, medical clinic, hospital, public library, governmental agency, quasi-governmental agency and [if this was done] for a bona fide governmental, educational or scientific purpose.\u201d Plaintiff News argues that the ordinance is violative of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because only commercial establishments are subject to its sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-9\">We disagree. The ordinance creates a classification that distinguishes between commercial enterprises and noncommercial enterprises. Such classifications are upheld if they are rationally related to a legitimate state interest. <em>See New Orleans v. Dukes, </em>427 U.S. 297, 303, 96 S.Ct. 2513, 2516, 49 L.Ed.2d 511 (1976) (per curiam); <em>Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp., </em>426 U.S. 794, 810-14, 96 S.Ct. 2488, 2498-500, 49 L.Ed.2d 220 (1976); <em>Hart Book Stores, Inc. v. Edminsten, </em>612 F.2d 821, 831 (4th Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>447 U.S. 929, 100 S.Ct. 3028, 65 L.Ed.2d 1124 (1980).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>See also Schilb v. Kuebel, </em>404 U.S. 357, 364, 92 S.Ct. 479, 484, 30 L.Ed.2d 502 (1971) (\u201c[Classifications will be set aside only if no grounds can be conceived to justify them ....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-13\">We rejected a similar argument in <em>Piepenburg v. Cutler, </em>649 F.2d 783 (10th Cir.1981). In <em>Piepenberg </em>a state statute prohibited exhibiting pornographic films and created an affirmative defense if their distribution \u201cwas restricted to institutions or persons having scientific, educational, governmental, or other similar justification for possessing pornographic material.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 785. We rejected the argument that this violated the Equal Protection Clause, reasoning that it was possible to conceive of justifications for the classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-14\">We likewise believe that the Wichita ordinance\u2019s classification must be upheld. Distinguishing between commercial and non-commercial institutions bears a rational relationship to a legitimate state interest. The Supreme Court has recognized that there are \u201clegitimate state interests at stake in stemming the tide of commercialized obscenity....\u201d <em>Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, </em>413 U.S. 49, 57, 93 S.Ct. 2628, 2635, 37 L.Ed.2d 446 (1973); <em>see also Young v. American Mini Theatres, supra, </em>427 U.S. 50, 96 S.Ct. 2440, 49 L.Ed.2d 310 (upholding zoning ordinances applicable to adult thea-tres or similar establishments). Commer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1292\">*1292</page-number>cial enterprises have the economic incentive to make sales and are therefore more likely to press the display and dissemination of material harmful to minors. Hence, making a distinction between commercial and non-commercial enterprises is sufficiently' grounded in a legitimate state interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-4\">We conclude that the ordinance does not violate the Equal Protection Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-6\">PRIOR RESTRAINT</p>\n<p id=\"ahe-dedup-1\">Plaintiff argues that the ordinance creates an impermissible prior restraint. It contends that the threat of criminal prosecution, the substantial penalties available to a prosecutor, and the almost indefinable standards combine to create an unconstitutional prior restraint on the right to distribute their materials. Brief of Appellant at 34. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-7\">The ordinance creates a penalty for violating its terms. It does not require prior approval of the authorities before any material can be distributed or displayed. \u201c[T]here is a world of difference between a government statement that one cannot speak at all and a statement that one can speak out at some risk of paying a specified cost.\u201d Hunter, <em>Toward a Better Understanding of the Prior Restraint Doctrine: A Reply to Professor Mayton, </em>67 Cornell L.Rev. 283, 293 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-8\">The Supreme Court has expressed a preference for subsequent punishment over pri- or restraint. <em>See, e.g., Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Conrad, </em>420 U.S. 546, 558-59, 95 S.Ct. 1239, 1246, 43 L.Ed.2d 448 (1975); <em>Carroll v. Princess Anne, </em>393 U.S. 175, 180-81, 89 S.Ct. 347, 351, 21 L.Ed.2d 325 (1968); <em>see also Nebraska Press Ass\u2019n v.

The Court has suggested that although the Government may not be able to restrain an individual from expressing himself, it does not follow that he cannot be punished if he abuses his rights. <em>Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad, supra, </em>420 U.S. 558-59, 95 S.Ct. 1246.</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-11\">We are mindful that the Supreme Court has held that a system of prior administrative notice of a determination of obscenity as to particular publications,' with subsequent criminal prosecution for distribution possible, violated constitutional rights protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>See, e.g., Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan, </em>372 U.S. 58, 70-71, 83 S.Ct. 631, 639, 9 L.Ed.2d 584 (1963).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Such a conclusion is not justified here, however, because there is no such prior administrative determination, nor any significant risk that one may be prosecuted for engaging in protected conduct. We cannot say that on its face the Wichita ordinance has the infirmities of a prior restraint. The standard by which materials are to be judged is neither overbroad nor vague and there have been no threats of bad faith enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1293\">*1293</page-number>We conclude that the ordinance imposes no unlawful prior restraint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-5\">TRIAL BY JURY</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-6\">News also contends that the ordinance is unconstitutional because it violates the Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury. More specifically, it argues that prosecutions under the ordinance take place before the Municipal Court for the City of Wichita where trial is to the court,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and the trial occurs without any determination on obscenity by a jury, which is essential since contemporary community standards must be applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-7\">Relying on <em>Miller, supra, </em>413 U.S. at 26, 30, 33-34, 93 S.Ct. at 2616, 2618, 2619-20, News says \u201cthat the only manner in which the facts can be found so as to determine the prevailing standards in the adult community is through the decision of a jury.\u201d Brief of Appellant at 24. News reasons that the obscenity test \u201crequires the participation of the community wherein the action is brought.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 25, 93 S.Ct. at 2615. Likewise, News points to statements in <em>Hamling </em>v. <em>United States, </em>418 U.S. 87, 105, 94 S.Ct. 2887, 2901, 41 L.Ed.2d 590 (1974), that a juror is permitted \u201cto draw on his own knowledge of the views of the average person in the community or vicinage from which he comes for making the required determination .... \u201d News also relies on statements in <em>Ballew v. Georgia, </em>435 U.S. 223, 98 S.Ct. 1029, 55 L.Ed.2d 234 (1978), as support for its position that a jury trial is constitutionally required in the first instance in obscenity cases.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1359-14\">The defendants respond to the jury trial argument, <em>inter alia, </em>by pointing to the right to a jury trial <em>de novo </em>on appeal in such cases. Kansas, like numerous states, has a two-tier system for adjudicating specific eases. In Kansas, \u201c[t]he municipal court of each city shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine cases involving violations of the ordinances of the city.\u201d Kan. StatAnn. \u00a7 12-4104 (1982). Some states provide a jury trial in each tier; others provide a jury only in the second tier but allow an accused to by-pass the first; and still others do not allow an accused to avoid a trial of some sort at the first tier before he obtains a trial by jury at the second. <em>See Ludwig v. Massachusetts, </em>427 U.S. 618, 620, 96 S.Ct. 2781, 2783, 49 L.Ed.2d 732 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-15\">Under the Kansas procedure, on a plea of no contest a finding of guilty may be adjudged. Kan.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 12 \u2014 4406(b) (1982). If an accused pleads guilty, the municipal judge may hear evidence touching on the nature of the case, otherwise ascertain the facts, and then may refuse or accept the plea, assess punishment and enter the proper judgment. Kan.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 12-4407. All trials in the municipal court are to the municipal judge or the municipal judge pro tem. Kan.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 12-4502. However, the accused has the right to appeal and then the case is tried <em>de novo </em>in the district court where trial by jury may be requested.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1360-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1294\">*1294</page-number>The Supreme Court has said that such a procedure affords an accused \u201cthe absolute right to have his guilt determined by a jury composed and operating in accordance with the Constitution.\u201d <em>Ludwig v. Massachusetts, supra, </em>427 U.S. at 625, 96 S.Ct. at 2785. Moreover, it provides him a clean slate. <em>Colten v. Kentucky, </em>407 U.S. 104, 112-19, 92 S.Ct. 1953, 1958-61, 32 L.Ed.2d 584 (1972).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Hence we cannot agree that the decisions of the Supreme Court, considered together, call for a holding that this Kansas procedure for obscenity prosecutions is invalid. The Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Ludwig </em>and <em>Colten </em>have upheld the two-tier systems and the earlier <em>Callan </em>decision is distinguishable, as we have explained, See note 23 <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"ARsq\">We must now consider whether the reference to \u201cthe average person, applying contemporary community standards\u201d in the First Amendment obscenity test, <em>see Roth v. United States, </em>354 U.S. 476, 479, 77 S.Ct. 1304, 1305, 1 L.Ed.2d 1498 (1957), as well as the numerous references to the jury system which the Court has made while construing and defining this test, constitutionally mandate a jury trial in the <em>first </em>instance. News cites state court decisions holding that in obscenity cases an accused must have a jury trial at the first tier. <em>See City of Kansas City v. Darby, </em>544 S.W.2d 529, 532 (Mo.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1295\">*1295</page-number>1976) <em>appeal dismissed, </em>431 U.S. 935, 97 S.Ct. 2644, 53 L.Ed.2d 252 (1977); <em>cf. City of Duluth v. Sarette, </em>283 N.W.2d 533, 537-38 (Minn.1979). The <em>Darby </em>case, which relied on the above-mentioned portions of <em>Miller </em>and <em>Hamling, </em>capsulizes plaintiff\u2019s point, stating that it held <em>\u201cin obscenity cases only, </em>that a trial by jury is required in the first instance and that a trial by jury after appeal to circuit court \u2018does not satisfy the requirements of the Constitution.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Callan </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>127 U.S. 540, 557, 8 S.Ct. 1301, 1307, 32 L.Ed. 223 (1888)). (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-5\">We are not persuaded to follow these decisions. The Supreme Court has not held that the trier of fact in cases applying the obscenity test must, <em>ipso facto, </em>be a jury. The Court has recognized that there is no constitutional right to a trial by jury in state civil proceedings to determine what is obscene material. <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>413 U.S. 836, 93 S.Ct. 2803, 37 L.Ed.2d 993 (1973). Indeed it has been held by some courts that criminal prosecutions for obscenity need not be by jury trials. <em>See Coble </em>v. <em>City of Birmingham, </em>389 So.2d 527, 533 (Ala.Cr.App.1980); <em>Holderfield v. City of Birmingham, </em>380 So.2d 990, 991-93 (Ala.Cr.App.1979), cer<em>t. denied, </em>449 U.S. 888, 101 S.Ct. 245, 66 L.Ed.2d 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-6\">And even assuming that the jury system may be the desirable method for judging obscenity by community standards, the Kansas procedure is not unconstitutional in view of the right it provides for a <em>de novo </em>jury trial on appeal. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rich, </em>63 Pa.Commw. 30, 437 A.2d 516, 520-21 (1981); <em>Manns v. Commonwealth, </em>213 Va. 322,191 S.E.2d 810, (1972); <em>Walker v.

In the <em>de novo </em>jury trial the accused has a clean slate. <em>Colten </em>v. <em>Kentucky, supra, </em>407 U.S. at 119, 92 S.Ct. at 1961. Moreover the appeal stays \u201call further proceedings upon the judgment appealed from,\u201d Kan.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 12-4601 (1982).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1361-9\">We find no violation of plaintiff News\u2019s constitutional rights under the First or Sixth Amendments in the procedure laid out for prosecution of violations of the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-10\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-11\">In sum, we are not convinced that there is any substantive or procedural infirmity demonstrated in the Wichita ordinance.

Thus, News is the only plaintiff-appellant. <em>See </em>Brief of Appellant at 3-4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1351-8\">. By dismissing plaintiffs action, the district court refused to enjoin enforcement of the newly enacted ordinance. The court held that on its face the ordinance was constitutional; the district court did not decide whether the ordinance is constitutional as applied. I R. 119. In such circumstances, we consider only whether the ordinance is constitutional on its face.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1351-9\">. If the district court considers matters outside the pleadings, Rule 12(b) requires the court \u201cto treat the motion to dismiss as one for summary judgment and to dispose of it as provided in Rule 56 [Fed.R.Civ.P. 56].\u201d <em>Carter v. Stanton, </em>405 U.S. 669, 671, 92 S.Ct. 1232, 1234, 31 L.Ed.2d 569 (1972) (per curiam); see <em>Owens v. Rush, </em>654 F.2d 1370, 1377 n. 9 (10th Cir.1981); 6 J. Moore &amp; J. Wicker, <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>(Part 2), \u00b6 56.11 [2] (1982). Here the district court had before it matters outside the pleadings, including two affidavits in support of News\u2019 request for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction. <em>See </em>II R. 1-45. We therefore review the dismissal as an order granting summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1352-6\">. The ordinance in <em>Ginsberg </em>used the test approved in <em>Memoirs v. Massachusetts, </em>383 U.S. 413, 86 S.Ct. 975, 16 L.Ed.2d 1 (1966). Since then, in <em>Miller v. California, </em>413 U.S. 15, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973) the Supreme Court has enunciated a somewhat different test. Under <em>Miller, </em>to determine if material is obscene and therefore unprotected, the trier of fact must inquire:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1352-7\">(a) whether \u201cthe average person, applying contemporary community standards\u201d would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest; (b) whether the work depicts or describes in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and (c) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1352-8\"><em>Miller, supra, </em>413 U.S. at 24, 93 S.Ct. at 2615 (citations omitted). The Wichita ordinance and the statute approved in <em>Ginsberg </em>both adapted the current obscenity test so it could be used to determine whether material is harmful to minors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1352-9\">. Plaintiff also argues that the ordinance \u201cexceeds the rights conferred on the Government by <em>Ginsberg v. New York.\u201d </em>Brief of Appellant at 10. Plaintiff argues it is inconsistent with <em>Ginsberg </em>to create an affirmative defense for displays that have a bona fide governmental, educational or scientific purpose. We disagree and address the equal protection issues stemming from this later. <em>See infra </em>Part II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-11\">Plaintiff\u2019s contention that the ordinance is inconsistent with <em>Ginsberg </em>because it proscribes distribution and display of material that is not \u201csuitable\u201d for minors is without merit. The ordinance approved in <em>Ginsberg </em>and Wichita\u2019s ordinance both use this term in the same context.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-12\">We similarly reject plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the Wichita ordinance unconstitutionally expands the definition of obscenity to include \u201cwithin its proscriptions ... definitions which are also incongruous with the \u2018patently offensive\u2019 element of <em>Miller </em>and which encompass depictions of sexual conduct which are clearly legitimate and not \u2018hard <em>core.\u2019 \u201d </em>Brief of Appellant at 13. Although the ordinance does proscribe dissemination of some material protected as to adults, the proscription applies only to dissemination or display to juveniles, not adults. Plaintiff\u2019s argument implicitly, rejects the rule from <em>Ginsberg </em>that it is constitutional to proscribe dissemination of generally protected materials to juveniles when such materials are harmful to them. Later cases recognize that the state has a legitimate interest in preventing juveniles from being exposed to sexually oriented materials even when they are not obscene as to adults. <em>See, e.g., New York v. Ferber, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 102 S.Ct. 3348, 3354, 73 L.Ed.2d 1113 (1982); <em>FCC v.

California, supra, </em>413 U.S. at 19, 93 S.Ct. at 2612.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1353-8\">. We are not faced with an ordinance that is overbroad because it prohibits dissemination to minors of material that is not even obscene as to them. The Wichita ordinance is limited so that only material that is obscene as to minors may not be exposed to them. When courts have found .similar legislation overbroad, generally the legislation has in some way sought to regulate material that is not obscene even as to minors. <em>See Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville, </em>422 U.S. 205, 95 S.Ct. 2268, 45 L.Ed.2d 125 (1975) (ordinance making it an offense for outdoor drive-in theatre to exhibit film containing any nudity); <em>American Booksellers\u2019 Ass\u2019n v. McAuliffe, </em>533 F.Supp. 50 (N.D.Ga.1981) (statute prohibiting display or sale to minors of material containing nude figures held over-broad because prohibition extends to material not obscene as to minors); <em>Allied Artists Pictures Corp. v. Alford, </em>410 F.Supp. 1348 (W.D. Tenn.1976) (ordinance overbroad because it prohibited exposing juveniles to films containing language that was not obscene as to juveniles); <em>American Booksellers Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Superior Court, </em>129 Cal.App.3d 197, 181 Cal.Rptr. 33 (2d Dist.1982) (ordinance overbroad because it required sealing material containing any photo whose primary purpose is sexual arousal regardless of whether obscene as to minors); <em>Calderon v. City of Buffalo, </em>61 A.D.2d 323, 402 N.Y.S.2d 685 (1978) (ordinance overbroad because it prohibited sale and exhibition to juveniles of material that was not obscene as to juveniles); <em>Oregon v. Frink, </em>60 Or.App. 209, 653 P.2d 553 (1982) (statute prohibiting dissemination of all nudity to minors overbroad because it does not limit prohibition to material that is obscene as to juveniles).</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-12\">Nor are we faced with an ordinance whose standard for determining whether material is obscene either to minors or adults is vague. The Wichita Ordinance uses almost the identical language approved in <em>Ginsberg </em>with the exception of using the <em>Miller </em>test. When legislation designed to protect minors from sexually oriented matters has been found to be unconstitutionally vague, the standard for evaluating whether the material was obscene as to minors has generally been the source of the vagueness. <em>See, e.g., Rabeck v. New York, </em>391 U.S. 462, 88 S.Ct. 1716, 20 L.Ed.2d 741 (1968) (per curiam); <em>Interstate Circuit, Inc. v.

Plaintiff News relies, <em>inter alia, </em>on <em>Callan v. Wilson, </em>127 U.S. 540, 8 S.Ct. 1301, 32 L.Ed. 223 (1888). In <em>Ludwig, supra, </em>427 U.S. at 629-30, 96 S.Ct. at 2787-88, the Supreme Court pointed out that <em>Callan </em>recognized that the sources of the right to jury trial in the federal courts are several and include Art. Ill, \u00a7 2, cl. 3, of the Constitution which requires that \u201c[tjhe trial of all Crimes ... shall be by Jury.\u201d That language was said to be capable of being read as prohibiting, in the absence of a defendant\u2019s consent, a federal trial without a jury; and the court noted that the provision is not applicable to the States. 427 U.S. at 630, 96 S.Ct. at 2788. The right of trial by jury in state court as a matter of federal constitutional law derives from the Sixth Amendment as applied to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Duncan v. Louisiana, </em>391 U.S. 145, 149-50, 88 S.Ct. 1444, 1447-48, 20 L.Ed.2d 491 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-23\">Furthermore, <em>Ludwig </em>also noted that to the extent that <em>Callan </em>may have rested on a determination that the right to a second tier jury trial was unduly burdened by a requirement that an accused be \u201cfully tried\u201d without a jury at the first tier, <em>Callan </em>was not controlling in a Massachusetts case like <em>Ludwig </em>because the defendant was able to circumvent trial in the Massachusetts first tier by \u201cadmitting to sufficient findings of fact.\u201d 427 U.S. at 630, 96 S.Ct. at 2788.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-24\">We believe that the instant Kansas case is distinguishable from <em>Callan, </em>as was the Massachusetts case in <em>Ludwig. </em>The Kansas two-tier system also permits a defendant to avoid being \u201cfully tried\u201d at the first tier. In a Kansas municipal court a defendant can plead guilty or no contest, Kan.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 12\u20144406 (1982), and sentence must be imposed without unreasonable delay. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 12-4507. The defendant then can appeal to the district court where he \u201chas an absolute right to a trial <em>de novo </em>...,\u201d <em>State v. Parker, </em>213 Kan. 229, 516 P.2d 153, 158 (1973), and the appeal stays \u201call further proceedings upon the judgment appealed from.\u201d Kan.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 22-3609(1) (1981); <em>see also Id. </em>\u00a7 12\u20144601 (1982). The defendant is entitled to \u201ca trial <em>de novo ... </em>regardless of lack of error or <em>the nature of his plea </em>in the lower court.\u201d <em>State v. Parker, supra, </em>516 P.2d at 157 (emphasis added). \u201cThe defendant\u2019s right to a new trial is unrestricted in that all he is required to do to obtain it is to appeal.\u201d <em>Id., </em>516 P.2d at 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-25\">We feel that both grounds used in <em>Ludwig </em>to distinguish <em>Callan </em>apply here and that the Kansas procedure is supported by <em>Ludwig.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b1361-7\">. As amicus curiae, the State of Kansas argues that there can be no violation of the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial because a violation of the ordinance is a petty offense. The amicus points out that the maximum penalty under the ordinance is a fine of not more than five hundred dollars and a jail term not to exceed one month. Although we recognize that a petty offense is \u201cusually defined by reference to the maximum punishment that might be imposed ...,\u201d <em>Ludwig v. Massachusetts, </em>427 U.S. 618, 624-25, 96 S.Ct. 2781, 2785, 49 L.Ed.2d 732 (1976), and that a maximum one month sentence and five hundred dollar fine might be light enough to be a petty offense, <em>see Baldwin </em>v. <em>New York, </em>399 U.S. 66, 90 S.Ct. 1886, 26 L.Ed.2d 437 (1970) (plurality); <em>Duncan v.

Under the ordinance, \u201c[ejach day that any violation of [the ordinance] occurs or continues shall constitute a separate offense [, and] [e]very act, thing, or transaction prohibited by [the ordinance] shall constitute a separate offense as to each item, issue or title involved....\u201d In such circumstances, we are not inclined to rely on the \u201cill-defined, if not ambulatory\u201d boundaries of the petty offense category. <em>Duncan v.
