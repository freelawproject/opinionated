Civ.P., prohibiting his execution under sentence of the Florida State courts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The motion was presented to this court orally by telephone call from attorneys in Atlanta and, in substantially the same form and language, by telephone call from attorneys in Jacksonville, Florida. Two judges on the panel were present in the court clerk\u2019s office where the motion was being received and recorded; the third judge was on an open telephone line from his chambers in Montgomery, Alabama. The recording of the motion was played back and, in case it was not clearly audible, the grounds of the motion were restated to the judge in Montgomery. Without interruption, the judges conferred and considered the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-10\">The sole issue presented is appellant\u2019s contention that the carrying out of the appellant\u2019s death sentence by means of electrocution is cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Appellant asserts this contention in an action brought against R.L. Dugger, Superintendent, Florida State Prison and Louie L. Wainwright, Secretary, Florida Department of Corrections. The action is brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 alleging the deprivation of a constitutional right under color of state law. Appellant does not challenge the fact or nature of his sentence or the state\u2019s right to execute him thus distinguishing this \u00a7 1983 action from one brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (state habe-as).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-13\">After due consideration consistent with the time available to the court, the motion is denied. <em>In re Kemmler, </em>136 U.S. 436, 10 S.Ct. 930, 34 L.Ed. 519, <em>quoted in Gregg </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>428 U.S. 153, 170, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 2923, 49 L.Ed.2d 859 (where the Supreme Court held that a New York statute providing for electrocution as the method for carrying out a sentence of capital punishment was constitutional); <em>Spinkellink v. Wainwright, </em>578 F.2d 582, 616 (5th Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-14\">The court\u2019s action was immediately transmitted by telephone to the attorneys who had presented the motion and counsel for adverse parties. This order is written confirmation of the order of court announced in that fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-15\">The two oral presentations are considered as one motion. At about 10:15 a.m., the written motion with accompanying record material arrived in the clerk\u2019s office and was immediately reviewed. It presents the same issue as had been telephonically communicated. Therefore the two telephone communications and the written motions are considered as one motion and this order of denial covers the motion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b790-11\">. Appellant had appeared before the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida seeking temporary restraining order and a permanent injunction and appellant had filed a notice of appeal from adverse ruling by that court. The injunctive relief sought here was to prevent the carrying out of the sentence pending a trial on the merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
