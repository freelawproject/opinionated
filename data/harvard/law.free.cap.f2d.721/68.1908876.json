Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AAa\">Appellants in this case are four physicians and their employer, Cardio-Medical Associates, Ltd. (hereafter referred to as \u201cplaintiffs\u201d). All four physicians practice in Pennsylvania and specialize in cardiology and internal medicine. Cardio-Medical Associates is a Pennsylvania corporation created for the purpose of facilitating the physicians\u2019 practice of cardiology and internal medicine</p>\n<p id=\"Ak\">Appellees are the Crozer-Chester Medical Center and various of its employees (hereafter referred to as \u201cdefendants\u201d). The Medical Center is a health care facility located in Upland, Pennsylvania. It provides various medical services, including cardio-logical services. Plaintiffs maintain their offices in one of the buildings in defendants\u2019 complex.</p>\n<p id=\"AkN\">Plaintiffs filed a complaint against defendants in the district court in 1981, charging violations of sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, and the equal protection and due process clauses of \u201e i , <em>\\ </em>, the fourteenth amendment. Plaintiffs al- . , , , \u201e . j n A , . eged that defendants had entered into contracts and other agreements to prevent the plaintiff doctors from using certain of defendants specialized cardiological equipment, located m defendants complex. These agreements, according to plaintiffs, were part of a conspiracy to restrain trade and monopolize the local market for cardio-logical services. As a result, plaintiffs were allegedly foreclosed from this market and were injured both in their ability to offer full cardiological services to existing patients and in their ability to attract new patients.</p>\n<p id=\"Avr\">Defendants answered the complaint and then filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(c), alleging a failure to state a claim and lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The district court granted this motion. The constitutional claim was dismissed with prejudice, and plaintiffs have not renewed that claim in subsequent proceedings. The Sherman Act claims were dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. This dismissal was without prejudice, and plaintiffs were given sixty days in which to file an amended complaint. 536 F.Supp. 1065.</p>\n<p id=\"AiW\">, Pontiffs filed a timely amended comPlaJnt m Jhlch, they renewed their claims un^e\" sectl01ns! 1 and ? of the Sherman Act and de\u2122anded\u2019 for the first time, a jury J Wlthout \u2122rmg this complaint, de*eildants moved to dismiss for lack of * Jjed; matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1). Defendants also moved to strike plaintiffs\u2019 demand for a jury trial and to stay au discovery pending disposition of the j^uje 12(b)(1) motion</p>\n<p id=\"Adr\">. . . In sffate \u00abP1111011?* the dlstnct court ^ai\\ted both the motion to strike the de- . mand for 8' ?U17tnal- 95 J*RD-194&gt; and the motion to dismiss, 552 F.Supp. 1170. Plaint\u00f3fsfPeal from orders implementing those tw0 decisi0ns'</p>\n<p id=\"ar-dedup-0\">jj. <em>Jurisdiction Under the Sherman Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"AH\">Sections j and 2 of tbe gherman Act both r ire that tbe actg hibited b those \u201e , \u2022 \u201e , . , , , sections relate to trade or commerce <em>u </em>____ , \u2022., , ,, mi* among the several States . This requirement intergtate commerce hag been con. gtrued ag an e]ement of both ^ jur.igdic. t\u00edonal gtandard and ^ subgtantive offense under the Sherman Act. <em>See Mortensen v. </em>First Federal Savings <em>&amp; Loan Association, </em>549 F.2d 884, 890-91 (3d Cir.1977). In the present apppeal we are concerned only with jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"AMQ\">There are two wayg to gatigfy tbe jurisdictional requirement. The proscribed conduct may ifeelf be \u00abin interstate commeree\u201d, or the conduct may be a purely intrastate activity that has a \u201csubstantial and adverse effect\u201d (or, what is apparently the same thing, a \u201cnot insubstantial effect\u201d) on interstate commerce. <em>See, e.g., McLain v. Real Estate Board of New Orleans, </em>444 U.S. 232, 246, 100 S.Ct. 502, 511, 62 L.Ed.2d 441 (1980) (\u201cnot insubstantial effect\u201d); <em>Hospital Building Co. </em>v. <em>Trustees of Rex Hospital, </em>425 U.S. 738, 743, 96 S.Ct. 1848, 1852, 48 L.Ed.2d 338 (1976) (\u201csubstantially and adversely affects interstate commerce\u201d). In this appeal, plaintiffs argue that they have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>adequately alleged that defendants\u2019 actions had the requisite \u201ceffect\u201d on commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">The first issue that we must consider is the question of the type of effect that must be shown. The district court held that plaintiffs\u2019 complaint must satisfy a \u201ctripartite test\u201d by demonstrating the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-5\">(i) the <em>presence </em>of interstate commerce; (ii) the existence of a <em>substantial and adverse effect </em>on interstate commerce; and (iii) the requisite <em>nexus </em>between the challenged activities of defendants and the effect on the relevant channel of interstate commerce.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">552 F.Supp. at 1177 (emphasis in original). The district court based this test on language in various decisions of the Supreme Court. In our opinion, however, the first and third findings in this analysis are subsumed within the second finding. <em>Cf. McLain, </em>444 U.S. at 242, 100 S.Ct. at 509; <em>Hospital Building Co., </em>425 U.S. at 743-44, 96 S.Ct. at 1852. We therefore require only that plaintiffs show a substantial and adverse effect on commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">This court has elsewhere explained this requirement in the following terms: \u201c[s]ub-stantiality of effect ... is to be viewed on a case-by-case, practical economic basis, from the perspective of whether the local activity has a significant impact on competition in commerce and whether the commerce so affected is substantial in volume.\u201d <em>Harold Friedman, Inc. v. Thorofare Markets Inc., </em>587 F.2d 127, 132 (3d Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">The district court also held that the plaintiffs may not meet their burden merely by demonstrating that the defendants\u2019 conduct \u201cshifted\u201d the flow of interstate commerce away from the plaintiffs and toward some other firm. According to the district court, the plaintiffs must demonstrate a net change in the flow of interstate commerce into or out of the state. 552 F.Supp. at 1178. In making such a showing, \u201cthe identified aspect of interstate commerce must relate to the activities of the plaintiffs, not the defendants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1177. We consider these two holdings in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">There is no doubt, at least in the Third Circuit, that the requisite effect need not be a reduction in commerce. In <em>Harold Friedman Inc., supra, </em>we held that the effect need not be of any particular magnitude so long as it is substantial, and in fact the requirement may be satisfied \u201ceven if interstate commerce is increased by the anticompetitive conduct.\u201d 587 F.2d at 132.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-11\">This does not answer the question, however, whether there must be either an increase or decrease in net trade. This issue has not been addressed directly either by the Supreme Court or by this court. We approached the issue in <em>Harold Friedman, Inc., </em>where we held that the plaintiff had met its burden by showing a decrease in its own trade and an increase in the defendant\u2019s trade. We did not consider the result where the decreases and increases were equal and therefore produced only a \u201cshift\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-12\">The Sixth Circuit has directly addressed this issue and concluded that a mere shift is sufficient to satisfy the requirement of an effect on interstate commerce. In <em>James R. Snyder Co., Inc. </em>v. <em>Associated General Contractors of America, </em>677 F.2d 1111 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. </em>denied, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 374, 74 L.Ed.2d 508 (1982), the court looked to the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>McLain </em>and <em>Hospital Building Co. </em>and concluded that the effect of the defendant\u2019s conduct on the net flow of interstate commerce was not of any particular significance. 677 F.2d at 1114-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-15\">We agree that the decisions in <em>McLain </em>and <em>Hospital Building Co. </em>do not require any particular type of substantial effect on commerce. In <em>McLain, </em>the Court considered the effects on commerce of an alleged conspiracy by real estate brokers to fix brokerage rates in New Orleans. The Court held that the jurisdictional requirement was satisfied by allegations that the conspiracy affected both the sale of real estate to interstate buyers and the financing of those sales by interstate lenders. 444 U.S. at 245, 100 S.Ct. at 510-11. Although noting that such a conspiracy would probably have an effect on \u201cthe frequency and terms of residential sales transactions,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 246, 100 S.Ct. at 511, the Court did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>appear to require the plaintiff to demonstrate or allege any particular effect on the overall flow of realty-related commerce into the state. Instead, the Court explained that jurisdiction would not be defeated \u201cby plaintiff\u2019s failure to quantify the adverse impact of defendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 243, 100 S.Ct. at 510. <em>Cf. Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, </em>421 U.S. 773, 785, 95 S.Ct. 2004, 2012, 44 L.Ed.2d 572 (1975) (\u201conce an effect is shown, no specific magnitude need be proved\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">In <em>Hospital Building Co., </em>the Court considered the jurisdictional sufficiency of a complaint charging defendants with conspiring to obstruct plaintiff\u2019s attempt to build a new hospital in North Carolina. The Court held that the plaintiff\u2019s burden was satisfied by allegations that the conspiracy, if successful, would substantially reduce the plaintiff\u2019s purchase of out-of-state drugs and supplies and render unnecessary the planned interstate financing for the construction. 425 U.S. at 744, 96 S.Ct. at 1852. The Court expressed no interest in whether the financing and purchases would simply be shifted to some other hospital project.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">This unwillingness of the Supreme Court to require a plaintiff to quantify the adverse impact of the defendant\u2019s conduct on interstate trade makes it difficult to understand how a plaintiff can be required to show a net change in the flow of business into or out of the state. Such a showing would depend on a comparison of quantities lost with quantities gained, and would in effect require the plaintiff to make a showing that <em>Goldfarb </em>refuses to require. We are unwilling to impose such a requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">There is another reason to draw back from the district court\u2019s \u201cshifting\u201d theory. It has been frequently observed that Congress, in enacting the Sherman Act, intended to regulate anticompetitive conduct to the full extent of its power under the Commerce Clause. <em>See, e.g., Hospital Building Co., </em>425 U.S. at 743 n. 2, 96 S.Ct. at 1852 n. 2; <em>Harold Friedman, Inc., </em>587 F.2d at 135. There can be no doubt that Congress may, if it wishes, regulate anticompetitive conduct that affects interstate commerce, even if that conduct does not change the net flow of interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">The district court noted, and defendants repeat in their brief on appeal, that the shifting theory receives support from a recent Supreme Court decision, <em>Exxon Corp. v. Maryland, </em>437 U.S. 117, 98 S.Ct. 2207, 57 L.Ed.2d 91 (1978). There the Supreme Court considered a challenge under the Commerce Clause to a Maryland statute prohibiting oil refiners from owning and operating retail outlets for their products within the state. The Court rejected the challenge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-11\">The source of the consumers\u2019 supply may switch from company-operated stations to independent dealers, but interstate commerce is not subjected to an impermissible burden simply because an otherwise valid regulation causes some business to shift from one interstate supplier to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-12\">437 U.S. at 127, 98 S.Ct. at 2214.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-13\">In our opinion, this language is inapposite. There are at least two powers embodied in the Commerce Clause. One is the power of the Commerce Clause that authorizes Congress\u2019s own regulation of interstate trade. This aspect was not implicated in the <em>Exxon Corp. </em>decision. The other power is that of the \u201cdormant\u201d clause, which is used by the judiciary to invalidate state regulations interfering with an area of interstate trade that Congress intends, by implication, to leave free. This is the aspect of the Commerce Clause at issue in <em>Exxon Corp. </em>The Court ruled that a state regulation that merely shifts commerce from one enterprise to another cannot be regarded as interfering with an implicit decision by Congress to keep interstate trade free. This does not mean, however, that Congress could not itself affirmatively act to regulate intrastate conduct that has no greater effect on interstate commerce than the Maryland statute has.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-14\">We are also reluctant to adopt the shifting theory because of our uncertainty about what the theory would require. The district court in this case assumed that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>was a shift in trade because the plaintiffs lost business which the defendants acquired. <em>See, e.g., </em>552 F.Supp. at 1192, 1194. In order to determine whether there is a net change in the volume of interstate commerce, however, it might be necessary to consider. other factors or examine other transactions. For example, it might be necessary to consider differences between the different parties\u2019 trade practices, such as their sources of supply or the prices they pay. It is also unclear what the relevant time frame would be for assessing the changes. It is not appropriate to burden the jurisdictional inquiry with such complications.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">Finally, we find ourselves in disagreement with the shifting theory because it reflects a misunderstanding of the role the Commerce Clause plays in the Sherman Act, at least insofar as jurisdiction is concerned. The purpose of the Sherman Act is to protect competition against certain restraints and monopolistic conduct. Anti-competitive conduct may occur locally as well as in interstate commerce. Congress, however, is constrained in its attempt to regulate this conduct by the limits of the Commerce Clause, the source of its authority. It is not relevant to the purpose of regulating anticompetitive conduct that the conduct affect the net volume of interstate trade, nor is it necessary to the exercise of congressional power under the Commerce Clause. What is relevant is the presence in interstate commerce of transactions that, as a result of the anticompetitive conduct, are \u201csubstantially\u201d different from the transactions that would otherwise have occurred. These may be differences in the overall number or volume of such transactions, but they may also be differences in the terms of the transactions, or the parties thereto. Such transactions \u201cburden\u201d interstate commerce because they are the result, directly or indirectly, of conduct that violates federal antitrust policy. They are a burden not on the volume of trade, but on the freedom of trade.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">The district court also held that \u201cthe identified aspect of interstate commerce must relate to the activities of plaintiffs, and not defendants.\u201d 552 F.Supp. at 1177. Elsewhere in its opinion, the court noted that \u201c[t]he extent of defendants\u2019 activities in interstate commerce ... is irrelevant in establishing jurisdiction under the Sherman Act in denial of hospital staff privileges cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1190 n. 22. Although this language seems puzzling, we do not read it literally. Clearly the defendants\u2019 conduct is relevant to jurisdiction under the Sherman Act insofar as the requisite effects on commerce must derive either directly or indirectly from that conduct. We understand the district court to be making a different point \u2014 not that defendants\u2019 conduct is irrelevant, but that it is only relevant insofar as it affects interstate commerce through the person of the plaintiffs. Earlier, the court had held that the only conduct by the defendants relevant to the jurisdictional inquiry was the defendants\u2019 allegedly <em>illegal </em>conduct. 552 F.Supp. at 1178 n. 6.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Combining these two holdings, we conclude that the court wished to tie the jurisdictional inquiry to the substantive offense by requiring that the same conduct be the basis for both showings.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">We could rest our holding on plaintiffs\u2019 jurisdictional allegations, discussed below, without reviewing the district court\u2019s limitation on the scope of the jurisdictional inquiry. We have decided to reach the issue, however, because the district court\u2019s theory conflicts with the approach taken by this court in recent decisions and with the approach in other circuits. Although this court has not ruled on the issue directly, it has shown its willingness in several recent cases to consider the defendant\u2019s conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>both as it affects interstate commerce through the person of the plaintiff and as it affects commerce directly. <em>See Harold Friedman, Inc., </em>587 F.2d at 134; <em>J.P. Mascaro &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Wm. J. O\u2019Hara, Inc., </em>565 F.2d 264, 266 (3d Cir.1977); <em>Mortensen v. First Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association, </em>549 F.2d 884, 897 (3d Cir.1977). The district court\u2019s approach also conflicts directly with a recent decision by the Ninth Circuit, <em>Hahn v. Oregon Physicians Service, </em>689 F.2d 840, 844 (9th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 3115, 77 L.Ed.2d 1369 (1983). <em>See also Konik v. Champlain Valley Physicians Hospital Medical Center, </em>561 F.Supp. 700, 710-12 (N.D.N.Y.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">In our opinion there is no reason why an enterprise engaged in nationwide anticom-petitive conduct should not be subject to suit by a local victim simply because the defendant\u2019s conduct, as regards that particular plaintiff, does not affect interstate commerce. Moreover, there seems to be no reason why, as a matter of constitutional authority, Congress may not create a cause of action for wholly intrastate plaintiffs as part of a scheme to regulate anticompeti-tive conduct that otherwise affects interstate commerce. <em>See Maryland v. Wirtz, </em>392 U.S. 183, 193, 88 S.Ct. 2017, 2022, 20 L.Ed.2d 1020 (1968). We therefore decline to adopt the district court\u2019s theory that defendants\u2019 conduct is relevant to the jurisdictional inquiry only insofar as it affects interstate commerce through the person of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">In sum, this court will review plaintiffs\u2019 complaint to determine whether it has alleged a substantial and adverse, or a not insubstantial, effect on interstate commerce. We do not require that plaintiffs allege a net change in the volume of interstate commerce. Finally, we are willing to examine the defendants\u2019 conduct both as it affects interstate commerce through the person of the plaintiff and as it affects commerce independently.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">\n<em>III. CMA\u2019s Jurisdictional Allegations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">We now turn to consider whether plaintiffs have met their burden and established that the district court should take jurisdiction over their claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">By way of introduction, we note that defendants\u2019 motion under Rule 12(b)(1) was filed prior to any answer. The motion is therefore a facial challenge to jurisdiction, asserting that plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, on its face, does not allege sufficient effects on interstate commerce to warrant the court in taking jurisdiction. As this court has explained elsewhere, and as the district court recognized, the court in assessing a Rule 12(b)(1) motion based on the pleadings must assume that the allegations contained in the complaint are true. <em>Mortensen, </em>549 F.2d at 891. The Supreme Court has noted that such dismissals \u201cshould be granted very sparingly.\u201d <em>Hospital Building Co., </em>425 U.S. at 746, 96 S.Ct. at 1853.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-11\">Plaintiffs argue that the district court, although declaring its intention to consider defendants\u2019 motion according to this rule, nonetheless refused repeatedly to assume the truth of the allegations in the complaint and rebutted the allegations with its own assertions founded on \u201clogic\u201d and common sense. Defendants respond that the district court was simply exercising its right to take judicial notice of adjudicative facts under Fed.R.Evid. 201.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-12\">Frequently during its analysis of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, the district court rejected the factual allegations contained therein. For example, in considering the allegation that defendants\u2019 conduct affected the interstate travel of patients seeking cardiological therapy, the district court asserted that it was \u201clogically inconceivable\u201d that plaintiffs\u2019 ability or inability to offer the services in question could have \u201cany discernible impact\u201d on the travel of patients. In choosing a doctor, according to the district court, patients do not consider whether the doctor provides a service \u201cthat the patient cannot even pronounce.\u201d 552 F.Supp. at 1188. This rejection of plaintiffs\u2019 allegation cannot be justified as judicial notice under Rule 201. That rule defines a \u201cjudicially noticed fact\u201d as one \u201cnot subject to reasonable dispute in that it is either (1) generally known within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>territorial jurisdiction of the trial court or (2) capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\u201d Clearly the district court\u2019s assertion is reasonably disputable. It is not \u201cgenerally known\u201d, nor is any source offered for determining its accuracy. In reviewing plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, we will therefore assume that the jurisdictional allegations are true.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">We arrive finally at the heart of this appeal, the jurisdictional allegations set forth in plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. We need only consider a few of these allegations to conclude that plaintiffs have satisfied their burden at this stage in the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">First, plaintiffs allege that both they and defendants offer cardiological services to patients living in an area defined by a radius extending eight to ten miles from defendants\u2019 complex. This area includes portions of the states of New Jersey and Delaware, in addition to Pennsylvania. Plaintiffs allege that approximately 12-15% of their patients are from out-of-state, and that these patients account for over $100,-000 of plaintiffs\u2019 annual revenue. On this basis, plaintiffs allege that approximately 12-15% of the additional patients they would have served in the absence of defendants\u2019 allegedly anticompetitive conduct would have come from out-of-state, and that the total revenues from these patients would have been in the hundreds of thousands of dollars during the relevant time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">In addition, plaintiffs allege that cardio-logical services require the use of large amounts of drugs and other medications, and that most of these products are manufactured out-of-state. Defendants\u2019 practices have allegedly prevented plaintiffs from prescribing medication for the patients it would have served in the absence of such practices, and have thereby affected the interstate trade in such medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">This brief restatement of plaintiffs\u2019 jurisdictional allegations is by no means exhaustive. Plaintiffs allege various other ways in which defendants\u2019 conduct has affected interstate commerce. We need proceed no further, however, because we conclude on the basis of the allegations already described that plaintiffs have met their burden at this stage of the proceedings. Interferences with the interstate travel of patients, the interstate payment of fees, and the interstate purchase of medication are well-recognized methods for demonstrating an effect on interstate commerce in antitrust litigation. <em>See, e.g., Hospital Building Co., </em>425 U.S. at 744, 96 S.Ct. at 1852; <em>Mishler v. St. Anthony\u2019s Hospital Systems, </em>694 F.2d 1225, 1227 (10th Cir.1981); <em>Pontius v. Children\u2019s Hospital, </em>552 F.Supp. 1352, 1361 (W.D.Pa. 1982); <em>Pao v. Holy Redeemer Hospital, </em>547 F.Supp. 484, 490 (E.D.Pa.1982). We therefore conclude that plaintiffs\u2019 pleadings meet the jurisdictional requirements of the Sherman Act, and we reverse the district court\u2019s holding to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">\n<em>IV. CMA\u2019s Jury Demand</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">Because we reverse on the jurisdictional issue, we must consider plaintiffs\u2019 argument that they are entitled to a jury trial on remand. Plaintiffs concede in their brief that, with respect to the original complaint, they have waived their right to a jury trial by failing to make a demand within ten days of the final pleadings. Fed.R.Civ.P. 38(d). Plaintiffs contend, however, that the dismissal of the entire original complaint without prejudice requires us to treat that complaint as if it never existed, and to conclude that plaintiffs are entitled to a jury trial on the basis of the \u201ctimely\u201d demand contained in the amended complaint. The district court rejected that contention, 95 F.R.D. 194, and so do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-11\">Our decision is based in large part on another decision of this court, <em>Borelli v. City of Reading, </em>532 F.2d 950 (3d Cir.1976) (per curiam). There we held that a dismissal without prejudice, with leave to amend, is not a final order until either the time for amendment has expired or the plaintiff has announced its intention to stand on the complaint. Until then, the dismissal \u201cis neither final nor appealable because the deficiency may be corrected by the plaintiff without affecting the cause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>action.\u201d 532 F.2d at 951. In the present case the portion of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint asserting claims under the Sherman Act was dismissed without prejudice, with leave to amend the jurisdictional allegations within sixty days. Plaintiffs amended their complaint as suggested and filed it in a timely manner. The amended complaint asserted identical claims under the Sherman Act. It was given the same docket number as the original complaint, and it was assigned to the same district judge. No new filing fees were paid, and no new summons was served on the defendants. There can be no doubt that, in such circumstances, the dismissal order was not final and plaintiffs must remain bound to their waiver of a jury trial on the basis of the original pleadings. The fact that the original complaint was dismissed in its entirety does not distinguish this case from others in which the plaintiff has not been allowed to make a new demand for a jury trial on the basis of amended pleadings. <em>See, e.g., Southern Equipment Co. v. Christensen, </em>40 F.R.D. 126 (S.D.N.Y.1966); <em>Ridge Theatre Corp. </em>v. <em>United Artists Corp., </em>27 F.R.D. 8 (E.D.Pa.1961).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Plaintiffs allege that this result is inconsistent with a series of cases considering the effect of a dismissal without prejudice on the tolling of a statute of limitations. Again, we reject this contention. It is a well recognized principle that a statute of limitations is not tolled by the filing of a complaint subsequently dismissed without prejudice. As regards the statute of limitations, the original complaint is treated as if it never existed. <em>See Butler v. Sinn, </em>423 F.2d 1116 (3d Cir.1970) (per curiam); <em>Di Sabatino </em>v. <em>Mertz, </em>82 F.Supp. 248 (M.D.Pa.1949). The cases that so hold, however, are distinguishable from the instant appeal on precisely the issue that we identify as determinative in this ease, namely the finality of the dismissal. Many of the cases we have read involved voluntary dismissals. <em>See, e.g., Goff </em>v. <em>United States, </em>659 F.2d 560 (5th Cir.1981). A voluntary dismissal is a final order. <em>See LeCompte v. Mr. Chip, Inc., </em>528 F.2d 601, 603 (5th Cir.1976). Other decisions involved circumstances that make it equally clear the dismissal was final. <em>See, e.g., Gainey </em>v. <em>Brotherhood of Railway and Steamship Clerks, </em>275 F.Supp. 292 (E.D.Pa.1967) (more than six years between two complaints); <em>Falsetti v. Local Union No. 2026, United Mine Workers, </em>249 F.Supp. 970 (E.D.Pa.1965) (first suit in state court, second in federal court). Moreover, the rule has not been applied in cases where there was no final order of dismissal. <em>See, e.g., Gordon v. Green, </em>602 F.2d 743 (5th Cir.1979) (complaint amended under Rule 15). <em>But see Moore v. St. Louis Music Supply Co., </em>539 F.2d 1191 (8th Cir.1976) (implying that dismissal without prejudice will necessarily bar amended complaint).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">V. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">For the reasons set forth above, we will reverse the district court\u2019s order dismissing the amended complaint and will affirm the order striking the jury demand. Costs are awarded in the proportion of seven-eighths to plaintiffs and one-eighth to defendants.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b146-5\">. The district court based the shifting theory in part on <em>Moles v. Morton F. Plant Hospital, Inc., </em>1980-81 Tr.Cas. \u00b6 63,600 (M.D.Fla.1978), <em>aff\u2019d mem., </em>617 F.2d 293 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 919, 101 S.Ct. 317, 66 L.Ed.2d 147 (1980). We decline to follow that decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b146-9\">. In view of our holding on CMA\u2019s jurisdictional allegations, <em>infra, </em>it is unnecessary for us to consider whether the district court was correct in limiting its inquiry to the defendants\u2019 <em>Illegal </em>activities. <em>Cf. McLain, </em>444 U.S. at 242-43, 246, 100 S.Ct. at 509-10, 511.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b149-6\">. Plaintiffs have based their argument for a jury trial entirely on Rule 38(b). Plaintiffs have not raised the issue of the availability of a jury trial under Rule 39(b), which gives a court the discretion to grant a jury trial even though proper demand was not made.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
