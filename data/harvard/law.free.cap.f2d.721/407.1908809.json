Lavoie possessed a 28-foot self-contained recreational vehicle (mobile home) in Rhode Island and Connecticut on July 12,1981, the same day in which the vehicle had been stolen from its sales lot in Massachusetts. The only issue at trial was whether Lavoie knew that the vehicle was stolen. The defense maintained that Tommy Serapiglia, a friend in the auto sales and auto salvage business, had loaned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>Lavoie the mobile home. Serapiglia died before trial. On July 12, Lavoie and others commenced a round-trip journey in the mobile home to California. He then stored the vehicle in the driveway outside his sister\u2019s house. Lavoie raises five issues on appeal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">1. Prosecutor\u2019s comment</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Lavoie\u2019s first contention focuses on what he perceived as a reference in the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument to Lavoie\u2019s failure to testify. The prosecutor commented to the jury in his closing rebuttal argument, \u201c... you might ask yourself what has Mr. Lavoie put between himself and the truth? And \u2014\u201d The trial judge then interrupted and admonished the prosecutor, \u201cJust a moment .... Mr. Lavoie doesn\u2019t have to do anything. The entire burden of proving the case rests upon the United States government. Mr. Lavoie doesn\u2019t have to prove anything. He doesn\u2019t have to disprove anything.\u201d Defense counsel did not object or move for a dismissal or a mistrial, but now suggests to this court that the prosecutor\u2019s comment impermissibly invited the jury to draw an adverse inference from Lavoie\u2019s silence during trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">We find Lavoie\u2019s interpretation untenable. The prosecutor\u2019s comment seems directed at the implausibility of the defense theory of how Lavoie came into possession of the recreational vehicle, not at trying to draw attention to Lavoie\u2019s failure to testify. <em>United States v. Ward, </em>552 F.2d 1080 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 850, 98 S.Ct. 161, 54 L.Ed.2d 119 (1977), involved a similar remark in a prosecution for similar activity under the same statute. The court held that the prosecutor\u2019s comment in summation that the defendant, but not the jury, knew where the defendant had gotten a stolen tractor would reasonably be construed by the jury as a reference to defendant\u2019s failure to rebut the natural inference arising from defendant\u2019s possession of the recently stolen tractor rather than as a comment directed at defendant\u2019s failure to testify. 552 F.2d at 1083-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">In the case at bar, the prosecutor\u2019s closing rebuttal argument focused on the gaps in the defendant\u2019s version of how he came to possess a stolen vehicle on the day it was stolen in another state. Given the evidence before the court, the prosecutor quite ex-pectedly and reasonably sought to draw attention to defendant\u2019s failure to rebut the legitimate inference of guilty knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">The trial judge\u2019s response to the prosecutor\u2019s remark indicates that the judge believed that the remark was addressed not to defendant\u2019s failure to take the witness stand, but rather to the allocation of the burden of proof. The judge explicitly censured the prosecutor and immediately and clearly provided the jury with a curative instruction on the burden of proof in a criminal trial. Later, in his instructions to the jury, the judge emphatically told the jurors not to discuss and not to draw any inferences from Lavoie\u2019s exercise of his constitutional right not to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">The comment itself, the court\u2019s response, and the defendant\u2019s failure to object or to move for a dismissal or new trial indicate that the prosecutor\u2019s remark did not refer to the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. We do not believe that a reasonable juror could have construed the prosecutor\u2019s statement as a comment on Lavoie\u2019s silence at trial. <em>See United States v. Savarese, </em>649 F.2d 83, 87 (1st Cir.1981). As such, the challenged statement does not violate this circuit\u2019s proscription on even indirect prosecutorial comment on a defendant\u2019s failure to testify. <em>Cf. United States v. Flannery, </em>451 F.2d 880, 882 (1st Cir.1971) (prosecutor\u2019s reference to \u201cuncontradicted\u201d government testimony impermissible, when \u201ccontradiction\u201d would have required defendant to take the stand).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-11\">This court has not ruled improper prose-cutorial comments that have come closer than the comment in this case to implicating a defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment right. <em>Cf. United States </em>v. <em>Babbitt, </em>683 F.2d 21, 23-24 (1st Cir.1982) (\u201cWhile you search out the truth you may wish to ask yourself, \u2018Who has appeared before me in the form of a witness?\u2019 \u201d) (emphasis deleted); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Savarese, </em>649 F.2d at 86 (\u201cask yourselves why is [defendant\u2019s] mother the only corroboration of the existence of [the person from whom defendant allegedly had received stolen money orders]\u201d). Once again, however, as in <em>Babbitt, </em>we have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>presented with a colorable issue on appeal that could have been avoided by a heightened sensitivity to the explosive potential of comments intended to characterize the quality of defense evidence that may all too easily be understood as directed to quantity and, more particularly, to the absence of testimony from a defendant. The wary prosecutor plans his closing argument much as a sapper approaches a minefield.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">2. Instructions on inference from recent possession</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Lavoie next argues that the trial judge erred in its charge to the jury concerning the inference that could be drawn from defendant\u2019s possession of a recently stolen vehicle. Lavoie challenges both the placement and the substance of the charge. Near the end of his charge,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the judge instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-7\">\u201cI instruct you that possession of property recently stolen if not satisfactorily explained, is ordinarily a circumstance from which the jury may reasonably draw the inference and find in light of surrounding circumstances shown by the evidence in the case that the person in possession knew the property had been stolen.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">At trial, the defendant specifically objected to the placement of the instruction close to the end of the judge\u2019s charge. Defendant faults this placement by arguing essentially that jurors will focus on the last thing that they hear in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">Whatever empirical support may exist for such a hypothesis, it has nowhere received judicial endorsement. A reviewing court should not evaluate a single instruction in isolation, but rather should evaluate the instruction in the context of the overall charge. <em>See Cupp v. Naughten, </em>414 U.S. 141, 146-47, 94 S.Ct. 396, 400-401, 38 L.Ed.2d 368 (1973); <em>United States v. Morris, </em>700 F.2d 427,433 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. </em>denied,U.S. \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 2128, 77 L.Ed.2d 1306 (1983). This brings us to defendant\u2019s attack on the substance of this element of the court\u2019s charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-14\">Lavoie argues that the court erred by failing to give a separate instruction that \u201cif the explanation of possession offered by the defendant were believed, it would be sufficient to overcome an adverse inference emanating from the possession of recently stolen property.\u201d The government argues that Lavoie failed to preserve his objection to the court\u2019s charge on this issue. The trial transcript reveals that defense counsel presented some three reasons for objecting to the district court\u2019s charge concerning the inference of guilty knowledge arising from possession of a recently stolen vehicle. To the extent that defense counsel\u2019s reasons were sufficiently specific, they claimed more than the law would permit. To the extent that they accurately represented the law, they were too general. However, we assume for the purposes of this appeal that defendant objected with sufficient specificity to preserve his challenge. <em>See Freije v. United States, </em>386 F.2d 408, 411 (1st Cir.1967), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>396 U.S. 859, 90 S.Ct. 137, 24 L.Ed.2d 111 (1969); Fed.R.Crim.P. 30. However, we cannot agree with his challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-15\">In a charge that filled eighteen transcript pages, the judge spoke one sentence concerning the inference that could be drawn from possession of a recently stolen vehicle. And immediately prior to that sentence, the judge had instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AT2\">\u201cUnder our law a defendant is entitled to every inference in his favor which can reasonably be drawn from the evidence. And where two inferences may be drawn from the same facts, one of the inferences would be consistent with guilt and one of the inferences would be consistent with innocence, the defendant is entitled to the inference which is consistent with his innocence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-16\">Given this instruction concerning permissible inferences and given the balanced nature of the overall charge, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s failure to use the precise language that defendant has told this court he would have preferred. <em>Cf. United States v. Fusaro, </em>708 F.2d 17, 22 (1st Cir.1983) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>(quoting <em>United States v. Newson, </em>531 F.2d 979, 982-83 (10th Cir.1976)) (\u201c\u2018the trial court is not bound to give instructions in the form and language requested, and ... if the instructions as given are correct and cover the issues of the case, the judgment will not be disturbed\u2019\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 524, 78 L.Ed.2d 708 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">To support his argument that the trial judge should have given a specific instruction on the defense theory of the case, defendant seeks to place himself within the protection of this court\u2019s ruling in <em>Freije. </em>In that case, defendants Freije and Sarno denied that they had sold stolen cars with guilty knowledge. Defendants possessed the cars in the normal course of their work as employees of an auto sales business. The trial judge instructed the jury concerning possession of recently stolen property, but did not separately instruct the jury concerning defendants\u2019 explanation. This court set aside the convictions, holding that defendants were entitled to a separate instruction, because the \u201cpossession of recently stolen property\u201d doctrine holds less force \u201cwhere an employee sells merchandise for a company doing public business.\u201d <em>Freije, </em>386 F.2d at 410 (citation omitted). The court held that under the circumstances, defendants were entitled to an additional instruction that the defendants\u2019 explanation, if believed, would negate any inference that might arise from possession. <em>Id. </em>at 411.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">The <em>Freije </em>holding is inapposite here. Lavoie was not the employee of a business that routinely sold the item that Lavoie possessed. Lavoie was self-employed, apparently in the auto body repair business. Lavoie therefore could not claim, as had the defendants in <em>Freije, </em>that he was the innocent dupe in his employer\u2019s scam. Moreover, Lavoie\u2019s explanation of possession did not relate to his business. He instead maintained that a friend had loaned him the mobile home. Defendant presented no evidence to indicate that his possession of a mobile home in Rhode Island and Connecticut while en route to California was in any way related to his business of auto body repair. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Brawer, </em>482 F.2d 117, 129-30 (2d Cir.1973) <em>(Freije </em>instruction not necessary where defendant\u2019s explanation of possession was unrelated to his occupation and was not credible), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 1051, 95 S.Ct. 628, 42 L.Ed.2d 646 (1974). <em>Freije </em>notwithstanding, we find no defect in the trial court\u2019s standard charge regarding the inference to be drawn from possession of a recently stolen vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-10\">Given that we have assumed that defense counsel preserved defendant\u2019s challenge to the trial judge\u2019s charge on this inference, defendant\u2019s argument that he was denied effective assistance of counsel by his attorney\u2019s failure to preserve this issue does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-11\">Finally, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. Lavoie has not shown that his conviction was a miscarriage of justice. The evidence presented at trial amply supports the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-12\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b479-13\">. Although defendant suggests that the quoted excerpt was the last thing the jurors heard, the transcript of the judge\u2019s charge extends for two and a half pages beyond this item. The jurors thus did not begin their deliberations with the \u201cpossession\u201d inference ringing in their ears.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
