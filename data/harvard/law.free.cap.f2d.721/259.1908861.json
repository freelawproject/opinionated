Valley Bank (\u201cBank\u201d) filed a complaint in bankruptcy court to remove the automatic stay so it could foreclose its security interest in a 1977 utility trailer. The trustee counterclaimed that the Bank\u2019s security interest was void as a preference under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547 within ninety days of the bankruptcy filing. The bankruptcy. court, 22 B.R. 26, found that the Bank\u2019s lien was a preference under section 547 and would be void unless one of the exceptions to section 547(b) applied. The bankruptcy court held that the only applicable exception was section 547(c)(3) and that the Bank did not qualify for this exception because it did not perfect its security interest within the 10 days required by that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-28\">The Bank appealed to the district court arguing that the contemporaneous ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>change exception of section 547(c)(1) should also be available to the Bank. The district court affirmed the decision of the bankruptcy court. The district court held that a purchase money security transaction cannot fall under the preference avoidance exception of section 547(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">We hold that section 547(c)(1) does not apply to a purchase money security transaction and that in order to be excepted from the avoidance provisions of section 547 the Bank\u2019s transaction would have to qualify under section 547(c)(3). Because the security interest was not perfected within the 10 days required, it does not qualify under that section. We therefore affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">On November 18, 1981, Stephen Vance obtained a $14,224.33 loan from Valley Bank to purchase a 1977 utility trailer. Valley Bank secured this loan by a lien on the utility trailer and mailed the lien documents to the Fremont County Assessor to be recorded. On December 2, 1981, fourteen days after the debtor obtained the loan for purchase of the trailer, the lien was recorded, thereby completing the perfection requirements under Idaho law.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">On January 29, 1982, the Vances filed for bankruptcy. The Bank\u2019s lien on the utility trailer was therefore perfected within ninety days of the bankruptcy filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-21\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b332-22\">THE CONTEMPORANEOUS EXCHANGE EXCEPTION</p>\n<p id=\"b332-23\">A trustee in bankruptcy is granted the power to avoid preferential transfers for antecedent debts under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547(b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The purpose of this provision is to discourage creditors \u201cfrom racing to the courthouse to dismember the debtor during his slide into bankruptcy\u201d and to \u201cfacilitate the prime bankruptcy policy of equality of distribution among creditors of the debtor.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 95-595, 95th Cong., 1st Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 5963, 6138.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-24\">Subsection (c) of section 547 contains exceptions to the trustee\u2019s power to avoid transfers. These exceptions provide safe harbors for certain transactions involving transfers falling within the definition of preference in section 547(b), but which do not conflict with the purposes of section 547(b). Valley Bank, in the present case, is seeking to exclude the transfer of a security interest in Vance\u2019s utility trailer from the trustee\u2019s avoiding power by means of the contemporaneous exchange exception of section 547(c)(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-25\">The courts below followed the majority view of cases which have considered whether section 547(c)(1) can apply to purchase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>money security transactions. <em>See In re Murray, </em>27 B.R. 445 (Bkrtcy.M.D.Tenn. 1983); <em>In re Davis, </em>22 B.R. 644 (Bkrtcy.M.D.Ga.1982); <em>In re Enlow, </em>20 B.R. 480 (Bkrtcy.S.D.Ind.1982); <em>In re Christian, </em>8 B.R. 816 (Bkrtcy.M.D.Fla.1981). A number of these cases point to the legislative history of section 547(c)(1) as an indication that Congress did not intend that provision to apply to purchase money security interests. A pertinent portion of the legislative history states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-4\">The first exception is for a transfer that was intended by all parties to be a contemporaneous exchange for new value, and was in fact substantially contemporaneous. Normally, a check is a credit transaction. However, for the purposes of this paragraph, a transfer involving a check is considered to be \u201cintended to be contemporaneous,\u201d and if the check is presented for payment in the normal course of affairs, which the Uniform Commercial Code specifies as 30 days, U.C.C. \u00a7 3-503(2)(a), that will amount to a transfer that is \u201cin fact substantially contemporaneous.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">H.R.Rep. No. 95-595, 95th Cong., 1st Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 5963, 6329. This legislative history indicates that Congress was specifically concerned with transactions involving payment by check or other cash equivalent transactions when Congress enacted section 547(c)(1). There is no indication in the legislative history that Congress intended section 547(c)(1) to be a general exception covering a variety of transactions. Rather, the legislative history indicates that Congress designed section 547(c)(1) to exclude check or other cash equivalent transactions from the trustee\u2019s avoiding powers. Thus, applying section 547(c)(1) to purchase money security interests would expand the scope of the exception far beyond the contemplation of Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-12\">Congress specifically provided preference protection for purchase money security interests in section 547(c)(3).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That section provides that the security interest must be perfected before 10 days after such security interest attaches. This exception does not protect the Bank\u2019s security interest in Vance\u2019s trailer because the security interest was perfected fourteen days after the security interest attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-13\">Even if section 547(c)(1) were to be construed as a general exception for those situations not specifically contemplated by the authors of the Bankruptcy Code, the existence of section 547(c)(3), which specifically applies to purchase money security transactions, would preclude the application of the general exception to transactions specifically provided for in subsection (c)(3). As the bankruptcy court stated in <em>In re Enlow:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHv\">The explicit reference by Congress in Section 547(c)(3) to enabling loans lends further support to the conclusion that Section 547(c)(1) is not applicable to the instant transaction. Through its enactment of Section 547(c)(3) Congress intended to make that section \u2014 not Section 547(c)(1) \u2014 applicable to an enabling loan situation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-14\">20 B.R. at 483. The bankruptcy court in another case applied the traditional maxim <em>\u201cexpressio unius est exclusio alterius </em>\u201d and concluded</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-15\">11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547(c)(3) provides a mechanism by which liens to secure enabling loans might be excepted from avoidance. In so doing it negates the availability of other means of exception. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547(c)(1) is in general; 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547(c)(3) is specific; it refers to \u201ca se<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>curity interest\u201d such as in this adversary proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-4\"><em>In re Davis, </em>22 B.R. at 649. This application of statutory construction techniques is persuasive that Valley Bank should not be able to take advantage of section 547(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">The Bank contends, however, that subsections (c)(1) and (c)(3) are not mutually exclusive. The Bank refers to the following statement from the legislative history:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_q\">Subsection (c) contains exceptions to the trustee\u2019s avoiding power. If a creditor can qualify under any one of the exceptions, then he is protected to that extent. If he can qualify under several, he is protected by each to the extent he can qualify under each.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">H.R.Rep. No. 95-595, 95th Cong., 1st Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News at 6329. The Bank argues that this legislative history indicates that Congress did not intend that section 547(c)(3) be the exclusive exception for purchase money security transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">The Bank places too much reliance on this legislative history. As one bankruptcy court commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-8\">The legislative history does not reveal which sections might provide multiple protection or why a transferee would desire to qualify under more than one section because satisfaction of any section excepts the entire transfer from avoidance. Assuming some purpose for multiple protection, however, the legislative history cannot be interpreted, as FMCC argues, to suggest that all exceptions in \u00a7 547(c) are interchangeable and overlap. Each section has distinct prerequisites and to the extent one of those elements is absent, the section is inapplicable. Similarly, those sections that are inconsistent with each other will not be applied to one another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-9\"><em>In re Murray, </em>27 B.R. at 449 n. 7. The legislative history does not explicitly state that subsections (c)(1) and (c)(3) overlap. The legislative history does explicitly state that Congress intended section 547(c)(1) to except certain transactions involving payment by check and that section 547(c)(3) excepts certain transactions involving enabling loans. These are distinct types of transactions. The cited legislative history is not persuasive for the proposition that section 547(c)(1) and section 547(c)(3) overlap in their coverage of transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-11\">Our conclusion is further supported by the fact that applying section 547(c)(1) to enabling loan transactions would make section 547(c)(3) superfluous. <em>See In re Christian, </em>8 B.R. at 819. If the contemporaneous exchange exception of section 547(c)(1) were applicable to all purchase money security transactions, then the more specific provisions of section 547(c)(3), such as the 10-day perfection requirement, would be meaningless. We are not persuaded that Congress intended this result.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-12\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b334-13\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b334-14\">None of the provisions of section 547(c) are applicable to this transaction and, therefore, the Bank\u2019s security interest is not exempt from the avoidance provisions of section 547(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b332-9\">. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-10\">(b) Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, the trustee may avoid any transfer of property of the debtor\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-11\">(1) to or for the benefit of a creditor;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-12\">(2) for or on account of an antecedent debt owed by the debtor before such transfer was made;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-13\">(3) made while the debtor was insolvent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-14\">(4) made\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-15\">(A) on or within 90 days before the date of the filing of the petition; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-16\">(B) between 90 days and one year before the date of the filing of the petition, if such creditor, at the time of such transfer\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-17\">(i) was an insider; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-18\">(ii) had reasonable cause to believe the debtor was insolvent at the time of such transfer; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-26\">(5) that enables such creditor to receive more than such creditor would receive if\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-27\">(A) the case were a case under chapter 7 of this title;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-28\">(B) the transfer had not been made; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-29\">(C) such creditor received payment of such debt to the extent provided by the provisions of this title.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b332-30\">. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547(c)(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-31\">(c) The trustee may not avoid under this section a transfer\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-32\">(1) to the extent that such transfer was\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-33\">(A) intended by the debtor and the creditor to or for whose benefit such transfer was made to be a contemporaneous exchange for new value given to the debtor; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-34\">(B) in fact a substantially contemporaneous exchange.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b333-6\">. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547(c)(3) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-7\">(c) The trustee may not avoid under this section a transfer</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-8\">(3) of a security interest in property acquired by the debtor\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-9\">(A) to the extent such security interest secures new value that was\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-10\">(i) given at or after the signing of a security agreement that contains a description of such property as collateral;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-16\">(ii) given by or on behalf of the secured party under such agreement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-17\">(iii) given to enable the debtor to acquire such property; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-18\">(iv) in fact used by the debtor to acquire such property; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-19\">(B) that is perfected before 10 days after such security interest attaches.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
