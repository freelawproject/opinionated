State, </em>233 Ga. 369, 211 S.E.2d 577 (1974), and the United States Supreme Court denied a petition for writ of certiorari. <em>McCorquodale v. Georgia, </em>428 U.S. 910, 96 S.Ct. 3223, 49 L.Ed.2d 1218 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1561-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1495\">*1495</page-number>The petitioner subsequently filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in state court, which was denied, <em>McCorquodale v. Stynchcombe, </em>239 Ga. 138, 236 S.E.2d 486 (1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 975, 98 S.Ct. 534, 53 L.Ed.2d 467 (1977). McCorquodale then filed an extraordinary motion for a new trial based upon newly discovered evidence, which, after an evidentiary hearing, was also denied, and the denial was affirmed on appeal. <em>McCorquodale v. State, </em>242 Ga. 507, 249 S.E.2d 211 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1561-5\">After his failure to obtain relief in the state courts, McCorquodale brought the present petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. He raised six contentions in support of his petition, attacking both his conviction and his sentence. The district court found all of the arguments to be without merit and denied habeas corpus relief. <em>McCorquodale v. Balkcom, </em>525 F.Supp. 408 (N.D.Ga.1981). A panel of this court affirmed the denial of relief as to five of McCorquodale\u2019s arguments, but reversed as to his sentence, directing that the writ of habeas corpus issue because the petitioner\u2019s constitutional right to a fair and impartial jury under <em>Witherspoon v. Illinois, </em>391 U.S. 510, 88 S.Ct. 1770, 20 L.Ed.2d 776 (1968), had been violated. <em>McCorquodale v. Balkcom, </em>705 F.2d 1553 (11th Cir.1983). This court elected to hear the case en banc, and we now hold that the district court properly denied the writ in concluding that the voir dire procedures comported with <em>Wither-spoon </em>standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b1561-6\">I. <em>The Witherspoon Rule</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1561-7\">The Supreme Court in <em>Witherspoon v. Illinois </em>enunciated the rule that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"afj-dedup-1\">a sentence of death cannot be carried out if the jury that imposed or recommended it was chosen by excluding veniremen for cause simply because they voiced general objections to the death penalty or expressed conscientious or religious scruples against its infliction. No defendant can constitutionally be put to death at the hands of a tribunal so selected.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1561-8\">391 U.S. at 522, 88 S.Ct. at 1777 (footnotes omitted). The Court clarified in a footnote the two reasons why a juror could be excused for cause in the <em>Witherspoon </em>context:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"arf-dedup-0\">We repeat, however, that nothing we say today bears upon the power of a state to execute a defendant sentenced to death by a jury from which the only veniremen who were in fact excluded for cause were those who made it unmistakably clear (1) that they would <em>automatically </em>vote against the imposition of capital punishment without regard to any evidence that might be developed at the trial of the case before them, or (2) that their attitude toward the death penalty would prevent them from making an impartial decision as to the defendant\u2019s <em>guilt.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1561-9\">391 U.S. at 522, n. 21, 88 S.Ct. at 1777, n. 21 (emphasis in original). <em>Witherspoon\u2019s </em>holding thus struck a balance between \u201cthe state\u2019s legitimate interest in obtaining jurors who could follow their instructions and obey their oaths,\u201d <em>Adams v. Texas, </em>448 U.S. 38, 44, 100 S.Ct. 2521, 2526, 65 L.Ed.2d 581 (1980), and a defendant\u2019s right to have a neutral jury not \u201cuncommonly willing to condemn a man to die.\u201d <em>Witherspoon, </em>391 U.S. at 521, 88 S.Ct. at 1776; <em>see also Adams, </em>448 U.S. at 44, 100 S.Ct. at 2526.</p>\n<p id=\"b1561-10\">The petitioner advances three arguments as to why the voir dire proceedings in his case violated <em>Witherspoon\u2019s </em>standards: (1) the collective questioning of the venireper-sons and their non-verbal responses failed to ensure that each individual juror would unequivocally refuse to impose the death penalty or impartially deliberate on the defendant\u2019s guilt; (2) the <em>Witherspoon </em>questions asked at voir dire were insufficient; and (3) the questions asked to and the responses by two of the jurors dismissed for cause, jurors Woodlief and Kidd, were insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b1561-11\">II. <em>Group Questioning and Non-Verbal Responses</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1561-12\">At voir dire the prosecutor collectively asked a series of three questions to the approximately sixty jurors comprising the jury pool. The prosecutor first asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1562-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1496\">*1496</page-number>Are you conscientiously opposed to capital punishment? If you\u2019re conscientiously opposed to capital punishment, if you will, please stand. If you are not conscientiously opposed to capital punishment, remain seated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1562-4\">Nineteen jurors stood up in response to this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1562-5\">The prosecutor then posed the two additional questions required by <em>Witherspoon </em>to those jurors who had stood up, asking them to step forward if they would answer the question affirmatively:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1562-6\">The first question is this. Would you allow your opinion about capital punishment to prevent you from voting for the death penalty in this case, regardless of what the evidence was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1562-7\">The [second] question is this. Would you allow your opinion about capital punishment to prevent you from being a fair and impartial juror on the issue of guilt or innocence as distinguished from the issue of punishment? If you would, would you please step forward.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1562-8\">The prosecutor then moved the court to dismiss the fifteen jurors who had stepped forward. The court granted the motion over defense counsel\u2019s general objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1562-9\">The manner in which voir dire was conducted in this case raises two questions of first impression:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> whether <em>Witherspoon </em>requires individual questioning of prospective jurors and whether their responses must be verbal. Necessarily involved in answering the last question is another issue which has yet to be resolved in the <em>Witherspoon </em>context: <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> what degree of deference, if any, should be granted to a trial court\u2019s assessment of whether a juror\u2019s responses are \u201cunmistakably clear\u201d so as to satisfy <em>With-erspoon.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1562-16\">We hold that group questioning and nonverbal responses do not constitute a per se violation of <em>Witherspoon. Witherspoon </em>governs the <em>substance </em>of the inquiry to be made, not its form, and only requires that the voir dire method used for questioning and receiving responses allows a court to determine <em>in the particular case at hand </em>that the excluded venirepersons \u201cmade unmistakably clear\u201d that their attitude toward the death penalty would either automatically cause them to vote against the death penalty or prevent them from impartially deciding the defendant\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1562-17\">In this case, posing the <em>Witherspoon </em>questions to the jury pool as a group did not prevent the trial court from making this necessary determination. The questions asked by the prosecution went immediately to the relevant <em>Witherspoon </em>inquiries and carefully tracked the wording in <em>Wither-spoon.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Furthermore, the responses to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1497\">*1497</page-number>made by those venirepersons responding affirmatively to the questions \u2014 standing up in answer to the first question and stepping forward as to the next two questions \u2014 were clearly stated to the jurors and were not susceptible to misunderstanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1563-5\">The petitioner argues, however, that the group questioning was an \u201call or nothing\u201d affair, and that individual questioning may have revealed that certain jurors were equivocating in their attitudes. This argument is without merit for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1563-6\">First, nothing in the record indicates that the venirepersons were prevented from indicating that they did not understand the questions or from asking for clarification. Second, the court did not prevent defense counsel from asking further questions or requesting individual questioning of venirepersons; defense counsel entered only general objections without specifying the precise nature of his objection. Once the state clearly establishes a potential juror\u2019s unequivocal opposition to the death penalty, which in this case the questions asked and the jurors\u2019 responses accomplished, it is then incumbent upon the defendant to make an objection specifying why the juror should not be dismissed and to request further questions that would clarify any perceived ambiguity or equivocating by the juror.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Goodwin v. Balkcom, </em>684 F.2d at 816 (defense counsel\u2019s failure to raise <em>Witherspoon </em>violation is evidence of ineffectiveness); Bur<em>ns v. Estelle, </em>626 F.2d 396, 398 (5th Cir.1980) (en bane)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (error to deny defense counsel\u2019s request for further questioning). <em>See also, O\u2019Bryan v. Estelle, </em>714 F.2d at 378; <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Estelle, </em>709 F.2d 944 (5th Cir.1983). Third, the <em>Witherspoon </em>questions were strongly and clearly worded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1498\">*1498</page-number>so as to evoke an affirmative answer only from those jurors with unequivocating beliefs. In this sense, the petitioner\u2019s \u201call or nothing\u201d argument would actually work in his favor \u2014 initially equivocating jurors who might on further questioning answer the <em>Witherspoon </em>questions \u201cyes\u201d would remain seated, and only those jurors who could answer the questions \u201cyes\u201d without hesitation would stand. Finally, even where individual questioning is conducted, a juror must eventually make the \u201call or nothing\u201d decision of answering the <em>Witherspoon </em>questions \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As used in this case, therefore, group questioning complied with <em>Witherspoon\u2019s </em>directive.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1564-4\">The analysis of group voir dire developed above equally applies to the adequacy of the non-verbal responses. The relevant inquiry is whether the non-verbal responses served <em>in this case </em>to make \u201cunmistakably clear\u201d the excused jurors\u2019 unequivocal opposition to the death penalty or their inability to impartially decide the defendant\u2019s guilt. <em>Witherspoon v. Illinois, </em>391 U.S. at 522 n. 21, 88 S.Ct. at 1777 n. 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b1564-5\">In assessing the adequacy of a venireperson\u2019s response to <em>Witherspoon </em>questions, a reviewing court must grant some deference to the trial court\u2019s assessment of the juror\u2019s demeanor and clarity of his answer. Whether verbal or non-verbal, a response once reduced to a written record may not adequately convey the strength of the juror\u2019s response. Even a simple \u201cyes,\u201d although on a cold record appearing crystal clear, can be delivered in a manner that conveys doubt. <em>Witherspoon </em>requires a reviewing court to independently review the record to ensure that the exclusions were proper, but that review must take into account that' the trial judge was in a much better position to evaluate the clarity of a juror\u2019s response. <em>See O\u2019Bryan v. Estelle, </em>714 F.2d at 395 (Higginbotham, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b1564-10\">The juror\u2019s responses in this case were unambiguous acts which were sufficient to make \u201cunmistakably clear\u201d their answers to the <em>Witherspoon </em>questions. Potential jurors were asked to stand up if conscientiously opposed to the death penalty and to step forward if either unequivocally opposed to the death penalty or if their views would prevent impartial deliberation of the defendant\u2019s guilt. The trial court was able to observe the jurors\u2019 responses and demeanor for hesitancy or uncertainty that would have indicated that their responses were not \u201cunmistakably clear.\u201d Moreover, defense counsel did not bring to the court\u2019s attention any jurors responding to the question who appeared to be equivocating, which further indicates that the voir dire was satisfactory. On the basis of these facts, we cannot find that the non-verbal responses failed to satisfy <em>Witherspoon\u2019s </em>\u201cunmistakably clear\u201d standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1564-11\">Non-verbal responses and group voir dire are not necessarily the preferred method for voir dire in the <em>Witherspoon </em>context. Individual voir dire and verbal responses may very well be less susceptible to error.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1499\">*1499</page-number><em>Witherspoon, </em>however, does not require that any one form of voir dire be used or that a juror\u2019s philosophical reasons for opposing the death penalty be explored. Instead, it only requires that the method employed and the questions asked evoked-non-ambiguous answers that satisfied the <em>With-erspoon </em>\u201cunmistakably clear\u201d standard. Applying that principle to this case, we find that the method of voir dire used here satisfied <em>Witherspoon\u2019s </em>mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1565-5\">III. <em>Sufficiency of the Witherspoon Questions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1565-6\">The petitioner raises two specific challenges to the sufficiency of the <em>Wither-spoon </em>questions asked at voir dire. His first argument focuses on the language of the question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1565-7\">Would you allow your opinion about capital punishment to prevent you from voting for the death penalty in this case, regardless of what the evidence was?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ae4\">He argues that the inclusion of the phrase \u201cin this case\u201d violates <em>Witherspoon\u2019s </em>admonishment that \u201ca prospective juror cannot be expected to say in advance of trial whether he would in fact vote for the extreme penalty in the ease before him.\u201d 391 U.S. at 522 n. 21, 88 S.Ct. at 1777 n. 21. Defense counsel had objected generally to the question, without specifying this argument as the basis of his objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1565-8\">The argument ignores the clear import of the voir dire question. The phrase \u201cin this case\u201d was not intended to refer specifically to the petitioner\u2019s case, and a reasonable juror would not have interpreted the phrase as asking him in advance if he \u201cwould in fact\u201d vote for the death penalty in the petitioner\u2019s case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Rather, the phrase was used in the same sense that the <em>Wither-spoon </em>Court used the phrase \u201cin the case before him\u201d in explaining that venireper-sons could be excused only if they would not impose the death penalty \u201cwithout regard to any evidence that might be developed at the trial of <em>the case before them. </em>...\u201d <em>Witherspoon v. Illinois, </em>391 U.S. at 522 n. 21, 88 S.Ct. at 1777 n. 21. (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1565-12\">Petitioner next urges that in addition to the two <em>Witherspoon </em>questions that were actually posed, a third question should have been asked as to whether a juror could subordinate his views to his oath as a juror to obey the law. Petitioner relies on footnote seven in <em>Witherspoon </em>for this proposition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1565-13\">It is entirely possible, of course, that even a juror who believes that capital punishment should never be inflicted and who is irrevocably committed to its abolition could nonetheless subordinate his personal views to what he perceived to be his duty to abide by his oath as juror and to obey the law of the state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1565-14\">391 U.S. at 514 n. 7, 88 S.Ct. at 1773 n. 7. Petitioner would thus have us add a third prong to the two-prong test outlined in footnote twenty-one of <em>Witherspoon.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1565-15\">This court has already rejected petitioner\u2019s argument on one prior occasion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"a8m-dedup-0\">Nowhere in ... footnote [7], or in any other part of the opinion, does the Court even imply that a trial court must give the instructions suggested by the petitioner, and we decline to so hold.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"asv-dedup-0\"><em>Spinkellink </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>578 F.2d 582, 593 n. 14 (5th Cir.1978). We adhere to Spinkellink!s holding as the proper result in light of <em>Witherspoon\u2019s </em>purpose and reasoning. Footnote seven in <em>Witherspoon </em>merely explained the rationale behind the opinion, that potential jurors cannot be excluded for their views on the death penalty unless it would prevent them from following their oaths as jurors. This concern is more than adequately covered by the two questions asked in voir dire based upon footnote twenty-one of the <em>Witherspoon </em>opinion. The very principle underlying the questions asking jurors whether their views on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1500\">*1500</page-number>death penalty would cause them to automatically vote against the death penalty or preclude them from deliberating impartially on the defendant\u2019s guilt is to discern whether the jurors would follow their oaths. The petitioner\u2019s proposed third question, therefore, is already subsumed under the two questions that were asked.</p>\n<p id=\"b1566-4\">IV. <em>Jurors Woodlief and Kidd</em></p>\n<p id=\"axe-dedup-2\">After the group voir dire, the prosecutor conducted individual questioning of the remaining jurors, which resulted in jurors Woodlief and Kidd being excused for cause. Petitioner challenges these excus\u00e1is on <em>Witherspoon </em>grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1566-5\">The excusal of Woodlief was based on the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1566-6\">Q: Do you really believe in capital punishment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1566-7\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1566-8\">Q: You don\u2019t?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1566-9\">A: No, I don\u2019t. It\u2019s different being faced, you know, discussing capital punishment and sending someone to the electric chair.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1566-10\">THE COURT: You didn\u2019t understand the question that was posed to you a while ago?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1566-11\">THE JUROR: Yes, I did at that time. I thought that under certain situations and possibly to rationalize this to myself, but sitting here and observing, I don\u2019t think I could do it, I really don\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"agi-dedup-0\">THE COURT: All right, Mr. Ridley. That\u2019s grounds for excusal for cause. You may be excused.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1566-12\">MR. RIDLEY: Your honor, may I invoke the same objections as to the others?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9y\">THE COURT: Yes. You may be ex- \u2022 cused.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1566-13\">Focusing on Woodlief\u2019s use of the word \u201cthink,\u201d the petitioner argues that Wood-lief\u2019s excusal for cause was improper because she did not unequivocally state that she could not impose the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1566-15\">A review of a <em>Witherspoon </em>excusal necessitates an examination of the \u201ctotality of the circumstances of the voir dire\u201d because <em>Witherspoon </em>\u201cdoes not require that the venire person utter a pat phrase ... . \u201d <em>Witt v. Wainwright, </em>714 F.2d 1069, 1083 (11th Cir.1983). Moreover, the fact that a juror initially stated that he could follow his oath and then later changed his mind does not demonstrate that a <em>Witherspoon </em>violation has occurred. It is the juror\u2019s ultimate conclusion by which the court judges whether the juror is unequivocally opposed to the death penalty. <em>See Williams v. Maggio, </em>679 F.2d 381 (5th Cir.1982) (en banc), <em>cert. </em>denied, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 3553, 77 L.Ed.2d 1399 (1983); <em>O\u2019Bryan </em>v. <em>Estelle, </em>714 F.2d at 381-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b1566-18\">Analyzed from the foregoing prospective, we find that too much is made of Woodlief\u2019s use of the word \u201cthink.\u201d Placed within the context of her <em>entire </em>voir dire, her response, \u201cI don\u2019t think I could do it, <em>I really don\u2019t,\u201d </em>is unambiguous and unequivocal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1566-19\">Woodlief stated that she had understood the <em>Witherspoon </em>questions<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and proceeded to explain that upon further thought she realized that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1566-20\">It\u2019s different being faced, you know, discussing capital punishment and sending someone to the electric chair ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1566-21\">I thought that under certain situations and possibly to rationalize this to myself, but sitting here and observing, I don\u2019t think I could do it, I really don\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1566-22\">This narrative evidences an individual who understood the questions asked, reflected upon them, and concluded that she could not impose the death penalty. Her statements, coupled with the trial judge\u2019s ability to observe Woodlief\u2019s tone of voice and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1501\">*1501</page-number>demeanor for indecisiveness, allows only one reasonable interpretation of Woodlief\u2019s repetitive statement, \u201cI don\u2019t think I could do it, I really don\u2019t\u201d: she unequivocally believed that she could not impose the death penalty regardless of the evidence presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b1567-5\">Woodlief\u2019s voir dire, therefore, does not fall within the ambit of those cases holding a juror\u2019s response inadequate under <em>Wither-spoon. </em>In those cases, the juror\u2019s response was insufficient either in light of the ambiguity of the questions asked<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> or because the reply itself indicated confusion or ambiguity that was not clarified by the voir dire.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In contrast, Woodlief was responding to properly stated <em>Witherspoon </em>questions and undertook an explanation that allows us to interpret the meaning of her answer without having to engage in speculation as to what her replies would have been if further questions had been propounded. <em>Compare Burns v. Estelle, </em>592 F.2d 1297, 1301 (5th Cir.1979), <em>aff\u2019d </em>626 F.2d 396 (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b1567-6\">In retrospect, the trial judge ideally would have repeated the <em>Witherspoon </em>questions to Woodlief, but the court\u2019s failure to conduct a perfect voir dire does not prevent us from finding that, based upon all the circumstances, Woodlief understood the questions previously asked and had come to an unequivocal decision that she could not impose the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1567-7\">We conclude likewise, based upon a review of the totality of the circumstances, that juror Kidd was not improperly excused. Kidd\u2019s voir dire consisted of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1567-8\">Q: Do you really believe in capital punishment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1567-9\">A: To a certain extent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1567-12\">Q: To a certain extent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1567-13\">A: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1567-14\">Q: Do you feel there are cases where under the evidence it would be a right and just verdict?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1567-15\">A: Well, in a way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1567-16\">Q: Well, when it comes down, like the last lady [Ms. Woodlief] said, from a theoretical point to where a juror would be asked to vote, do you think you could really never vote for the death penalty no matter what the evidence was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1567-17\">A: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1567-18\">Q: You don\u2019t think you could?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1567-19\">MR.

Furthermore, defense counsel once again entered only a general objection, without requesting that any further questions be asked. Considering Kidd\u2019s ultimate conclusion that he could not impose the death penalty under any circumstances, <em>see Williams v. Maggio, </em>679 F.2d at 386; <em>O\u2019Bryan v.

Questions that have been held inadequate for gauging the unequivocality of a juror\u2019s response are those that have inquired only as to the \u201cconscientious scruples\u201d of the juror or asked whether the death penalty might \u201caffect\u201d his deliberations, without making the ultimate inquiry of whether the juror\u2019s views are so strong that they would preclude him from following his oath. <em>See, Adams v.

The petitioner argues that the use of the word \u201cprevent\u201d in the questions was ambiguous. We note, however, that the word \u201cprevent\u201d was a word chosen by the <em>Witherspoon </em>Court to be used in the second question, to be asked. 391 U.S. at 522 n. 21, 88 S.Ct. at 1777 n. 21. Furthermore, as \u201cprevent\u201d is used within the context of the questions posed, it conveys the proper meaning that the juror must find that he <em>could not </em>impose the death penalty or deliberate impartially on the defendant\u2019s guilt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1563-8\">. The dissent states that Georgia law, OCGA 15-12-164, prohibits defense counsel from individually questioning prospective jurors after the statutory <em>Witherspoon </em>question is asked pursuant to OCGA 15-12-164(a)(4), because, if the juror\u2019s answer is affirmative, he is automatically excused for cause. <em>Infra, </em>dissent at 1504-1505, citing <em>Arnold v. State, </em>236 Ga. 534, 224 S.E.2d 386, 390 (1976) and <em>Jordan v. State, </em>247 Ga. 328, 276 S.E.2d 224, 234 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1563-9\"><em>Jordan </em>and <em>Arnold, </em>however, stand only for the proposition that <em>general </em>individual voir dire (preliminary to peremptory challenges) is not allowed at the OCGA 15-12-164 voir dire stage (excusal for cause). The statute does not forbid additional questioning based upon answers to the statutory questions, and the case law interpreting the statute holds that although additional examination is not a matter of right, the trial judge has the discretion to allow further inquiry. <em>Ford v. State, </em>202 Ga. 599, 44 S.E.2d 263, 265 (1947) (interpreting GA.CODE 59-806, predecessor of OCGA 15-12-164); <em>Hall v. State, </em>64 Ga.App. 644, 13 S.E.2d 868, 869 (1941) (scope of inquiry based on statutory questions concerning juror\u2019s competency within judge\u2019s discretion). See <em>also Goodwin v. Balkcom, </em>684 F.2d at 816 (defense counsel in Georgia capital case erred because he could have, but did not, question a juror that judge erroneously concluded had stated she was unequivocally opposed to the death penalty).</p>\n<p id=\"b1563-12\">Furthermore, a view of Georgia cases reveals that defense counsel frequently participate in the <em>Witherspoon </em>questioning of jurors. See <em>Mincey v. State, </em>251 Ga. 255, 304 S.E.2d 882, 889-90 (1983); <em>Castell v. State, </em>250 Ga. 776, 301 S.E.2d 234, 244-46 (1983); <em>Allen v. State, </em>248 Ga. 676, 286 S.E.2d 3 (1982); <em>Cofield v. State, </em>247 Ga. 98, 274 S.E.2d 530, 535-36 (1981) (defense counsel\u2019s further questioning of juror on <em>Witherspoon </em>issue allowed, but not questions outside scope of <em>Witherspoon\u2019s </em>holding). <em>Cf. Mincey, supra </em>304 S.E.2d at 890 (defense counsel allowed to question juror further as to OCGA 15-12-164 question concerning juror\u2019s ability to be fair and impartial). Thus, although defense counsel does not have an absolute right under Georgia law to ask or request questions beyond the basic <em>Witherspoon </em>inquiry of OCGA 15-12-164, if defense counsel makes a nonfrivolous, specific objection to the dismissal of a juror because of ambiguity, and his request for further questioning is denied, such denial would fall within the ambit of <em>Burns, supra,- </em>as the reviewing court would have to speculate about the juror\u2019s response to a crucial question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1563-13\">.

Illinois, </em>391 U.S. 510, 521, 88 S.Ct. 1770, 1776, 20 L.Ed.2d 776, 784 (1968), the Supreme Court announced the principle that \u201ca State may not entrust the determination of whether a man should live or die to a tribunal organized to return a verdict of death.\u201d To that end, the Court held that a venireperson\u2019s opposition to capital punishment will not justify his excusal for cause, unless he \u201cstates unambiguously\u201d and thereby renders it \u201cunmistakably clear\u201d that he would \u201cautomatically vote against the imposition of capital punishment no matter what the trial might reveal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 515-16, 522, 88 S.Ct. at 1773-74, 1777, 20 L.Ed.2d at 781-82, 785.</p>\n<p id=\"b1568-12\">As a general matter, unmistakable clarity is no mean feat to obtain in communications between a judge and juror; it requires that the juror understand the questions asked, and that the judge understand the answers given.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Such clarity is doubly elusive in the <em>Witherspoon </em>context, where the juror must communicate not only his opinion as to whether he opposes capital punishment, but also the strength and nature<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of that opin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1503\">*1503</page-number>ion, for \u201ceven a juror who believes that capital punishment should never be inflicted and who is irrevocably committed to its abolition could nonetheless subordinate his personal views to what he perceived to be his duty to abide by his oath as a juror and to obey the law of the State.\u201d <em>Witherspoon, </em>391 U.S. at 514, 88 S.Ct. at 1773, 20 L.Ed.2d at 781 n. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b1569-5\">The central issue here is whether the procedures employed by the trial court elicited sufficient information to make it unmistakably clear to the trial judge that the jurors excused for cause were unable to set aside their opposition to the death penalty. The majority of this court is satisfied that fifteen jurors standing mute in the face of two questions fulfills this requirement and justifies the jurors\u2019 exclusion. The objective of the <em>Witherspoon </em>inquiry, however, is not to furnish a vehicle for the exclusion of jurors, but on the contrary is to <em>insure against </em>the exclusion of qualified objectors to the death penalty. This was made clear in <em>Adams v. Texas:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1569-6\">As an initial matter, it is clear beyond peradventure that <em>Witherspoon </em>is not a ground for challenging any prospective juror. It is rather a limitation on the state\u2019s power to exclude; if prospective jurors are barred from jury service because of their views about capital punishment on \u201cany broader basis\u201d than inability to follow the law or abide by their oaths, the death penalty cannot be carried out.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1569-7\"><em>Adams v. Texas, </em>448 U.S. 38, 100 S.Ct. 2521, 65 L.Ed.2d 581 (1980). I cannot agree with the majority opinion, because it authorizes the exclusion of prospective jurors from jury service on a broader basis than permitted by <em>Adams v. Texas </em>and <em>Witherspoon.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1569-11\">In this case, nineteen jurors indicated that they were conscientiously opposed to capital punishment; the nineteen were then addressed en masse by the district attorney,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> who requested that those venireper-sons, whose opposition to capital punishment would prevent them from being impartial as to guilt or from voting for the death penalty regardless of the evidence, step forward. The fifteen who did were excused for cause over objection and without further questions. In assessing whether those fifteen jurors were properly excused, it is \u201cthe duty of the Court of Appeals to independently evaluate the <em>voir dire </em>testimony of the impaneled jurors.\u201d <em>Irvin v. Dowd, </em>366 U.S. 717, 723, 81 S.Ct. 1639, 1643, 6 L.Ed.2d 751, 756 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b1569-12\">The first matter that must be considered in light of the trial procedures employed is whether the jurors may have misunderstood the questions asked of them. As <em>Wither-spoon </em>emphasized, \u201cThe critical question, of course, is not how the phrases employed in this area have been construed by courts and commentators. What matters is how they might be understood \u2014 or misunderstood\u2014 by prospective jurors.\u201d 391 U.S. at 515-16, 88 S.Ct. at 1773-74, 20 L.Ed.2d at 781-82 n. 9 (1968). The majority here concludes that the questions \u201cwere clearly stated to the jurors and were not susceptible to misunderstanding.\u201d Such a conclusion is directly contradicted by the testimony of venireper-sons Kidd and Woodlief, quoted by the majority later in the opinion. Kidd and Wood-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1504\">*1504</page-number>lief did not indicate, when questioned en masse along with the rest of the venire, that they would be unable to vote for the death penalty regardless of the evidence. They and the other remaining jurors were then questioned individually:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1570-4\">The Court: You say you never could vote for it regardless of the circumstances?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1570-5\">Juror Kidd: No, Sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1570-6\">The Court: Did you hear the question that was posed to you just awhile ago? Did you understand the question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1570-7\">Juror Kidd: <em>No, I did not understand.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATqi\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1570-8\">Q. Do you really believe in capital punishment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1570-9\">Juror Woodlief: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1570-10\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1570-11\">The Court: You didn\u2019t understand the question that was posed to you awhile ago?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1570-12\">Juror Woodlief: Yes, <em>I did at that time. I thought that under certain situations and possibly to rationalize this to myself, but sitting here and observing, I don\u2019t think I could do it, I really don\u2019t.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1570-13\">Jurors Kidd and Woodlief either did not understand or come fully to terms with the <em>Witherspoon </em>questions when posed to the jurors en masse. Kidd and Woodlief resolved their confusion in favor of not stepping forward and were excused after individual questioning. But what of those ven-irepersons who may have been equally confused but nevertheless who stepped forward? They were dismissed without further interrogation; consequently, there is no way of telling how many of such persons there were, or from among such persons how many ought not to have been excused under <em>Witherspoon.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1570-14\">The majority suggests first that members of the venire were free to ask for clarification if they did not understand the questions posed to them en masse. Such an assertion presupposes that jurors have no qualms about standing alongside eighteen of their peers and volunteering information to the effect that they do not know what is going on. To so conclude is to ignore a vast body of research demonstrating the reluctance of individuals to single out their perceptions and attitudes as different from those of the group.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1570-18\">Second, the majority indicates that after the fifteen venirepersons had stepped forward in response to the prosecutor\u2019s questions, it was incumbent upon the defense to rehabilitate those jurors through questioning. But Georgia law does not permit such questioning at that stage in the proceedings. O.C.G.A. 15-12-133 provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUeC\">In all criminal cases both the state and the defendant shall have the right to an individual examination of each juror from which the jury is to be selected prior to interposing a challenge. The examination shall be conducted ... in criminal cases <em>after the usual voir dire questions have been put by the court.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Azi\">(emphasis added). The \u201cusual voir dire questions\u201d refers to those questions enumerated in O.C.G.A. 15-12-164 <em>(Jordan v. State, </em>247 Ga. 328, 276 S.E.2d 224, 234 (1981)), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1570-19\">(a) On voir dire examination in a felony trial, the jurors shall be asked the following questions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1570-20\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1570-21\">(4) \u201cAre you conscientiously opposed to capital punishment?\u201d If the juror answers this question in the negative, he shall be held to be a competent juror.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1570-22\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1570-23\">(c) If a juror answers any of the questions set out in subsection (a) of this Code section so as to render him incompetent or <em>if he is found to be so by the judge, he shall be set aside for cause.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1570-24\">(emphasis added). Thus, McCorquodale\u2019s opportunity to question prospective jurors individually did not begin until <em>after </em>the trial court had put the statutory voir dire questions to the jury as a panel, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1505\">*1505</page-number>question (4) pertaining to attitudes toward capital punishment, and <em>after </em>the judge had excused those jurors found to be incompetent in light of their answers to those questions. <em>Arnold v. State, </em>236 Ga. 534, 224 S.E.2d 386, 390 (1976).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1571-5\">Third, the majority insists that the <em>With-erspoon </em>questions were worded so strongly and clearly that they would evoke an affirmative answer only from jurors whose beliefs were unequivocal. This, of course, presumes that the questions could not have been misunderstood, which, as noted earlier, is not the case. That the questions asked seem clear enough to a lawyer or judge well versed in the <em>Witherspoon </em>issue, does not necessarily make them so to the average juror. It is likely that the average venire-member will have formed an opinion as to whether he is philosophically in favor of or opposed to capital punishment, and to the extent he has an opinion, he probably knows whether it is relatively strong or weak. Yet until the moment the question is asked, what cause would an ordinary juror have to consider whether he can set his opinion aside? It is improbable that a lay person will have had prior occasion to undertake the novel mental exercise of pitting the strength of his opposition to capital punishment against his desire to obey the law and abide by his oath as a juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b1572-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1506\">*1506</page-number>Consequently, the question is a unique one for the juror, though not for the judge. It is thus incumbent upon the judge to see to it that the juror understands the question, and that the juror\u2019s opposition to the death penalty is indeed sufficiently strong to justify exclusion under <em>Witherspoon. </em>The trial court offered no such assistance in this case. The jurors\u2019 silence was presumed tantamount to understanding, and the strength of their opinions was presumed sufficient by their stepping forward.</p>\n<p id=\"b1572-4\">Quite apart from whether the jurors understood the questions asked and responded as honestly as possible, is the question of whether the judge understood the jurors\u2019 answers. A juror\u2019s inability to set aside his opposition to capital punishment in reaching a verdict as to guilt or innocence must be stated unambiguously in order for his exclusion to be justified; equivocal responses are insufficient. <em>Maxwell v. Bishop, </em>398 U.S. 262, 264-65, 90 S.Ct. 1578, 1580, 26 L.Ed.2d 221, 224 (1970). If a juror presented with the question of whether his opposition to capital punishment will prevent him from rendering an impartial verdict responds that he thinks so but is not sure, the judge should have little trouble in understanding that the juror is equivocating and that further questioning is necessary to render the juror\u2019s position unmistakably clear.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But how is equivocation or ambiguity to be detected when jurors respond nonverbally and en masse?</p>\n<p id=\"b1572-5\">The majority supposes that \u201c[t]he trial court was able to observe the juror\u2019s responses and demeanor for hesitancy or uncertainty that would have indicated that their responses were not \u2018unmistakably clear\u2019.\u201d There is no denying that uncertainty or hesitation may be communicated nonverbally, and that a judge no less than anyone else may be able to detect and comprehend such communication. Nonverbal communication, however, unlike verbal communication, is transmitted by any of several means: facial expression, hand gestures, eye movement, posture and body movement, to name but a few. R. Baron, D. Byrne, <em>Social Psychology </em>45-56 (1979). It is unreasonable and contrary to common sense to expect that a trial judge would be able to attend to and assimilate the many nonverbal indicia of hesitation or equivocation manifested by any single venireperson, let alone nineteen, when all are responding at the same time. This conclusion is bolstered by studies in the field of cognitive psychology demonstrating the markedly diminished capacity of human beings to assimilate an isolated stimulus or piece of information when multiple stimuli are received simultaneously. A. Reynolds, P. Flagg, <em>Cognitive Psychology </em>28-29 (1983); E. Carterette, M. Friedman (Ed\u2019s), <em>Handbook of Perception </em>Vol. IX \u201cPerceptual Processing\u201d 3-7 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1572-10\">It is true that a trial judge is in a position to observe the demeanor of jurors, and thus has an advantage over an appellate court, which has only a record to read. Nevertheless, even a trial judge cannot implement the strictures of the <em>Witherspoon </em>tests under the circumstances presented here. It is inconceivable that a trial court, utilizing a procedure whereby nineteen venirepersons answer two short questions nonverbally and en masse, can independently evaluate and adjudicate each of the juror\u2019s qualifications as required by <em>Witherspoon </em>and its progeny. Instead, the jurors themselves were permitted to make the decision as to whether they should be excluded from jury service by the mere expedient of stepping for<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1507\">*1507</page-number>ward. <em>Witherspoon </em>requires unambiguous and unmistakably clear communication between jury and judge; any semblance of such clarity was lacking in this case, consequently rendering the brief en masse, nonverbal interrogation constitutionally inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1573-5\">Part II: Individual Questioning</p>\n<p id=\"b1573-6\">\n<em>Sylvia Woodlief\u2019s Interrogation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1573-7\"><em>Witherspoon </em>and <em>Adams </em>require unequivocal answers by prospective jurors to questions propounded to them before they may be excluded by the state from the venire panel for cause. This is conceded in the majority opinion (at 1500-1501), which nevertheless concludes that the statement \u201cI don\u2019t think I could do it, I really don\u2019t,\u201d is unequivocal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1573-8\">Woodlief\u2019s individual <em>voir </em>dire<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> never established that she would automatically vote against the imposition of the death penalty, or that her convictions would preclude her from fairly deciding the question of guilt or innocence, or that she would not be able to adhere to her oath as a juror and apply the applicable law. Since she was not asked the questions to elicit this information, the majority reasons that the questions were not ambiguous. The district attorney had asked her if she would be fair and impartial and \u201cgo by the evidence and the law\u201d to which she replied in the affirmative. He then asked her if she \u201creally\u201d believed in capital punishment, and she said she did not. She then added that, \u201cIt\u2019s different being faced, you know, discussing capital punishment and sending someone to the electric chair.\u201d The trial court then interrupted and asked her whether she understood \u201cthe question that was posed to you awhile ago,\u201d to which Woodlief replied in the affirmative. She then volunteered that she \u201cthought that under certain situations and possibly to rationalize this to myself, but sitting here and observing, I don\u2019t think I could do it, I really don\u2019t.\u201d She was then immediately excused by the court over objection of defendant\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1573-25\">This individual voir dire examination demonstrates that the state of Georgia did not satisfy Witherspoon\u2019s stringent test. A state is permitted to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A487\">execute a defendant sentenced to death by a jury from which the only veniremen who were in fact excluded for cause were those who made unmistakably clear (1) that they would <em>automatically </em>vote against the imposition of capital punishment without regard to any evidence that might be developed at the trial of the case before them, or (2) that their attitude toward the death penalty would prevent them from making an impartial decision as to the defendant\u2019s <em>guilt.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1573-26\"><em>Witherspoon, </em>391 U.S. at 522, 88 S.Ct. at 1777, 20 L.Ed.2d at 785 n. 21 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1574-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1508\">*1508</page-number>The leading case in this circuit<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> is <em>Burns v.

He was first asked whether he had conscientious scruples against the infliction of the death penalty, whereupon he stated, \u201cI don\u2019t know what that means.\u201d When asked if he could ever vote to inflict the death penalty, he replied, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t <em>think </em>I could.\u201d Then, in response to the question, \u201cYou just don\u2019t <em>feel </em>like you would be entitled to take another person\u2019s life in that fashion?\u201d He nodded and then said, \u201cNo, I could not.\u201d These questions and answers fall far short of an affirmation by Harrison that he would automatically vote against the death penalty regardless of the evidence, or that his objections to capital punishment would prevent him from making an impartial decision as to guilt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1574-12\"><em>Granviel, </em>655 F.2d at 677 (footnotes omitted; emphasis in the original).

A prospective juror may even concede that his or her feelings about the death penalty would possibly color an objective determination of the facts of a case without admitting of the necessary partiality to justify excusal. The Court has stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"azm-dedup-1\">Nor [does] the Constitution permit the exclusion of jurors from the penalty phase of a ... murder trial if they aver that they will honestly find the facts and answer the questions in the affirmative if they are convinced, beyond reasonable doubt, but not otherwise, <em>yet who frankly concede that the prospects of the death penalty may affect what their honest judgment of the facts will be or what they may deem to be reasonable doubt. </em>Such assessments and judgments by jurors are inherent in the jury system, and to exclude all jurors who would be in the slightest way affected by the prospect of the death penalty or by their views about such a penalty would be to deprive the defendant of the impartial jury to which he or she is entitled under the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1575-15\"><em>Adams, </em>448 U.S. at 50, 100 S.Ct. at 2529 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-17\"><em>Witt v.

At no point did she unequivocally state that she would automatically be unable to apply the death penalty or to find petitioner guilty if the facts so indicated. Her statements fall far short of the certainty required by <em>Witherspoon </em>to justify for cause excusal. Perhaps her responses are so devoid of the necessary certainty because of the State\u2019s failure to frame its questions in an appropriately unambiguous manner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A5-\"><em>Witt, </em>714 F.2d at 1082. The majority opinion does not purport to overrule <em>Burns, Gran vie}, Hance, </em>or <em>Witt, supra, </em>since those cases properly interpret the <em>Witherspoon-Adams </em>test. Given our requirement to follow the Supreme Court opinions, the majority opinion is inexplicable.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1576-29\">\n<em>Allen L. Kidd\u2019s Interrogation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"afe-dedup-1\">A review of the examination of juror Allen Kidd reveals that he too was improperly excused under the <em>Witherspoon-Adams </em>test.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The majority opinion holds that Kidd made it unmistakably clear that he was opposed to the death penalty and that he was unable to set aside such opposition and follow the law and the evidence and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1511\">*1511</page-number>return a verdict for the death penalty. Instead, a review of the complete interrogation reflects a morass of ambiguities. First, Kidd states that he could be a fair and impartial juror and that his verdict would speak the truth based on the evidence and the law presented. He then states that to a certain extent he believes in capital punishment. He further states that \u201cin a way\u201d he feels that there are cases where the death penalty would be a right and just verdict. To that point, Mr. Kidd is making it clear that he is a juror who could be eligible to sit on the jury even though he might have some doubts about a death penalty in some cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1577-5\">The district attorney then asked \u201cdo you think you could really never vote for the death penalty no matter what the evidence was,\u201d to which Kidd answers \u201cno.\u201d The majority opinion reads the answer to that question to be \u201cyes\u201d instead of \u201cno.\u201d After that answer, the district attorney moved the court to excuse Mr. Kidd for cause. The court asked Mr. Kidd the same question and got the same no answer, which reflects that Mr. Kidd <em>could </em>vote for the death penalty. The court then asked the juror if he heard \u201cthe question that was posed to you just awhile ago\u201d and did you understand the question, to which the juror said, \u201cNo, I did not understand.\u201d The court then asked, \u201cYou could not under any circumstances vote for the death penalty,\u201d to which the juror answers \u201cno\u201d and again \u201cno\u201d when the court asks, \u201cIs that right, under any circumstances?\u201d The majority opinion reasons: \u201cAny initial misunderstanding or uncertainty on Kidd\u2019s part was thus resolved by the subsequent questions asked of him and the unequivocality of his responses.\u201d (at 1502). An ambiguous question with a double negative that elicits a meaningless response cannot be the basis of unequivocality.</p>\n<p id=\"b1577-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1577-7\">The writ should be granted conditionally in this case for a retrial of the sentencing issue. The <em>Witherspoon </em>Court had before it the issue of whether a state could challenge for cause <em>any </em>prospective jurors who held conscientious objections about the death penalty. <em>Witherspoon </em>held that a state could remove such a juror, but only after the juror is interrogated and (1) it is established that the juror understood the phrases and words used in the interrogation; and (2) the juror makes it unmistakably clear, by means of unambiguous responses, that he would be unable to set aside his conscientious opposition to the death penalty and abide by his oath as a juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b1577-9\">The test established in <em>Witherspoon </em>is rigorous. It places upon the state the burden of showing that a juror is not qualified before exclusion for cause can be justified, and it requires that the trial court carefully weigh the views of each conscientious objector in determining whether the state has met its burden. These requirements were not satisfied here with regard to the fifteen jurors questioned as a group, or as to jurors Woodlief and Kidd.</p>\n<p id=\"b1577-10\">Group questioning is not condemned in all cases, but where a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to have a balanced jury is at stake, there is no excuse for a cursory, preemptive examination that does not permit the full sifting of jurors\u2019 views. The holding that jurors Woodlief and Kidd were unqualified and properly excluded flies in the face of precedent in the Supreme Court and our circuit. McCorquodale is entitled to a sentencing hearing before a new, properly qualified petit jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1577-11\">GODBOLD, Chief Judge, with whom JOHNSON, Circuit Judge, joins, dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b1577-12\">I respectfully dissent, and I concur in Part II of the dissenting opinion filed by Judge Clark.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1568-14\">. Determination of whether a juror should be excused for cause is a mixed question of fact and law and is left to the trial judge. See <em>Irvin v.

The record reflects that the trial judge suggested that \u201cwe start off with 60\u201d and then \u201cthe voir dire oath was administered to all panels by the District Attorney.\u201d (R. 1201-2). With this large group in the courtroom, the District Attorney undertook the interrogation of the entire group by asking questions required by O.C.G.A. \u00a7 15-12-164 \u2014 \u201cQuestions on voir dire; setting aside juror for cause.\u201d Some jurors were excused for possible bias because of knowledge about the case. Then the District Attorney asked the <em>Witherspoon </em>questions which are the subject of this dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1571-7\">On the basis of their responses to the <em>Wither-spoon </em>inquiry and the other statutory voir dire questions, the trial court, pursuant to \u00a7 15 \u2014 12\u2014 164(c), excused those jurors deemed incompetent. Fifteen jurors were so excused. The remaining jurors were then \u201cput upon the accused\u201d as directed by \u00a7 15-12-161, at which time, the right to individual examination commenced pursuant to O.C.G.A. \u00a7 15-12-133, which by its terms takes effect \u201cafter the usual voir dire questions have been put by the court.\u201d The balance of the panel was then questioned a second time, and additional jurors were excused for cause after both parties had had the opportunity to question them individually. Veniremembers Kidd and Woodlief were excused at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1571-8\">The majority cites several cases in support of its observation that Georgia defense counsel frequently participate in the Witherspoon questioning of jurors. <em>Mincey v. State, </em>251 Ga. 255, 304 S.E.2d 882, 889-90 (1983); <em>Castell v. State, </em>250 Ga. 776, 301 S.E.2d 234, 244-46 (1983); <em>Allen </em>v. <em>State, </em>248 Ga. 676, 286 S.E.2d 3 (1982); <em>Cofield </em>v. <em>State, </em>247 Ga. 98, 274 S.E.2d 530, 535-36 (1981). There is no doubt that defense counsel do so participate; \u00a7 133 entitles them to. The question is when. None of the cases cited implicates a right of defense counsel to participate at the time the veniremembers are questioned by the court en masse, prior to their being called to the stand individually; indeed,</p>\n<p id=\"b1571-10\">there is no indication in any of those cases that the panel was ever addressed en masse, or if it was, whether defense counsel were permitted to question the panel at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1571-11\">To the extent the trial court foregoes assembly of the panel en masse, as appears to have been done in the cases cited by the majority, and instead waits until the veniremembers are called to the stand one at a time to ask them the statutory voir dire questions, it follows that the defendant\u2019s right to question the jurors individually commences as soon as the statutory questions are asked by the court. But in McCorquodale\u2019s case, the process was bifurcated: the statutory voir dire questions were posed to the panel en masse in phase I, with individual questioning to follow in phase II. Insofar as the statute entitles counsel to question the jurors individually only after the statutory voir dire questions have been asked, that right necessarily did not begin until after the first phase was completed, and after fifteen jurors were excused.</p>\n<p id=\"b1571-12\">Objection to group questioning was made in <em>Arnold, supra, </em>a Fulton County case where the procedure was identical. There the jurors were asked the same questions and responded by raising their hands. Six were excused for cause over the objections of the defense. The Supreme Court said at 224 S.E.2d 390: \u201cThe defendant also contends that the statutory voir dire questions cannot be put to jurors as a group over objection. Code Ann. \u00a7 59-806 [now O.C.G.A. \u00a7 15-12-164]. We disagree.\u201d While going on to cite Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 59-705 [now O.C.G.A. \u00a7 15-12-133], and saying that this fact gives defense counsel the right to examine jurors individually, the court points out that this is \u201c... after the usual voir dire questions had been put by the court.\u201d There is no procedure in Georgia as examinations are conducted in Fulton County for the individual questioning to commence until after the trial court has excused the veniremen for cause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1572-6\">. In <em>Douglas v. Wainwright, </em>a venireperson who was asked if she could return a truthful verdict regardless of her opposition to the death penalty, initially responded: \u201cI don\u2019t know; I just don\u2019t believe in capital punishment.\u201d 521 F.Supp. 790, 799 (M.D.Fla.1981). The district court, on habeas review, observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AtAf\">Although the trial judge was again conducting the proper inquiry under <em>Witherspoon, </em>in that he was asking specifically whether her opposition to capital punishment would interfere with her \u201cbringing in a truthful verdict touching upon guilt or innocence\u201d, this veni-reperson initially did not respond in the unequivocal fashion that would, at that point, permit her exclusion for cause.

ENGLAND:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1573-13\">Q Miss Woodlief, you say you\u2019re what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1573-14\">A I\u2019m a sales representative for Gillette.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1573-15\">Q The razor blade company?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1573-16\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1573-17\">Q Have you served before on a jury in a criminal case this week?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1573-18\">A This week.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1573-19\">Q Do you recognize anyone at the other table?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1573-20\">A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1573-21\">Q Would you be fair and impartial in this case, go by the evidence and the law, let your verdict speak the truth on that basis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1573-22\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1573-23\">Q Do you really believe in capital punishment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1573-27\">A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1573-28\">Q You don\u2019t?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1573-29\">A No, I don\u2019t. It\u2019s different being faced, you know, discussing capital punishment and sending someone to the electric chair.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1573-30\">THE COURT: You didn\u2019t understand the question that was posed to you awhile ago?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1573-31\">THE JUROR: Yes, I did at that time. I thought that under certain situations and possibly to rationalize this to myself, but sitting here and observing, I don\u2019t think I could do it, I really don\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1573-32\">THE COURT: All right, Mr. Ridley. That\u2019s grounds for excusal for cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1573-33\">You may be excused.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1573-34\">MR. RIDLEY: Your Honor, may I invoke the same objections as to the others?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1573-35\">THE COURT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1573-36\">You may be excused.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1573-37\">R. at 400-01.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1574-8\">.

PROSECUTOR: No matter what the facts or circumstances of this case might be, you do not believe that you could follow the instructions of the Court to consider the death penalty and vote to impose it, is that right?</p>\n<p id=\"Ahr\">MRS. MELTON: No, sir, as I said before, I feel there are times when the death penalty is warranted. I do not believe that I with my conscience could vote to impose the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-9\">PROSECUTOR: No matter what the facts or circumstances of the case might be?</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-10\">MRS. MELTON: In some cases I might. Before excusing her for cause, the judge asked a final question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-11\">THE COURT: Let me just ask her my question too, then, are you so conscientiously opposed to capital punishment that you would not vote for the death penalty under any circumstances?</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-12\">MRS. MELTON: As I said before, I believe there are circumstances where the death penalty is warranted. I do not believe that I could vote for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-13\">COUNSEL: If you thought from the facts you heard in the whole case that that was the proper decision to make, that he should be electrocuted, could you vote that that was what you thought should be done?</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-25\">MS. TURPIN: Well, this is hard, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just too confused. I don\u2019t know.</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-26\">THE COURT: Well, what we want to find out is if he should be found guilty, after you\u2019ve heard all the circumstances about this case, do you think that there is any way that you could vote to have him executed, that is, to find for the death penalty?</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-27\">MS. TURPIN: Well, I guess I could.</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-28\">}(&lt; <em>% </em>if! <em>% </em>!$!</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-29\">THE COURT: Well, that\u2019s what we need to find out whether or not you could vote for death if the circumstances of the trial, after you\u2019ve learned all about it, whether or not you could, not that you would, whether you could vote to impose the death penalty? MS. TURPIN: Well, I don\u2019t know. I just say that I don\u2019t think I could.</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-30\">THE COURT: You don\u2019t think you could?
