Appellants and petitioners argue on appeal that the FCC violated (1) Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, (2) the public interest standard of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 307(e) (1983 Supp.), and (3) the equal protection component of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. Appellants also argue that the District Court erred in dismissing their action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and in denying their motion for attorneys\u2019 fees. We find these arguments without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-24\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b738-25\">In September 1977, the California Association for the Physically Handicapped <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>(CAPH) filed a petition with the FCC requesting the institution of rulemaking proceedings. CAPH petitioned the FCC to include the handicapped in its equal employment opportunity (EEO) rules and to give preference to handicapped individuals in ownership and management of broadcast facilities. In addition, CAPH requested that the FCC require its licensees to modify their facilities to accommodate the handicapped.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">The FCC filed its report and order on CAPH\u2019s petition on March 6, 1980. The FCC declined to adopt the regulations sought by CAPH. Instead, the FCC promised to appoint a \u201ccoordinator for broadcasting and the handicapped\u201d to advise the licensees on methods to increase employment of the handicapped. The FCC also stated that it would consider findings of illegal discrimination against the handicapped in reviewing applications for new licenses and license renewals.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">CAPH petitioned this court for review of the FCC\u2019s report and order on March 26, 1980. At the same time, the California Paralyzed Veterans Association (CPVA) and two individual litigants filed a petition with the FCC for reconsideration of the report and order. On August 4, 1980, the FCC filed a memorandum opinion and order denying the petition for reconsideration and affirming its previous order. CPVA then filed a petition in this court for review of the memorandum opinion and order. The two petitions were consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">While CAPH\u2019s rulemaking petition was pending before the FCC, CAPH filed suit in February 1979 against the FCC and CBS. CAPH requested that the District Court order the same relief which CAPH sought before the agency: the promulgation of rules under Section 504 regarding employment of the handicapped and the extension of the EEO rules applicable to women and minorities to the handicapped. After the filing of the FCC report and order on March 6, 1980, the District Court dismissed CAPH\u2019s suit against the FCC and CBS. In a decision rendered March 10, 1980, the District Court found that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction in light of the FCC action taken on March 6. The District Court also denied CAPH\u2019s motion for attorneys\u2019 fees made under Section 505(b) of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794a(b), 496 F.Supp. 125. CAPH then appealed the District Court\u2019s decision, which was later consolidated with the petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b739-12\">1. <em>Section 504</em></p>\n<p id=\"b739-13\">Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act provides that no otherwise qualified handicapped individual, solely by reason of the handicap, shall be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> CAPH contends that broadcast licenses are a form of federal financial assistance and that the FCC must therefore issue regulations implementing Section 504.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-14\">Contrary to CAPH\u2019s contention, however, it is now clear that broadcast licenses are not a form of federal financial assistance within the context of Section 504. In <em>Community Television of Southern California v. </em>Gottfried, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 885, 892, 74 L.Ed.2d 705 (1983), the Supreme Court held that the FCC is not a funding agency and has no responsibility to enforce Section 504. Thus, Section 504 does not require the FCC to issue the regulations which CAPH requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-17\">2. <em>Communications Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b739-18\">CAPH argues next that even if Section 504 does not require the FCC to issue the requested regulations, the Communications Act does impose such a requirement. CAPH contends that the FCC\u2019s duty under the Communications Act to pursue the pub-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>lie interest<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> requires the agency to establish regulations implementing the national policy in favor of the handicapped as reflected in Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. In particular, CAPH argues that the public interest standard requires the FCC to (1) forbid employment discrimination against the handicapped, (2) promote ownership and management of broadcasting facilities by the handicapped, and (3) demand a barrier-free environment for the handicapped in broadcasting facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Gott-fried, </em>however, precludes this argument. The court ruled that Congress had not \u201cintended the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to impose any new enforcement obligation on the Federal Communications Commission,\u201d and that the public interest standard of the Communications Act was insufficient to create any obligation to enforce Section 504 or incorporate that section\u2019s standards into the Communications Act. <em>Gottfried, </em>103 S.Ct. at 892 and n. 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">3. <em>Equal Protection</em></p>\n<p id=\"AKH\">CAPH contends that the FCC deprived handicapped persons of equal protection when the <em>agency </em>refused to include the handicapped in its EEO program designed to preclude discrimination against women and racial minorities. CAPH argues that the handicapped should be considered a suspect class, and that under the strict scrutiny standard applicable to a suspect class, the FCC\u2019s action should be held unconstitutional. No appellate court, however, has held that the handicapped are a suspect class. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Sibley, </em>650 F.2d 760, 766 (5th Cir.1981). We decline to be the first.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">CAPH argues that even under that rational basis test applicable to distinctions involving non-suspect classifications, the FCC\u2019s refusal to include the handicapped in the EEO program was still a violation of equal protection. This argument is without merit. Treating two groups differently does not necessarily violate the equal protection. <em>See Massachusetts Board of Retirement v. Murgia, </em>427 U.S. 307, 96 S.Ct. 2562, 49 L.Ed.2d 520 (1976). The FCC claimed that in light of problems unique to handicapped persons, setting up an EEO program to monitor employment of the handicapped by FCC licensees required more resources and expertise than was required for similar programs designed to prevent employment discrimination against women and minorities. Because the FCC\u2019s justification of its refusal to include the handicapped in its EEO program was reasonable, the FCC did not violate equal protection under the rational basis test. <em>See McLaughlin v. Florida, </em>379 U.S. 184, 191, 85 S.Ct. 283, 13 L.Ed.2d 222 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-9\">4. <em>Subject Matter Jurisdiction in District Court</em></p>\n<p id=\"b740-10\">CAPH\u2019s action sought an order directing the FCC to (1) promulgate a Section 504 regulation, and (2) refrain from denying equal employment opportunities to qualified handicapped persons. Although the Court of Appeals has exclusive jurisdiction to review final orders of the FCC, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342(1); 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(a) (1983 Supp.), CAPH argues that the District Court still erred in dismissing the complaint. According to CAPH, the District Court had jurisdiction under two different theories: (1) through application of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2347(b)(3); and (2) because CAPH asserted substantial violations of constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-11\">Section 2347(b)(3) provides no help to CAPH. This section merely provides for a transfer from the Court of Appeals to the District Court when the appellate court has determined that an agency hearing is not required by law and that a genuine issue of material fact remains unresolved. CAPH offers no authority to support the proposition that \u00a7 2347(b)(3) provides the District Court with jurisdiction in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>CAPH\u2019s second argument also lacks merit. The presence of a constitutional issue is insufficient to grant the District Court jurisdiction where jurisdiction would otherwise exist only in the FCC and the Court of Appeals. In <em>Writers Guild of America, West, Inc. v. American Broadcasting Co., </em>609 F.2d 355 (9th Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 824, 101 S.Ct. 85, 66 L.Ed.2d 27 (1980), this court was presented with an argument similar to CAPH\u2019s argument here. In <em>Writers Guild, </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-6\">While we agree that the [action of] the FCC presents serious issues involving the Constitution, the Communications Act, and the APA, we nevertheless believe that the district court should not have thrust itself so hastily into the delicately balanced system of broadcast regulation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AEob\"><em>Id. </em>at 365 (footnote omitted). Statutory and constitutional claims against the FCC are not initially cognizable in federal District Court. CAPH\u2019s constitutional claim against the FCC, therefore, was insufficient to give the District Court subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">5. <em>Attorneys\u2019 Fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">CAPH\u2019s final argument on appeal is that the District Court erred when it dismissed CAPH\u2019s motion for attorneys\u2019 fees on the ground that it did not have jurisdiction to grant the motion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While we hold that the District Court did not err in dismissing CAPH\u2019s motion, the District Court did err by basing its holding on lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">CAPH sought an award of attorneys\u2019 fees under Section 505(b) of the Rehabilitation Act. This section provides that a court can award a prevailing party attorneys\u2019 fees in \u201cany action or proceeding to enforce or charge a violation of a provision\u201d of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 790, <em>et seq., </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794a(b). The Supreme Court, however, has held that Congress\u2019 use of the phrase \u201cany action or proceeding\u201d demonstrates its intent to authorize civil suits in federal court solely to obtain an award of attorneys\u2019 fees for legal work done in administrative proceedings. <em>New York Gaslight Club, Inc. v. Carey, </em>447 U.S. 54, 66, 100 S.Ct. 2024, 2032, 64 L.Ed.2d 723 (1980).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, the District Court erred when it held that it did not have jurisdiction to award attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-13\">Although we would ordinarily remand the case to the District Court for a determination of the attorneys\u2019 fees issue, we need not remand where resolution of factual issues is unnecessary. <em>United States v. Ford, </em>650 F.2d 1141, 1144 (9th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 942, 102 S.Ct. 1437, 71 L.Ed.2d 654 (1982). Here, remand is unnecessary. CAPH requested attorneys\u2019 fees under Section 505(b) of the Rehabilitation Act. For the reason discussed below, CAPH cannot legally qualify as a prevailing party under Section 505(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-14\">In <em>Fitzharris </em>v. <em>Wolff, </em>702 F.2d 836 (9th Cir.1983), we discussed two possible elements of a test for determining whether a plaintiff is a prevailing party. The first element \u2014 required by our previous decisions \u2014 is a factual one: the District Court must determine what the lawsuit sought to accomplish and then determine whether it was accomplished by means of the suit. <em>Id. </em>at 838. The second possible element is a legal one: whether there was a legal basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>for the plaintiff\u2019s claim. The First Circuit requires such an element: \u201cIf it has been judicially determined that defendants\u2019 conduct, however beneficial it may be to plaintiffs\u2019 interests, is not required by law, then defendants must be held to have acted gratuitously and plaintiffs have not prevailed in a legal sense.\u201d <em>Nadeau v. Helgemoe, </em>581 F.2d 275, 281 (1st Cir.1978). We noted in <em>Fitzharris </em>that we had not previously decided whether to adopt this second element, and we found it unnecessary to decide the question at that time since the plaintiff had met both elements. <em>Fitzharris, </em>702 F.2d at 838.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">Here, however, the FCC\u2019s appointment of a \u201ccoordinator for broadcasting and the handicapped\u201d was not required by Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> FCC\u2019s action, therefore, was gratuitous, at least with respect to the Section 505(b) attorneys\u2019 fee provision upon which CAPH relies.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, we are now squarely presented with the issue we left open in <em>Fitzharris. </em>We now hold that a plaintiff cannot be a prevailing party where a defendant\u2019s action is only gratuitous. Consequently, CAPH is not a prevailing party since it fails to meet the legal element of our definition of a prevailing party. The District Court did not err in dismissing the attorneys\u2019 fee claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">The District Court\u2019s dismissal of appellants\u2019 action is affirmed, and the petitions for review are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b739-8\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794 provides, <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-9\">No otherwise qualified handicapped individual in the United States, as defined in section 7(7) of this title, shall, solely by reason of his handicap, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b740-7\">. 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 307(c) (1983 Supp.) provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that the FCC is directed by statute to grant an application for renewal of a broadcast license if it finds that the \u201cpublic interest, convenience, and necessity would be served thereby.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b741-10\">. In view of our decision on the issue of attorneys\u2019 fees, we conclude that no party was prejudiced when the panel granted CAPH\u2019s counsel\u2019s motion to allow counsel to briefly argue the single issue of attorneys\u2019 fees. Although CAPH\u2019s counsel was the only party present at oral argument, all counsel were notified by phone that the court had granted the limited oral argument. The procedure adopted was merely to facilitate the hearing of this appeal. The suggestions coming after submission for further oral argument are denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b741-11\">. In <em>New York Gaslight Club, Inc. v. Carey, </em>447 U.S. 54, 100 S.Ct. 2024, 64 L.Ed.2d 723 (1980), the Supreme Court interpreted the attorneys\u2019 fees provisions of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(k). The similar legislative histories and wording of the Title VII and the Rehabilitation Act attorneys\u2019 fees sections compel the conclusion that the courts must interpret the \u201cany action or proceeding\u201d language of both statutes in the same manner. <em>Compare </em>110 Cong.Rec. 12724 (1964) (remarks of Sen. Humphrey concerning Title VII) <em>with </em>124 Cong.Rec. 18999-19000 (1978) (remarks of Sen. Stafford concerning the Rehabilitation Act).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b742-8\">. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Gottfried </em>clearly states that the FCC is not a funding agency and therefore has no obligation to enforce Section 504. <em>See </em>discussion of Section 504 in text above.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b742-9\">. Section 505(b) authorizes an award of attorneys\u2019 fees only for actions to enforce Title V of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 790, <em>et seq. </em>Therefore, unless Section 504 forms the required legal basis for the FCC\u2019s action, the action is gratuitous with respect to an award of fees under Section 505(b). Thus, it is irrelevant whether the FCC\u2019s action was gratuitous with respect to the Communications Act. Even if the Communications Act required the FCC to take the action, CAPH could not collect.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
