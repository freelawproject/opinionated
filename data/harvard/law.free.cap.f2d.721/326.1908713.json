(hereinafter \u201cMasonry\u201d), appeals from an award of auditing fees following appellees\u2019 successful suit under the Employee Retirement Income Security Program (\u201cERISA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-24\">Plaintiffs/appellees, three employee benefit funds and their boards of trustees (hereinafter \u201cBoard\u201d), brought an action to audit appellant\u2019s payroll records and to obtain an accounting of all funds allegedly due to the trust, as well as costs of the audit and attorneys\u2019 fees. The Board succeeded in that action, and the trial court found that Masonry had made an underpayment to the trust funds. Based upon the auditor\u2019s time sheets and the detailed investigation results, the trial court also found that appellees were entitled to accountants\u2019 fees in the amount of $4,955 to cover the costs of the audit. At issue is whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>district court erred in granting the auditing fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The district court found both contractual (the trust agreements) and statutory (29 U. S.C. \u00a7 1132(g)) authorization for an award of auditing fees in the instant case. Former \u00a7 1132(g)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-7\">In any action under this subchapter by a participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary, the court in its discretion may allow a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee and <em>costs of action </em>to either party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(g) (1974), Pub.L. 93-406, title I, \u00a7 502, 88 Stat. 891, (emphasis supplied) (amended 1980). The court found that \u201ccosts\u201d under ERISA\u2019s fee authorization provision envisaged auditing fees. Record (hereinafter \u201cR\u201d) at 484. While the costs of the accountants\u2019 actual court appearances probably would be \u201ccosts\u201d under \u00a7 1132,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we have some doubt as to whether the \u201cfield\u201d and \u201cclerical\u201d work connected with the audit is compensable as \u201ccosts.\u201d We need not determine whether such auditing costs are within the ambit of \u00a7 1132, however, because a contractual basis for an award of these costs clearly exists. Article V, \u00a7 5.9 of the Pension Fund Agreement, dealing with the powers of the Trustees, provides that the Trustees are empowered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-10\">[T]o have the Fund\u2019s Auditor inspect and audit, at the expense of the Fund, the payroll records of any Employer ... to the extent necessary to determine whether the proper contributions required to be made to the Fund have been made; and <em>at the sole discretion of the Board in the event an underpayment is found to exist, </em>to charge the Employer all or a portion of the expense of the audit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-12\">R. Vol. 1 at 65 (emphasis added). We find that the appellees were within the bounds of their discretion in assessing the costs of the audit against appellant because an underpayment was found to exist. Therefore, the trial court committed no error in awarding auditing fees to the appellees. Accordingly, the judgment below is</p>\n<p id=\"ak-dedup-0\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b397-11\">. In 1980, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(g) was amended to make the award of certain litigation costs to a fund mandatory. Multi-Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980, Pub.L. 96-364, title III, \u00a7 306(b)(2), 94 Stat. 1295, codified at 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(g)(2)(D) (Supp. V 1981). Appellees have argued that this amendment applies to the instant case, citing <em>Central States, Southeast, etc. v. Alco Express Co., </em>522 F.Supp. 919 (E.D.Mich.1981). Appellees\u2019 Brief at 23. We do not address the retroactivity of this amendment because (1) our holding is based upon the contractual authorization of auditing fees, not \u00a7 1132(g) and (2) to the extent that we do discuss the statute, our discussion focuses only on interpretation of \u201ccosts of the action,\u201d rather than the discretionary versus mandatory issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b397-21\">. The Time and Billing Report attached to the Board\u2019s Application for Accounting Fees indicates that $310 of the $4,955 auditing fee was for a total of 11\u2019A hours of court appearances by two accountants.
