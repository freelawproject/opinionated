Appellants<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> seek to prohibit the release of funds by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (\u201cHUD\u201d), the expenditure of funds already released, and any other action in furtherance of the construction of Lake Alma, a man-made 1,400 acre lake in Bacon County, Georgia.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-18\">Appellants challenge the lawfulness of HUD\u2019s 1982 decision to release the funds for the Lake Alma Project and the Army Corps of Engineers\u2019 (\u201cCorps\u201d) grant of a permit pursuant to \u00a7 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended by the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344, for construction of the dam for the lake.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-19\">In releasing the funds, HUD waived a regulation requiring that the project for which funds are issued must \u201cprincipally benefit\u201d persons of low and moderate income. Appellants contend (1) that the governing statute, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5301-5320, requires that over fifty percent of the persons benefited by funding issued thereunder be of low and moderate income and (2) that the Deputy Assistant Secretary of HUD had no authority to waive this requirement. Appellees argue and the district court held that the statute does not impose a <em>requirement </em>of fifty percent benefit to low and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>moderate income persons; that the fifty percent directive is regulatory only, <em>see </em>24 C.F.R. \u00a7 570.302(b)(1), (d)(2) (1983); and that, therefore, the provision may be waived pursuant to 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 570.4.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Alternatively, appellants claim that even if the requirement is regulatory only, waiver of the regulation was arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">Appellants next argue that a supplemental environmental impact statement (\u201cSEIS\u201d) was required before HUD or the Corps could release the funds or grant the \u00a7 404 permit because modifications in the plans subsequent to issuance of the final environmental impact statement (\u201cEIS\u201d) would have a significant impact on the environment. Finally, they contend that the Corps acted unlawfully in granting a \u00a7 404 permit for the primary project prior to determining whether additional permits would be necessary for the modifications of the plan on which environmental approval for the entire plan is conditioned, and, if the additional permits are needed, prior to issuance of such permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">The district court rejected each of appellants\u2019 claims, ruled that there was no substantial likelihood of success on the merits,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and denied the preliminary injunction as well as a stay pending appeal. A panel of this court granted a temporary stay pending appeal. We affirm in part, reverse in part and remand for further proceedings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b840-13\">I. Background<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"aqv-dedup-1\">A. <em>Early History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b840-14\">In 1968 the City of Alma (\u201cAlma\u201d) was selected to participate in the Model Cities Program, pursuant to the Demonstration Cities and Metropolitan Development Act of 1966,42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3301-3374. Alma formulated its plan under the program centered around four cornerstone projects: (1) development of an air/rail industrial park, (2) improvement of water and sewage treatment facilities, (3) improvements to the airport, and (4) the construction of a reservoir on Hurricane Creek, now referred to as Lake Alma and the subject of this litigation. Alma secured funding for and completed the first three of the four cornerstone projects. Other community development projects, such as a residential community for the elderly and a recreation park, were constructed on the expected shoreline of the lake.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-15\">In 1971 HUD released funds for a feasibility study on the Lake Alma project and, in 1972, funds for preliminary engineering work. Additional funds were appropriated in 1973. In the same year a lawsuit was filed by plaintiffs challenging the project on the grounds that an EIS was required. <em>Deen v. Lynn, </em>CV No. 861 (S.D.Ga. Sept. 20, 1973). The suit was dismissed when HUD <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>undertook preparation of an EIS. In 1974 HUD issued a draft EIS for the Alma project. Because the EIS engendered a substantial amount of criticism, it was withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\">B. <em>HUD\u2019s Involvement in the Lake Alma Project as Administrator of the Community Development Block Grant Program</em></p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">In the meantime, Congress had enacted the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (\u201cAct\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5301-5320. Alma sought funding for the Lake Alma project under this Act and, pursuant thereto, assumed HUD\u2019s responsibility for ensuring compliance with all applicable environmental requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">Under the Act, in particular the Community Development Block Grant Program, HUD allocated funds for the Lake Alma project in fiscal years 1975 through 1979. The release of these funds, however, was conditioned upon the completion of an EIS for the project. Alma issued a final EIS in December, 1976, and submitted it to HUD in March, 1977, together with a request for release of the allocated funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">By a letter dated March 24, 1977, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Interior informed the Mayor of Alma and HUD that the Department of the Interior opposed the project on environmental grounds. The Deputy Assistant Secretary stated that the Fish and Wildlife Service (\u201cFWS\u201d) also objected to the project. On the same day the Deputy Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) registered that agency\u2019s objections to the Lake Alma project. The next day a lawsuit was filed challenging HUD\u2019s funding of the project. <em>Hurricane Creek Protective Society v. Bacon County, Georgia, </em>CV No. 577-16 (S.D.Ga. March 25, 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">The Assistant Secretary of HUD informed Alma on April 4, 1977, that serious objections to the project had been raised and that Alma should consider withdrawing its request for the release of funds. Alma declined to do so. HUD considered the merits of the application and, after consultation with all federal agencies involved, refused to release the funds. HUD informed Alma of the decision on August 10, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-10\">Alma requested that HUD conduct an administrative hearing and filed a cross-claim in the pending lawsuit seeking to compel HUD to release the funds. The lawsuit was dismissed, without prejudice, for want of prosecution in June, 1980, due to an agreement among the litigants that Alma would obtain a \u00a7 404 permit from the Corps before proce\u00e9ding further with the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-11\">The Corps issued the \u00a7 404 permit in November, 1981. HUD reinstituted review of the Lake Alma project, receiving comments from certain interested parties. On January 20, 1982, HUD informed Alma it was considering funding the project on the condition that Alma certify satisfaction of four requirements: (1) that the EIS had been reviewed and, if necessary, revised, (2) that the project would principally benefit low- and moderate-income persons, (3) that the use of the lands acquired was in compliance with the applicable comprehensive open space plan, and (4) that the project description remained unchanged from the most recently approved HUD application.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-12\">In February, 1982, Alma responded and submitted documents declaring that all four of the requirements were satisfied. Upon review, HUD\u2019s Atlanta Area Office (\u201cHUD-Atlanta\u201d) determined that Alma had satisfied the first, third and fourth conditions, but not the second. HUD-Atlanta found that, under the best assumptions, the project might barely qualify as principally benefiting low- and moderate-income persons but that, under more realistic assumptions, the project would not qualify. HUD-Atlanta therefore recommended to the Assistant Secretary of HUD that the funds not be released.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-13\">Upon review of HUD-Atlanta\u2019s report and recommendation, the Deputy Assistant Secretary agreed with the findings therein but refused to follow HUD-Atlanta\u2019s recommendation. Rather, the Deputy Assistant Secretary waived the principal benefit requirement on the grounds that to do oth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>erwise would result in undue hardship and would frustrate the purpose of the block grant statute. He directed HUD-Atlanta to inform Alma that the funds would be released.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">C. <em>The Corps\u2019 Involvement in the Lake Alma Project</em></p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">As required by the agreement of the litigants in the second lawsuit, Alma applied to the Corps for a \u00a7 404 permit for the discharge of dredged and fill material. Public notice was issued and a public hearing was held with approximately 550 persons in attendance.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">Supporters of the project included several state agencies and officials: the Governor of Georgia; the Georgia Department of Natural Resources (\u201cDNR\u201d); the Georgia State Clearing House; and the Southeast Georgia Area Planning and Development Commission. Opponents included nearly all federal agencies involved with conservation and environmental issues: the EPA; the Executive Office of the President, Counsel on Environmental Quality (\u201cCEQ\u201d); FWS; and the Bureau of Outdoor Recreation (\u201cBOR\u201d). Other opponents included: The Sierra Club; the National Wildlife Federation; the Georgia Wildlife Federation; the Georgia Conservancy; the Atlanta Audubon Society; the Georgia Ornithological Society; and the Hurricane Creek Protective Society.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">After thorough analysis, the Corps\u2019 District Engineer for the Savannah District recommended to the Divisional Engineer for the South Atlantic Division that the permit be denied for environmental reasons. The divisional engineer directed his staff to further investigate the critical issues, made a personal inspection of the site, received comments from interested state and federal agencies and asked the District Engineer for a reevaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">At this time a major development occurred. The FWS issued a Mitigation Study for the Lake Alma project. The Study proposed a plan whereby the loss of 1,400 acres of bay and branch swamp would be mitigated with creation of six green tree reservoirs (\u201cGTRs\u201d), combined with intense wildlife management of the proposed project area.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Conditioned on the implementation of this Mitigation Plan, the FWS and the BOR, now the Heritage Conservation and Recreation Service, withdrew their objections to the issuance of the \u00a7 404 permit. The EPA and CEQ, however, maintained their opposition to the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-11\">During this period a new District Engineer had assumed charge of the Savannah District. After apparently comprehensive analysis, he concluded that the permit should be issued, but only on condition that the Mitigation Plan be implemented. This recommendation was forwarded to and accepted by the Divisional Engineer. The Divisional Engineer informed the EPA that the permit would be granted unless the EPA requested that the issue be elevated to the department level for further review. EPA requested the elevated review, which was conducted by the Office of the Chief of Engineers (\u201cOCE\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-12\">The EPA and the CEQ continued to object to the construction of Lake Alma due to its anticipated environmental impact. In addition, both attacked the Mitigation Plan on the ground that it would not adequately mitigate the loss of the wetlands and that the proposed GTRs could create additional water quality problems. The EPA at this time brought to the attention of the Corps the possibility that the GTRs themselves would require \u00a7 404 permits, separate and distinct from the \u00a7 404 permit required for the entire project. In response to this last issue, OCE conducted a site inspection and concluded that individual \u00a7 404 permits for the GTRs might be required, but, due to the uncertain location of the reservoirs, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>was a possibility that all of the GTRs could be covered by a nationwide permit.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\">OCE held a public hearing on the Lake Alma project in January, 1980, with officials from the Corps, EPA, and CEQ present. Subsequently, OCE ordered preparation of a study concerning the Mitigation Plan and the GTRs. The Environmental Protection Division of the DNR made and released this study in April, 1980. Despite criticism by both the EPA and the FWS questioning the methods employed in the study, OCE concluded that the \u00a7 404 permit should be issued. Following EPA\u2019s request for elevated review, the Assistant Secretary of the Army ordered the OCE to update the administrative file and directed that a new study on the GTRs be undertaken, this time in consultation with the FWS and the EPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">On the basis of this study, completed in July, 1981, and the other information before him, the Assistant Secretary decided that the \u00a7 404 permit should be issued. EPA was notified of this decision and of its option to elevate review to the Secretary of the Army. In a letter dated October 9, 1981, the Administrator of the EPA informed the Corps that the EPA\u2019s questions regarding the loss of wetlands and the water quality of Lake Alma had been adequately answered and that the EPA now withdrew its objection to the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">At the direction of the Assistant Secretary of the Army, the District Engineer on November 10,1981, issued the \u00a7 404 permit to construct the dam for Lake Alma. This lawsuit ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">II. <em>HUD Authority to Waive the Principal Benefit Regulation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">This issue was framed in the court below and by the parties on appeal as whether the requirement that funds \u201cprincipally\u201d benefit low- or moderate-income persons is a statutory or a regulatory requirement. All agreed that if it were regulatory only, the Secretary of HUD has the authority pursuant to 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 570.4<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> to waive it. The district court concluded that while principally benefiting low- and moderate-income persons is the primary <em>goal </em>of the statute, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5301(c), the principal benefit <em>requirement, </em>24 C.F.R. \u00a7 570.302(b)(1), (d)(2), was regulatory only and could be waived, and that the only statutory requirement is that the funded project give \u201cmaximum feasible priority\u201d to benefiting low- and moderate-income persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-11\">It is clear from the face of the statute that no explicit principal benefit requirement is statutorily imposed. \u201cPrincipally benefiting\u201d is explicitly made the primary <em>goal </em>of the statute, not a requirement. Preambles to statutes do not impose substantive rights, duties or obligations. <em>See Association of Am. Railroads v. Costle, </em>562 F.2d 1310, 1316 (D.C.Cir.1977); <em>Alexander v. HUD, </em>555 F.2d 166, 171 (7th Cir.1977). The statute requires only that the \u201cmaximum feasible priority\u201d be given. Accordingly, it is critical to determine what the statutory requirement of giving maximum feasible priority, which all concede is a nonwaivable requirement, really means, and what it actually requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-12\">The thrust of appellants\u2019 argument is that \u201cmaximum feasible priority\u201d implicitly requires that <em>at least </em>fifty percent of the beneficiaries of a funded project be of low- or moderate-income and that above that level the highest priority feasible is to be given to benefiting such persons. In other words, appellants assert, \u201cmaximum feasible priority\u201d means \u201cmaximum feasible priority above fifty percent.\u201d Appellees have failed to interpret \u201cmaximum feasible priority,\u201d other than to argue that it does <em>not </em>mean at least fifty percent low- and moderate-income beneficiaries because, if that is what Congress intended, it would have said so in clear terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-13\">When faced with an issue of statutory interpretation, \u201c[ajbsent a clearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary, [the statutory] language must ordinarily be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>regarded as conclusive.\u201d <em>North Dakota v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 1095, 1102-03, 75 L.Ed.2d 77 (1983), <em>quoting Consumer Products Safety Comm\u2019n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., </em>447 U.S. 102, 108, 100 S.Ct. 2051, 2056, 64 L.Ed.2d 766 (1980) [hereinafter CPSC]. This guideline presupposes that the \u201cplain meaning\u201d of the statute can be deduced from its terms. <em>CPSC, </em>100 S.Ct. at 2056. <em>Accord Frank Diehl Farms v. Secretary of Labor, </em>696 F.2d 1325, 1331 (11th Cir.1983); <em>Hills v. Commissioner, </em>691 F.2d 997, 1000 (11th Cir.1982). Here, the \u201cplain meaning\u201d of the term \u201cmaximum feasible priority\u201d is not readily apparent. Accordingly, recourse to the legislative history of the statute is necessary. <em>See Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co. v. </em>EEOC, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 2622, 2627, 77 L.Ed.2d 89 (1983) (where statute does not define relevant term, court \u201cmust therefore go beyond the bare statutory language\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">In enacting the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, Congress authorized the Secretary of HUD to issue block grants to localities for revitalization and maintenance of our nation\u2019s cities. As Congress stated: \u201cThe primary objective of this chapter is the development of viable urban communities, by providing decent housing and a suitable living environment and expanding economic opportunities, principally for persons of low- and moderate-income.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5301(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-9\">In setting the requirement for approval or disapproval of applications for grants, Congress established:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-10\">Any grant under this chapter shall be made only on condition that the applicant certify to the satisfaction of the Secretary that its Community Development Program has been developed so as to give maximum feasible priority to activities which will benefit low- or moderate-income families or aid in the prevention or elimination of slums or blight. The Secretary may also approve an application describing activities which the applicant certifies and the Secretary determines are designed to meet other community development needs having a particular urgency as specifically described in the application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b844-13\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5304(b)(2). The Lake Alma funds were applied for only under the \u201cbenefit to low- or moderate-income persons\u201d prong, Alma never having certified that the project would remove or prevent blight or that any other urgent need applied. Thus, our review is limited to the propriety of the authorization of funds under the first standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-14\">The legislative history of this section of the statute began in the Senate. The original Senate version of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5304(b)(2) contained a limitation that no more than twenty percent of funds issued for a particular program could be used so as not \u201cto be of direct and significant benefit to families of low or moderate income . .. . \u201d S.Rep. No. 693, 93d Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>1974 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 4273, 4322; <em>see also id. </em>at 4400. This requirement of eighty percent use for low- or moderate-income persons was to be applied \u201cunless the Secretary finds modification of the limitation necessary to meet urgent community needs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4322. The Senate wished to include the statutory limitation \u201c[i]n order to assure ... that the activities undertaken by a community development agency reflect the national priorities for which assistance is provided .... \u201d <em>Id. </em>Although the Senate committee members dealing with the bill had divergent views as to the propriety of the limitation, all seemed to agree on the purpose to be served by the eighty percent requirement: limiting the discretion of localities to use community development funds for purposes other than those set forth in the statute.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>The eighty percent requirement was deleted from the bill by the Conference Committee before final passage. In lieu thereof the \u201cmaximum feasible priority\u201d language made its debut:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-5\">The Senate bill contained a provision not contained in the House amendment prohibiting more than 20 percent of an applicant\u2019s community development funds to be used for activities which do not directly and significantly benefit low- and moderate-income families or blighted areas. The conference report contains, in place of the Senate provision, a requirement that the applicant certify to the \u2022 HUD Secretary\u2019s satisfaction that its program has been developed so as to give maximum feasible priority to activities which will benefit low- and moderate-income families or aid in the prevention or elimination of slums or blight.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b845-11\">S.Conf.Rep. No. 1279, 93d Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>1974 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 4449, 4453 (emphasis deleted). This is the sum and substance of guidance given by the 93rd Congress on the meaning of \u201cmaximum feasible priority.\u201d It is clear at this stage in the history that adoption of the term signaled a rejection of the eighty percent use requirement. While the legislative history is silent on Congress\u2019 reasons for the rejection, given the criticism by several Senators, we can infer that it was prompted primarily by a belief that the requirement would place too rigid a restriction on local government discretion. What limits on discretion 'were intended by \u201cmaximum feasible priority,\u201d however, we are not told. It is probable that Congress deliberately avoided the issue, not setting any specific percentage limits on the authorization of funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>To gain insight into this question, we have explored the subsequent history of the Housing and Community Development Act. We bear in mind that \u201cthe views of a subsequent Congress form a hazardous basis for inferring the intent of an earlier one.\u201d <em>CPSC, </em>447 U.S. at 117, 100 S.Ct. at 2061 (quoting <em>United States v. Price, </em>361 U.S. 304, 313, 80 S.Ct. 326, 332, 4 L.Ed.2d 334 (1960)). Given the paucity of guidelines, however, any assistance available must be accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">The Conference Report for the 1977 amendments to the statute suggests that the conferees may have interpreted \u00a7 5304(b)(2) in the way appellants urge: \u201cmaximum feasible priority\u201d as a requirement to give as much priority as possible over fifty percent to activities benefiting low- and moderate-income persons. The report states: \u201cThe committee ... does not intend that this amendment change the <em>requirement </em>that community development grant funds must, to the maximum extent feasible, be used for activities <em>primarily benefiting </em>low and moderate income persons .... \u201d H.Conf.Rep. No. 634, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 47, <em>reprinted in </em>1977 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 2965, 2968 (emphasis added). This language reflects that particular Congress\u2019 understanding that maximum feasible priority means above and beyond primarily benefiting low- and moderate-income persons. <em>But cf. </em>Staff Report on the Community Development Block Grant Program, Subcommittee on Housing and Community Development of the House Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 5 (1977) (\u201cWhile [maximum feasible priority] appears to focus on funding priorities, the focus is still extremely broad. Given the procedural objectives of the program, this provision would appear to proscribe only those individual activities which are clearly unrelated to ... low or moderate income persons ... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">\u25a0 Later in this report the Conference Committee adopted a Senate amendment to \u00a7 5304(c)(3) providing for disapproval of block grant applications that do not comply with the primary purpose of principally benefiting low- and moderate-income persons: \u201cThe Conference report contains the Senate provision amended to specifically incorporate the present [1974] law <em>requirements </em>that no application be approved unless it ... <em>principally benefits </em>persons of low- and moderate-income .... \u201d H.Conf. Rep. No. 634, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 50, <em>reprinted in </em>1977 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 2970 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">In 1981 Congress repealed and rewrote major portions of the statute, restructuring its provisions to emphasize administrative oversight of post-award use of funds instead of stringent enforcement of detailed application requirements. It stated its reasons for so doing thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-8\">In the period since 1974, various pressures from both Congress and within HUD, have worked both to narrow the focus of the program and to layer thicker and more restrictive regulations on the application .... The HUD regional and area office staff has used the application process far too frequently as a means for imposing HUD\u2019s views of acceptable program activity on local entities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b846-9\">S.Rep.

Nevertheless, Congress retained \u201cmaximum feasible priority\u201d as a project requirement to which each applicant must certify when applying for funds under the low- and moderate-income provision of the statute. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5304(b)(3) (Supp.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-10\">Whether the \u201cprincipally benefit\u201d regulation, 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 570.302(b)(1), (d)(2), was one of the \u201crestrictive regulations\u201d to which the Senate reacted is not clear. In light of the fact, however, that soon thereafter HUD took steps to modify substantially its principal benefit requirement, <em>see </em>Proposed Amendments to Community Development Block Grants, 47 Fed.Reg. 43900, 43923 (1982); 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 570 (1983), and accompanying editorial note; Intergovernmental Review of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Programs and Activities, 48 Fed.Reg. 29206, 29218 (1983), it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>likely that the requirement was considered one of the \u201crestrictive regulations.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It would be illogical therefore to interpret \u201cmaximum feasible priority\u201d as containing an implicit \u201cprincipal benefit\u201d requirement.

Unfortunately, the agency\u2019s contemporaneous and subsequent interpretations of the statutory language are unclear and seemingly inconsistent. Certainly, contrary to appellees\u2019 assertions, no one interpretation is longstanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-9\">The 1978 administrative regulations implementing section 5304(b)(2) require that at least fifty percent of the persons benefited must be of low- or moderate-income. 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 570.302(d)(2). The original 1974 implementing regulations, however, did not by their terms contain a principal benefit requirement. <em>See </em>Rulemaking, Community Development Block Grants, 39 Fed.Reg. 40136 (1974). Instead they required an applicant to identify community development needs and a strategy for meeting those needs, and to specify both short and long term objectives developed in accordance with area-wide development planning and national urban growth policies. <em>Id. </em>at 40144. These regulations could be interpreted as an indication that HUD, at least originally, did not construe \u201cmaximum feasible priority\u201d to include a principal benefit requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-10\">In 1977, three years after Alma applied for funding under the Act, HUD first proposed the principal benefit regulation, Proposed Rulemaking, Housing and Community Development Act, 42 Fed.Reg. 56450 (1977), stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-11\">The experience gained in carrying out the block grant program has caused some concern that the statutory intent was not being met in a consistent fashion, and that benefits to lower-income persons might be diminishing. The 1977 amendments to the Housing and Community Development Act include additional language concerning benefits to low- and moderate-income persons. It was therefore decided to propose a rule which con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>tained specific controls on the use of funds to assure that low- and moderate-income persons are the principal beneficiaries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-3\">The proposed rule is that all block grants must be used for projects which principally benefit low- and moderate-income persons.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b848-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 56454. This proposal reflects two possible HUD interpretations: (1) that the statute embodies a requirement of principally benefiting low- and moderate-income persons; and/or (2) in HUD\u2019s opinion, there had been times prior to 1977 when the statute had been applied so as not to principally benefit low- and moderate-income persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">The 1977 rules provided for exceptions to their requirements \u201cwhere clearly necessary to attain other statutory objectives.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Appellees persuasively argue that if the principal benefit requirement were statutorily required, the agency would have had no power either to make exceptions to it or not to have applied it between 1974 and 1977. Indeed, when the principal benefit regulation was finally promulgated, HUD \u201cconcluded that the requirement is statutorily <em>permissible </em>Rulemaking, Housing and Community Development Act, 43 Fed. Reg. 8450, 8451 (1978) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">Given that a question had been raised in HUD\u2019s collective mind whether the principal benefit requirement was even permissible, and given HUD\u2019s failure to include the requirement in the original regulations, it appears HUD did not interpret the statutory \u201cmaximum feasible priority\u201d requirement to embody a principal benefit requirement, even though it interpreted Congress\u2019 overriding intent behind the statute to be one of principally benefiting low- and moderate-income persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">The district court properly relied upon the rule of deference to agency interpretation, defering to HUD\u2019s original interpretation of the statute and its 1981 decision that the principal benefit requirement was regulatory only and therefore waiva-ble. In the matter before us, however, other principles of statutory construction also apply and unfortunately present a conflict.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-11\">[T]he courts are the final authorities on issues of statutory construction. They <em>must reject </em>administrative constructions of the statute ... that are inconsistent with the statutory mandate or that frustrate the policy that Congress sought to implement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b848-12\"><em>Federal Election Comm\u2019n v.

To interpret \u201cmaximum feasible priority\u201d to allow approval of projects that have as their principal beneficiaries persons who are not of low- or moderate-income would appear inconsistent with this primary goal, the \u201cvery heartbeat of the bill,\u201d Additional Views of Mr. Taft, S.Rep.

After examining the relevant legislative and regulatory history, as well as arguments of counsel, however, we conclude that the statutory requirement of \u201cmaximum feasible priority\u201d does not embody a required floor that in each case the funds at least principally benefit low- and moderate-income persons. While it seems anomalous that the requirements of the statute would allow authorization of grants that do not satisfy the primary objective of the statute, the legislative history accompanying the original adoption of the \u201cmaximum feasible priority\u201d language leads us to conclude that Congress rejected an explicit percentage floor for the use of funds. If it intended another percentage minimum to replace the eighty percent figure it rejected, it could have said so. Although Congress has been presented with various opportunities to clarify the meaning of \u201cmaximum feasible priority,\u201d it has declined to do so. It appears that while the systemic goal behind the statute was principally to benefit low- and moderate-income persons, Congress did not intend for that goal to be met absolutely by every funded project. <em>See </em>Staff Report on the Community Development Block Grant Program, Subcommittee on Housing and Community Development of the House Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 5 (1977). The history of the implementing regulations is consistent with this interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">In summary, we conclude that \u201cmaximum feasible priority\u201d does not embody the principal benefit requirement. The district court therefore properly interpreted the principal benefit requirement as regulatory<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and waivable under 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 570.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">III. <em>Waiver of the Principal Benefit Requirement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">The district court correctly noted that the standard of review for HUD actions is whether they are \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A); <em>Mejia v. HUD, </em>688 F.2d 529, 531 (7th Cir.1982). The Secretary of HUD has authority to waive the principal benefit requirement only if \u201cit is determined that undue hardship will result from applying the requirement and where application of the requirement would adversely affect the purposes of the Act.\u201d 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 570.4. The issue is whether the Deputy Assistant Secretary abused his discretion in finding that application of the regulation would result in undue hardship and adversely affect the purposes of the block grant statute. We conclude that he did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-10\">A. <em>Undue Hardship</em></p>\n<p id=\"b849-11\">In a letter supporting his decision to waive the principal benefit requirement, the Deputy Assistant Secretary concluded that the project qualified as an activity benefiting low- and moderate-income persons and that imposition of the requirement would result in undue hardship. His conclusions were founded upon three considerations. First, Lake Alma was the hub of a larger development program that began over a decade ago under the Model Cities Program,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> which was instituted in 1966 to provide financial assistance to cities in an effort to overcome economic and social problems associated with urban life. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3301. In developing its program, Alma sought to alleviate area problems of poverty, a critical shortage of recreational facilities and the need for industrial development. To respond to these problems, the city proposed the development of four cornerstone projects: an air/rail industrial park, improved water and sewerage facilities, modernized airport services, and Lake Alma. The lake was intended to provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>recreational opportunities and to induce economic development.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">Although each of the four projects was designed to provide benefits independent of the other three, Lake Alma was viewed as the \u201curban shaper of the four,\u201d and as such, millions of dollars of public and private investment were spent developing and constructing projects that conceptually and physically are connected to the lake. A fifty-two unit home for the elderly was built in a location overlooking the proposed shore of the lake; the city\u2019s urban renewal projects were built next to the proposed lake; and a recreational park was planned to surround Lake Alma on three sides, some facilities of which have already been completed.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In fact, most of Alma\u2019s revitalization projects, including the cornerstone projects, were designed and constructed in anticipation of Lake Alma.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">A second reason offered by the Deputy Assistant Secretary in support of his waiver is the potential waste of large sums of local and federal funds already invested in the plan. In addition to the $500,000 expended under the Model Cities Program, over $2.3 million in block grant funds had been allocated to the project from 1975 through 1977. Since the principal benefit regulation did not become effective until 1978, the Deputy Assistant Secretary concluded that failure to waive the requirement would effectively hold these previously allocated funds \u201chostage\u201d to the appropriations set aside for 1978 and 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">The Deputy Assistant Secretary\u2019s third consideration supporting his conclusion that undue hardship would result if the principal benefit regulation were not waived was the near-majority low- and moderate-income population in the area benefiting from the project (46.2% in Bacon County; 41.9% in the twenty-one county service area). Although the regulation was not completely satisfied by these figures, he noted that the standard was nearly met and that the project did qualify as an activity benefiting low- and moderate-income persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-10\">When examining decisions of agency officials, the reviewing court is not empowered to substitute its own judgment for that of the agency. <em>Bowman Transp., Inc. v. Arkansas-Best Freight Sys., Inc., </em>419 U.S. 281, 285, 95 S.Ct. 438, 442, 42 L.Ed.2d 447 (1974); <em>McHenry v. Bond, </em>668 F.2d 1185, 1190 (11th Cir.1982). Review is limited to determining whether the agency has articulated \u201ca rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u201d <em>Bowman, </em>419 U.S. at 285, 95 S.Ct. at 442 (quoting <em>Burlington Truck Lines v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 156, 168, 83 S.Ct. 239, 246, 9 L.Ed.2d 207 (1962)). Moreover, in assessing the rationality of an agency decision, the court must give appropriate deference to the wisdom of agency officials in deciding issues within their area of expertise. <em>See McHenry, </em>668 F.2d at 1190; <em>Watkins Motor Lines, Inc. v. I.C.C., </em>641 F.2d 1183 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-11\">The Deputy Assistant Secretary concluded that undue hardship would result if the principal benefit regulation were not waived. We find his decision wholly rational and supported by substantial evidence in the record. If the project is defeated by rigid application of the regulation, the citizens of Bacon County and the surrounding area, many of whom are intended beneficiaries of the block grant program, could lose the benefits of a development program that was conceived years before promulgation of the regulation, implemented to a significant extent to date, and in large part dependent upon the completion of its final \u201ccornerstone,\u201d Lake Alma. Considerable federal funds, expended or allocated, would be wasted as well. In addition, the program is related to the plight of low- and moderate-income persons. Statistical evidence indicates that a substantial minority, if not a numerical majority, of the users of Lake Alma will be lower income individuals. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>Given these circumstances, a finding of undue hardship was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">B. <em>Adverse Effect on Purpose of the Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">In order to waive the principal benefit provision, the Secretary of HUD must also make a finding that application of the standard would adversely affect the purposes of the Act. 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 570.4. In concluding that it would, the Deputy Assistant Secretary determined that enforcement of the regulation would frustrate two purposes of the Act: (1) encouraging community development activities which are consistent with comprehensive local and area-wide planning and (2) fostering the undertaking of community development activities in a coordinated and mutually supportive manner by federal agencies and programs, as well as by communities. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5301(d)(2), (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">Appellants do not dispute that these two purposes of the Act will be adversely affected by application of the principal benefit standard. They maintain, however, that these are only subsidiary purposes of the block grant statute and that the primary purpose of principally benefiting low- and moderate-income persons will be adversely affected if the regulation is waived. Taking HUD\u2019s position to its logical extreme, appellants contend, the agency could provide funding for a project completely outside its area of concern and without regard to the statute\u2019s purpose<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> by waiving its regulatory requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">Appellants\u2019 argument, simply stated, is that HUD abused its discretion when it waived application of a provision that transforms a statutory purpose, in this case the purpose of principally benefiting low- and moderate-income persons, into a regulatory requirement. Our adoption of this position, however, would in effect nullify our holding that the principal benefit requirement is not statutorily mandated but is only regulatory and therefore waivable. To accept appellants\u2019 argument would mean that by adopting a presumably waivable regulation parroting the stated legislative purpose, HUD would have inadvertently elevated that statutory purpose to the level of an express, mandatory statutory requirement. In essence, HUD would be precluded from waiving any regulation that furthers the primary purpose of the Act, because waiving application of the regulation would be contrary to legislative intent. Such a rule would deprive HUD\u2019s waiver authority under 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 570.4 of all practical significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-11\">The issue under \u00a7 570.4 is not whether waiving the principal benefit standard will itself further the purposes of the statute. Rather, the question is whether given the circumstances presented to the Secretary, \u201capplication of the requirement would adversely affect the purposes of the Act.\u201d 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 570.4. Here, application of the principal benefit requirement would adversely affect two of the stated purposes enumerated in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5301(d). Moreover, if the regulation is enforced and Lake Alma is not completed, the primary purpose of the statute will also be adversely affected: even if the primary objective of the Act will not be absolutely met by the project, that objective will be furthered significantly by construction of the lake. Precluding HUD funding for the lake would adversely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>affect that purpose by eliminating the recreational and economic benefits of the lake to the near-majority low- and moderate-income persons living in the service area. In sum, there is sufficient support for the Deputy Assistant Secretary\u2019s conclusion that application of the principal benefit regulation would adversely affect the purposes of the Act. Finding his decision rational and supported by the evidence, we affirm the district court\u2019s holding that HUD\u2019s waiver of the regulation was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See McHenry </em>v. <em>Bond, </em>668 F.2d 1185 (11th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">IV. <em>Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">Appellants contend that adoption of the Mitigation Plan is a significant change requiring that an SEIS be prepared. The district court concluded that release of the funds by HUD and issuance of the \u00a7 404 permit by the Corps was proper because a conclusion by the Alma officials, who had assumed the position of the responsible federal officials under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5304(h), that no SEIS was required, was \u201creasonable.\u201d We disagree, and reverse and remand on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">In <em>Environmental Defense Fund v. Marsh, </em>651 F.2d 983, 992 (5th Cir. Unit A 1981),<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the court noted that \u201cthe legal standard of the need for a supplemental EIS ... is whether the post-[original EIS] changes in the [project] will have a \u2018significant\u2019 impact on the environment that has not previously been covered by the [original] EIS.\u201d If a \u201csignificant\u201d impact on the environment will result, either \u201cin qualitative or quantitative terms,\u201d from subsequent project changes, an SEIS is required. <em>Id. </em>at 991.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">In reviewing an agency decision on the necessity for an SEIS, \u201cthe reviewing court should uphold the agency\u2019s decision only if it is reasonable, rather than use the deferential \u2018substantial evidence\u2019 standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 992 (citing <em>Hiram Clarke Civic Club, Inc. v. Lynn, </em>476 F.2d 421, 424-25 (5th Cir.1973); <em>Save Our Ten Acres v. Kre-ger, </em>472 F.2d 463, 466-67 (5th Cir.1973)). The district court concluded that the decision of the Alma officials not to submit an SEIS covering the Mitigation Plan was \u201creasonable\u201d because \u201cthe change is insignificant quantitatively and <em>non-existent </em>qualitatively.\u201d <em>National Wildlife Federation v. Marsh, </em>CV No. 582-98 at 35 (S.D.Ga. Mar. 3, 1983) (emphasis added). At least the second half of this conclusion is clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-11\">The Alma officials, in conveying to HUD their opinion that no SEIS was required, relied on the concurrence among all relevant governmental agencies that \u201cno substantial <em>adverse </em>effect to the environment would result from ... construction [of the GTRs] in conjunction with Lake Alma.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> They also relied on a letter by the EPA Administrator agreeing with the Corps that the waters to be released for the GTRs \u201care not expected to <em>adversely </em>affect its water quality.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Neither of these agencies nor the Alma officials focused on the degree of mitigation, the beneficial impact, of the Mitigation Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-12\">In <em>EDF v. Marsh, </em>the court reversed the district court\u2019s conclusion that the agency decision not to supplement an EIS was reasonable. The court made clear that even if post-EIS changes in a project are <em>beneficial </em>to the environment or are intended to mitigate environmental impact, if those changes are significant, a supplemental statement is required:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-13\">The proper question is not the intent behind the actions, but the significance of the environmental impacts. And even if the Corps was correct in deciding that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>new land use will be beneficial in impact, a beneficial impact must nevertheless be discussed in an EIS, so long as it is significant. NEPA is concerned with all significant environmental effects, not merely adverse ones.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">651 F.2d at 993. The court also emphasized that the district court erred in assessing the significance only of the increased acreage needed for the mitigation project because where \u201cthe new land would be <em>used </em>in a way that had significant effects on the environment, which obviously could not have been addressed in the [original] EIS,\u201d an SEIS is required. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">The lower court in this case relied on a portion of the <em>EDF v. Marsh </em>opinion in which the court concluded that one of the several post-EIS changes did not require an SEIS. This reliance was misplaced. The change deemed insignificant in that case involved a 9 million cubic yard increase in the amount of spoil excavated from a 260 million cubic yard excavation plan. Plaintiffs had offered no proof of a qualitatively significant impact, and the quantitative effect, a 3.5 percent increase in spoil removal, was considered insignificant.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Here, however, appellants have shown that the Mitigation Plan involves a number of proposed project changes that are likely to have a significant, though beneficial, impact on the environment in and around the proposed lake.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">The Mitigation Plan proposes the construction of 194 acres of GTRs, which represent not only an increase in the quantity of land affected, but also a change in the character of the land itself. The GTRs would involve annual flooding, selective clearing, creation of five percent permanent water, development of small islands, planting grasses or sedges, and erecting wood duck boxes. Moreover, in addition to the six GTRs, the plan establishes a program for intense wildlife management throughout the entire project area. The wildlife management plan includes: selective clearing of 466 acres of wooded swamp; creation of small pools of standing water; planting of oak trees; development of an emergency access road; construction of firebreaks and prescribed burning to manage sand ridge areas; selective thinning and burning of planted and natural pine areas; and staged disking, seeding and mowing of old fields, pastures and rights-of-way. The GTRs and wildlife management plan are therefore easily distinguishable from the increase in excavated spoil in <em>EDF v. Marsh. </em>Here the plan envisions a change in the types of activities to be undertaken on the land, not merely an incremental increase in an activity that was fully evaluated in a previous EIS.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-10\">Until proposal of the Mitigation Plan by FWS, all interested federal agencies had opposed the project on environmental grounds. The \u00a7 404 permit was approved by the Corps only on the condition that the plan be implemented.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> FWS approved the project conditioned on acceptance of the plan, and EPA withdrew its objections only after adoption of the plan and after con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>eluding that the plan itself would not have adverse effects on water quality.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">Given the plan\u2019s detailed proposals for mitigating any adverse environmental effects resulting from the creation of Lake Alma, as well as the role of the plan in allaying the environmental concerns of all relevant federal agencies, we conclude that the Mitigation Plan will have a significant qualitative environmental impact.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The conclusion of Alma officials to the contrary is not reasonable and the district court\u2019s approval of that conclusion is clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">V. <em>\u00a7 404 Permits for the Green Tree Reservoirs</em></p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">Appellants argue finally that the Corps acted improperly in issuing the \u00a7 404 permit for Lake Alma without first requiring application for \u00a7 404 permits required for the construction of the GTRs. The \u00a7 404 permit granted for Lake Alma expressly is conditioned on construction of six GTRs. These GTRs will require their own dams, which, appellants argue, will require individual \u00a7 404 permits. Appellants contend, therefore, that Lake Alma cannot lawfully be constructed unless the permits for the GTRs are first applied for and issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">The district court found appellants\u2019 argument logically appealing but held that appellants had the burden of proving that the GTRs will require separate permits. Since the precise location of the GTRs is not yet definite, the court concluded that appellants had failed to meet this burden, and therefore issuance of the Lake Alma permit prior to consideration of the need for GTR permits was not arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">Issuance of a permit before engaging in a determination of the need for the GTR permits would allow Lake Alma to be- constructed even though at a later date it is determined that additional \u00a7 404 permits are needed and cannot be obtained. Lake Alma, the environmental soundness of which is conditioned on construction of the GTRs, would thus be constructed without the GTRs. For the Corps to act in the face of this open question was a clear error of judgment and thus an abuse of discretion. <em>See Citizens to Protect Overton Park v. Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 416, 91 S.Ct. 814, 824, 28 L.Ed.2d 186 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-12\">While appellants have the burden of demonstrating an abuse of discretion or arbitrary agency action, this burden is met by showing that there is a substantial issue as to whether or not permits will be required for the GTRs. The district court erred in placing on the appellants the burden of conclusively closing the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-13\">The Corps\u2019 internal procedures require:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"a5s-dedup-0\">All activities which are reasonably related to the same project and for which a Department of the Army permit would be required should be included in the same permit application. The District Engineer should reject, as incomplete, any permit application which fails to comply with this requirement. For example, permit application for a marina shall include dredging required for access as well as any fill associated with construction of the marina.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b854-14\">March 1, 1979, DAEN-CWO-N Directive on Permit Procedures. The parties do not dispute that the GTRs are \u201creasonably related\u201d to the overall project. The only no-narbitrary reason for not requiring contemporaneous application for the GTR permits would be a conclusive demonstration at this juncture that the permits were <em>not </em>necessary. Such a showing has not been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>At best, there is a <em>possibility </em>that all of the GTRs could be covered by a nationwide permit, making application for individual permits unnecessary. The district court did not hold to the contrary. The Decision Memorandum of the Corps, recommending issuance of the Lake Alma \u00a7 404 permit, indicates that a site inspection was undertaken to determine whether \u201cthe green tree reservoirs included in the Mitigation Plan would require a public notice with opportunity for public hearing and would require a 401 [sic] water quality certification.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-4\">The site inspection revealed that, of the tentative green tree reservoir locations, one (area A-l) was covered by a nationwide permit, that four <em>could probably </em>be constructed so as to be covered by a nationwide permit, and that one <em>would require </em>an individual permit. Furthermore, the Corps believes that the green tree reservoir acreage required by the Mitigation Plan <em>could be </em>satisfied by green tree reservoirs constructed under a nationwide permit by relocating the one reservoir which would now require an individual permit. <em>The Corps would also require the permitee to apply for any permits that may be required to construct any of the green tree reservoirs.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">Aug. 29, 1980, Decision Memorandum for the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil Works), page 3 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">The final word from the Corps, a November 10, 1981, letter from the Corps District Engineer, accompanying the issuance of the draft permit, states: \u201cBased on their final location, construction of the green tree reservoirs <em>may require </em>additional Department of Army permits.\u201d If, as suggested, any permit applications are required, the Corps\u2019 procedures for consolidated permit application, including public comment, must be followed before the Lake Alma permit, which is conditioned on construction of the GTRs, is issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-11\">Appellees argue, however, that the Corps has developed a policy of imposing mitigation plans, and determining whether permits are necessary therefor, as conditions <em>subsequent </em>to issuance of . permits for the entire project. As evidence of this policy, they refer to a statement of the Corps\u2019 internal procedures which authorizes a district engineer to condition the issuance of a permit on the implementation of a proposed mitigation plan.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Appellants argue that we are prohibited under <em>Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. National Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>435 U.S. 519, 543-44, 98 S.Ct. 1197, 1211, 55 L.Ed.2d 460 (1978),<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> from interfering with this \u201cestablished\u201d procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-12\">Neither the record nor the findings of the district court support appellees\u2019 interpretation of Corps policy. On the contrary, this case presents a unique situation. As stated by the Deputy Assistant Administrator for Water Planning Standards of the EPA in July of 1979:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-13\">To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case to come to the attention of this office in which a proposed mitigation feature of a project itself would require a Section 404 analysis. We wanted to alert you to this problem at this time, early in the process, in the interest of avoiding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>unnecessary delays in the further processing of this important case.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ATiS\">Given the indication that this is the first case of its kind and the absence of any support in the record for the notion that the Corps has developed a consistent condition subsequent procedure, we reject appellees\u2019 argument. As quoted <em>supra, </em>the Corps\u2019 usual procedure is to require all related permit applications to be submitted together. Although the Corps does have a procedure for conditioning permits on implementation of a mitigation plan, the memorandum describing that procedure does not purport to modify the general policy pertaining to permits for related activities. It does not discuss the procedure for review of permits that may be necessary for the mitigation plan itself. It certainly does not state that the necessary mitigation plan permits could be obtained at a date after approval of the initial permit. Such a policy would be directly contrary to the usual procedure' of requiring contemporaneous permit application of all related project activities. In the absence of a stated policy to the contrary, the Corps\u2019 normal procedure should be followed. This may be an unusual case, but that is no reason to abandon the well-settled internal Corps\u2019 policy of consolidated permit application.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">The applicable procedure established by the Corps within the meaning of <em>Vermont Yankee </em>is one of contemporaneous application for all required permits. We impose no additional procedural requirement here. Because the locations of the GTRs have not been determined, the district court concluded prematurely that no \u00a7 404 permits would be necessary. If the GTRs will not be covered by a nationwide permit, Corps procedure requires it to review and approve individual permit applications before issuance of the overall project permit.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Statements by the Corps itself indicate a substantial likelihood that appellants will prevail in establishing a need for additional \u00a7 404 permits. The district court erred in deciding otherwise in the face of this open question. We therefore remand to enable the district court to decide, once the GTR locations are determined, whether additional permits are necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">VI. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b856-9\">The district court erred in concluding that appellants had shown no likelihood of success on the merits. Appellants have made a sufficient showing on the need for an SEIS and the impropriety of issuing the \u00a7 404 permit prior to a determination of the need for additional permits for the GTRs.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-10\">Appellants also have carried their burden as to the other requirements for preliminary injunctive relief. Irreparable injury is readily apparent. Absent injunctive relief, the funds in question will be expended, the wetlands will be destroyed, and those appellants who are landowners will lose their land. Issuance of the injunction may cause monetary injury to the appellees. Failure to grant the injunction, however, will cause irreparable injury to the appellants which outweighs the threatened harm to the ap-pellees. Issuance of the injunction will serve the public interest, given the substantial issues involved both as to the proper use of federal funds and protection of the environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-11\">Hence, the preliminary injunction is granted and this matter is remanded to the district court for further proceedings.

With the advent of general revenue sharing ... there is no reason to create another fund transfer program which simply provides localities with more federal money to use virtually as they see fit. In addition, the benefits and injuries caused by any community development program can accrue to citizens of widely varying income levels depending on the specific program. That quality makes community development funds all the more susceptible to questionable use if no specific directives for use are given. Furthermore, the essence of any community development program \u2014 housing and physical development and redevelopment\u2014 probably deals more fundamentally with the problems of economic and racial integration, which have proved so difficult for localities to tackle even with strong federal directives, than any other federal program. Because of such problems, I feel that community development is one of the least suitable types of programs areas [sic] for a totally \u201chands off\u2019 revenue sharing approach. Accordingly, I consider strong federal directives for the program not to constitute support of bureaucrats \u201csecond-guessing,\u201d but rather to be a necessity for fulfillment of the federal responsibility to the taxpayers to promote the use of their money in as productive a manner as possible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-13\">I consider the need for such a directive to be fulfilled adequately by the requirement that unless HUD grants an exception, at least 80% of a community\u2019s funds must be expended for activities intended to be of direct and significant benefit to blighted or deteriorating areas or to families with low and moderate incomes. <em>This provision affects the very heartbeat of the bill </em>because it requires most funds to be spent for what have always been considered to be the most important purposes of federally supported community development program, assuming that \u201cdirect and significant\u201d is interpreted in a sensibly broad manner. In view of HUD\u2019s authority to interpret the broad requirement and to make exceptions, I believe that any administrative burden caused will be outweighed by a greater understanding of and commitment to these purposes at both the federal and the local levels.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b845-14\">Additional Views of Mr. Taft, 1974 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 4439 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b847-6\">.

We note that even if HUD waived its principal benefit regulation, such a project could not be funded unless it satisfied the statutory maximum feasible priority requirement. Moreover, waiver of the regulation for a project so clearly unrelated to the interests of low- and moderate-income individuals would be contrary to legislative intent and would likely be an abuse of agency discretion. One of the facts relied upon by the Deputy Assistant Secretary in support of the waiver was that the project would very nearly satisfy the principal benefit standard by directly benefiting a large percentage of the lower income population. Even though Lake Alma does not satisfy a fifty-percent benefit threshold, its construction will significantly further the systemic goal of the statute by providing substantial benefit to individuals in the low- and moderate-income community. A luxury condominium, which would provide only speculative, indirect benefits to the surrounding community, would not further the purpose of the statute to any significant extent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b852-8\">.

Because we conclude that the Mitigation Plan constitutes a significant qualitative impact on the environment, we need not decide whether its quantitative effect is also significant. Abstract numerical comparisons are frequently misleading and inconclusive, as this case illustrates. The GTRs would affect about 194 acres of the 1400 proposed for the entire project, an impact on approximately 14% of the total project land. Compared with the 3.5% increase in land affected by the change found insignificant in <em>EDF v. Marsh, </em>651 F.2d at 996 n. 15, this change might be considered a significant quantitative impact. Using <em>volume </em>of water affected rather than acres of land, however, the figures show that the Mitigation Plan will affect only an additional 3.6% of inland water, an arguably insignificant increase. It is not immediately apparent which figure would be more relevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b853-12\">.

HUD\u2019s interpretation of this statute is not entitled to deference because it is clearly contrary to the purpose of the statute. In fact, there is no support in the legislative history of the statute for a project such as this one. HUD\u2019s interpretation of this statute would permit funding of a luxury condominium as long as it benefits low-and moderate-income persons to the maximum extent feasible. Conceivably, under this interpretation the luxury condominium that would enhance the skyline for the low-and moderate-income persons would be the benefit \u201cto the maximum extent feasible.\u201d Appellants on the other hand assert that to be funded a project must <em>at a minimum </em>principally benefit low-and moderate-income families. Apparently, this requirement was not expressed as a requirement because the drafters of the statute did not think it was necessary \u2014 it was stated as the \u201cprimary objective\u201d of the statute.
