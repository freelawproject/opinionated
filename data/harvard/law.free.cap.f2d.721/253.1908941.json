Deere sought to enjoin Farmhand from selling certain front-end loaders that Farmhand had copied from Deere and had painted \u201cJohn Deere green.\u201d Farmhand counterclaimed for damages and attorneys\u2019 fees under the antitrust laws. After a non-jury trial, the district court, the Honorable Donald E. O\u2019Brien, found in favor of Farmhand on the allegations of Deere\u2019s complaint and in favor of Deere on the allegations of Farmhand\u2019s counterclaim. Deere has appealed and Farmhand has cross-appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-22\">We have carefully studied the record, including the trial court\u2019s opinion, the briefs and the arguments of the parties to this action. We find no merit to the arguments for reversal of the decision below in any respect, and accordingly affirm pursuant to Rule 14 of the rules of this court on the basis of Judge O\u2019Brien\u2019s opinion. <em>Deere &amp; Company v. Farmhand, Inc., </em>560 F.Supp. 85 (S.D.Iowa 1982).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
