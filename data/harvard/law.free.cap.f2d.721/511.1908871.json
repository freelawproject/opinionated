Cherry, </em>718 F.2d 682, 690 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-25\">We invited the parties to agree to a joint statement of facts and proposed certificate of questions. <em>Id. </em>at 690. <em>See State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. v. Daughdrill, </em>695 F.2d 141, 143 (5th Cir.1983). In response to our invitation, the parties filed the following joint state of facts and proposed question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-26\">It is hereby stipulated and agreed by and between the parties hereto, for the purposes of the question to be certified to the Supreme Court of Louisiana, that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-27\">I.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-28\">The record in this case establishes that the State of Louisiana, under its Medical Assistance Plan-Medicaid, makes reimbursement to ophthalmologists for services which are within the scope of practice of optometrists, but does not make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>reimbursement to optometrists for performing those services to Medical eligible persons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-4\">2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-5\">The question to be certified to the Supreme Court of the State of Louisiana should read:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-6\">Do the state employees and officials charged with adoption of the Louisiana Medical Assistance Plan, the Medical Assistance Program Manual, Providers\u2019 Manual and practices and procedures thereunder have discretion under R.S. 37:1066 and R.S. 49:185 to provide therein for provision of all eye care services to Medicaid eligible persons by ophthalmologists and other medical doctors to the exclusion of optometrists, except for routine eye examinations for eligible recipients under the age of 21 in the Early Periodic, Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment program and refractions following cataract surgery for eligible recipients?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">Adopting the parties\u2019 statement and proposed question for certification to the Louisiana Supreme Court, we amend our original opinion to reflect this change. The Louisiana Supreme Court, of course, will not be bound by this articulation of the question in its consideration of the issues involved. <em>Martinez v.
