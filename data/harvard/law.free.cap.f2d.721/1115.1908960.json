Williams retained as his trial counsel one Thomas C. Hughes, Jr. (hereinafter \u201ctrial counsel\u201d). This case arises from Hughes\u2019 representation of Williams at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-19\">a). <em>The Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1186-20\">On May 17,1979, Judge Skillman issued a comprehensive pretrial discovery order giving the State 10 days and trial counsel 20 days for discovery. Trial, originally slated for June 11, 1979, did not begin until June 13, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-21\">Before jury selection began on the morning of trial, the trial court ruled on several preliminary matters. Trial counsel initially moved to strike Count 3 of the complaint (alleging felony theft) on the grounds that it was identical to Count 2 (alleging defendant\u2019s receipt of stolen property). The State\u2019s Attorney indicated that he had earlier amended the complaint to make Count 3 a lesser included offense of Count 2. Trial counsel admitted that he had received a copy of the amended complaint but had not read it. When the court denied trial counsel\u2019s motion, trial counsel attempted to lodge an \u201coral notice of appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-22\">That same morning, the State\u2019s Attorney moved the trial court for an order requiring trial counsel to either make defense wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1117\">*1117</page-number>nesses available to the State for interviews during lunch break that day, or to provide the State with written summaries of each witness\u2019 testimony. Despite the court\u2019s comprehensive discovery order of May 17, trial counsel had failed to provide the State with a list of witnesses until the morning of trial, even though the State had fully complied with the court\u2019s discovery order. Trial counsel offered a variety of excuses for his failure to comply with the court\u2019s May 17 discovery order, first stating that he had not expected the case to be tried so soon,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and then arguing that he had diligently attempted to comply. The court found that trial counsel had not diligently complied with its discovery order and granted the State\u2019s motion requiring trial counsel to make his witnesses available for interview or to provide written summaries of their testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-5\">Later that morning, following jury selection, trial counsel presented the court with a handwritten notice of appeal from the trial court\u2019s earlier rulings. The court rejected the notice of appeal on the ground that its orders were interlocutory, not final.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1187-6\">Following a short recess, the jury was reconvened and trial commenced. Trial counsel\u2019s lack of familiarity with Illinois trial procedure as well as his lack of preparation for his client\u2019s trial soon became obvious. For example, the State, as part of its case-in-chief, referred one of its witnesses to an odometer mileage statement for the stolen pickup truck. Trial counsel moved to strike the exhibit even though it had not yet been marked, identified or admitted. Trial counsel argued that he had not been permitted to review the odomet\u00e9r mileage statement. Upon inquiry by the court, it became obvious that trial counsel had never seriously attempted to get a copy of the statement. The trial court refused to strike the exhibit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-15\">Other errors permeated trial counsel\u2019s performance. He showed an unfamiliarity with direct and cross-examination. He had difficulty in responding to simple objections, even to the point where trial counsel abandoned certain lines of examination. Trial counsel failed to move for a directed verdict when the State rested its case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-16\">On the second day of trial, the State opened by presenting the court with a copy of its supplemental discovery (summaries of the State\u2019s expected rebuttal testimony). Trial counsel objected, contending he had not received a copy of it. The record provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1188-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1118\">*1118</page-number>Mr. Hughes [trial counsel]: Your honor, I didn\u2019t receive a copy of this [the Supplemental Discovery] yesterday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1188-4\">The Court: You didn\u2019t receive a copy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8c\">Mr. Hughes: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1188-5\">Mr. Ford [State\u2019s Attorney]: Your honor, I was standing outside the court room and I gave it to him. He asked me what it was. I told him what it was. He said he didn\u2019t want it, to give it to him tomorrow morning. I said I\u2019m giving it to him now. My secretary is going to file an affidavit. I told him he could do with it what he wanted to do, and he walked and put it on the steps of the court house, and I walked away.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1188-6\">The Court: O.K. What about that Mr. Hughes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1188-7\">Mr. Hughes: Mr. Ford was giving me a copy as we were leaving, and I said, \u2018If it\u2019s in regard to this case give it to me in court. If it\u2019s regarding this case I want you to hand it to me in court. You know.\u2019 <em>We were done for the day. </em>That\u2019s all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1188-8\">The Court: Well, then, apparently what Mr. Ford is stating now is an accurate statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1188-9\">Mr. Hughes: I said, \u2018 <em>We are done for the day here. </em>I mean give it to me in court.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"asy-dedup-1\">(emphasis supplied). Trial counsel then changed his objection and argued that, since the State had rested, it was barred from presenting any more testimony. The court explained to trial counsel the role of rebuttal testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-10\">The jury was brought back in. Trial counsel then indicated that he wanted \u201cto make a statement.\u201d After the jury was sent out, trial counsel moved for a mistrial on the grounds that the court\u2019s \u201clanguage tone\u201d towards him was very prejudicial. The court denied trial counsel\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-11\">Trial counsel then moved for a mistrial on the grounds that he was required to withdraw from the case because of a conflict of interest, but he was unable to elaborate for the court what constituted this conflict of interest. Trial counsel then moved for a mistrial because his client, Williams, would not follow his advice. The court denied trial counsel\u2019s motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-15\">The jury was once again reconvened but before proceedings could begin, Williams spoke out and stated that his attorney was incompetent. After the jury was sent out, trial counsel moved for his own withdrawal, and for a mistrial because of Williams\u2019 statement. Williams told the court that he supported trial counsel\u2019s motion for withdrawal because he believed that trial counsel was incompetent, and that the trial court was prejudiced against trial counsel. The court denied both motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-16\">Trial recommenced. Trial counsel called his remaining witnesses and also recalled the State\u2019s main witness as an adverse witness. Trial counsel attempted to lead the adverse witness and the State objected. The State\u2019s objections were sustained when trial counsel failed to argue that the adverse witness was hostile.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-17\">Williams never took the stand on his own behalf during the course of the trial, allegedly because of trial counsel\u2019s advice that he would be impeached by several previous convictions which, at the time of trial, were more than 15 years old. Trial counsel failed to submit any jury instructions. After closing arguments, the jury found Williams guilty on both counts. Williams was sentenced to 30 months probation, with alternate weekends in jail for 18 months and payment of a $10,000 fine and $1,200 restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-18\">b). <em>Post-trial Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1188-19\">Williams then retained new counsel and argued in a post-trial motion that he had been denied effective assistance of counsel in violation of the Sixth Amendment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial court denied the motion, finding that while trial counsel\u2019s performance was substandard, it was not so poor as to amount to no representation at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1119\">*1119</page-number>Williams then appealed to the Illinois Appellate Court. The appellate court acknowledged that trial counsel\u2019s performance was substandard, and even noted 6 instances of ineptness which could not be defended.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nonetheless, the appellate court, applying a \u201cfarce or sham\u201d standard, held that Williams\u2019 constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel had not been denied. Williams then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus which was denied for failure to exhaust state remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-5\">Williams filed a petition for post-conviction relief in the trial court. After an evidentiary hearing at which four witnesses, including Williams, testified, the trial court reiterated its view that Williams receive adequate, albeit substandard,. assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-6\">Williams then filed the present petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The district court properly found that it was required to evaluate trial counsel\u2019s performance under the standard of whether trial counsel\u2019s representation of Williams met a \u201cminimum standard of professional representation.\u201d <em>United States ex rel. Williams v. Twomey, </em>510 F.2d 634, 641 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 876, 96 S.Ct. 148, 46 L.Ed.2d 109 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-7\">However, the district court erroneously determined that the state court\u2019s findings of attorney competency were factual determinations entitled to a presumption of correctness under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> When Williams failed to establish that the state court\u2019s findings were not entitled to the statutory presumption of correctness, the district court accepted the state court\u2019s findings on the issue of attorney competency and denied Williams\u2019 petition. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-13\">Both sides agree that in light of this Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>United States ex rel. Cosey v. Wolff, </em>682 F.2d 691 (7th Cir.1982), the district court erred in deferring to the state court\u2019s finding of attorney competency. In <em>Cosey, </em>this Court noted that \u201c[W]here the issue is lack of effective assistance of counsel, a mixed question of fact and law is presented.\u201d <em>Cosey, supra </em>at 693. \u201cA legal determination or a mixed determination of law and fact is open to review upon collateral attack in federal court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As such, the state court determination of attorney competency was not entitled to a presumption of correctness under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). <em>See Cuyler v. Sullivan, </em>446 U.S. 335, 341-42, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 1714-15, 64 L.Ed.2d 333 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-14\">Petitioner Williams requests this Court to find as a matter of law that he was denied effective assistance of counsel, and remand to the district court with directions to vacate his conviction. The State argues that this Court should affirm the district court despite its failure to make an independent determination of attorney competency because the record clearly demonstrates that Williams was not prejudiced by the \u201calleged incompetence\u201d of his attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-15\">The standard of attorney competency which counsel must meet in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1120\">*1120</page-number>protect a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel is set forth in <em>United States ex rel. Williams v. Twomey:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1190-4\">... While a criminal trial is not a game in which the participants are expected to enter the ring with a near match in skills, neither is it a sacrifice of unarmed prisoners to gladiators. The criminal defendant, whether represented by his chosen counsel, or a public agency, or a court-appointed lawyer, has the constitutional right to an advocate whose performance meets a minimum professional standard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKEz\">510 F.2d at 640. While \u201cthe mere fact that a lawyer makes errors in the course of a trial does not demonstrate failure to meet minimum professional standards .... representation permeated by serious and inexplicable errors falls below minimum standards.\u201d <em>Wade v. Franzen, </em>678 F.2d 56, 58 (7th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-5\">This Court has carefully scrutinized the trial record and now holds that trial counsel\u2019s representation of Williams failed to meet the minimum professional standards required by this Circuit. The trial record is replete with instances which reflect not only trial counsel\u2019s lack of familiarity with Illinois trial procedure but also which indicate trial counsel\u2019s lack of diligence in preparing his client\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-6\">Trial counsel\u2019s unfamiliarity with trial procedure permeated every stage of the trial. He attempted to lodge oral notices of appeal from interlocutory orders, demonstrated an unfamiliarity with direct and cross-examination, was unable to respond to objections made by opposing counsel, attempted to make a statement before the jury, was unaware that the State could present rebuttal evidence, and allegedly admonished his client not to take the stand lest he be impeached by long outdated convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-7\">Trial counsel also failed to diligently prepare his client\u2019s case. Despite a discovery order issued well in advance of trial, trial counsel did not provide the State with a list of witnesses until the morning of trial. Trial counsel failed to examine the odometer mileage statement which he knew the State intended to use at trial. For some inexplicable reason, trial counsel refused to accept and review the State\u2019s supplemental discovery. Trial counsel failed to read the State\u2019s amended complaint prior to trial, although he conceded he received it. In summary, the record reflects that the entire trial was permeated by serious and inexcusable errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-9\">The State contends, however, that a habeas petitioner who wishes to prevail on a theory of ineffective assistance of counsel must demonstrate prejudice. <em>See Hawkman v. Parratt, </em>661 F.2d 1161, 1165 (8th Cir.1981). In essence, the state argues that even if Williams received inadequate assistance of counsel, at best, it constitutes harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-10\">This Court need not address whether a harmless error approach is appropriate in this case since we find that Williams was clearly prejudiced by trial counsel\u2019s incompetency. Defense witnesses failed to testify because trial counsel delayed in providing the state with a list of defense witnesses. Trial counsel abandoned lines of examination because of his ineptness. In the context of a largely circumstantial State case, trial counsel\u2019s incompetency precluded Williams from effectively presenting his case to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-11\">In <em>Cosey </em>and <em>Wade, </em>this Court suggested that \u201c[WJhere the issue is lack of effective assistance of counsel .... [t]he targeted counsel, if at all available, should be called and given the opportunity to meet and refute the serious charges made against him.\u201d <em>Cosey, supra </em>at 693; Wade <em>v. Franzen, </em>678 F.2d at 58. In both <em>Cosey </em>and Wade, however, factual inferences remained which precluded this Court from determining the issue of attorney competency as a matter of law. Here, by comparison, the fully developed record on appeal demonstrates attorney incompetency. No possible trial strategy can justify the blunders made. Every court which has considered this trial counsel\u2019s performance has found it seriously deficient, and in many instances, indefensible. We hold, as a matter of law, that Williams <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1121\">*1121</page-number>was denied effective assistance of counsel in violation of the Sixth Amendment. Judgment will be entered granting the writ of habeas corpus but staying execution of the writ on condition that the State of Illinois grant petitioner a new trial on the charges resulting in his conviction within a reasonable time not to exceed ninety days, and diligently and without delay prosecute the charges to final conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-4\">Reversed And Remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1187-7\">. The trial record clearly indicates that trial counsel knew the case would be tried on June 11:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1187-8\">Mr. Hughes [trial counsel]: Your honor, I just received the names of the witnesses yesterday. Yesterday. And I spoke with the witnesses yesterday afternoon. I informed Mr. Ford this morning that I had a list of witnesses.

Why not? This case was set for trial and I don\u2019t know why it is that the day before trial you would furnish the names of witnesses, but whatever source it was from which you obtained the names of witnesses, it occurs to me that maybe you could have asked two weeks ago, or three weeks ago.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1187-12\">Mr. Hughes: Yes, your honor. I did not receive actual notice that the trial would be had until I received a phone call from yourself Monday afternoon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1187-13\">The Court: Mr. Hughes, what did you think the orders meant back on May 17 and \u2014 or, rather, May 21 and May 25 and June 1, when Judge Jensen, three times, said this case is going to be tried June 11? What did that mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1187-18\">Mr. Hughes: That meant to be ready and prepared on June 11.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1187-19\">The Court: Well, I don\u2019t understand what you are telling me when you say you didn\u2019t have any idea this case was going to trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1187-20\">(R.
