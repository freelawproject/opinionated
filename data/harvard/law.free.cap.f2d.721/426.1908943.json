Ann. \u00a7 5103(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-15\">Plaintiff-appellee Donna Lee McLaughlin filed a complaint in federal court characterized as a \u201cclaim in Assumpsit\u201d alleging that 'she is a \u201cresident\u201d of Pennsylvania; that she was hired as an Occupational Health Nurse in October 1974 by defendant ARCO Polymers, Inc., a division of the Atlantic Richfield Company, for its Beaver Valley Plant which produces polystyrene plastics; that in that capacity she was the \u201cprincipal site source of medical attention for approximately 1,200 employees\u201d; that she became aware that the plant\u2019s employees had hematological abnormalities; that shortly thereafter a complaint was filed with the Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) which resulted in the issuance of a citation to defendant; that defendant\u2019s officers and agents \u201cblamed\u201d her for the OSHA inquiry \u201cand the employee concern for test results\u201d; and that she was dismissed in 1978 as a result. The complaint also alleges, \u201cAt the time plaintiff was dismissed no male employee [in related positions] was either subject to employer criticism or dismissal.\u201d The complaint then alleges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-17\">The aforesaid conduct of Defendant\u2019s was violative of public policy by wrongfully discharging Plaintiff and/or otherwise discriminating against her in retaliation against her with respect to the terms, conditions and privileges of her employment because of her involvement with the Occupational Safety and Health Act investigation and/or violative of public policy by discharging the Plaintiff and otherwise discriminating against her with respect to the terms, conditions and privileges of her employment because of her sex.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-18\">The complaint identifies jurisdiction as founded only on diversity of citizenship and an amount in controversy, exclusive of interest and costs, exceeding $10,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-19\">ARCO moved to dismiss the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the ground there was no diversity of citizenship between the parties. It attached affidavits showing that both defendants Atlantic Richfield Company and ARCO Polymers, Inc. (before its merger into Atlantic Rich-field) were incorporated in Pennsylvania. In response, plaintiff filed a \u201cMotion to Transfer Claim in Lieu of Answer to Motion to Dismiss\u201d which averred that \u201cThe Plaintiff herein has stated a cause of action cognizable under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, to wit, an unlawful dismissal from employment\u201d; admitted that \u201call parties reside in Pennsylvania\u201d; and requested in lieu of a dismissal \u201ca transfer of the state claim\u201d to the Court of Common Pleas, Beaver County, Pennsylvania. Plaintiff also filed an answer to the motion to dismiss, with affidavits, stating that the Atlantic Richfield Company, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>though incorporated in Pennsylvania, maintains its principal office in Los Angeles.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">After a hearing and argument on Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss and Plaintiff\u2019s Motion to Transfer, the district court found there was no diversity of citizenship since plaintiff is a citizen of Pennsylvania and defendants are incorporated in Pennsylvania. Although there was no other basis for federal jurisdiction alleged in the complaint, the district court also found that it lacked jurisdiction over \u201cclaims pertaining to sex discrimination\u201d and \u201ca complaint of retaliatory discharge\u201d resulting from a filing of an OSHA complaint. The district court concluded it had no basis for exercising jurisdiction, \u201calthough Plaintiff may have state law causes of action.\u201d The district court stated that the case was erroneously filed in the Western District of Pennsylvania, and thereupon ordered it transferred to the Court of Common Pleas of Beaver County, Pennsylvania \u201cpursuant to the provisions of 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 5103(b) and in accordance with Weaver v. <em>Marine Bank </em>[683 F.2d 744 (3d Cir.1982)].\u201d Defendants appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">There can be no diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 (1976) when plaintiff is a citizen of Pennsylvania and defendants are incorporated there. Since the statute expressly defines corporate citizenship to include the state of incorporation, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(c), plaintiff\u2019s affidavit alleging ARCO\u2019s principal place of business is in California was irrelevant. The district court recognized that the underlying suggestion that the state of incorporation can be overlooked in determining corporate citizenship was totally wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-11\">ARCO contends that because there was no diversity, the only order the district court could have entered was one dismissing the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. It stresses the mandatory nature of the language of Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(h)(3): \u201cWhenever it appears by suggestion of the parties or otherwise that the court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter, the court <em>shall </em>dismiss the action.\u201d (emphasis added). ARCO relies on those cases which hold a court without subject matter jurisdiction has no power to transfer but only to dismiss. <em>See Grand Blanc Education Association v. Grand Blanc Board of Education, </em>624 F.2d 47, 49 n. 4 (6th Cir.1980); <em>Dantes </em>v. <em>Western Foundation Corporation Association, </em>614 F.2d 299, 301 (1st Cir.1980); <em>White v. Commercial Standard Fire and Marine Co., </em>450 F.2d 785, 786 (5th Cir.1971); <em>Atlantic Ship Rigging Co. v. McLellan, </em>288 F.2d 589, 591 (3d Cir.1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-12\">ARCO\u2019s broad argument against any power to transfer based on these cases has now been weakened by the provision of the Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1982 which authorizes the court in which a case has been improperly filed to transfer it to a court in which the action or appeal could have been brought \u201cif it is in the interest of justice\u201d. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1631 (Supp.1983).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>Section 1631 does not, however, provide for the transfer of this action to a state court. Both the statutory language and the legislative history show that this provision was directed to the federal court system. The Senate Report explicitly states, \u201cThis provision is broadly drafted to allow transfer between any two <em>Federal </em>courts.\u201d S.Rep. No. 275, 97th Cong., 1st Sess. 30, <em>reprinted in </em>1982 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 11, 40 (emphasis added).' <em>See also </em>Hearing on Judicial Housekeeping Before the Subcomm. on Courts, Civil Liberties, and the Administration of Justice of the House Comm, on the Judiciary, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 372-90 (May 4,1978) (discussions of need for transfer between <em>federal </em>courts).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">The only other congressional authorization to which plaintiff has alluded as a basis for providing for such transfer notwithstanding the lack of subject matter jurisdiction is 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c) (1976). That statute gives the district court only limited authority in this regard, <em>i.e., </em>to remand to the state court actions \u201cremoved improvidently and without jurisdiction\u201d. Since plaintiff McLaughlin\u2019s action was not initially removed from state court, this provision is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Plaintiff and the district court relied on this court\u2019s decision in <em>Weaver v. Marine Bank, </em>683 F.2d 744 (3d Cir.1982) (on remand), where we transferred the pendent state law claim to state court. In <em>Weaver, </em>however, we characterized the state claim as pendent to plaintiffs\u2019 colorable federal claim that defendant had violated section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b), a claim clearly within the subject matter jurisdiction of the federal district court. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision that the Weavers\u2019 action did not involve a \u201csecurity\u201d within the scope of the federal statute, <em>see Marine Bank v. </em>Weaver, 455 U.S. 551, 102 S.Ct. 1220, 71 L.Ed.2d 409 (1982), did not deprive the federal claim of its initial substantiality. As we stated on remand,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-9\">Unquestionably, at the time the suit was filed in the district court, there was a <em>colorable federal claim and pendent jurisdiction could properly be assumed.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">683 F.2d at 747 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-11\">There is a serious question in this case whether McLaughlin\u2019s complaint can be construed to present any colorable federal claim. The complaint alleged no violation of federal law, referred to no effort by McLaughlin to seek federal administrative remedies;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> stated no basis of jurisdiction other than diversity; and pleaded only a violation of Pennsylvania law. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel throughout the litigation, both in the district court and this court, argued only diversity of citizenship and contended only that Pennsylvania law was violated. The passing references to OSHA which appear in the complaint were apparently intended to support plaintiff\u2019s claim that her discharge violated Pennsylvania public policy. See <em>Bruffett v. Warner Communications, Inc., </em>692 F.2d 910, 918-19 (3d Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-12\">It is true that the complaint\u2019s reference to \u201cdiscrimination against [plaintiff] with respect to the terms conditions and privileges of her employment because of sex\u201d is identical to that employed by Title VII. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l) (1976). It is, however, also substantially identical to language in the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act, 43 Pa.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 955(a) (Purdon Supp.1983). Nothing in the complaint indicates whether the federal statute, the state statute or both were contemplated as a basis for McLaughlin\u2019s claim, since the complaint refers only to \u201cpublic policy\u201d. In any event plaintiff does not argue on appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>that the district court erred in holding that there was no basis for federal jurisdiction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Plaintiffs argument, at least on appeal, has been directed to preservation of its state law claim, which both it and the district court believed could be effected only through a transfer by the district court to the state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">There is a serious question whether the Weaver precedent can be extended to authorize the district court to transfer a state law claim in the absence of any color-able federal claim to which it could have been pendent.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Resolution of that difficult issue would require us to interpret the scope of our inherent power, and could implicate as well Article III of the United States Constitution. We refrain from deciding constitutional issues when the case can be resolved on another basis. See <em>Spicer </em>v. <em>Hilton, </em>618 F.2d 232, 240-41 (3d Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">After the district court entered its order of transfer in this case, the Pennsylvania legislature amended the relevant transfer statute to permit the preservation of claims filed in federal court without the necessity of any transfer order. The amendment was a portion of a broader statute enacted December 20,1982 and effective 60 days thereafter, which, <em>inter alia, </em>amended 42 Pa. Cons.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 5103(b) to provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-6\">\u00a7 5103. Transfer of erroneously filed matters</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">(b) Federal cases.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-9\"><em>(1) </em>Subsection (a) shall also apply to any matter transferred or remanded by any United States court for a district embracing any part of this Commonwealth. In order to preserve a claim under Chapter 55 (relating to limitation of time), a litigant who timely commences an action or proceeding in any United States court for a district embracing any part of this Commonwealth is not required to commence a protective action in a court or before a district justice of this Commonwealth. <em>Where a matter is filed in any United States court for a district embracing any part of this Commonwealth and the matter is dismissed by the United States court for lack of jurisdiction, any litigant in the matter filed may transfer the matter to a court or magisterial district of this Commonwealth by complying with the transfer provisions set forth in paragraph (2).</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-12\"><em>(2) </em>Except as otherwise prescribed by general rules, or by order of the United States court, such transfer may be effected by filing a certified transcript of the final judgment of the United States court and the related pleadings in a court or magisterial district of this Commonwealth. The pleadings shall have the same effect as under the practice in the United States court, but the transferee court or district justice may require that they be amended to conform to the practice in this Commonwealth. Section 5535(a)(2)(i) (relating to termination of prior matters) shall not be applicable to a matter transferred under this subsection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-13\">42 Pa.Cons.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 5103(b) (Purdon Supp.1983), 1982 Pa.Legis.Serv. Act <em>326, </em>art. II, \u00a7 201 (Dec. 20, 1982) (new matter italicized).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-14\">As is evident, it is now possible to effectuate the intention of the Pennsylvania legislature to ameliorate the hardship to litigants who inadvertently file their actions in the wrong court merely by having them, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>their own actions, transfer the dismissed matters.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Accordingly, we will remand this action to the district court with directions that it dismiss the action so that plaintiff, pursuant to the amended Pennsylvania statute which is now effective, can transfer this matter by her own action to the Court of Common Pleas of Beaver County, Pennsylvania. Each side to bear its own costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b498-7\">. We have jurisdiction over the appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (1976). The order below finding a lack of subject matter jurisdiction and transferring the action divested the court of all control of the action and is appealable as a final order. <em>See Untalan </em>v. <em>Calvo, </em>381 F.2d 228, 230 (9th Cir.1967). <em>Cf. Baltimore Bank for Cooperatives v. Farmers Cheese Cooperative, </em>583 F.2d 104, 108 (3d Cir.1978) (abstention decision appealable as \u201cremoving entirely from the original federal jurisdiction cases that fall within federal jurisdiction grants .... \u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b498-8\">. That section provides in full:</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">Transfer to cure want of jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"A0VB\">Whenever a civil action is filed in a <em>court as defined in section 610 </em>of this title or an appeal, including a petition for review of administrative action, is noticed for or filed with such a court and that court finds that there is a want of jurisdiction, the court shall, if it is in the interest of justice, transfer such action or appeal <em>to any other such court </em>in which the action or appeal could have been brought at the time it was filed or noticed, and the action or appeal shall proceed as if it had been filed in or noticed for the court to which it is transferred on the date upon which it was actually filed in or noticed for the court from which it is transferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-14\">28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1631 (Supp.1983) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-15\">Section 610, referred to in Section 1631, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>As used in this chapter the word \u201ccourts\u201d includes the courts of appeals and district courts of the United States, the United States District Court for the District of the Canal Zone, the District Court for Guam, the District Court of the Virgin Islands, the United States Claims Court and the Court of International Trade.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-13\">28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 610 (Supp.1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b499-14\">. For example, the district court found that no charges were ever filed with the EEOC nor was any right to sue letter ever issued in the four years since the events complained of.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b500-10\">. In light of our disposition, we do not reach the correctness of the district court\u2019s rulings which formed the basis for its holding that there was no viable claim presented by plaintiff under either the OSHA Act or Title VII. We also express no opinion on whether McLaughlin has pled a viable claim under Pennsylvania law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b500-15\">. I adhere to the position expressed in my separate opinion in <em>Weaver, 683 F.2d </em>at 751-52, that transfer of an action from a federal to a state court is unauthorized without an applicable federal statute. See <em>White v. Commercial Standard Fire and Marine Co., </em>450 F.2d 785 (5th Cir.1971). I am, however, bound by the legal precedent of reported decisions of this court unless and until they are reversed by the in banc court. IOP Chapter 8[C].</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b501-19\">. The amendment, further reflecting Pennsylvania\u2019s \u201cenlightened effort to preserve a litigant\u2019s claim on the merits when the suit has been improvidently brought in federal court\u201d by using the date of institution of the federal suit for purposes of the statute of limitations, see <em>Weaver, </em>683 F.2d at 751-52 (Sloviter, J., separate opinion), appears to have emanated from the Judicial Code Committee of the Pennsylvania Conference of State Trial Judges. <em>See </em>Letter from the Hon. Robert A. Doyle, Chairman of the Judicial Code Committee to the Hon. George W. Gekas, Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee (Dec. 7, 1981) (proffering the amendments to clarify that \u201ca person who files in the wrong place does not lose the cause of action since it can be transferred anywhere within or outside the unified judicial system.\u201d)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
