Centrally at issue is the scope of authority Congress accorded the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB or Board) under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA or Act) to issue a bargaining order when an employer has committed \u201c \u2018outrageous\u2019 and \u2018pervasive\u2019 unfair labor practices ... of \u2018such a nature that their coercive effects cannot be eliminated by the application of traditional remedies, with the result that a fair and reliable [representation] election cannot be had.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Supreme Court so described a category of cases in <em>NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., </em>and thereby opened the question whether a bargaining order might issue to redress the employer\u2019s grave misconduct even though the union involved never received authorization cards from a majority of the bargaining unit employees and lost a representation election.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We confront here the situation the Supreme Court described but did not decide in <em>Gissel: </em>the employer engaged in \u201coutrageous\u201d and \u201cpervasive\u201d unfair labor practices; the union never achieved a card majority, it did not otherwise demonstrate majority support, and it lost the representation election; the NLRB, in a three to two decision, issued a bargaining order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-21\">On December 7, 1977, Local 222 of the International Ladies\u2019 Garment Workers\u2019 Union (Union) lost a representation election among the production and maintenance employees of Conair Corporation (Conair or Company). Joint Appendix (J.A.) 583a-84a. In administrative proceedings brought by the Board\u2019s General Counsel to set aside the results of the election and to remedy the Company\u2019s unfair labor practices, an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) found that Conair had engaged in \u201coutrageous\u201d and \u201cpervasive\u201d unfair labor practices. <em>Conair Corp., </em>261 NLRB 1189, 1285 (1982). The ALJ\u2019s proposed order directed Conair to implement extraordinary notice and access remedies, including a requirement that Co-nair\u2019s president personally read the NLRB\u2019s remedial notice to an assemblage of the company\u2019s employees. The ALJ declined to recommend a bargaining order, however, because the union never obtained authoriza<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1360\">*1360</page-number>tion cards from a majority of the bargaining unit employees. <em>Id. </em>at 1284-85 &amp; n. 451 (noting that the NLRB had not yet issued a bargaining order absent a card majority).</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-4\">The Board affirmed the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact, amending them only to include a finding that Conair had actually discharged its striking employees on April 22, 1977. <em>Id. </em>at 1189-90. Adopting the notice and access remedies proposed by the ALJ, the Board further ruled that Conair\u2019s \u201cmassive and unrelenting coercive conduct\u201d warranted imposition of a bargaining order. <em>Id. </em>at 1192-94.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Conair has challenged the NLRB\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-5\">We conclude that Conair did not receive fair notice of, and opportunity to respond to, a claim that it actually discharged striking employees on April 22, 1977; we therefore decline to enforce the Board\u2019s order in that particular. On the central issue, we hold that Congress has not empowered the Board to issue a bargaining order absent a concrete manifestation of majority employee assent to union representation; we therefore decline to enforce the NLRB's bargaining order. In all other respects, we deny Conair\u2019s petition for review and grant the Board\u2019s cross-petition for enforcement of its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-6\">On two issues, the panel is divided: (1) the NLRB\u2019s authority to issue a nonmajority bargaining order; and (2) the requirement that Conair\u2019s president personally read the NLRB\u2019s remedial notice to an assemblage of employees. Judge Wald, for the reasons stated in her dissenting opinion, would enforce the Board\u2019s bargaining order. For the reasons stated in Part V.C of this opinion, written by Judge Wald, the court upholds the Board on the presidential reading issue. Judge Ginsburg dissents on this issue; she would allow Conair\u2019s president, if he so elects, to designate a responsible officer to read the remedial notice on his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-12\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-13\">Conair is engaged in the manufacture, sale, and distribution of hair care, personal grooming, and related products. At all times relevant to this controversy, Conair maintained its administrative offices, conducted warehousing and distributional operations, and produced electrical hair care appliances at the Company\u2019s facility in Edison, New Jersey. 261 NLRB at 1203-04.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> When the events at issue occurred, the Edison plant employed 300 unit workers. <em>Id. </em>at 1285 n. 451.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Most of these employees, it appears, were Spanish speaking. <em>Id. </em>at 1208 n. 31, 1268 n. 369.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-14\">In March of 1977,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the Union began an organizational campaign at Conair\u2019s Edison plant. <em>Id. </em>at 1205. In early April, shortly after becoming aware of the Union\u2019s campaign, the Company conducted a series of unprecedented management-employee meetings in direct response to the Union\u2019s efforts. <em>Id. </em>at 1262, 1265. Conair Vice-Presidents John Mayorek and Jerry Kampel held a meeting for all unit employees in the plant\u2019s cafeteria on April 4. <em>Id. </em>at 1205. At that meeting, Mayorek indicated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1361\">*1361</page-number>the Company knew of the organizational campaign. He then pointed out the benefits provided by the Company in the past, <em>id. </em>at 1205-08, cautioned that certain current benefits would be lost with unionization, <em>id. </em>at 1205-08, 1267,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and promised that in the future the Company would provide a variety of benefits \u2014 many directly responsive to employee complaints aired at the meeting. <em>Id. </em>at 1205-08, 1264 &amp; n. 351, 1272.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Mayorek further informed the employees that the Company had an \u201copen-door\u201d policy \u2014 previously unknown to most, if not all, employees \u2014 whereby they could bring grievances directly to managerial personnel.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This direct access to management also would be lost with unionization, he warned. <em>Id. </em>at 1205-08, 1262-63. Kampel reiterated much of what Mayorek said. <em>Id. </em>at 1208, 1267, 1272.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1427-5\">On April 6, Conair President Leandro Rizzuto addressed a second mass meeting of unit employees held in the production area. His remarks tracked the earlier remarks of Mayorek and Kampel. President Rizzuto stated that he could not understand why the employees would want to unionize; he then recited current benefits, cautioned that unionization would result in the loss of certain benefits,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and promised various additional benefits in the future. <em>Id. </em>at 1210-\u00cd2, 1267-68, 1273.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Rizzuto warned that if he had to pay the increased wages the Union would demand, he would go out of business. <em>Id. </em>at 1210-12, 1267-68. He also stressed that, without a union, employees were free to bring complaints directly to supervisory and managerial personnel; with a union, he said, someone would have to represent workers before management, resulting in delay. <em>Id. </em>at 1211-12, 1267-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-12\">Later that same day, Rizzuto, Mayorek and Kampel held several meetings with groups of ten to fifteen employees during which they again spoke of current and future benefits, and of the \u201copen-door\u201d policy. Rizzuto stated at the small group sessions that if a union came in, it would be cheaper to move to Hong Kong than to remain in Edison. <em>Id. </em>at 1214-15,1268,1273.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Kam-pel promised to deal with several employee complaints aired at these meetings. <em>Id. </em>at 1214-15, 1273.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1427-13\">In response to Conair\u2019s extraordinary management-employee meetings, the Union called an unfair labor practice strike on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1362\">*1362</page-number>morning of April 11. <em>Id. </em>at 1217, 1277.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Approximately 125-140 unit employees participated in the strike that morning,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and over 100 remained at the plant to picket. <em>Id. </em>at 1218, 1277. The strike continued for over five months, ending on September 23. Disorganized picketing and numerous spontaneous acts of picket line violence<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> marked the first two days. <em>Id. </em>at 1219-26, 1287.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Thereafter, apart from a few incidents during the week of July 18,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> no significant picket line misconduct occurred. <em>Id. </em>at 1287.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1428-4\">On April 13, the Union initiated two administrative actions: it petitioned the Board for certification as unit representative, J.A. 579a-80a;<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and it filed an unfair labor practice charge against Conair based on the early April meetings. J.A. 271a-72a. The Union and the Company then entered into a stipulation to hold a consent election among all unit employees on Conair\u2019s payroll as of April 9. J.A. 581a-83a.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> This election, originally scheduled for May 6, was postponed on May 5 pending resolution of an unfair labor practice charge (based on the early picket line violence) the Company had filed with the Board on April 25. 261 NLRB at 1202 n. 1; J.A. 280a-81a.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1428-12\">During the course of the strike, the Company repeatedly made it clear to the striking employees that persistence in the concerted action would result in loss of their jobs. On April 20, Conair sent mail-grams to the strikers stating that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1363\">*1363</page-number>would be deemed to have quit their jobs unless they reported to work on April 22. 261 NLRB at 1237-38, 1268; J.A. 453a.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Conair subsequently sent each striker a letter dated June 9 which, in the Spanish version,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> offered \u201cfull and immediate reinstatement ... if you accept unconditionally our offer to return to work.\u201d 261 NLRB at 1238-39 &amp; n. 216,1268; J.A. 452a.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Finally, Conair sent letters to the strikers in July or August stating in English and Spanish that the Company had notified the insurance carriers for the employees\u2019 medical and life insurance plans that the strikers no longer worked for Conair. 261 NLRB at 1239, 1268 &amp; n. 371; J.A. 484a.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1429-11\">Meanwhile, inside the plant, the Company persisted in its efforts to eliminate unrest among its nonstriking employees.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Conair officials, both at meetings and in remarks to individual employees, continued to encourage workers to voice to management any grievances they might have. 261 NLRB at 1226, 1257 &amp; n. 371, 1262, 1265; J.A. 2328a. A bilingual personnel director, promised by Mayorek on April 4, commenced employment at the Edison plant on June 1. 261 NLRB at 1238. Thereafter, the Company planned and implemented a variety of benefits<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> \u2014 many in response to employee complaints raised during the early April meetings. <em>Id. </em>at 1246-48, 1274 &amp; n. 392.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1430-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1364\">*1364</page-number>After a spring and summer of concerted action, the Union informed Conair that the strike would end on September 23; on behalf of all striking employees, the Union made an unconditional offer to return to work on that day. <em>Id. </em>at 1240, 1277. The Company accepted the offer but refused to reinstate the strikers immediately.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Instead, when the strikers reported to the plant on September 28, the Company required them to fill out job applications. <em>Id. </em>at 1240-41, 1278. During the period from October 4 to November 7, most of the strikers received reinstatement offers<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> and returned to work. <em>Id. </em>at 1241,1279.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Conair initially offered five strikers jobs less desirable than the ones they held before the strike, however, and never offered reinstatement to thirteen strikers.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1430-11\">On November 23, the Board approved a formal settlement of the unfair labor practice charges Conair had filed alleging picket line misconduct by the Union. J.A. 362a-66a.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The representation election initially scheduled for May 6 was thereafter rescheduled for December 7. 261 NLRB at 1202 n. 1. During the two weeks prior to the vote, supervisory personnel repeatedly stated to various unit employees that Co-nair\u2019s president would close the Edison plant and move to Hong Kong if the Union won the election. <em>Id. </em>at 1248-51, 1269.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1365\">*1365</page-number>Supervisors also warned on several occasions that, in the event of a Union victory, the employees would not receive their Christmas bonuses. <em>Id. </em>at 1250, 1253-54, 1270. \u201cRaffle tickets\u201d inundated the plant warning that a vote for the Union was a vote for plant closure. <em>Id. </em>at 1251-53, 1269-70.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Finally, Conair distributed campaign literature (printed in both Spanish and English, <em>id. </em>at 1254) and \u201cStatements of Account\u201d declaring that the Company\u2019s profit sharing plan was for nonunion employees only.. <em>Id. </em>at 1254, 1270.</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-5\">The Union lost the December 7 election by a vote of 136 to 69;<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> eight votes were cast for the Teamsters<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> and forty-one ballots were challenged. J.A. 583a-84a. On March 8, 1978, the Board\u2019s Regional Director filed a complaint in which he consolidated the Union\u2019s challenge to the election with allegations drawn from the various unfair labor practice charges the Union had filed against Conair. 261 NLRB at 1202 &amp; n. 2; J.A. 370a-93a.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1431-6\">Hearings on the Regional Director\u2019s complaint ran for thirty-eight days, commencing on March 23, 1978, and ending on June 2,1978. 261 NLRB at 1202 &amp; n. 4. On July 30, 1980, the ALJ issued his decision and recommended order. J.A. 260a. The ALJ determined that Conair had violated section 8(a)(1) of the NLRA<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> by soliciting employee grievances during an organizational campaign through means more elaborate than previously used and with the promise (expressed or implied) that reported grievances would be adjusted, 261 NLRB at 1266-67; by threatening its employees with loss of current benefits if they supported a union, <em>id. </em>at 1270-71; by threatening its employees with plant closure if they supported a union, <em>id. </em>at 1269-70; by threatening to discharge its employees for engaging in protected concerted action, <em>id. </em>at 1268-69; by promising (expressly or impliedly) and granting benefits to induce its employees to renounce unionization, <em>id. </em>at 1273-75; by coercively interrogating several employees concerning their union activities, <em>id. </em>at 1275-76; and by creating the impression that its employees\u2019 union activities were under surveillance, <em>id. </em>at 1276. <em>See id. </em>at 1288. The ALJ further determined that Conair's disadvantageous treatment of unfair labor practice strikers, based on their union activities, was unlawful under both section 8(a)(1) and section 8(a)(3) of the NLRA.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> In this category of violations, the ALJ included the Company\u2019s failure to reinstate the strikers immediately upon their unconditional offer to return to work, <em>id. </em>at 1279; its failure initially to reinstate five strikers to positions substantially equivalent to their pre-strike jobs, <em>id. </em>at 1279; its failure ever to reinstate thirteen strikers, <em>id. </em>at 1281; and its discharge of three previously reinstated strikers, <em>id </em>at 1282. <em>See id. </em>at 1288. Conair\u2019s 8(a)(1) and 8(a)(3) violations, the ALJ concluded, were sufficiently grave and numerous to place the Company\u2019s conduct within the \u201coutrageous\u201d and \u201cpervasive\u201d category described by the Supreme Court in <em>Gissel. Id. </em>at 1285.</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-13\">The ALJ\u2019s recommended order directed Conair to cease and desist from the enumer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1366\">*1366</page-number>ated unfair labor practices and from violating section 8(a)(1) in any other manner,<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> and to implement extraordinary notice and access remedies. <em>Id. </em>at 1283, 1285.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> The ALJ declined to recommend a bargaining order, however, because the Union never had obtained authorization cards from a majority of the unit employees<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> and the Board, at the time of the ALJ\u2019s decision, had never issued a nonmajority bargaining order. <em>Id. </em>at 1284-85 &amp; n. 451.</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-4\">The full Board generally affirmed the ALJ\u2019s findings and proposed remedies. <em>Id. </em>at 1189-92; <em>id. </em>at 1195 &amp; n. 28 (Chairman Van de Water); <em>id. </em>at 1199 (Member Hunter).<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> By a divided vote, the Board also imposed a bargaining order retroactive to April 4, 1977 \u2014 the date Conair began its campaign of unfair labor practices. <em>Id. </em>at 1192-94.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Finally, the Board majority concluded that the April 20 mailgram resulted in the actual discharge of the striking employees on April 22 \u2014 and thus Conair was liable for back pay to the strikers from that date until the end of the strike. <em>Id. </em>at 1189-90 &amp; n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-15\">II. Threshold Issues</p>\n<p id=\"ALc8\">Conair initially raises two objections and contends that each of them warrants a decision vacating the Board\u2019s order in its entirety. The Company argues first, that the timing of the representation election among unit employees contravened NLRB policy and regulations; and second, that credibility assessments along with a host of other findings made by the ALJ, and adopted by the Board, lack foundation in the record. Both objections are insubstantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-16\">A. <em>Timing of the Representation Election</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1432-17\">On September 1, 1977, the Union and the Board\u2019s General Counsel reached a formal settlement of the unfair labor practice charges alleging picket line misconduct by the Union. J.A. 332a-40a. A term of the settlement required the Union to post a remedial notice at its offices for sixty days. J.A. 335a-36a. The Board approved this settlement, over Conair\u2019s objections, on November 23, 1977. J.A. 362a-65a. The representation election was then held on December 7, 1977. J.A. 583a.</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-18\">The election occurred several weeks too soon, Conair maintains, because the Union\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1367\">*1367</page-number>misconduct had destroyed \u201claboratory conditions,\u201d and the Board\u2019s own regulations indicate that such conditions could not be restored until expiration of the sixty-day posting period. We note first that it is not altogether clear that NLRB policy called for a sixty-day wait in this case. More importantly, the error, if there was one, was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1433-5\">NLRB regulations do provide that, \u201cexcept in exceptional circumstances, no <em>election </em>should be held until the posting period has expired.\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> But \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d may be present here. Almost all of the Union\u2019s misconduct occurred on April 11 and 12, 1977 \u2014 eight months prior to the December 7,1977 election date. 261 NLRB at 1219-26, 1287 (ALJ Opinion). The remaining incidents of misconduct occurred during the week of July 18, 1977 \u2014 four and one-half months prior to the election. <em>Id. </em>at 1287. Moreover, the strike ended on September 23, 1977; there had not even been a picket line for two and one-half months prior to the election. <em>See id. </em>at 1240, 1277-78. It would not have been unreasonable, under these circumstances, for the NLRB to conclude that any effects of the Union\u2019s picket line misconduct had dissipated prior to December 7, 1977.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1433-6\">In any event, Conair\u2019s argument fails on a practical ground. We do not comprehend how a Board-held election arguably tainted by Union misconduct harmed Conair when the Union lost that election. Thus, even if the NLRB should have deferred the election date until sixty days after the Union posted the remedial notice, Conair is not positioned to complain. Scheduling the election during the period the <em>Union </em>was required to post a cease and desist notice did not reduce the force of the <em>Company\u2019s </em>unfair labor practices at which the Board\u2019s order is directed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1433-10\">B. <em>Substantial Evidence Supports the ALJ\u2019s Findings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1433-11\">Conair\u2019s attack on the ALJ\u2019s findings do not merit extended discussion.

The April 20, 1977 Mailgram:</p>\n<p id=\"A6l\">Threatened or Actual Discharge</p>\n<p id=\"auj-dedup-0\">By a three to two vote, the Board held that one of the ALJ\u2019s conclusions of law did not reach far enough. The ALJ had determined that Conair\u2019s April 20,1977, mailgram to striking employees <em>threatened </em>discharge in violation of section 8(a)(1) of the NLRA (hereafter, \u00a7 8(a)(1)).<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> The Board\u2019s majority decided that the mailgram violated section 8(a)(3) of the NLRA (hereafter, \u00a7 8(a)(3)) as well,<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> because it amounted to more than a threat; it in fact terminated the strikers\u2019 employment as of April 22, 1977.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> We hold that Conair was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1369\">*1369</page-number>not afforded timely notice that the issue presented by the mailgram was actual, not merely threatened, discharge. Accordingly, we reverse the Board\u2019s determination that the mailgram episode violated \u00a7 8(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-5\">A. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1435-6\">On April 20,1977, Conair sent a mailgram to each of its striking employees, stating in both English and Spanish: .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1435-7\">WE HAVE CALLED YOU REPEATEDLY TO RETURN TO YOUR JOB. DESPITE YOUR PROMISES TO DO SO, YOU HAVE FAILED TO REPORT FOR DUTY. THERE IS NO VIOLENCE, EMPLOYEES FREELY ENTER THE PLANT. UNLESS YOU REPORT FOR WORK ON FRIDAY APRIL 22 1977 AT YOUR REGULAR STARTING TIME YOU WILL BE DEEMED TO HAVE VOLUNTARILY QUIT YOUR JOB.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1435-8\">J.A. 453a. No striking employees reported . to work in response to this mailgram. <em>See </em>261 NLRB at 1238 (ALJ Opinion). The Union asserted, in an unfair labor practice charge filed against Conair on May 19, 1977.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> that the mailgram episode violated \u00a7 8(a)(1) and \u00a7 8(a)(3). J.A. 285a. Specifically, the Union charged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1435-14\">On or about April 20, 1977, and continuing to date, [Conair], by its officers and agents, <em>threatened its employees with discharge, and on April 22 discharged said employees, </em>because of their activities on behalf of Local 222, ILGWU, ... and for their protected concerted activities. The foregoing employees consisted of those employees who have supported and are supporting the strike called by Local 222.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AnCO\">J.A. 285a (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-15\">The first official unfair labor practice complaint was lodged against Conair by the Board\u2019s Regional Director on May 31, 1977.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> It covered unfair labor practices charged by the Union prior to May 19,1977, and therefore did not include any reference to the mailgram. A statement concerning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1370\">*1370</page-number>the mailgram episode appeared, initially, in the Acting Regional Director\u2019s first amended complaint against Conair, issued on November 11, 1977. J.A. 345a-61a. That pleading alleged: \u201cOn or about April 20, 1977, at its Edison plant, [Conair] did <em>threaten its employees with loss of employment </em>if they continued to support the Union or any other labor organization.\u201d J.A. 350a (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-4\">Notably, the Acting Regional Director\u2019s pleading did not incorporate the Union\u2019s charge that employees were in fact discharged by reason of the mailgram. Matching its confinement of the allegation to \u201cthreaten[ed] ... loss of employment,\u201d the first amended complaint cited only \u00a7 8(a)(1), not \u00a7 8(a)(3), in this context. J.A. 360a. As to other unfair labor practices identified in the pleading, however, the complaint asserted that both provisions, \u00a7 8(a)(1) and \u00a7 8(a)(3), had been violated. <em>See </em>J.A. 353a-58a, 360a.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-5\">A second amended complaint issued on March 8, 1978. J.A. 370a-93a. It added new allegations, <em>see, e.g., </em>J.A. 376a, 385a-86a, but repeated verbatim the mailgram charge as set out in the first amended complaint. J.A. 377a. Again, the pleading stated that the mailgram incident violated \u00a7 8(a)(1); no \u00a7 8(a)(3) charge was asserted in relation to this incident. J.A. 391a. Further, as the ALJ noted, \u201cat the commencement of the hearing [before the ALJ] and during the course thereof the second amended complaint was amended at various times by counsel for the General Counsel to include additional allegations of violations ... by [Conair].\u201d 261 NLRB at 1202. None of these further amendments to the second amended complaint alleged actual discharge of strikers in violation of \u00a7 8(a)(3). <em>See </em>General Counsel Exhibit l(cc)-(hh).</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-8\">At the hearing before the ALJ, Conair Vice-President Mayorek testified that he knew of no striking employees who returned to work in response to the April 20 mailgram, J.A. 1485a, and that as of April 22, 1977, the striking employees were considered \u201c[t]o have voluntarily quit their jobs.\u201d J.A. 1486a. Referring to this testimony and to the content of the April 20 mailgram, the ALJ concluded that the mail-gram expressly threatened discharge in violation of \u00a7 8(a)(1). 261 NLRB at 1268. Nothing in the ALJ\u2019s comprehensive decision, issued in July 1980, however, indicates as an issue in controversy the question whether the April 20, 1977, mailgram occasioned actual discharges in violation of \u00a7 8(a)(1) and \u00a7 8(a)(3). By contrast, in instances where the complaint alleged conduct in violation of \u00a7 8(a)(3), and the evidence supported the allegation, the ALJ concluded that \u00a7 8(a)(3) had been violated. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 1278 n. 417, 1279, 1281.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-9\">In exceptions to the ALJ\u2019s decision, the Board\u2019s General Counsel asserted that the Judge erred by:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1436-10\">[f]ailing to find that [Conair] violated Section 8(a)(1) and (3) of the Act by discharging all of its unfair labor practice strikers as of April 22, 1977, and by failing to provide an appropriate remedy in connection therewith.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1436-11\">General Counsel\u2019s Exceptions to the Decision of the Administrative Law Judge at 2 (November 14, 1980).<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> The Union filed a similar exception, and specifically asserted that Conair should have been ordered \u201cto make all of the [affected] unfair labor prac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1371\">*1371</page-number>tice strikers ... whole for any loss of pay commencing April 22, 1977 until the date of a bona fide offer of reinstatement.\u201d Charging Party\u2019s Exceptions to the Decision of the Administrative Law Judge at 2 (November 7, 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-5\">The Board unanimously affirmed the ALJ\u2019s determination that the mailgram unlawfully threatened striking employees with discharge in violation of \u00a7 8(a)(1). We agree that the record fully supports the ALJ\u2019s conclusion, and Conair does not seriously argue otherwise. Three of the Board\u2019s five members, however, further determined that the ALJ\u2019s conclusion should be augmented in line with the exception pressed by the General Counsel and the Union; these members cited record evidence supporting the contention \u201cthat the April 20 mailgram also violated Section 8(a)(3) and (1) of the Act by unlawfully terminating the striking employees.\u201d 261 NLRB at 1189-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-6\">Conair, in its brief responding to the General Counsel\u2019s and Union\u2019s exception, had objected that the pleadings failed to alert it to the presence of an actual termination issue stemming from the mailgram. The Board\u2019s majority declared as its answer to this lack of notice objection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1437-7\">Although [Conair] asserts that it had no notice that the April 20 mailgram would be litigated as a violation of Sec. 8(a)(3), the complaint specifically alleges that the mailgram threatened employees with discharge in violation of Sec. 8(a)(1), and <em>other paragraphs of the complaint allege that other conduct by [Conair] violated Sec. 8(a)(8). </em>Further, in its exceptions, [Conair] argued that the law and the interpretation of the facts now in the record do not support the finding of a violation. [Conair] does not argue that it was precluded from adducing any exculpatory facts or that it would have altered its presentation of the case in any manner. Accordingly, we find no merit to [Conair\u2019s] contentions since the issue was fully litigated and all of the operative facts underlying the finding of a 8(a)(3) and (1) violation are present in the record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1437-8\">261 NLRB at 1190 n. 5 (citing <em>Southern Newspapers, Inc., </em>255 NLRB 154, 154 n. 1 (1981)) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-9\">Board Member Hunter, joined by Chairman Van de Water, dissented from the majority\u2019s extension of the ALJ\u2019s decision on the mailgram episode. They reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aid-dedup-1\">[T]he discharge issue was initially raised in the [Union\u2019s] charge but was not alleged as an unfair labor practice in the [Regional Director\u2019s] complaint, [thus leading Conair] to believe that the discharge issue was not before the Board. Sec. 3(d) of the Act vests the authority to issue unfair labor practice complaints with the General Counsel, and in this case the General Counsel saw fit not to allege that the mailgram had violated the Act by unlawfully discharging [Conair\u2019s] striking employees.... [T]his is not the type of case where, during the hearing, the General Counsel discovers previously unavailable evidence indicating additional unfair labor practices.... [T]he General Counsel had long been aware of the existence of the mailgram.... [I]t is patently unfair to permit the General Counsel to raise the discharge issue at such a late stage, and after the record has been closed.... [W]e can only speculate as to how [Conair] might have changed its litigation strategy or presented its facts differently if the discharge issue, with its substantial backpay liability, had been timely raised. Once the record has been closed, and, if you will, all bets called, it is too late to raise the ante and attempt to collect additional chips.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1437-10\">261 NLRB at 1199 n. 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-11\">B. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1437-12\">We agree with the dissenting Board members that the critical issue is not whether there is substantial evidence in the record indicating that the mailgram occasioned actual termination of the strikers\u2019 employment. That issue, we believe, should not have been reached by the Board, for Conair was never told before the hearing record closed that the stakes included liability for discharges effected on April 22,1977. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1372\">*1372</page-number>The Union opened the matter by charging that the mailgram episode spelled discharge, and not the mere threat of such action. But the complaint adjudicated by the ALJ, although amended in several particulars both before and during the course of the hearing, never asserted more than the threat of termination in violation of \u00a7 8(a)(1). And the ALJ, who canvassed the case thoroughly in an extraordinarily detailed decision, apparently did not regard actual discharge as a matter fairly posed for resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-4\">It will not do to assert, as the Board\u2019s majority did, that \u201cother paragraphs of the complaint allege[d] that other conduct by [Conair] violated Sec. 8(a)(3).\u201d 261 NLRB at 1190 n. 5. If anything, such \u201cother paragraphs\u201d might have reinforced Conair\u2019s anticipation that it faced only an \u00a7 8(a)(1), not an \u00a7 8(a)(3), contention in relation to the mailgram. Nor do we believe it was Conair\u2019s burden to show that, had it been accorded due notice of an actual discharge claim based on the mailgram, it could have \u201cadduc[ed] ... facts\u201d or \u201caltered its presentation\u201d to defeat the claim. <em>See id. </em>Here, as in <em>McLean-Behm Steel Erectors, Inc. v. Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, </em>608 F.2d 580, 582 (5th Cir.1979), \u201cbecause the record ... does not reveal uncontrovertibly that petitioner could not have prevailed in any defense to [the 8(a)(3)] charge, we find prejudice requiring reversal.\u201d<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1438-5\">We stress that we do not rest on the notion that the NLRB\u2019s General Counsel is rigidly bound by his initial statement of a complaint or even his successively amended pleadings. Rule 15(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides an apt analogy. Under Rule 15(b), pleadings can be amended to conform to the evidence, even after judgment, when \u201cissues not raised [therein] are tried by express or implied consent of the parties.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(b). Indeed, formal amendment is unnecessary to preserve the result of a fair trial of an issue that the parties in fact have agreed to litigate. But it must be \u201cclear that the parties understand exactly what the issues are when the proceedings are had.\u201d <em>Kuhn v. Civil Aeronautics Board, </em>183 F.2d 839, 842 (D.C.Cir.1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-11\">Further, the presence of evidence in the record to support a charge unstated in a complaint or any amendment thereto does not mean the party against whom the charge is made had notice that the issue was being litigated. \u201c[T]he introduction of evidence relevant to an issue already in the case may not be used to show consent to trial of a new issue absent a clear indication that the party who introduced the evidence was attempting to raise a new issue.\u201d <em>Cioffe v. Morris, </em>676 F.2d 539, 542 (11th Cir.1982) (quoting <em>International Harvester Credit Corp. v. East Coast Truck, </em>547 F.2d 888, 890 (5th Cir.1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-12\">Because it is the \u201c[a]ctuality of notice ..., not the technicality, [that] govern[s],\u201d <em>Kuhn v. Civil Aeronautics Board, </em>183 F.2d at 842, pleading amendments may be tendered on appellate review. <em>See </em>6 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil \u00a7 1494, at 476-78 (1971). But \u201cif the record is incomplete or if it is uncertain whether the party opposing the motion to amend had notice of the unplead-ed issue at the trial stage, the appellate court should render its decision in conformity with the issues relied upon by the lower court in reaching its judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 478.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-13\">It is at least uncertain whether Conair had fair notice or understood that the discharge issue was part of the case tendered to the ALJ. The ALJ, who did not even mention the issue in an otherwise exhaustive set of findings and conclusions, evidently did not perceive that the question had been tried \u201cby express or implied consent.\u201d <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(b). Under the circumstances presented here, the Board, acting as an appellate body, should have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1373\">*1373</page-number>\u201crendered] its decision in conformity with the issue[ ]\u201d as framed and resolved by the ALJ. <em>See </em>6 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, <em>supra, </em>at 478. We conclude, for the reasons stated, that the Board erred in \u201cfinding that [Conair] violated Section 8(a)(3) and (1) of the Act by discriminatorily discharging its striking employees on April 22, 1977,\u201d 261 NLRB at 1190, and in modifying the AU\u2019s proposed remedy to conform to that Board finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-5\">IV. Conair Engaged in \u201cOutrageous\u201d and \u201cPervasive\u201d Unfair Labor Practices Not Offset by Union Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"A-9\">Two determinations underlie the Board\u2019s remedial directives: first, a fair election could not be held in the wake of Conair\u2019s \u201coutrageous\u201d and \u201cpervasive\u201d violations of the NLRA; second, the Union did not engage in sufficiently grave misconduct to preclude the issuance of any bargaining order that might otherwise be appropriate. The evidence credited in the administrative proceedings,<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> and prior NLRB and court decisions, support both determinations. Neither is vulnerable under the deferential standard of review we apply when the Board engages in a reasoned exercise of its expert judgment. <em>See NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., </em>395 U.S. 575, 612 n. 32, 615-16, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 1939 n. 32, 1940-41, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969); <em>Amalgamated Clothing Workers v. NLRB, </em>527 F.2d 803, 807 (D.C.

The NLRB accepted the ALJ\u2019s conclusion<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> as congruent with the Board\u2019s analysis of Conair\u2019s conduct in terms of four variables: the gravity of the Company\u2019s violations, the extent to which their coercive effect pervaded the bargaining unit, their timing, and the degree to which Conair repeated them.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1439-12\">The Board referred first to the gravely coercive nature of Conair\u2019s unfair labor practices, stressing the Company\u2019s threats to close the plant and its reprisals against striking employees. <em>Id. </em>at 1192.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> Next, the Board noted that the Company\u2019s violations were constantly repeated. Further, the Board observed that the unlawful practices began at a high level of intensity shortly after the Union\u2019s organizational drive commenced, continued over an eight month period, intensified as the election neared, and even occurred several times after the election. <em>Id. </em>at 1193. Finally, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1374\">*1374</page-number>Board cited the conspicuous involvement of Conair\u2019s highest officials and the use of mass meetings and publications as factors serving to insure that the coercive impact pervaded the bargaining unit. <em>Id. </em>The confluence of factors thus identified by the Board is undergirded by substantial evidence on the record as a whole, <em>see, e.g., Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951); <em>Pedro\u2019s, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>652 F.2d 1005, 1011 (D.C.Cir.1981),<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> and adequately justifies the conclusion that Conair\u2019s conduct fell into the most egregious category.</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-4\">Prior NLRB and court decisions sustain the Board\u2019s judgment as to the character and impact of Conair\u2019s conduct. Precedent acknowledges the gravity of threats to close a plant. <em>See, e.g., Sinclair Co. v. NLRB, </em>395 U.S. 575, 588-89, 611 n. 81, 615, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 1926-27, 1938 n. 31, 1940 (1969) (threats of plant closure alone provide sufficient justification for majority bargaining order); <em>Donn Products, Inc. v.

Reprisals against union proponents are similarly recognized as highly coercive. <em>See, e.g., Jim Baker Trucking Co., </em>241 NLRB 121, 122 (1979) (\u201cthreat of termination is a serious unfair labor practice, [and] the effectuation of such a threat is even more serious\u201d), <em>enforced mem., </em>626 F.2d 866 (9th Cir.1980); <em>cf.

The numerosity of \u00a7 8(a)(1) violations has figured prominently as well in estimating the coercive impact of an employer\u2019s unlawful anti-union activities. <em>See United Oil Manufacturing Co. v. NLRB, </em>672 F.2d 1208, 1213 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 446, 74 L.Ed.2d 601 (1982); <em>NLRB v.

NLRB, </em>612 F.2d 144, 149 (3d Cir.1979); <em>Wright Plastic Products, Inc., </em>247 NLRB 635, 635 (1980), and when the violations affect most of the unit employees. <em>See, e.g., Electrical Products Division of Midland-Ross Corp. v.

Repetition of unfair labor practices, practical judgment suggests, reinforces their coercive effect. <em>See also NLRB v.

First, this case in several respects is similar to the one other case in which the Board concluded a nonmajority bargaining order was necessary because an employer\u2019s \u201coutrageous\u201d and \u201cpervasive\u201d unfair labor practices precluded a fair return election <em>(United Dairy Farmers Coop</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1375\">*1375</page-number><em>erative Association, </em>257 NLRB 722 (1981)),<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> and it is distinguishable from cases in which the Board did not reach that conclusion.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> <em>Cf. NLRB v. Jamaica Towing, Inc., </em>602 F.2d 1100, 1104-05 (2d Cir.1979) (one reason for remand is Board\u2019s failure to explain apparent inconsistency of issuing a bargaining order when Board had not issued such an order in similar cases). Second, Conair\u2019s misconduct was more \u201coutrageous\u201d and \u201cpervasive\u201d than the misconduct demonstrated in other cases in which this court affirmed the Board\u2019s decision to issue a majority bargaining order because prospects for a fair rerun election appeared dim. <em>See Road Sprinkler Fitters Local Union No. 669 v.

Picketing was massive and disorganized on the opening days, April 11 and 12. Employees attempting to cross the picket line encountered pushing and shoving. Uncontrolled strikers threw rocks, obstructed traffic, slashed tires, and smashed windshields. Several workers sustained minor injuries. These chaotic incidents, the ALJ found, were not Union-planned. <em>See </em>261 NLRB at 1219-26, 1287 nn. 453, 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-4\">On the evening of July 21, the arrival of a truck at Conair\u2019s premises for no apparent business reason occasioned a further violent incident. The truck driver was assaulted and his truck was damaged. <em>See id. </em>at 1232-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-5\">The ALJ determined from the testimony that \u201cvictims\u201d provoked some of the strikers\u2019 misconduct and that Conair\u2019s own unlawful activities created a \u201cvolatile situation.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 1287 n. 456. He further found that, following the chaotic first two days of the strike, violence subsided. <em>See id. </em>In the long stretch from April to September, the ALJ concluded, the \u201cstrike was generally conducted in a peaceful manner with no significant picket line misconduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1287.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1442-9\">We do not decide in this case whether, as a general rule, grave union misconduct, even if offset by more egregious employer misconduct, precludes Board imposition of a remedial bargaining order. <em>Compare NLRB v. Triumph Curing Center, </em>571 F.2d 462, 476 (9th Cir.1978), <em>and Donovan v. NLRB, </em>520 F.2d 1316, 1321 (2d Cir.1975) (in deciding propriety of majority bargaining order Board should balance \u201ceffect of the Company\u2019s violations against the gravity of the Union\u2019s misconduct\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 1053, 96 S.Ct. 783, 46 L.Ed.2d 642 (1976), <em>with </em>Note, <em>Union Violence &amp; Bargaining Orders: A New Approach to </em>Laura Modes, 127 U.PaL.Rev. 1640,1658-65 (1979) (advocating exclusive focus on gravity of union misconduct).<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> We address only the circumstances at hand: when a strike is generally peaceful, marred only by outbursts of violence contained within a short span and not traced to union direction, we are not prepared to declare the Board\u2019s issuance of an otherwise appropriate bargaining order an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-10\">V. Remedies</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-11\">For the reasons stated in Part III, <em>supra, </em>we decline to enforce the portion of the Board\u2019s \u201cmake whole\u201d directives predicated upon the alleged discharge of strikers on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1377\">*1377</page-number>April 22, 1977.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> We explain below why, despite our acceptance of the Board\u2019s evaluation of Conair\u2019s conduct as \u201coutrageous\u201d and \u201cpervasive,\u201d we reject the Board\u2019s non-majority bargaining order remedy. In all other respects, we uphold the Board\u2019s remedial order. We divide our discussion of the Board-imposed remedies into three parts: (1) the bargaining order; (2) extraordinary notice and access remedies generally; (3) the requirement that Conair\u2019s president personally read the Board\u2019s remedial notice to an assembly of current employees.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1443-9\">A. <em>The Nonmajority Bargaining Order</em></p>\n<p id=\"ach-dedup-0\">In 1980, for the first time in the long history of the NLRA,<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> a court squarely held that the NLRB has the authority to issue a bargaining order despite the absence of tangible evidence that the union ever secured the support of a majority of the affected employees.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> The full Board itself did not rule unequivocally on the question until 1982, in the case at hand.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> The issue is vexing<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> because it trenches upon employee freedom of choice, a matter at the very center of our national labor relations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1378\">*1378</page-number>policy. Nonmajority bargaining orders pose this dilemma: if the Board lacks authority to issue them, employers who offend the law most egregiously will escape the most stringent remedy in the NLRB\u2019s arsenal; if the Board has the authority and exercises it to sanction patent and incessant employer unfair labor practices, employees may be saddled for a prolonged period<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> with a union not enjoying majority support.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> Absent a card majority the Board cannot estimate with any degree of reliability how the employees would have responded in a free election.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> Inevitably, therefore, a nonmajority bargaining order replaces employee freedom of choice with a government agency\u2019s educated guess that the employees will fare better with a union than without one.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1445-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1379\">*1379</page-number>Nothing now in the text of the governing statute, or in its legislative history, suggests that Congress contemplated general authority in the Board to select or designate a union for employees, a majority of whom never signaled assent to the arrangement. Nor do lower court judges have secure guidance from the Supreme Court on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-5\">To discourage employer lawlessness, arguably the NLRB should be positioned to choose for the employees when the prospect of an untainted election, held within a reasonable time frame, appears remote. We recognize the appeal of the position that a nonmajority bargaining order may be the only potentially effective means to check an employer\u2019s unlawful conduct designed to nip a union\u2019s organizing campaign in the bud.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> Nonetheless, we believe that the statutory gap we face is too deep for an agency or court to fill. A fundamental policy choice is at stake: Is it ever appropriate to substitute an agency\u2019s \u201cbig (even if good) brother\u201d judgment for a majority of employees\u2019 express choice of a bargaining representative? That basic decision, we believe, should be left to Congress, as the organ of government accountable to the people for establishing the main lines of our national labor relations policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-6\">1. The <em>Gissel </em>dictum</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-7\">The Supreme Court has not yet confronted a case requiring it to decide whether the NLRB has the power to issue a bargaining order where the union has not shown majority status. In <em>NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., </em>395 U.S. 575, 613-14, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 1939-40, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969), however, the High Court, citing dictum from <em>NLRB v. S.S. Logan Packing Co., </em>386 F.2d 562, 570 (4th Cir.1967), appeared to contemplate the possibility of such an order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-9\"><em>Gissel </em>itself reversed a Fourth Circuit decision which had refused to sanction a bargaining order despite serious employer misconduct and in face of proof that the union had once obtained authorization cards from a majority of employees.<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> The Court observed, nonetheless, that its views and those of the Fourth Circuit were not far apart:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1445-10\">[T]he actual area of disagreement between our position here and that of the Fourth Circuit is not large as a practical matter. While refusing to validate the general use of a bargaining order in reliance on cards, the Fourth Circuit nevertheless left open the possibility of imposing a bargaining order, <em>without need of inquiry into majority status on the basis of cards or otherwise, </em>in \u201cexceptional\u201d cases marked by \u201coutrageous\u201d and \u201cpervasive\u201d unfair labor practices. Such an order would be an appropriate remedy for those practices, the court noted, if they are of \u201csuch a nature that their coercive effects cannot be eliminated by the application of traditional remedies, with the result that a fair and reliable election cannot be had.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1445-11\"><em>Gissel, </em>395 U.S. at 613-14, 89 S.Ct. at 1939-40 [quoting <em>Logan Packing, </em>386 F.2d at 570) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-12\">As the Supreme Court recognized, the Fourth Circuit\u2019s decisions in both <em>Gissel </em>and <em>Logan Packing </em>generally disfavored remedial bargaining orders. Indeed, the <em>Logan Packing </em>dictum indicated the Fourth Circuit\u2019s uncertainty whether a nonmajority bargaining order could be reconciled with the statute even in the most egregious circumstances: \u201c[I]n light of the guaranty of [NLRA] \u00a7 7 of employees\u2019 rights not to be represented [the use of a nonmajority bargaining order], <em>if ever appropriate, </em>must be reserved for extraordinary cases.\u201d 386 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1380\">*1380</page-number>at 570-71 (footnote omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1446-4\">The Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Gissel </em>dictum, reciting Fourth Circuit dictum, has been read to encompass cases with two characteristics: the employer\u2019s conduct falls into the most egregious category; the union\u2019s campaign at no point achieved a card majority.<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> Cases with these characteristics are commonly described as <em>Gissel </em>\u201ccategory one\u201d cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1446-5\">The Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Gissel, </em>however, is confined to a second category,<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> cases in which the union shows that at one point it had majority employee support:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1446-6\">The <em>only </em>effect of our holding here is to approve the Board\u2019s use of the bargaining order in less extraordinary cases marked by less pervasive practices which nonetheless still have the tendency to undermine majority strength and impede the election processes. The Board\u2019s authority to issue such an order on a lesser showing of employer misconduct is appropriate, <em>we should re-emphasize, where there is also a showing that at one point the union had a majority; in such a case, of course, effectuating ascertainable employee free choice becomes as important a goal as deterring employer misbehavior. </em>In fashioning a remedy in the exercise of its discretion, then, the Board can properly take into consideration the extensiveness of an employer\u2019s unfair practices in terms of their past effect on election conditions and the likelihood of their recurrence in the future. If the Board finds that the possibility of erasing the effects of past practices and of ensuring a fair election (or a fair rerun) by the use of traditional remedies, though present, is slight and that <em>employee sentiment once expressed through cards would, on balance, be better protected by a bargaining order, </em>then such an order should issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Agq\">395 U.S. at 614-15, 89 S.Ct. at 1940-41 (emphasis added) (citation omitted). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1381\">*1381</page-number>Court thus anchored its holding in <em>Gissel </em>to the NLRA\u2019s core principle that a majority of employees should be free to accept or reject union representation. A bargaining order in a \u201ccategory two\u201d case, the Court reasoned, not only \u201cdeter[s] employer misbehavior,\u201d it \u201ceffectuat[es] ascertainable employee free choice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1447-5\">In \u201ccategory one\u201d cases, by contrast, the employees\u2019 free choice is not ascertainable. There is tension between the objective of deterring unfair labor practices and effectuating <em>expressed </em>majority sentiment. Dictum reciting dictum, we believe, is not a reliable indicator of the Court\u2019s probable view on a tense issue. \u201c[A]ll that can fairly be said [of the <em>Gissel </em>dictum] is that the Court left open the issue of whether the Board has the statutory authority to issue a bargaining order in the absence of a showing that the union ever enjoyed majority support.\u201d<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> In deciding that issue, the statute itself should be our dominant guide.</p>\n<p id=\"b1447-6\">2. The Act\u2019s twin pillars: freedom of choice and majority rule in employee selection of representatives</p>\n<p id=\"b1447-7\">The Board is charged by section 10(c) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(c) (1976), \u201cwith the task of devising remedies to effectuate the policies of the Act.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Seven-Up Bottling Co., </em>344 U.S. 344, 346, 73 S.Ct. 287, 288, 97 L.Ed. 377 (1953).<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> In performing this task, the Board has wide discretion, subject to limited judicial review. <em>Fibreboard Paper Products Corp. v. NLRB, </em>379 U.S. 203, 216, 85 S.Ct. 398, 405, 13 L.Ed.2d 233 (1964). A prime function of that limited judicial review, however, is to ensure that the Board\u2019s decisions are consistent with the Act\u2019s basic premises. <em>See, e.g., H.K. Porter Co. v.

For a near half century, the Act has centrally stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqI\">Representatives designated or selected for the purposes of collective bargaining <em>by the majority of the employees </em>in a unit appropriate for such purposes, shall be the exclusive representatives of all the employees in such unit....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1448-5\">National Labor Relations Act, ch. 372, \u00a7 9(a), 49 Stat. 449, 453 (1935) (codified as amended at 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 159(a) (1976)) (emphasis added).

In the same vein, the Supreme Court has ruled that section 8(f) agreements do not shield unions from the Act\u2019s restrictions on picketing aimed at coercing an employer into recognizing a union or at pressuring employees into selecting a particular labor organization as its bargaining representative.<footnotemark>89</footnotemark> <em>See Local 103, International Association of Bridge, Structural &amp; Ornamental Iron Workers, supra; cf.

Nonmajority bargaining orders are not within the NLRB\u2019s current remedial discretion</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-12\">Our national labor relations policy is designed to \u201ceffectuat[e] ascertainable employee free choice\u201d and \u201cexpressed\u201d majority sentiment. <em>Gissel, </em>395 U.S. at 614, 89 S.Ct. at 1940. A nonmajority bargaining order departs from this design. Absent a union election victory or some other concrete manifestation of majority assent to union representation, it is impossible to project the employees\u2019 choice reliably; imposition of a bargaining order in these circumstances runs a high risk of opposing the majority\u2019s will.<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> Judge Wald points out effectively in dissent that the majority\u2019s will may also be frustrated when an employer\u2019s unlawful acts have eliminated the prospect of a reliable election. She would substitute for the coercion Conair imposed an opposing coercive force imposed by the government. Without a clear direction from Congress, we are not prepared to recognize administrative authority, or arrogate power to ourselves, to remedy one possible injustice by taking the substantial chance of imposing another.</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1384\">*1384</page-number>Administrative \u201cexpertise,\u201d we note, does not appear to command great weight on the question of the Board\u2019s statutory authority to issue a nonmajority bargaining order. The NLRB has seen egregious employer conduct on the order of Conair\u2019s before. Through decades of administering the Act, however, it issued, on its own initiative, no nonmajority bargaining order in response to an employer\u2019s \u201coutrageous\u201d and \u201cpervasive\u201d conduct. It did so, for the very first time, in this case; and it took that action by a bare, one-vote margin.</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-4\">Today, as in the past, the NLRB is torn over the nonmajority bargaining order issue. The current three-member majority maintains that, in an atmosphere chilled by an employer\u2019s egregious anti-union behavior, a nonmajority bargaining order ultimately will enhance employee freedom of choice.<footnotemark>91</footnotemark> Two members maintain, as insistently, that \u201cresolution of the conflict between majority rights and remedial needs\u201d by the issuance of nonmajority bargaining orders is \u201cfraught with danger for employee freedom of choice.\u201d<footnotemark>92</footnotemark> The only Supreme Court expression in point is inconclusive. Congress, the one time it authorized employer recognition of a union without a showing of majority employee support, did so within narrow confines.</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-5\">If Congress wishes to add to the construction industry exception and permit the Board to impose nonmajority bargaining orders as a sanction for an employer\u2019s flagrantly unlawful anti-union campaign, it may do so with whatever qualifications it deems appropriate to prevent the Board from veering too far from the freedom of choice-majority rule premise. Given the current shape of the statute, however, we believe Congress has not placed nonmajority bargaining orders within the NLRB\u2019s remedial discretion.<footnotemark>93</footnotemark> Strong arguments can be made for and against granting the Board the authority in question. Administrators and judges, in our view, should not endeavor to anticipate or preempt debate on and decision of this issue in the political arena.<footnotemark>94</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1450-10\">B. <em>Extraordinary Notice and Access Remedies Generally</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1450-11\">We set out earlier,<footnotemark>95</footnotemark> and restate here, a set of extraordinary notice and access provisions included in the Board\u2019s remedial order. Notice of Conair\u2019s violations and of the Board\u2019s cease and desist order, written in both Spanish and English and personally signed by the Company\u2019s president, is to be mailed to each employee at his or her home; copies are to be posted on Company premises; the notice is to be included in appropriate Conair publications; and it is to be published twice weekly for four weeks in local newspapers. For two years, Conair is to afford the Union access to Company bulletin boards, and to employees on Company premises in nonwork areas during nonwork time. A current list of employees\u2019 names and addresses is to be furnished to the Union. Also for two years, the Union is to be given notice of, and equal time and facilities to respond to, Company speeches to employees concerning union representation. Further, prior to any Board election held within two years in which the Union participates, the Union is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1385\">*1385</page-number>to be permitted to deliver a 30-minute speech to employees on Company time. <em>See </em>261 NLRB at 1195; <em>id. </em>at 1285 (ALJ Opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-6\">The Board has ordered similar measures in several other cases involving pervasive patterns of illegal employer conduct. This court recently reviewed and upheld an almost identical set of provisions in <em>Teamsters Local 115 v. NLRB, </em>640 F.2d 392 (D.C.Cir.), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>454 U.S. 837, 102 S.Ct. 141, 70 L.Ed.2d 118 (1981). With respect to the appropriateness of these measures, this case is indistinguishable from <em>Teamsters Local 115. </em>We have upheld the Board\u2019s determination here that Conair\u2019s extreme conduct ruled out a fair, reliable election in the foreseeable future. <em>Teamsters Local 115 </em>concerned an employer whose \u201cnumerous and egregious\u201d unfair labor practices \u201cmay have so poisoned the well\u201d that a fair election was \u201cno longer viable.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 396, 399-401.<footnotemark>96</footnotemark> Judge Mikva, writing for the court in <em>Teamsters Local 115, </em>cogently explained why extraordinary notice and access remedies are within the range of the Board\u2019s corrective action when employers conduct anti-union campaigns in a patently unlawful manner. We adopt his reasoning and uphold the Board\u2019s above-stated notice and access requirements.</p>\n<author id=\"b1451-7\">WALD, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1451-8\">C. <em>The Notice-Reading Order</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1451-9\">The Board, following the recommendation of the ALJ, ordered the president and owner of the company personally to read aloud to the assembled employees the Board\u2019s notice of employee rights and employer obligations. <em>Conair Corp., </em>261 NLRB 1189, 1289 (1982). The Employer argues that this requirement is punitive, oppressive and unwarranted. We are aware that there is support in the language of a recent decision of this court for the view that such a requirement is particularly unpleasant for the chief executive officer of a company, and should be reserved for extraordinary cases where no lesser remedy will achieve the remedial purpose. However, we uphold the Board\u2019s exercise of discretion in ordering this unusual remedy here because we find uniquely appropriate circumstances to warrant it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-14\">The requirement that a particular management official read to employees the Board\u2019s notice of their rights, although rarely used,<footnotemark>97</footnotemark> has been subject to judicial scrutiny in this court before. In <em>Teamsters Local 115 </em>v. <em>NLRB (Haddon House), </em>640 F.2d 392 (D.C.Cir.1981), this court refused to enforce the Board\u2019s requirement that the president of a company personally read the notice. The court reached that conclusion only after a painstaking review of the facts of the case, resting its reversal of the Board on \u201cthe lack of a particularized need\u201d for such an <em>ad hominem </em>remedy. <em>Id. </em>at 403. Most important for our purposes, the court found that the record in <em>Haddon House </em>revealed little personal involvement by the president in the employer\u2019s numerous unfair labor practices. The ALJ in that case had not recommended such a remedy, and the Board itself had articulated no special reason for singling out the president as the indispensable purveyor of the Board\u2019s findings and orders. The Board\u2019s only rationale \u2014 that the president\u2019s personal reassurance to the employees would have greater impact \u2014 would presumably have justified the same remedy in every unfair labor practice case. The court concluded in these circumstances that the personal dignity interests of the president outweighed the marginal benefits of requiring his personal participation in the public reading. The court in <em>Haddon House </em>was careful to note the presence of different circumstances in <em>United Dairy Farmers Cooperative Association, </em>242 NLRB 1026 (1979), <em>remanded on other grounds, </em>633 F.2d 1054 (3d Cir.1980), where the Board had also ordered the presi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1386\">*1386</page-number>dent personally to read the notice.<footnotemark>98</footnotemark> In that case the Board had emphasized the president\u2019s extensive personal participation in the violations sought to be remedied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-4\">Thus, <em>Haddon House </em>in no way foreclosed the possibility that in another case egregious circumstances might justify the acknowledged personal indignity occasioned by the Board\u2019s extraordinary order of a presidential reading. 640 F.2d at 403. Regrettably, the Board in this follow-up case again failed to address itself specifically to the special circumstances in the record that justified this remedy. But here, as distinguished from <em>Haddon House, </em>the ALJ who recommended the remedy, and whose findings and conclusions in this matter were adopted by the Board, made ample findings of fact to support the recommendation that the president personally be required to read the Board\u2019s notice to the employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-5\">The ALJ found that President Rizzuto <em>personally and repeatedly </em>communicated to employees the ominous threat to transfer operations to Hong Kong if the plant were unionized. 261 NLRB at 1267-68, 1271. The threat of a plant shutdown, itself held to be an unfair labor practice beyond the protection of the first amendment, <em>id. </em>at 1271, became the centerpiece of Conair\u2019s intense anti-union campaign. Subordinate officers, in repeating the threat to employees, stressed President Rizzuto\u2019s <em>personal animus </em>against unions as the basis for the threatened relocation. <em>Id. </em>at 1267, 1269. Rizzuto also <em>personally </em>threatened employees with the withdrawal of benefits such as Christmas parties and bonuses and the employees\u2019 profit-sharing plan if the Union won. Furthermore, Rizzuto <em>personally </em>promised his employees, in violation of section 8(a)(1), many improvements in working conditions and wages, including the \u201copen door policy\u201d by which grievances were solicited. <em>Id. </em>at 1264-65. Rizzuto, as well as other high company officials, issued this barrage of threats and promises at a series of unprecedented \u201ccaptive audience\u201d meetings, themselves held to violate section 8(a)(1). <em>Id. </em>at 1191 n. 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-9\">Thus it is apparent from the ALJ\u2019s findings, adopted by the Board, that throughout the relentless anti-union crusade at Conair Rizzuto committed himself personally to defeating the union drive by unlawful means, undermining any possibility of reasoned discussion by systematically promoting fear and promising improvements. Nevertheless, the Employer now asserts Rizzuto\u2019s personal dignity as a basis for challenging the requirement that he read aloud to employees the Board notice that Conair will not engage in such practices in the future.<footnotemark>99</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1452-10\">The president of a company may indeed ordinarily be entitled to protest as oppressive a requirement that he read to the employees, even on a single occasion,<footnotemark>100</footnotemark> a statement of their rights and his company\u2019s obligations under the Act. The dignity interests implicated by such a requirement must always be carefully weighed and may be decisive when unfair labor practices, however egregious, are carried out entirely or primarily by subordinate management personnel. But it is the pervasive personal involvement of President Rizzuto in the unfair labor practices in this case that creates the need and justification for his personal involvement in their remedy. In order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1387\">*1387</page-number>dispel the atmosphere of intimidation created in large part by the president\u2019s own statements and actions, it is justifiable to require at least one formal declaration by him personally that the employees\u2019 statutory rights will be respected in the future. The Board\u2019s order can thus reasonably be said to effectuate the purposes of the Act, and is not punitive, as argued by the Employer. While we emphasize that a remedy such as that ordered here should be reserved for extraordinary circumstances giving rise to a particular remedial need, it is important to recall that the notice to be read by the president is nothing more nor less than an official statement of the statutory rights and obligations found to have been violated by the Employer. Under the special circumstances of this case, we will enforce this aspect of the Board\u2019s order.<footnotemark>101</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1453-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-6\">For the reasons stated (1) we decline to enforce the portion of the Board\u2019s \u201cmake whole\u201d directives premised on Conair\u2019s alleged discharge of strikers on April 22, 1977; (2) we decline to enforce the Board\u2019s bargaining order; (3) in all other respects we deny Conair\u2019s petition for review and grant the Board\u2019s cross-petition for enforcement of its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-7\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1425-17\">. <em>NLRB v.

Eighty-one strikers were reinstated from October 4, 1977 to November 7, 1977. The ALJ\u2019s proposed order required Conair to make whole those striking employees for wages lost during the period from September 26, 1977, to \u201cthe date of a bona fide offer of reinstatement by [Conair], or their actual reinstatement as the case may be.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1283.</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-10\">Actually discharged unfair labor practice strikers, however, are entitled to back pay from the date of discharge \u2014 even absent an unconditional offer on their part to return to work. <em>See </em>Abilities and Goodwill, Inc., 241 NLRB 27, 27-28 (1979).

However, the two cases have these common features: in both, the company president (as well as others) repeatedly threatened discharges and plant closure; the company actually discharged employees, granted benefits, coercively interrogated employees, and created the impression of surveillance; the company responded swiftly and severely to the beginning of the unionization drive and continued committing unfair labor practices over an extended period; and in both cases the coercive message was effectively spread throughout the bargaining unit. Moreover, unlike the employer in <em>United Dairy II, </em>Conair also engaged in extensive solicitation of employee grievances, threatened to terminate a variety of employee benefits, and delayed reinstatement of unfair labor practice strikers. <em>Compare United Dairy II, </em>257 NLRB at 772-74 <em>with </em>Part I, <em>supra </em>pp. 1360-1361.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-8\">The NLRB has found \u201coutrageous\u201d and \u201cpervasive\u201d employer misconduct in other cases.

Prior to its reference to the Fourth Circuit\u2019s <em>Logan Packing </em>dictum, the Supreme Court had set out its reasons for disagreeing with the Fourth Circuit\u2019s approach \u201con all major issues,\u201d 395 U.S. at 613, 89 S.Ct. at 1939, including that Circuit\u2019s distrust of union authorization cards, its view that the 1947 Taft-Hartley amendments had ruled out bargaining orders on the basis of card majorities, and its refusal to accept the Board\u2019s <em>Cumberland Shoe </em>doctrine. <em>Id. </em>at 595-610, 89 S.Ct. at 1930-1938. The Court then softened its multiple rejections of Fourth Circuit positions by pointing out that the Circuit had \u201cleft open the possibility\u201d of issuing bargaining orders without inquiry into majority status in sufficiently egregious cases. <em>Id. </em>at 613, 89 S.Ct. at 1939; see <em>Logan Packing, </em>386 F.2d at 570 (Board \u201cmay have the power\u201d to impose a bargaining order as a remedy for egregious unfair labor practices).</p>\n<p id=\"b1446-9\">Because <em>Logan Packing, </em>in dictum, had raised the possibility of Board-imposed bargaining orders in \u201cexceptional cases\u201d marked by \u201coutrageous\u201d and \u201cpervasive\u201d unfair labor practices, the Supreme Court in <em>Gissel </em>was able to say that \u201cthe actual area of disagreement between our position here and that of the Fourth Circuit is not large.\u201d <em>Gissel, </em>395 U.S. at 613, 89 S.Ct. at 1939. Thus, the High Court\u2019s concentration apparently was on the quality of employer conduct <em>Logan Packing </em>indicated might justify a bargaining order, not on the notion that such an order could issue \u201cwithout need of inquiry into majority status.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1446-12\">The probability that the High Court referred only casually to dispensing with inquiry into majority status is heightened by the statement the Court made immediately after it set out the <em>Logan Packing </em>dictum:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1446-13\">The Board itself, we should add, has long had a similar policy of issuing a bargaining order, in the absence of a \u00a7 8(a)(5) violation or even a bargaining demand, when that was the only available, effective remedy for substantial unfair labor practices.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1446-14\">Gissel, 395 U.S. at 614, 89 S.Ct. at 1940.

A third category <em>Gissel </em>mentioned includes violations not serious or extensive enough to warrant a bargaining order because remedies concededly within the Board\u2019s authority would adequately ensure a fair election. <em>See </em>395 U.S. at 615, 89 S.Ct. at 1941.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"85\">\n<p id=\"b1447-8\">. <em>United Dairy I, </em>242 NLRB at 1040 (Member Penello, concurring in part and dissenting in part), <em>quoted in Conair, </em>261 NLRB at 1196 (Chairman Van de Water, concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b1447-9\">Judge Wald suggests that in <em>Sinclair, </em>one of the four cases the <em>Gissel </em>opinion resolved, the Supreme Court in fact approved issuance of a bargaining order without inquiry into the union\u2019s majority status. <em>See </em>Wald dissent at 1392. She apparently reads the Supreme Court\u2019s words, \u201ceven in the absence of a \u00a7 8(a)(5) violation,\u201d to mean \u201cwithout need of inquiry into majority status.\u201d We do not comprehend why these statements should be regarded as synonymous. At the time the Court decided <em>Gissel, </em>Board doctrine had it that an employer could in good faith refuse to bargain in face of a union\u2019s proffer of a card majority without committing an \u00a7 8(a)(5) violation. <em>See, e.g., </em>Aaron Bros. Co., 158 NLRB 1077 (1966). Thus, an \u00a7 8(a)(5) violation required a card majority <em>plus </em>something more \u2014 employer bad faith in rejecting a bargaining request. When the <em>Gissel </em>Court, in discussing <em>Sinclair, </em>said a bargaining order could issue \u201ceven in the absence of a \u00a7 8(a)(5) violation\u201d it likely meant the employer\u2019s bad faith in refusing to bargain, not the union\u2019s card majority, could be dispensed with. Supporting this interpretation is the sentence immediately following the ones quoted in Judge Wald\u2019s dissent in which the Court explicitly referred to \u201cthe union\u2019s majority.\u201d 395 U.S. at 615, 89 S.Ct. at 1941. In short, the point that the union in <em>Sinclair </em>had once achieved majority support was not' an item merely raised in stating the facts of the case, <em>id. </em>at 589, 89 S.Ct. at 1927, only to be thereafter set aside as irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1447-14\">While the Supreme Court\u2019s discussion of <em>Sinclair </em>is less than crisp, we doubt that more is fairly extractable from the High Court\u2019s words than this: if the employer engaged in sufficiently egregious coercive practices and the union once had majority support, then even if the employer\u2019s grave offenses do not include a \u00a7 8(a)(5) violation, a bargaining order may issue forthwith, <em>i.e., </em>without further Board exploration of prospects for an untainted rerun election in the foreseeable future.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"86\">\n<p id=\"b1447-15\">.

We confess to being rather mystified as to the legal basis for the position taken by Judge Ginsburg in her dissent. The opinion does not rely, as <em>Haddon House </em>ultimately did, on the particular facts; it appears even to concede that if the remedy is ever authorized it is appropriate here. Nor do we believe that Judge Ginsburg rests her argument heavily on the suggestion, contrary to the Board\u2019s judgment, that a reading by the president might be less effective; such an intrusion into the expert judgment of the Board would certainly be unwarranted. Finally, the appeal to the principle barring a specific performance remedy for breach of personal service contracts is inapt. That principle operates in a factual and legal context too remote to serve as the basis for overturning the Board in an exercise of remedial discretion. Yet no other legal foundation for this position is evident. The opinion cites no statutory provision barring such a remedy. Although alluding to the supposedly \u201cpunitive quality\u201d of the order, Ginsburg dissent at 2, the dissent does not actually appear to argue that the order is \u201ca patent attempt to achieve ends other than those which can fairly be said to effectuate the policies of the Act.\u201d <em>See Fibre-board Paper Products Corp. v.

I find it paradoxical, yea incomprehensible, that they can accept the Board\u2019s findings of massive violations of the Act by the Employer, undermining embryonic labor support, and then infer from the \u201cpurpose\u201d of the Act an intent of Congress to deprive the Board of the only remedy it believes can at some point in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1388\">*1388</page-number>near future restore the employees\u2019 right to make a free choice to have or not have a union. Either the Board is totally offbase in its findings, or my colleagues have usurped for themselves a mighty responsibility in emasculating the Board\u2019s remedial authority in extreme cases to fulfill its congressional mandate to \u201ceffectuate the policies of the Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-4\">I. The Board\u2019s Findings</p>\n<p id=\"ayp-dedup-0\">The Board found not only that Conair had violated the Act, but that the violations had been so outrageous and pervasive that, in the Board\u2019s words,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"app-dedup-0\">neither our traditional remedies nor even our extraordinary access and notice remedies can effectively dissipate the lingering effects of Respondent\u2019s massive and unrelenting coercive conduct. By this conduct, Respondent has foreclosed any possibility of holding a fair representation election. Under these exceptional circumstances, we find that a remedial bargaining order is the only way to restore to employees their statutory right to make a free and uncoerced determination whether they wish to be represented in collective bargaining by a labor organization.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1454-5\">261 NLRB at 1193. It was on the basis of these findings that the Board ordered the Employer to bargain with the Union, in spite of the Union\u2019s inability to demonstrate, through authorization cards or otherwise, that it had at any time obtained the support of a majority of the employees eligible to vote. The Board also found, however, that there was a reasonable basis to conclude that the <em>Union would have enjoyed majority support </em>but for the Employer\u2019s unfair labor practices, relying primarily upon the fact that the Union at one point had the support of forty-six percent of the employees. <em>Id. </em>at 1194.</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-9\">Certainly conclusions as to the predicted effect of the Employer\u2019s illegal practices on the election process, the ineffectiveness of alternative remedies, and the probable effect of that illegal conduct on the Union\u2019s original ability to obtain majority support involve, even more than ordinary questions of fact, the utilization by the Board of its accumulated experience and expert judgment. The Supreme Court has underscored the necessity for judicial deference when reviewing such determinations. Commenting on the assertion by a circuit court that a cease and desist order and the posting of notices ordinarily would effectively remedy unfair labor practices, the Court stated, \u201c[i]t is for the Board and not the courts ... to make that determination, based on its expert estimate as to the effects on the election process of unfair labor practices of varying intensity.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., </em>395 U.S. 575, 612 n. 32, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 1939 n. 32, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969). Of course, the Board must always support its conclusions with a reasoned explanation and substantial evidence in the record. It did so here.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1455-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1389\">*1389</page-number>In evaluating the impact of the unfair labor practices in <em>Conair, </em>the Board followed its analysis in <em>United Dairy Farmers Cooperative Association, 257 </em>NLRB 772, 774 (1981) <em>(United Dairy II), </em>which identified the \u201cgravity, extent, timing, and constant repetition\u201d of violations as the key factors bearing upon whether the employer\u2019s illegal conduct was so outrageous and pervasive as to foreclose the possibility of a fair election. 261 NLRB at 1192. Summarizing its findings as follows, the Board laid heavy stress on the repetition and insidious timing of the violations committed by this Employer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1455-5\">The chilling effect on employee rights of a single discharge or threat of plant closure is difficult enough to erase. Several repetitions of these and other violations of the Act multiply the strength and duration of the impression left on employees. The same multiplier effect results from the manner in which Respondent timed its unlawful conduct \u2014 i.e., swift and severe initial retaliation against the Union\u2019s organizational efforts, a lengthy campaign of unfair labor practices, an increase in violations as the election neared, and two unlawful discharges even after the election. In moment and duration, the timing of Respondent\u2019s unfair labor practices underscored its enduring resolve to oppose unionization by any means and deeply imprinted on employee memories the drastic consequences of seeking union representation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1456-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1390\">*1390</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 1193. I agree wholeheartedly with the majority that \u201cwe have no cause in this case to second guess the NLRB\u2019s expert appraisal of the quality and effects of Co-nair\u2019s unlawful activities.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We have today unanimously upheld the Board\u2019s judgment that the Employer\u2019s coercive conduct has left such an indelible mark on the workforce that not even the Board\u2019s extraordinary notice and access remedies would restore to employees their right to make an un-coerced decision about union representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-4\">The Board also found that it was reasonable to conclude that the Union would have enjoyed majority support but for the Employer\u2019s egregious conduct. The Board\u2019s finding on this issue, which I consider critical,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> rests on precisely the same kind of expertise and the same body of precedent, and is thus entitled to the same degree of deference as its other conclusions concerning the seriousness and probable impact of particular unfair labor practices. Yet the majority swiftly passes over the Board\u2019s conclusion as to the probable effect of the coercive practices on the Union\u2019s initial ability to gain majority support, asserting that \u201c[ajbsent a card majority, the Board cannot forecast with any degree of reliability how the employees would have responded in a free election.\u201d Maj. Op. at 1378-1379. This cavalier rejection of the Board\u2019s expert judgment is inconsistent with the posture of deference properly assumed with respect to the Board\u2019s closely related conclusions unanimously upheld here. Furthermore, the main study cited in support of the majority\u2019s statement actually confirms the Board\u2019s premise that serious unfair labor practices by employers have a significant effect on the level of support for the union.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Finally, in this case the majority agrees with the Board that the campaign of coercion was exceptionally intense and pervasive. It is in light of that assessment that I briefly review the factual basis for the Board\u2019s conclusion. The Union began its organizing campaign in March and by April 11 had the support of about forty-six percent of the employees. 261 NLRB at 1205. Yet only days after the onset of the Employer\u2019s campaign on April 4, a group of twenty-five to thirty employees approached the Union, stating that the Employer\u2019s threats had made them fear losing their jobs; several requested the return of their cards. <em>Id. </em>at 1191. The Union secured only fourteen authorization cards after April 11, the day the strike began. <em>Id. </em>at 1205 n. 15. If the Employer\u2019s conduct had such an immediate impact on employees who had already expressed their support for the Union, it was certainly reasonable for the Board to conclude that it may have had an equally inhibiting impact on the relatively small number of undecided employees\u2014 about fifteen \u2014 that would have sent the union over the fifty percent mark and into majority status for recognition purposes. There is little question but that the Union would have continued to gain adherents but for the Employer\u2019s relentless anti-union <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1391\">*1391</page-number>campaign. The Board\u2019s conclusion in this respect is thus supported by adequate reasoning, established Board precedent concerning the impact of various unfair labor practices, and substantial evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-4\">II. The Board\u2019s Authority to Issue a Non-Majority Bargaining Order</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-5\">The Board rested its claim of statutory authority in large part on the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Gissel Packing Co., </em>395 U.S. 575, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969), and on subsequent judicial interpretations of that decision. I, too, find support for the Board\u2019s authority in the language and reasoning of these cases, recognizing that, as always with Supreme Court dictum and even with Supreme Court holdings, what the Court giveth it can as easily taketh away. In any event, because the issue of nonmajority bargaining orders has been smoldering on the Board and in this court for decades, I believe a searching inquiry into the language, legislative history, and underlying policies of the Act, as well as the practical effects on labor relations of upholding or overturning the Board, is called for before pronouncing judgment on either side of the issue. I find in none of these sources, singly or cumulatively, any contrary indicators to what the Supreme Court appeared to be saying in <em>Gissel. </em>On the contrary, I conclude from my inquiry that the issuance of a non-majority bargaining order under exceptional circumstances like these may well be the only way to \u201ceffectuate the policies of the Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-6\">A. <em>The </em>Gissel <em>Decision and Category I Cases</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1457-7\">In <em>Gissel, </em>the Court decided that a majority of union authorization cards, unambiguous on their face, constituted \u201cconvincing evidence of majority support.\u201d If an employer refused to bargain with a union that had obtained a majority of valid cards, and at the same time committed independent unfair labor practices tending to undermine the union\u2019s majority strength and impede the election process, the Board could issue a bargaining order as a remedy even if the union subsequently lost the election.</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-9\">The Court went on to summarize in some detail the factors that determine the appropriateness of a bargaining order in three categories of cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1457-10\">Despite our reversal of the Fourth Circuit below in Nos. 573 and 691 on all major issues, the actual area of disagreement between our position here and that of the Fourth Circuit is not large as a practical matter. While refusing to validate the general use of a bargaining order in reliance on cards, the Fourth Circuit nevertheless left open the possibility of imposing a bargaining order, <em>without need of inquiry into majority status on the basis of cards or otherwise, </em>in \u201cexceptional\u201d cases marked by \u201coutrageous\u201d and \u201cpervasive\u201d unfair labor practices. Such an order would be an appropriate remedy for those practices, the court noted, if they are of \u201csuch a nature that their coercive effects cannot be eliminated by the application of traditional remedies, with the result that a fair and reliable election cannot be had.\u201d The Board itself, we should add, has long had a similar policy of issuing a bargaining order, in the absence of a \u00a7 8(a)(5) violation or even a bargaining demand, when that was the only available, effective remedy for substantial unfair labor practices.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1457-11\">The only effect of our holding here is to approve the Board\u2019s use of the bargaining order in less extraordinary cases marked by less pervasive practices which nonetheless still have the tendency to undermine majority strength and impede the election processes. The Board\u2019s authority to issue such an order on a <em>lesser showing of employer misconduct </em>is appropriate, we should reemphasize, <em>where there is also a showing that at one point the union had a majority; </em>in such a case, of course, effectuating ascertainable employee free choice becomes as important a goal as deterring employer misbehavior.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aet-dedup-0\">395 U.S. at 613-14, 89 S.Ct. at 1939-40 (citations omitted) (emphasis added). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1392\">*1392</page-number>Court thus reinforced its approval of the \u201cCategory I\u201d non-majority bargaining order described by the Fourth Circuit by indicating that a showing of majority support is necessary only in \u201cless extraordinary cases\u201d falling into Category II. The Court also described a third category of even less serious offenses in which no bargaining order was appropriate without an election. <em>Id. </em>at 615, 89 S.Ct. at 1941.</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-4\">The Court\u2019s description of Category I cases of outrageous and pervasive violations where a bargaining order is warranted \u201cwithout need of inquiry into majority status\u201d is characterized by the majority as mere dictum, a palliative to the rejected and presumably dejected Fourth Circuit.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> I am not as certain as the majority that the \u201cdictum\u201d can be so easily dismissed. In one of the four cases decided by the Court in <em>Gissel, </em>the Court appears to have applied the analysis it described as appropriate for Category I eases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1458-5\">In <em>Sinclair, </em>No. 585, the Board made a finding, left undisturbed by the First Circuit, that the employer\u2019s threats of reprisal were so coercive that, even in the absence of a \u00a7 8(a)(5) violation, a bargaining order would have been necessary to repair the unlawful effect of those threats. The Board therefore did not have to make the determination called for in the intermediate situation above that the risks that a fair rerun election might not be possible were too great to disregard the desires of the employees already expressed through the cards.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1458-9\"><em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted). As the majority suggests, the court\u2019s statement is cryptic, and is conceivably open to an interpretation that its reference to the \u201cabsence of a \u00a7 8(a)(5) violation\u201d alludes only to the employer\u2019s possible lack of bad faith in refusing to bargain. <em>See </em>Maj. Op. at n. 85. But the language is also open to a reading that the Court did not feel it necessary to inquire into the majority status of the union in disposing of the <em>Sinclair </em>case. Because the extreme nature of the employer\u2019s coercive conduct made a fair election impossible and therefore placed <em>Sinclair </em>into Category I, the Board did not have to meet the Category II requirements of showing that the union had obtained a card majority and that a fair election was too unlikely to disregard this showing of majority support. This court has previously adopted the latter interpretation, declaring that the Supreme Court in <em>Gissel </em>\u201capproved the bargaining order entered against Sinclair without a showing of a prior union majority because the facts indicated \u2018exceptional\u2019 or \u2018outrageous\u2019 unfair labor practices.\u201d <em>Amalgamated Clothing Workers v. NLRB, </em>527 F.2d 803, 808 (D.C.Cir.1975), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Jimmy Richard Co. v. NLRB, </em>426 U.S. 907, 96 S.Ct. 2229, 48 L.Ed.2d 832 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-10\">Virtually every other court I know of has interpreted the <em>Gissel </em>decision similarly, assuming the existence of an extreme category of cases in which a bargaining order may issue in the absence of a card majority.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Only recently, however, did the case materialize.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In <em>United Dairy Farmers Coopera</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1393\">*1393</page-number><em>tive Association </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>633 F.2d 1054 (3d Cir.1980), the Third Circuit faced the issue for the first time in a union appeal from the refusal by a divided Board to issue a bargaining order in a <em>Gissel </em>Category I situation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> After a careful analysis of the <em>Gissel </em>decision and its rationale, the court held that \u201cthe Board has the remedial authority to issue a bargaining order in the absence of a card majority and election victory if the employer has committed such \u2018outrageous\u2019 and \u2018pervasive\u2019 unfair labor practices that there is no reasonable possibility that a free and uncoerced election could be held.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1069.</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-5\">Nonetheless, despite the <em>Gissel </em>pronouncement and a contemporary consensus of circuit court interpretations of it to the effect that the Board may issue a non-majority bargaining order to counter extraordinarily flagrant employer violations, our court decides today that the Board has no statutory authority ever to issue such an order. <em>See also Teamsters Local 115 v. NLRB (Haddon House), </em>640 F.2d 392 (D.C. Cir.1981) (earlier misgivings about such authority).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> With the understandable queasiness experience brings from relying too heavily on predictions of what the Supreme Court will do in the future based on what it has said in the past, I turn now to an examination of the language and legislative history of the Act to see whether the Board\u2019s interpretation of <em>Gissel </em>will hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-6\">B. <em>The Language of the Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1459-7\">The Board points to the broad remedial mandate of section 10(c), empowering it to order a party \u201cto take such affirmative action ... as will effectuate the policies of [the Act]\u201d once it has found a violation. The Employer asserts and the majority now decides that the Board\u2019s seemingly wide authority under section 10(c) is in fact securely bound by a fundamental principle of majority rule incorporated in section 9(a) which acts as an absolute limitation on the Board\u2019s authority to issue a non-majority bargaining order, whatever the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-12\">Section 9(a) states in relevant part: \u201cRepresentatives designated or selected for the purposes of collective bargaining by the majority of the employees in a unit appropriate for such purposes shall be the exclusive representatives of all the employees in such unit for the purposes of collective bargaining ...\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 159(a). The Employer and the panel majority read the exclusive majority representation rule of section 9(a) into section 7, which provides that \u201c[e]mployees shall have the right to self-organization, ... to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, ... and shall also have the right to refrain from any or all such activities.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 157. They say that together the two sections mean that the employees\u2019 right to bargain through representatives chosen by majority rule is violated by any Board order that requires an employer to bargain with a union that cannot demonstrate that it has at any time enjoyed the support of a majority of the employees, regardless of the egregiousness of the employer\u2019s conduct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1394\">*1394</page-number>In addition, the Employer points to section 8(a)(2), which makes it an unfair labor practice for an employer \u201cto dominate or interfere with the formation ... of any labor organization,\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(2), and which has been interpreted to prohibit an employer from voluntarily- recognizing a union that represents only a minority of its employees. <em>International Ladies\u2019 Garment Workers\u2019 Union v. </em>NLRB, 366 U.S. 731, 81 S.Ct. 1603, 6 L.Ed.2d 762 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-4\">Sections 9(a) and 8(a)(2) define conduct constituting unfair labor practices on the part of employers. They appear to have no direct application to the scope of the Board\u2019s remedial authority when employers have been found guilty of unfair labor practices. Congress most assuredly knew how to limit the Board\u2019s authority. For example, section 9(b), following directly after section 9(a) and dealing with determination of bargaining units, clearly limits the Board\u2019s power. It provides \u201cthat the Board shall not (1) decide that any unit is appropriate for such purposes if such unit includes both professional employees and employees who are not professional employees unless a majority of such professional employees vote for inclusion in such unit.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 159(b). It seems obvious to me that neither section 9(a) nor any other section of the Act dealing with unfair labor practices by an <em>employer </em>can be automatically read as an explicit limitation on the authority of the <em>Board </em>to take remedial action as to those same unfair labor practices.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1460-5\">The majority\u2019s argument that section 9(a)\u2019s majority principle, in conjunction with section 7\u2019s guarantee of freedom of choice, limits the Board's remedial authority in all cases and for all time ignores the quintessential paradox of this case. The Employer has been found to have engaged in an intense campaign of egregious unfair labor practices in complete and deliberate disregard of the section 7 right of employees freely to choose their bargaining representatives. Now the Employer \u2014 and the panel majority \u2014 emerge as the champions of that very right of choice: they would invoke that right as an absolute bar against the Board\u2019s authority to remedy the Employer\u2019s violation by issuing a bargaining order. But in fact, by my colleagues\u2019 own admission they simply leave the employees in an eternal limbo, for the Board has determined that a bargaining order in the short run is the only means of restoring to the employees their statutory right freely to choose whether or not to be represented in the long run by a union. Thus both the Board and the panel/Employer assert the same statutory sections as the basis for their diametrically opposite positions on the permissibility of a non-majority bargaining order. I am particularly reluctant to reject the Board\u2019s construction of its remedial authority on the basis of a purported conflict with the very statutory language it is claiming to implement. The bottom line here is how the employees, having been subjected to relentless employer pressures not to choose a union, can be best restored to some kind of equilibrium in which they can choose freely for or against the Union. The Board, as the expert in the field, says this can happen only if a short-term bar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1395\">*1395</page-number>gaining order is put into effect; the panel says that such an order is against statutory policy and that the employees therefore should be left in the <em>status quo. </em>Certainly the language of the statute alone does not compel Board paralysis of this sort.</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-5\">C. <em>Legislative History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1461-6\">There is nothing in the legislative history of the Wagner Act or subsequent amendments to indicate that Congress meant to withhold this remedial power from the Board. The majority\u2019s citations prove only that Congress provided a mechanism for employees in the usual situation to pick or reject their union by majority rule and required employers to abide by that decision. There is not a single word, however, to suggest that, if a fair election could not be held because of employer interference, the Board\u2019s remedial powers were absolutely restricted by majority rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-7\">Of course, Congress in passing the Wagner Act embraced the principle of majority rule in the selection of bargaining representatives by employees. S.Rep. No. 573, 74th Cong., 1st Sess. 13-14 (1935); H.R.Rep. No. 972, 74th Cong., 1st Sess. 18-19 (1935). It did so to obviate refusals by employers to recognize a labor organization that represented the majority of employees, and their attempts instead to divide employees by bargaining with individuals or with a company union that represented only a minority. Congress thus associated minority bargaining by the employer with collusive and complacent company unions; it was also worried about destructive competition among unions caused by employer bargaining separately with factions or individuals. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 972 at 19. These dangers arise where an organized majority is denied recognition; they have nothing to do with a situation like this where the Board orders the employer to bargain with the only employee organization that reasonably could be expected to have gained majority support but for the outrageous and pervasive unfair labor practices of the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-8\">Throughout the Act\u2019s passage, the principle of majority rule was always discussed in the context of an employer\u2019s bargaining obligations or the employees\u2019 representation choices; it was never discussed as a limitation on the Board\u2019s powers. Indeed, the Act\u2019s major sponsor, Senator Wagner, explicitly approved the possibility of a remedial bargaining order in the absence of a current majority when he approved the result in <em>Texas &amp; New Orleans Railroad Co. v. Brotherhood of Railway &amp; Steamship Clerks, </em>281 U.S. 548, 50 S.Ct. 427, 74 L.Ed. 1034 (1930). <em>See Hearings on H.R. 6288 Before the House Comm, on Labor, </em>74th Cong., 1st Sess. 21-22 (1935) (statement of Sen. Wagner). In that case, decided under the Railway Labor Act, the Supreme Court upheld the order of the district court \u201cdisestablishing\u201d a company union which could show current majority support, and reinstating the union that had enjoyed majority support before the company\u2019s illegal and eoercive campaign against it. The company was ordered to recognize the union that currently had only minority support until the employees rejected it in a fair and un-coerced election. 281 U.S. at 557, 571, 50 S.Ct. at 429, 434. In addressing that case, Senator Wagner implicitly acknowledged that strict application of the principle of majority rule must sometimes give way to the need to remedy illegal employer practices in order to permit employees genuine freedom of choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-10\">In general, however, non-majority bargaining orders as remedial measures were not discussed. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 972 at 21 (examples of remedial measures within Board\u2019s power). I infer from this silence at most either that Congress never conceived of the extraordinary circumstances giving rise to the need for a non-majority bargaining order or that Congress did not wish to constrain the Board\u2019s choice of remedial measures in this manner. I certainly see no way to infer, as the majority does, that the Act meant to take away from the Board this specific remedy without ever identifying it. The legislative history of the Wagner Act accordingly gives no cause to overrule the Board in its choice of remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1396\">*1396</page-number>Nor does the history of subsequent amendments to the Wagner Act. The Taft-Hartley amendments in 1947 were addressed in part to perceived excesses by the Board. For instance, they limited the Board\u2019s power to certify bargaining representatives by means other than secret ballot election, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 159(c);<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> they provided for a process by which employees could decertify a bargaining representative they no longer supported, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 159(c)(l)(A)(ii); \u00a7 159(e)(1); they prohibited certain kinds of \u201cclosed shop\u201d agreements which limited employment to union members, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(3). The Supreme Court in <em>Gissel, </em>however, demonstrated the irrelevance of any of these changes to the Board\u2019s independent power to issue a remedial bargaining order, noting the critical distinction that \u201c[a] certified union has the benefit of numerous special privileges which are not accorded unions recognized voluntarily or under a bargaining order.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., </em>395 U.S. 575, 598-99, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 1932, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Congress did not deal either in 1947 or in later amendments with the kind of remedial order issued by the Board here, which neither certifies a union nor compels union membership.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-4\">The majority argues that Congress\u2019 addition in 1959 of section 8(f), authorizing pre-hire agreements with unions in the construction industry even in the absence of a prior showing of majority support, reinforces the conclusion that there is no other authorized exception to the principle of majority rule. I disagree. If Congress had not passed section 8(f), employers in the construction industry, like other employers, would be barred by section 8(a)(2) from voluntarily concluding agreements with a union that cannot demonstrate majority support. Congress recognized the special needs of the construction industry and permitted such voluntary agreements. Thus, section 8(f) is an exception to a general rule that the Board\u2019s remedial order here does not contravene. In other words, the majority\u2019s view of the significance of section 8(f) is merely a recapitulation of the Employer\u2019s argument that the Act\u2019s prohibition on voluntary minority bargaining precludes a remedial non-majority bargaining order. I do not believe that this prohibition has any bearing upon the power of the Board to order bargaining where the employer has by extremely coercive conduct prevented the union from gaining a majority. <em>See infra </em>at 1367.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-8\">In sum, neither language nor legislative history contains anything to show that Congress intended to prohibit the Board from issuing a non-majority bargaining order if it is truly necessary to \u201ceffectuate the purposes of the Act.\u201d The centrality of the majority rule principle in the Act only reinforces the paradox that results from the majority\u2019s ruling today: the Board is precluded by the principle of majority rule from issuing a non-majority bargaining order when the Board has found (and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1397\">*1397</page-number>panel majority has conceded) that such an order is the only effective way of restoring to employees their right to make an un-coerced majority decision about union representation. I find such statutory creativity disturbing, to say the least.</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-5\">D. <em>The Policy of the Act: Majority Rule and Employee Freedom of Choice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1463-6\">The majority\u2019s argument\u2014like the Employer\u2019s\u2014appears to boil down to one of statutory ambience: Even if there is no explicit prohibition of a non-majority bargaining order in the language or legislative history of the Act, the entire statutory scheme of collective bargaining rests on the premise of majority rule and its corollary, the prohibition against minority bargaining set out in <em>International Ladies\u2019 Garment Workers\u2019 Union v. NLRB, </em>366 U.S. 731, 738, 81 S.Ct. 1603, 1607, 6 L.Ed.2d 762 (1961). Assuming that this is true, however, there is a familiar principle that the need to remedy a violation often justifies and even requires measures that might be unauthorized if undertaken on the actor\u2019s own volition. For example, state-imposed racial quotas, in the absence of an arguable constitutional violation, may run afoul of the fourteenth amendment under <em>Bakke.</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>But courts clearly have the power to order race-conscious remedies for proven constitutional violations.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This principle also operates throughout the administration of the Act in contexts no longer in dispute. Thus, an employer would presumably violate the Act\u2019s prohibition on minority bargaining if he voluntarily recognized and bargained with a union that, although it once had a card majority, had since lost a Board election. Yet <em>Gissel </em>clearly authorizes the Board to order bargaining under such circumstances if the employer has committed substantial independent unfair labor practices. The prohibition on minority bargaining thus has no application to the permissibility of a bargaining order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-11\">The principle of majority rule, while indeed central to the scheme of employer-employee rights and obligations, has never been mechanically applied to bind the Board in the remedial area. The <em>Gissel </em>situation is only one of several recognized by the Supreme Court in which the Board, pursuant to and consistent with the policies of the Act, may require an employer to bargain with a union that cannot demonstrate current majority status,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> or to cease bargaining with a union that does appear to have the support of a majority.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Furthermore, the Board is clearly authorized to invalidate for cause the results of elections in which a majority of employees expressed their preference either for<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> or against<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> a union.</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1398\">*1398</page-number>In truth, the majority rule principle is inextricably tied in the statutory scenario to the unfair labor practice prohibitions against employer coercion, domination and discrimination contained in sections 8(a)(1), (2) and (3) of the Act. These limitations on employer conduct during organizational campaigns are more severe than we would tolerate in the political process, but they are acceptable in the labor context precisely because of the inherent potential for economic coercion of employees by the employer. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Gissel,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"A40\">what is basically at stake is the establishment of a nonpermanent, limited relationship between the employer, his economically dependent employee and his union agent, not the election of legislators or the enactment of legislation whereby that relationship is ultimately defined and where the independent voter may be freer to listen more objectively and employers as a class freer to talk.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aia-dedup-0\">395 U.S. at 617-18, 89 S.Ct. at 1941-42. The entire statutory scheme is based on the clear congressional endorsement of the notion that only in the absence of illegal employer coercion can a majority of employees make the kind of free choice for or against union representation that is at the heart of the majority rule principle incorporated in the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-4\">Thus it is heavy irony that this majority rule principle should now be touted to prevent the Board from dealing with the most intimidating tactics adopted by employers to discourage union representation. We have here a case in which the Employer has been found guilty by the Board and this court of such outrageous and pervasive violations of the Act as to destroy any electoral atmosphere in which employees may express free choice. Under these circumstances, the vigorous assertion by the Employer and the majority of the statutory rights of the employees to select or not to select a bargaining representative strikes me as either disingenuous or incredibly naive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-11\">I would emphasize here what a remedial bargaining order does and does not do and the Board\u2019s reasoning as to how such an order can help restore to employees their right to make an uncoerced decision about union representation and collective bargaining. First, a bargaining order is not tantamount to certification, which, as we have noted, affords the union certain statutory privileges and a continuing presumption of majority status.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> As the Supreme Court has recognized, \u201c[tjhere is, after all, nothing permanent in a bargaining order, and if, after the effects of the employer\u2019s acts have worn off, the employees clearly desire to disavow the union, they can do so by filing a representation petition.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., </em>395 U.S. at 613, 89 S.Ct. at 1939. The bargaining order does not impose union membership.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Furthermore, the union\u2019s ability to impose contractual terms against the will of a majority of the employees is virtually nonexistent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1464-12\">The employees need not strike against their will. And they will generally possess some influence over the terms of the bargain, if only because the contract will often depend, in the last analysis, on their willingness to fight to obtain it. Still more important, there is every reason for the union to negotiate a contract that will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1399\">*1399</page-number>satisfy the majority, for the union will surely realize that it must win the support of the employees, in the face of a hostile employer, in order to survive the threat of a decertification election after a year has passed.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1465-5\">At the same time, a bargaining order does impose a trial period during which the employees can gain exposure to the merits of union representation in the only way that remains possible when the employer has irremediably destroyed all opportunity for a free election preceded by open discussion and debate. When the employer has so flagrantly flouted the law and the rights of its employees in order to keep out the union, thereby impressing upon employees his complete and unchallengeable control over their working conditions, a bargaining order may provide the only opportunity, albeit a temporary one, for them to see at work an employee organization with which their employer is obligated to negotiate about specific proposals to better their working conditions. This interim arrangement may also serve to dissuade them of lingering fear that it is impossible to elect a union without suffering dire consequences. In grossly tainted atmospheres, only the dynamics of ongoing collective bargaining and the display of power by a functioning employee organization can dispel the overwhelming sense of impotence created by the employer\u2019s prior success in breaking up the employees\u2019 attempts at self-organization.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1465-6\">I do not view this case, as the majority does, as presenting a conflict between employee freedom of choice and majority rule on the one hand, and the Board\u2019s determination to punish the Employer or simply deter future violations on the other. As the Board explained in its decision, the Employer has already effectively undermined any opportunity to ascertain whether an un-coerced majority would choose to be represented by this union, <em>Conair Corp., </em>261 NLRB at 1194, although \u201ca reasonable basis exists for concluding that the Union would have enjoyed majority support but for Respondent\u2019s unfair labor practices.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As noted previously, the union held authorization cards from forty-six percent of the employees before the Employer\u2019s vicious campaign began to take its toll. <em>Id. I </em>would be less confident about the propriety of a bargaining order in a case in which it was not reasonably likely that the union would have gained majority support in a free atmosphere. In this case, however, the failure of the union by less than five percent to make it over the fifty percent mark at any point in its campaign demonstrates to me the imprudence of drawing this \u201cclear bright line\u201d where an agency\u2019s statutory authority to choose remedial measures for extreme violations is at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-10\">To invoke the principle of majority rule as an absolute bar to a bargaining order in cases of extreme coercion like this introduces into the Act an unjustified premise that the employees\u2019 right to reject collective bargaining is more important than their right to choose it,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> a premise Congress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1400\">*1400</page-number>clearly did not endorse. To leave untouched, perhaps permanently, the negative fallout of an employer\u2019s successful campaign to wipe out organizational activity means that the employees are indefinitely presumed to have rejected the union even when they have been prevented from exercising their free choice. To permit a Board order as temporary surrogate for their right to select a union representative, on the other hand, appears a far less drastic alternative, and more in keeping with the congressional policy of encouraging free choice and collective bargaining.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> I believe that the fundamental statutory policy of protecting employees\u2019 freedom to choose by majority rule whether to be represented by a union is not undermined but rather is advanced by a temporary non-majority bargaining order where it is reasonable to conclude that the union would have gained majority support but for the employer\u2019s outrageous and pervasive unfair labor practices, and where no other remedial measures available will remove the taint of those practices so as to permit a fair election in the foreseeable future. I simply do not understand the logic of the majority\u2019s walk-away construction when confronted with violations of these dimensions and impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-4\">E. <em>The Policy of the Act: Deterrence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1466-5\">In the face of coercive conduct as grave, deliberate and unrelenting as the Employer\u2019s conduct here, the Supreme Court has also said that the Board may properly give increased weight to the deterrent effect of a proposed remedy. The <em>Gissel </em>Court stressed the importance of deterring the extreme misconduct covered by Category I; only on a \u201clesser showing of employer misconduct\u201d covered by Category II did the Court deem the goal of \u201ceffectuating ascertainable employee free choice ... as important a goal as deterring employer misbehavior,\u201d and consequently require \u201ca showing that at one point the union had a majority.\u201d 395 U.S. at 614, 89 S.Ct. at 1940.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-9\">The deterrent value of a bargaining order against an employer who has engaged in egregious illegal behavior is apparent. The prospect of a remedial bargaining order should create a strong incentive for the anti-union employer to keep its campaign within legal limits. For even if the company wins the organizational battle, it may lose the collective bargaining war. On the other hand, today\u2019s decision that no bargaining order can ever issue unless the union has gained the support of more than half the unit employees at some point in the process creates reverse and indeed perverse incentives. The anti-union employer can avoid ever dealing with a union by rushing in at the first sign of union sentiment, before employees have begun to experience the collective strength of numbers, with threats of plant closings, mass discharges and close surveillance, thereby creating an atmosphere of coercion that outlasts the tenure of current employees and outdistances the remedial powers of the Board. Indeed, we need not conjure up such a hypothetical horror story, for the Employer here has done precisely that. The Act is dealt a debilitating blow by the majority\u2019s ruling and the Board is deprived of its only effective means to remedy and deter a massive campaign of coercive and illegal conduct by an employer bent on crushing inchoate union organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-10\">Thus I would uphold the Board\u2019s authority to issue a bargaining order even in the absence of a positive showing of majority support for the union in the circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1401\">*1401</page-number>in this case, in which (1) the employer has engaged in unfair labor practices so pervasive and outrageous that there is no reasonable possibility of a fair election, and that even the Board\u2019s ordinary and extraordinary non-bargaining remedies will not restore to employees their right to choose or reject union representation free from employer coercion; and (2) it is reasonable to conclude that the union would have gained the support of the majority but for the employer\u2019s extremely coercive illegal conduct. On this basis, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1454-6\">. The Employer objects that the Board failed to consider changed circumstances making the issuance of a bargaining order inappropriate after the passage of six years since the unfair labor practices took place. Although it did not offer evidence of any particular changed circumstances, it argues that the Board has a duty to inquire as to whether, for example, there have been changes in the composition of the workforce or other outside forces that would tend to dissipate the lingering taint of the earlier events. Brief for Appellant [hereinafter Employer\u2019s Brief] at 43-44. The majority implicitly rejects this objection, thus reaching the issue of statutory authority; I agree that the objection fails, and I summarize my own reasoning for whatever guidance it may offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-7\">Neither the mere passage of time, <em>NLRB v.

Ship Shape Maintenance Co., Inc., </em>474 F.2d 434, 443 (D.C.Cir.1972), is grounds for overturning a bargaining order. However, the significance of subsequent events for the validity of a Board order is a subject of sharp dispute among the circuits and the Board. <em>Compare NLRB v. Drives, Inc.</em>, 440 F.2d 354, 366-67 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied sub nom. General Drivers &amp; Dairy Employees v.

NLRB, </em>629 F.2d 35 (D.C.Cir.1980); <em>NLRB v. Western Drug, </em>600 F.2d 1324 (9th Cir.1979) (requiring Board to consider certain events). This court has required the Board to consider subsequent events only when particularly noteworthy events such as an unusually high rate of turnover, <em>NLRB v. Ship Shape Maintenance Co., Inc., </em>474 F.2d at 443, or the union\u2019s decisive loss in a valid election wholly free of employer coercion, <em>Peoples Gas System, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>629 F.2d at 47-48, have been brought to the attention of the Board or the court. I am aware of no such event in this case. Furthermore, in neither of these two previous cases had the employer been found guilty of substantial, much less \u201coutrageous and pervasive,\u201d unfair labor practices. <em>See </em>474 F.2d at 442 (\u201c[n]o overt anti-union animus ... was demonstrated to any of its employees.\u201d); 629 F.2d at 39 (court emphasized \u201cborderline nature of the violation\u201d of duty to bargain). <em>See also NLRB v. Wilhow Corp., </em>666 F.2d 1294, 1304 (10th Cir.1981); <em>NLRB v. Western Drug, </em>600 F.2d at 1326 (turnover need be considered only in close cases, not egregious cases). As the Fifth Circuit stated about practices similar to the Employer\u2019s here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1455-7\">Practices may live on in the lore of the shop and continue to repress employee sentiment long after most, or even all, original participants have departed. The Board is not compelled to infer that past practices have attenuated, especially practices striking directly at the heart of the security of the employees, such as threats to close the plant, blacklisting, and the like.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1455-8\"><em>Bandag, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>583 F.2d 765, 772 (5th Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-9\">Additional considerations militate against imposing a blanket requirement that the Board inquire into possible subsequent events before issuing a bargaining order. First, it would generate enormous administrative difficulties at the Board level and possibly delay resolution of basic issues in the case including Employer liability as well as remedial measures. Second, we would reward the Employer\u2019s efforts to postpone the enforcement of an effective remedy by attaching to every normal delay in the process a \u201cbonus\u201d in the form of a requirement of further proceedings entailing additional delay. The Ninth Circuit, confronted with a similar issue, went to the jugular:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1455-12\">[Delay] is an unfortunate but inevitable result of the process of hearing, decision and review prescribed in the Act. And to deny enforcement, with or without remand for reconsideration on the basis of facts occurring after the Board\u2019s decision, is to put a premium upon continued litigation by the employer; it can hope that the resulting delay will produce a new set of facts, as to which the Board must then readjudicate. Suppose that the Board does so, and again finds against the employer. There can then be a petition to this court, a decision by it, and a petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court. By that time there will almost surely be another new set of facts. When is the process to stop?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-VG\"><em>NLRB v. L.B. Foster Co., </em>418 F.2d 1, 4 (9th Cir.1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>397 U.S. 990, 90 S.Ct. 1124, 25 L.Ed.2d 398 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-13\">On occasion, especially significant subsequent events may critically undermine the Board\u2019s ability to draw educated inferences about future events from circumstances at the time of the violations, even in the case of extremely serious violations.

The Court reached its conclusion that the Board lacked authority in that case not from section 8(d)\u2019s language alone, however, but rather from overwhelming evidence in the legislative history that Congress explicitly intended to preclude the Board from intruding into the substantive terms of collective bargaining agreements. <em>See </em>397 U.S. at 104-06, 90 S.Ct. at 824-25. In my view, the \u201cplain language\u201d of sections 7 and 9(a) offers far less support for the Employer\u2019s (and the panel\u2019s) view that the Board is barred from ever issuing a non-majority bargaining order, even when the employer has made a fair election impossible, than did the explicitly preclu-sive language of section 8(d), cited in <em>Porter, </em>defining exactly what the obligation to bargain did or did not mean.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1462-5\">.

NLRB, </em>348 U.S. at 103-04, 75 S.Ct. at 181-82. In addition, the so-called \u201ccontract bar\u201d calls for the automatic dismissal of any representation petition by a rival union during the term, up to three years, of a valid collective bargaining agreement between an employer and the certified representative of the employees. <em>See, e.g., </em>Leonard Wholesale Meats, Inc., 136 NLRB 1000 (1962).

This case thus, presents a far different situation than we faced in <em>Local 57, Int\u2019l Ladies\u2019 Garment Workers\u2019 Union v. NLRB, </em>374 F.2d 295 (D.C.Cir.1967), <em>cert. denied, </em>387 U.S. 942, 87 S.Ct. 2078, 18 L.Ed.2d 1328 (1967), in which the employer had violated sections 8(a)(1), (3), and (5) when it moved its operations to Florida from a unionized shop in New York. As part of its remedy, the Board ordered the employer to bargain with the union at the Florida location. We denied enforcement because the remedy violated the Florida employees\u2019 freedom to select a bargaining representative. <em>Id. </em>at 300. The Board had justified its remedy solely on the basis of the need \u201cto deprive the company of the \u2018fruits\u2019 of its illegal acts,\u201d <em>id., </em>and to deter others, <em>id. </em>at 303. In that case, unlike this one, there had been no showing of any interest by the Florida employees in the union and no claim that they had been coerced so as to make a fair election impossible. Furthermore, the Board did not even assert that the remedy would restore to the New York employees the section 7 rights violated by the employer. In short, the Board had wholly ignored the rights of one group of employees, not even to restore the rights of another group of employees, but simply to punish the employer and deter others. This case is obviously radically different.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b1465-12\">. The Chamber of Commerce in its amicus brief openly urges this premise upon us. It argues that \u201c(A) unionization imposes major <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1400\">*1400</page-number>burdens on personal liberty that most Americans refuse to accept, and (B) the Act contemplates that those burdens will be imposed only in response to the active, demonstrated, majority will of the employee unit.\u201d Brief of amicus curiae Chamber of Commerce at 8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b1466-7\">. The majority complains that \u00cd \u201cwould substitute for the coercion Conair imposed an opposing coercive force imposed by the government.\u201d Maj. Op. at 1383. I view the choice differently. Faced with massive and documented coercion by Conair that the majority agrees made a free election impossible, the Board applied the only remedy it found effective, even though there was a theoretical possibility (almost purely hypothetical in this case) that undesired union representation might be temporarily imposed on employees. So viewed, the Board\u2019s and my choice seems not only justifiable but necessary under the Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1467-5\">GINSBURG, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"anh-dedup-0\">dissenting as to the requirement that the Company\u2019s president read the Board\u2019s notice aloud to assembled employees:</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-6\">I would modify the extraordinary notice remedies in one respect.

NLRB, </em>640 F.2d 392 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 837, 102 S.Ct. 141, 70 L.Ed.2d 118 (1981), the Board similarly required that \u201cthe [Company] president, Harold Anderson, personally read a copy of the notice to an assembly of the employees.\u201d 640 F.2d at 401. Our opinion in that case summarized the history of Board public reading orders (they originated when the illiteracy of employees was a large concern), <em>id. </em>at 401-03, and noted the grave reservations this court had earlier expressed regarding such orders in <em>International Union of Electrical, Radio &amp; Machine Workers v. NLRB (Scott\u2019s, Inc.), </em>383 F.2d 230, 232-34 (D.C.Cir.1967), <em>cert. denied, </em>390 U.S. 904, 88 S.Ct. 818, 19 L.Ed.2d 871 (1968). <em>See </em>640 F.2d at 402. We enforced the public reading requirement in <em>Teamsters Local 115 </em>with this modification: we directed the Board to specify as the reader, in lieu of the president, simply \u201ca responsible officer of [the Company].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 403-04.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-14\"><em>Teamsters Local 115 </em>is distinguishable from this case. We observed there that \u201c[o]f all the unfair labor practices found by the Board,\u201d the president had personally performed \u201conly one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 403. Here, the president\u2019s personal involvement was far more conspicuous. His voice behind the Board\u2019s order might most authoritatively indicate to employees that Conair will comply with the directive. Nonetheless, a reading order \u201cdirected at a specified individual\u201d is a \u201cstartling innovation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Such an order would occasion no surprise in a system in which those who offend against state regulation must confess and repent as a means of self-correction, or to educate others. But it is foreign to our system to force named individuals to speak prescribed words to attain rehabilitation or to enlighten an assembled audience. The Board, I believe, has not thoughtfully considered this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-15\">A forced, public \u201cconfession of sins,\u201d even by an owner-president who has acted outrageously, is a humiliation this court once termed \u201cincompatible with the democratic principles of the dignity of man.\u201d <em>International Union of Electrical, Radio &amp; Machine Workers, </em>383 F.2d at 234. It has a punitive, vindictive quality, <em>see Teamsters Local 115, </em>640 F.2d at 401, and is the kind of personal performance command equity decrees have avoided. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 367 (1979); <em>Lumley v. Gye, </em>2 El. &amp; Bl. 216, 118 Eng.Rep. 749 (Q.B.1853); <em>cf. Lumley v.

Moreover, as Board Chairman Van de Water noted, <em>Conair, </em>261 NLRB at 1195 n. 28, a reading of the notice by the president may be less effective than a reading by another responsible officer. The former, humiliated and degraded by the personal specific performance order, may dem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1402\">*1402</page-number>onstrate \u201cby inflections and facial expressions, his disagreement with the terms of the notice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The latter, assigned the task but lacking the same personal involvement, may \u25a0 perform it with less distaste, more detachment, and thus with greater credibility.
