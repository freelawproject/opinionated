(Overseas), had violated Section 8(a)(4) of the National Labor Relations Act by discriminating \u00bfgainst one of its employees who had filed charges with the NLRB.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-22\">On September 12, 1980, Overseas Motors gave a raise to all of its employees. Mirol-jub Mitkovski, the highest paid mechanic employed by Overseas, received a sixty cents per hour raise while all other mechanics received a salary increase of $1.20 per hour. When asked for an explanation of his lesser wage increase, Sam \u25a0 Demrovsky, Mitkovski\u2019s supervisor and co-owner of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>Overseas, responded that he wanted to equalize the mechanics\u2019 pay. Demrovsky further responded that the matter was already decided and \u201cthat is the way it is whether you like it or not.\u201d Mitkovski then replied that he felt he was being discriminated against and that he intended to file a complaint with the NLRB. Co-owner Andy Demrovsky responded, \u201cyou will be fired for that.\u201d Mitkovski replied that he did not see how he could be fired for filing a complaint. Andy or Sam Demrovsky responded, \u201cOkay, you will not be fired but you won\u2019t get any jobs to make enough [of a] living, so you will fire yourself.\u201d Mitkovski sought and was granted approval to take time off to file charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">After filing charges with the NLRB, several forms of disciplinary action were taken against Mitkovski. He was suspended for two days after returning to work from his visit to the NLRB to file charges. Mitkov-ski was later suspended for three days for tardiness after an agent from the NLRB called Sam Demrovsky to inform him that the Board had decided to issue a complaint on Mitkovski\u2019s charge. Mitkovski was finally discharged from employment when an agent from the NLRB visited Overseas and spoke to one of the Demrovskys about Mit-kovski\u2019s charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">The NLRB brought charges against Overseas Motors, Inc. which resulted in a hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ). After the hearing, the ALJ found that Overseas had engaged in unfair labor practices by: (1) unlawfully threatening Mitkovski that he would not \u201cget any jobs to make enough living so (he) would fire [himself]\u201d; (2) unlawfully suspending Mit-kovski for two days on September 15, 1980 and for three days on October 16,1980; and (3) unlawfully discharging Mitkovski on October 23,1980. The ALJ ordered, inter alia, that Overseas reinstate Mitkovski to his former position and make him whole for any loss of pay he may have suffered as a result of being unlawfully suspended and discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">This case was later appealed to the National Labor Relations Board (206 NLRB 105) who adopted the findings, decision and order of the ALJ. Overseas later filed a motion for reconsideration which was denied by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">The NLRB\u2019s order is supported by substantial evidence and does not constitute an abuse of discretion. Therefore, the order is entitled to enforcement by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-10\">Respondent, Overseas, contends that the ALJ\u2019s decision is not supported by substantial evidence. We find this contention is without merit. The ALJ found that the NLRB General Counsel established a prima facie 8(a)(4) violation by showing that: (1) Overseas threatened that if Mitkovski complained to the NLRB he would not receive any desirable assignments; (2) Overseas suspended Mitkovski on September 15,1980 and October 6, 1980 because he had filed charges with the NLRB; (3) Mitkovski was considered a good auto mechanic; and (4) Mitkovski was discharged shortly after the Board visited Overseas, after which visit, Demrovsky, an Overseas co-owner, remarked to Mitkovski that it was \u201cbetter\u201d for him to \u201clook for another job\u201d and that he \u201cmight not quit, but [he] might be fired tonight.\u201d This evidence was sufficient to establish a prima facie 8(a)(4) violation. <em>See Wright Line, a Division of Wright Line, Inc., </em>662 F.2d 899 (1st Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>445 U.S. 989, 102 S.Ct. 1612, 71 L.Ed.2d 848 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-11\">Once the General Counsel establishes a prima facie 8(a)(4) violation by a preponderance of the evidence, the burden shifts to the employer to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the employee would have been fired for permissible reasons even if he had not been involved in activity protected by the National Labor Relations Act (the Act). <em>See NLRB v. Transportation Management Corp., </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 2469, 76 L.Ed.2d 667 (1983). In the present case, Overseas failed to present sufficient evidence to successfully rebut the evidence presented by the General Counsel that the disciplinary action taken by Overseas against Mitkovski was done as a result of Mitkovski\u2019s filing charges with the NLRB.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>The ALJ found that Overseas violated Section 8(a)(4) of the Act by threatening Mitkovski in Demrovsky\u2019s statement that he would not get enough jobs to make a living so he would, in effect, fire himself. Demrovsky, in an affidavit presented as evidence during the course of the hearing before the ALJ stated: \u201cI recall that he was firing himself.\u201d The ALJ found this to be sufficient evidence to support a finding that this was a violation of Section 8(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">In support of its suspensions of Mitkov-ski, Overseas offered evidence that Mitkov-ski had violated its policies regarding punctuality. However, the ALJ found this evidence insufficient in light of an affidavit wherein Demrovsky explicitly stated that Mitkovski was suspended because he (Mit-kovski) was going to file a complaint at the NLRB. Moreover, the ALJ permissibly found that the timing of these suspensions also lead to the conclusion that they were the result of Mitkovski\u2019s filing a complaint with the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Finally, Overseas also presented insufficient evidence to support a finding that it did not violate 8(a)(4) of the Act by discharging Mitkovski from employment. It was alleged by Overseas that Mitkovski was discharged due to a poor driving record which jeopardized Overseas\u2019 insurance coverage. The NLRB\u2019s General Counsel, however, presented evidence which indicated that Overseas had long known of Mitkov-ski\u2019s poor driving record. In fact, there was evidence in the record which tended to show that Overseas had concealed Mitkovski\u2019s driving record from its insurance carrier. It was only after Mitkovski filed his charges with the NLRB that Overseas became \u201cconcerned\u201d about his driving record. The ALJ found that this concern by Overseas was a pretext for Mitkovski\u2019s discharge from employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">This Court\u2019s review of NLRB decisions is limited. We have previously held that the NLRB\u2019s inference of unlawful motivation in dismissing an employee is entitled to affirmance if it is supported by substantial evidence. The reviewing court may not displace the NLRB\u2019s choice between two conflicting views \u2014 even where the court could justifiably have made a different choice had there been a <em>de novo </em>review of the same matter. <em>NLRB v. Retail Store Employees, </em>570 F.2d 586, 590 (6th Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">For the reasons stated above, we find that substantial evidence on the record does support the Board\u2019s finding, and accordingly we uphold and enforce the Board\u2019s order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
