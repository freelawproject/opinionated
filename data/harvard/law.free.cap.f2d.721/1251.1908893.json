A petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court was granted, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 386, 78 L.Ed.2d 332, with Justice Stevens dissenting. We have now received the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate, and under that mandate, our Court\u2019s judgment is vacated, and the cause is remanded to our Court \u201cwith directions to dismiss the appeal as moot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-9\">Following the Supreme Court\u2019s directive, the appellant\u2019s appeal, being moot,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is hereby</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-10\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1322-13\">. The reason for mootness, according to our information, is that in August 1983, the appellant entered a plea of guilty to a charge of voluntary manslaughter and was sentenced to a 6-year term of imprisonment. Since he had already served that period of time, because of his original conviction of murder, we are advised that he has been freed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
