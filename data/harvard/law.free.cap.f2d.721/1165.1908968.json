This case presents a question of first impression for this court concerning the Board\u2019s presumption that off-duty misconduct is related to agency performance where the misconduct is egregious. We conclude that such a presumption is unwarranted and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-27\">Petitioner E. was employed as a diesel engine mechanic with a naval facility. On March 10, 1980, E. was notified by letter that the head of his department proposed that E. be removed from his job \u201cfor infamous conduct off duty adversely affecting the employee/employer relationship.\u201d The proposal was based on the fact that E. pled <em>nolo contendere </em>to a charge of child moles<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1166\">*1166</page-number>tation following an investigation of charges that E. had been sexually abusing his then seven-year-old daughter for the past three years.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This was the second attempt at removing E. from his job based on the child molestation charge.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1236-4\">The commanding officer of the naval facility decided to remove E. as proposed, stating that \u201c[tjhere is no conclusive evidence that [he has] been rehabilitated.\u201d E. was removed from his job on April 18,1980. He appealed the removal decision to the Merit Systems Protection Board. A hearing was held before a presiding official of the Board, who found that \u201c[t]here is not a scintilla of evidence showing that [E.\u2019s] misconduct affected his work\u201d and reversed the agency\u2019s removal of E.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-5\">The Board granted the Navy\u2019s petition to review the presiding official\u2019s decision in light of a new Board decision, <em>Merritt </em>v. <em>Department of Justice, </em>No. PHO75209058 (MSPB June 8, 1981). On May 11, 1982, the Board reversed the presiding official\u2019s decision and sustained E.\u2019s removal. This petition for review followed. Jurisdiction is based on 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(a), (b) (Supp. V 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-6\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-7\">Our standard of review is set forth by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c) (Supp. V 1981), which provides that this court shall review the record and hold unlawful any agency action which we find to be arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion; procedurally defective; or unsupported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-13\">An agency may remove an employee \u201conly for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513(a) (Supp. V 1981).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> An agency must make two determinations before removing an employee for off-duty misconduct: (1) that the employee actually committed the conduct; and (2) that removal will promote the efficiency of the service. <em>Sherman v. Alexander, </em>684 F.2d 464, 468 (7th Cir.1982), <em>cert. </em>denied, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 752, 74 L.Ed.2d 970 (1983). The second requirement has been framed as requiring a \u201cnexus\u201d between the misconduct and the efficiency of the service. <em>Id. </em>Because E. does not dispute the child molestation charge, the issue here is whether a nexus was established.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-16\">Removal actions are also restricted by a statute which prohibits discrimination against any employee \u201con the basis of conduct which does not adversely affect the performance of the employee ... or the performance of others.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(10) (Supp. V 1981).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This restriction was enacted as part of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, Pub.L. No. 95-454, \u00a7 101(a), 92 Stat. 1114 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-17\">\n<em>Presumption of Nexus</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-18\">The Board held that the presumption of nexus was raised by the gravity of E.\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1167\">*1167</page-number>misconduct. It relied on its decisions in <em>Merritt </em>and <em>Doe v. National Security Agency, </em>No. PHO75209076 (MSPB June 8, 1981). The question of whether an agency may presume that a nexus exists between the off-duty conduct and the efficiency of the service is new to this and most other circuits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-6\">We first examine the development of the nexus test. Section 7513 was enacted as part of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, Pub.L. No. 95-454, \u00a7 204(a), 92 Stat. 1136 (1978). The statute and related regulations give little guidance for applying the \u201cpromote the efficiency of the service\u201d standard.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Neither the statute nor the regulations expressly permits an agency to presume nexus.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-7\">Since the language of section 7513 is identical to that of its predecessor statute, presumably Congress intended to re-enact existing law. <em>See Dragor Shipping Corp. v. Union Tank Car Co., </em>371 F.2d 722, 726 (9th Cir.1967). By 1978 the courts had established a trend toward greater judicial scrutiny of agency removals based on off-duty misconduct. In <em>Norton v. Macy, </em>417 F.2d 1161 (D.C.Cir.1969), a NASA employee was accused of homosexual off-duty conduct and removed from his job. The D.C. Circuit concluded that the record established no \u201cascertainable deleterious effect on the efficiency of the service\u201d and reversed the removal. <em>Id. </em>at 1165-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-8\">The D.C. Circuit followed its opinion in <em>Norton </em>with a further elaboration of the nexus requirement in <em>Doe v. Hampton, </em>566 F.2d 265 (D.C.Cir.1977). That case involved the dismissal of a clerk-typist on grounds of mental disability. The court commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AR6\">In law as well as logic, there must be a clear and direct relationship demonstrat- . ed between the articulated grounds for an adverse personnel action and either the employee\u2019s ability to accomplish his or her duties satisfactorily or some other legitimate governmental interest promoting the \u201cefficiency of the service.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"asq-dedup-0\"><em>Id. </em>at 272 (footnote omitted). The court held that there was a nexus between the employee\u2019s mental disability and the efficiency of the service, but remanded the case on other grounds. <em>Id. </em>at 276, 280-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-11\">In <em>Young v. Hampton, </em>568 F.2d 1253 (7th Cir.1977), the Seventh Circuit also addressed the nexus requirement. The court reversed the removal of a product inspector of the Department of the Army based on a conviction of off-duty possession of marijuana and other controlled substances. The court established criteria for determining whether disciplinary action will promote the efficiency of the service:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1237-12\">The agency may base this determination ... on evidence adduced at the employee\u2019s hearing which tends to connect the employee\u2019s misconduct with the efficiency of the service; or, in certain egregious circumstances, where the adverse effect of retention on the efficiency of the service could, in light of the nature of the misconduct, reasonably be deemed substantial, and where the employee can introduce no evidence showing an absence of effect on the efficiency of the service, the nature of the misconduct may \u201cspeak for itself.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1237-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 1257.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-14\">In <em>Merritt v. Department of Justice, </em>the Board relied on <em>Young </em>to state that in \u201ccertain egregious circumstances,\u201d a presumption of nexus may arise from the \u201cnature and gravity of the misconduct.\u201d <em>Merritt </em>involved the removal of a Bureau of Prisons correctional officer for possession and use of marijuana. The Board held that the off-duty misconduct was not so egregious that a presumption of nexus would arise. It theorized, however, that certain conduct can trigger a presumption which the employee may overcome \u201cby evidence showing an absence of adverse effect on service efficiency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1168\">*1168</page-number>The Fifth Circuit has rejected the notion that a presumption of nexus arises in egregious circumstances. In <em>Bonet v. United States Postal Service, </em>661 F.2d 1071 (5th Cir.1981), the court reversed the removal of a postal manager who was indicted for, but never convicted of, indecency with a child. The Board had affirmed the employee\u2019s discharge, finding that the sexual misconduct was adequately proved and was a violation of a code of ethical conduct which prohibited any employee from engaging in \u201ccriminal, dishonest, notoriously disgraceful or immoral conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1076.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-4\">The court stated that reliance on the code of ethical conduct amounted to a presumed or <em>per se </em>nexus and rejected the government\u2019s argument that a <em>per se </em>nexus is appropriate, even where the conduct is as reprehensible as that involved. The court refused to relieve the agency of its statutory duty to demonstrate the requisite nexus. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1238-5\">[Section 2302(b)(10) and 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 731.-202(a)] clearly signal a legislative intent that the agency must demonstrate by sufficient evidence that the off-duty misconduct, upon which the disciplinary action is founded, adversely affects the performance of the duties of the employee or of the agency .... [T]he reviewing authority may not place upon the employee, as the Board did, the burden of showing that his continued employment will <em>not </em>affect the efficiency of the service. The Board may not shift the burden of proof by presumption or application of the <em>per se </em>rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1238-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1078 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-7\">We agree with the <em>Bonet </em>court and hold that a presumption of nexus may not be used because it allows an agency to remove an employee without offering evidence of actual adverse impact on the service. The Board argues that the rebuttable presumption is permissible because it does not shift the ultimate burden of proof. We disagree. The presumption arbitrarily shifts to the employee the burden of producing evidence that his employment does <em>not </em>affect the efficiency of the service. Courts have expressly required the agency to show the opposite: that his continued employment <em>does </em>affect the service such that his termination will promote its efficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-9\">The Board in <em>Merritt </em>read <em>Young v. Hampton </em>as permitting a presumption to arise. It is true that dictum in <em>Young </em>suggests that the nature of the conduct may, in certain cases, reasonably be deemed to have a substantial adverse effect on the efficiency of the service. <em>Young, </em>568 F.2d at 1257. We can hypothesize that a conviction of off-duty embezzlement of an employee whose job involved handling funds could reasonably be regarded as having a substantial adverse effect on efficiency. There is no basis for such a conclusion here where the offense is totally unrelated to the duties performed by E. We need not reach the issue of whether \u201ccertain egregious circumstances\u201d may ever logically indicate an adverse effect on an employee\u2019s performance. In any event, the off-duty conduct must be shown to have some connection to the agency\u2019s overall performance. The burden should remain on the agency to prove that the off-duty misconduct adversely affects the employee\u2019s or the agency\u2019s performance. As the <em>Bonet </em>court noted, \u201cwhen the employee misconduct is off-duty and non-work related, even before the 1978 Act, the courts have been generally unwilling to presume that the discharge will promote the efficiency of the service.\u201d <em>Bonet, </em>661 F.2d at 1078 (footnote omitted). <em>See, e.g., Norton, </em>417 F.2d 1161 (reversal of discharge founded on homosexual conduct); <em>Phillips v. Bergland, </em>586 F.2d 1007 (4th Cir.1978) (reversal of discharge founded on assault); <em>Young, </em>568 F.2d 1253 (reversal of discharge founded on possession of marijuana).</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-10\">The Board also relies on its decision in <em>Doe v. National Security Agency. </em>The discharged employee in <em>Doe </em>was a collection management officer with the National Security Agency. He admitted to participating in \u201cincestuous incidents\u201d with his minor daughter. Relying on its opinion in <em>Merritt, </em>the Board held that a presumption of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1169\">*1169</page-number>nexus arose from the nature and gravity of Doe\u2019s misconduct. Since Doe failed to rebut the presumption, the Board sustained his removal. The decision was affirmed on appeal in a two-paragraph opinion which did not address the presumption of nexus issue. <em>Stalans v. National Security Agency, </em>678 F.2d 482 (4th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-4\">In rejecting the Board\u2019s decisions in <em>Merritt </em>and <em>Doe, </em>we conclude that Congress intended, with the passage of sections 7513(a) and 2302(b)(10), to place on the agency the burden of proving that removal based on off-duty misconduct will promote the efficiency of the service. We recognize that some courts have been willing to presume that the requisite nexus exists based on egregious conduct. In <em>Gueory v. Hampton, </em>510 F.2d 1222 (D.C.Cir.1974), the court held that conviction of a postal foreman for manslaughter supplied the requisite nexus even without a showing of an explicit deleterious effect on the efficiency of the service. In <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>United States, </em>639 F.2d 727 (Ct.Cl.1980), the Court of Claims reviewed the removal of an electronics engineer from a naval training equipment center for off-duty acts of sexual misconduct. The court stated that it did \u201cnot quarrel with the Government\u2019s finding that sexual misconduct adversely affects the employer-employee relationship,\u201d but remanded the case to determine whether misconduct actually occurred. 639 F.2d at 729-30, 731. To the extent that <em>Gueory </em>and <em>Cooper </em>may be construed as contrary to the views expressed herein, we respectfully disagree with the holdings in those cases. We find the <em>Bonet </em>decision more persuasive. The imposition of a presumption of nexus here was arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-5\">\n<em>Discharge of E.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-6\">Without the presumption, the Board has failed to meet its burden of proving nexus by producing substantial evidence that E.\u2019s removal would promote the efficiency of the service. The presiding official who initially reversed E.\u2019s removal found that there was not a \u201cscintilla of evidence\u201d showing that E.\u2019s off-duty conduct affected his work. Neither the head of his department nor the facility\u2019s commanding officer found fault with E.\u2019s job performance. Pri- or to this action, E.\u2019s performance as a diesel engine mechanic was satisfactory. E.\u2019s off-duty conduct has not been a source of notoriety, embarrassment or discomfiture to the Navy. The only evidence of nexus raised by the Navy is statements made by E.\u2019s superiors that they no longer had any trust or confidence in E.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-9\">The department head stated that after learning of E.\u2019s misconduct he \u201clacked trust and confidence in his judgment.\u201d The commanding officer testified that he has no trust or confidence in E.\u2019s ability to be able to function independently, in unusual and demanding situations, and to be able to respond to the officer\u2019s orders without the officer having any doubts about E.\u2019s moral standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-10\">The officers failed to give any specific examples in support of their conclusory statements. The Navy presented no evidence which would show that children were exposed to possible molestation at the work-site. It also failed to show how E.\u2019s history of child molestation affected his job performance or his ability to take orders from superiors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-11\">E. introduced testimony tending to show that his behavior is treatable and not likely to recur. He sought counselling from the very first and is now president of the Parents United counselling group. A counselor with the county child sexual abuse treatment program recommended E.\u2019s retention, stating that E.\u2019s conduct is \u201cnot a sign of mental illness nor a sign of generalized instability\u201d; in fact, he is \u201can exceptionally responsible and stable individual in many ways.\u201d Conclusory statements of distrust fall far short of the substantial evidence required to remove E. The Board has not sustained its burden of proof. We remand to the Board for reversal of its decision with orders to reinstate E. with back pay and beneficial entitlements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1170\">*1170</page-number>\n<em>Attorney\u2019s Fees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-4\">E. seeks attorney\u2019s fees and costs under 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 5596(b)(l)(A)(ii). We remand to the Board to determine whether petitioner is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees and costs. <em>See, Sims v. Department of Navy, </em>711 F.2d 1578 (C.A.Fed.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-5\">The order is REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1236-8\">.

E. was originally notified of a proposal to remove him for \u201cconduct unbecoming a Federal employee\u201d on August 20, 1979. The final decision to remove E. was issued September 21, 1979. That action was appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board and reversed on February 11, 1980, for harmful procedural error. <em>E. v.
