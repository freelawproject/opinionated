Only the Mystic View contract is directly involved in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-16\">Appellant raises four errors on appeal: (1) that the Government in its opening statement improperly commented upon \u201cdefendant\u2019s right not to put on a defense,\u201d (2) that his right of cross-examination was unduly impinged upon by the trial judge\u2019s limitations, (3) that the court below failed to give appropriate cautionary instructions to the jury regarding a co-conspirator\u2019s guilty plea, and (4) that the prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal argument was intentionally improper, to the point of constituting prosecu-torial misconduct thus warranting the reversal of appellant\u2019s conviction and dismissal of the charges against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-17\">\n<em>Opening Statements</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b912-18\">Appellant objects to that part of the Government\u2019s opening statement which came towards the end of the Government\u2019s allocution, after various interruptions by defense counsel objections.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b913-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>The objected statement was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-5\">The Government will present the testimony and the documents and of course Mr. Maccini will have an opportunity to present any evidence ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">Defense counsel objected before this statement was finished and a bench conference followed. Thereafter the trial judge gave a curative instruction to the jury, after having overruled the defense\u2019s motion for mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">Although the cited statement by the Government\u2019s representative is not to be encouraged, an allegation that it is grounds for mistrial as a comment on appellant\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights or the Government\u2019s burden of proof, is \u201can attempt to balloon an innocent statement out of all proportion to its content and intent.\u201d <em>Taylor </em>v. United <em>States, </em>390 F.2d 278, 281 (8th Cir.1968). This statement is in fact similar to an instruction which is commonly given by the trial judge shortly after the jury is empanelled for the purpose of explaining the order of proof. <em>See </em>1 Devitt and Black-mar, <em>Federal Jury Practice and Instructions </em>\u00a7 10.01 (1977); <em>United States v. Attaway, </em>449 F.2d 309 (5th Cir.1971). Notwithstanding that the U.S. Attorney is not the proper party to instruct the jury on these matters, it does not follow that this transgression, particularly under the facts of the present case, automatically leads to a mistrial. To begin with, appellant concedes that the statement falls short of violating the standard set forth in <em>United States v. Flannery, </em>451 F.2d 880 (1st Cir.1971), for automatic reversal,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as the language does not \u201cnaturally and necessarily\u201d comment on an accused\u2019s failure to testify. <em>United States v. Dansker, </em>537 F.2d 40, 63 (3d Cir.1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 1038, 97 S.Ct. 732, 50 L.Ed.2d 748 (1977) (quoting <em>United States v. Chaney, </em>446 F.2d 571, 576 (3d Cir.1971)). Most important, however, is the fact that the trial judge dispelled any possible doubts about this matter by immediate and thorough instructions to the jury, thus curing any prejudice that may have been caused by the Government\u2019s unnecessary comment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b914-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>The trial- court did not err by denial of the motion for mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">\n<em>The Trial Judge\u2019s Control of the Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">Appellant next complains that the trial judge impermissibly infringed upon his right to confrontation by limiting defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of the key Government witness, Densmore, and by allowing the prosecutor to interrupt counsel\u2019s examination to allow the reading of additional portions of Densmore\u2019s prior statement. Defense counsel attempted to impeach Densmore\u2019s credibility using his testimony in a prior case, <em>United States v. Stow, </em>Crim. No. 80-24-N (D.Mass. June 10, 1980). He contended that this transcript contained inconsistent statements concerning the identities of six persons involved in the S.H.A. scheme. The prosecutor objected because the <em>Stow </em>case concerned solely the brick contract and not the electrical contract, thus arguing that Densmore had not fully explained all parts of the fraudulent scheme as regarded the electrical contract. The trial judge resolved the controversy by allowing each party to read as much of the <em>Stow </em>transcript as they thought necessary. Defense counsel claims that this procedure was erroneous and is sufficient to require reversal. We disagree. Appellant admits that he had ample opportunity to present Densmore as an untruthful witness through other impeaching questions. Thus, this is not a circumstance as in <em>United States v. Fortes, </em>619 F.2d 108, 118 (1st Cir.1980), or <em>United States </em>v. <em>Tracey, </em>675 F.2d 433, 436, 439 (1st Cir.1982), where an entire line of inquiry was foreclosed. In <em>Fortes </em>we said: \u201cThe court need not permit unending excursions into each and every matter touching upon veracity if a reasonably complete picture has already been developed.\u201d 619 F.2d at 118.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In fact, the limitation imposed by the trial court took place after twice allowing defense counsel to read the parts of the transcript he was interested in calling to the attention of the jury, while in contrast the Government read theirs only once without the benefit of rehabilitative redirect. The trial judge\u2019s discretion as to the scope and extent of the cross-examination was well exercised. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>546 F.2d 166, 169 (5th Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-12\">Appellant next objects to the trial judge's requirement that additional portions of the <em>Stow </em>testimony, and of Dens-more\u2019s testimony to a grand jury, be read to the jury contemporaneously.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It is acknowledged that the trial judge has ample authority to impose a requirement of supplementation. Appellant contends, however, that this practice is only permitted on redirect. This objection need not detain us unduly. Rule 106 of the Federal Rules of Evidence states on its face:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-13\">When a writing or recorded statement or part thereof is introduced by a party, an adverse party may require him <em>at any time </em>to introduce any other part or any other writing or recorded statement which ought in fairness be considered contemporaneously with it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b914-14\">(emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-15\">The legislative history of this rule leaves the question as to when supplementation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>will be permitted to the discretion of the trial judge. <em>Hearings on the Proposed Rules of Evidence before the Subcomm. on Criminal Justice of the House Comm, on the Judiciary, </em>93d Cong., 1st Sess.Ser. 2, 55-56 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">The trial judge did not abuse his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">\n<em>Co-Conspirator Densmore\u2019s Guilty Plea</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">During trial, defense counsel attempted to impeach co-conspirator Dens-more with the fact that he pled guilty in the case against him. After this matter was brought out on cross-examination by defense counsel, the prosecutor requested that the judge explain the \u201cpurpose of Rule 11 allocution\u201d to the jury. The trial judge proceeded to explain the guilty plea proceeding, after which defense counsel failed to make any objection or request any additional instruction. It is now claimed that plain error was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">The trial judge instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-9\">Even though a man pleads guilty to an offense as charged in the indictment, the Court may not impose a judgment of conviction on the basis of a plea unless there has been a corpus delicti proved, so after the plea is taken, the Court then must comply with the rule that requires that it be satisfied that there is substantial evidence of a crime having been committed by somebody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-10\">The exact provision of the rule is that the Court may not enter a judgment upon a guilty plea without making such inquiry as shall satisfy it that there is a factual basis for the plea. Factual basis is sort of a rough equivalent of corpus delicti. I just quoted the rule about having to find a factual basis for a plea of guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-11\">So the way you go about it is to ask the Government lawyer to state the essence of the charge, and then to file, if there are some corroborative documents, like in a bank \u2014 I mean like in a check case or forgery case, something like that, the Court looks at the documents and then asks the defendant if he disagrees with or wants to change in any way the statement of the essence of the charge made by the prosecuting lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-13\">If the defendant says that he agrees with the statement by the Government lawyer, and if, from other documents, the Court is satisfied that there is a factual basis for the guilty plea, the.Court makes that finding and then sets the case down for sentencing, usually three weeks from that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-14\">So that is a description of what was happening on this occasion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-15\">Please resume.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b915-16\">No allusion was made to Maccini in that explanation, which in fact substantially follows the explanation required under Rule 11. <em>United States v. Fortes, </em>619 F.2d at 124; <em>United States v. St. Germain, </em>680 F.2d 874, 877 (1st Cir.1982). No error was committed by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-17\">\n<em>Closing Argument</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b915-18\">Appellant\u2019s most significant argument concerns the prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal argument in which he stated to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXl\">Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Maccini\u2019s defense requires that you aid and abet him now in doing what he did to Steve Densmore and Nancy Scotti before ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AF4\">Later he went on to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-19\">It would be the final irony if that man [Maccini] having orchestrated lies in the form of concealing his assets, were finally able to sell the story that they [Densmore and Scotti] did it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b915-20\">Appellant\u2019s counsel objected after the first part of the argument to which the court said: \u201cLet\u2019s wait and see. It is argument.\u201d After the second part of the argument there was a conference at the sidebar wherein defense counsel indicated that he wanted a copy of the rebuttal argument for the next day because at that time he would ask the court to declare a mistrial. The following morning, the trial judge, after reviewing the rebuttal as presented in the transcript, forcefully took issue with the Government\u2019s statements and gave instructions to the jury in an attempt to cure any prejudice caused by the Government\u2019s state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>ments. Appellant claims that these two statements, whether taken separately or together, warrant reversal and dismissal because they were intentionally designed to provoke a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">There is no question but that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were inappropriate. Once again we must remind prosecutors that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARVQ\">The United States Attorney is the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all; and whose interest, therefore, in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done .... It is as much his duty to refrain from improper methods calculated to produce a conviction as it is to use every legitimate means to bring about a just one.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b916-5\"><em>United States v. Capone, </em>683 F.2d 582, 585 (1st Cir.1982) (quoting <em>Berger v. United States, </em>295 U.S. 78, 88, 55 S.Ct. 629, 633, 79 L.Ed. 1314 (1935)).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">That despite our consistent warnings to the Government we should still be called upon to admonish against such conduct is reprehensible per se because it constitutes a disregard to our directives. But additionally it is particularly pernicious because it results in an unnecessary waste of judicial resources, both at the trial and appellate level, by diversion and attention to review of what by now should be understood to be totally unacceptable conduct by those who lay claim to representing the Government of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-7\">The issue, however, is not limited to deciding whether the Government acted improperly. What we must decide is whether in the context of this case the prosecutor\u2019s statements warrant reversal or dismissal. Central to that question is the determination of whether despite the instructions, appellant\u2019s trial was so prejudiced by the prosecutor\u2019s misstatements as to affect its outcome, <em>United States v. Capone, </em>683 F.2d at 587; <em>Angel v. Overberg, </em>682 F.2d 605, 608 (6th Cir.1982), or to warrant a sanction for the purpose of deterring future prosecu-torial misconduct. <em>United States v. Farn-koff, </em>535 F.2d 661, 668 n. 17 (1st Cir.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-9\">Appellant claims that the prosecutor\u2019s statements were clearly improper and intended to inflame. Yet these statements must be viewed within the context of appellant counsel\u2019s own style and verbiage. In his opening statement appellant counsel called Densmore, the prosecution\u2019s star witness, \u201cthe government stool pigeon,\u201d a tone which set the standard of attack throughout the trial, and was followed up in his closing arguments by his reference to him as \u201cthis man who comes in and tries to appear like a schlumpy little electrician who is being bossed around by Joe Maccini.\u201d Such comments when coupled with a style that defense counsel himself described as \u201cemotional,\u201d \u201cexcited,\u201d and which at times involved \u201cshouting,\u201d made the prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal less reprehensible than it would otherwise have been. <em>United States v. Hedman, </em>630 F.2d 1184, 1199 (9th Cir.1980); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Capone, </em>683 F.2d 582, 586 (1st Cir.1982); <em>United States v. Battista, </em>646 F.2d 237, 244 (6th Cir.1981). Although \u201c[w]e do not hold ... that the prosecutor has free rein once defense counsel makes inflammatory remarks ...,\u201d <em>United States v. Flaherty, </em>668 F.2d 566, 598 (1st Cir.1981), the mere fact that a transgression by the Government has occurred does not automatically trigger a sanction which places defendant in the position of an innocent bystander, if the Government\u2019s actions are not <em>actually </em>prejudicial to defendant\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-10\"><em>United States v. Capone, </em>683 F.2d 582, 586-87 (1st Cir.1982), presents an analysis of the relevant factors in determining whether prosecutorial impropriety provides the basis for reversal or mistrial: (1) whether the prosecutor\u2019s conduct was isolated and/or deliberate, (2) whether the trial judge\u2019s instructions were strong and explicit, and (3) whether it is likely that any prejudice that survived the judge\u2019s instructions could have affected the outcome of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-11\">The prosecutor\u2019s appeal to passion was not only isolated and clearly unpremeditated but in fact was triggered in large part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>by the aggressive and emotional tone set by defense counsel throughout the trial. Furthermore, they were made in the rebuttal argument at the end of a six-day trial, and thus it is unlikely \u201cthat the minds of the jurors would be so influenced by such incidental statements ... . \u201d <em>United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., </em>310 U.S. 150, 239, 60 S.Ct. 811, 851, 84 L.Ed. 1129 (1940). This does not make the misconduct appropriate but tends to neutralize any harm they might have done by it. <em>United States v. Flaherty, </em>668 F.2d at 598; <em>United States v. Capone, </em>683 F.2d at 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">Additionally, the impact of the prosecutor\u2019s misstatements was lessened, if not completely obliterated, by the trial judge\u2019s strong and pointed, curative instructions. As to the issue of aiding and abetting, he told the jury:<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-6\">Bear in mind that arguments of counsel, just like opening statements ... are not evidence, and you are obliged to decide this case on the basis of evidence .... I will explain to you what the issue of aiding and abetting is, but you are not being asked by the defense or by anybody to aid and abet anybody; you are required ... to reach a fair and impartial verdict in this case on the basis of the evidence. Whatsoever way you decide you will not be aiding and abetting anybody.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">As to the prosecutor\u2019s second statement during rebuttal, the trial judge told the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-8\">The error in that instruction is that it implies that there is a burden of proof on the defendant in a criminal case. He doesn\u2019t have to prove anything. He doesn\u2019t have to prove to you that Dens-more and Scotti and others were lying for example. It is up to the Government to prove to you beyond a reasonable doubt that the Government\u2019s evidence warrants a conviction. There is no burden on defendant ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b917-10\">There is no question but that these strong curative instructions were sufficient to correct any erroneous views in the mind of the jury that may have resulted from the Government counsel\u2019s rebuttal statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-11\">Waiting until the next day to give these instructions did not prejudice the defendant. If anything, the lapse of time aided in allowing the jury to forget what, in the context of a six-day trial, is a <em>de minim-is </em>incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-12\">Under the circumstances of this case, the curative instructions were sufficient to correct the prosecutorial indiscretion. Appellant was not prejudiced. <em>United States v. Farnkoff, </em>535 F.2d 661, 668 (1st Cir.1976); <em>United States v. Kim, </em>595 F.2d 755 (D.C.Cir. 1979). We must add that in this case the proof of guilt was strong. Therefore, the prejudicial effect of the comments that may have endured the judge\u2019s instructions could not reasonably have affected the outcome of the trial. The evidence against Maccini was overwhelming. In addition to testimony given by Densmore and Scotti, his two former associates, there were other witnesses against him. Also, there were a substantial number of exhibits which evidenced his wrongdoing. \u201cIn sum, the record reveals that the jury\u2019s verdict could hardly have been the result of passion inspired by the brief remarks of the prosecutor but rather was based upon lengthy testimony [and] vigorous argument .... \u201d <em>United States v. Capone, </em>683 F.2d at 587.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-13\">The court below committed no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-14\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b912-12\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b912-13\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001, 1002.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b912-14\">.

Gray, Executive Director of S.H.A., Robert Goodoak, the independent architect-engineer for S.H.A., John Stow (Stow), President of Allied Weatherproofing Co., Inc., and Stephen Densmore (Densmore), President of Masdec Construction, the contractor of the Mystic View contract were variously charged with the fraudulent practices. They were separately tried. Dens-more pled guilty to conspiracy, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, and the filing of false statements, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, and pursuant to the plea agreement in which the Government agreed to recommend a two-year probationary sentence and dismiss the recurring counts against him, promised to cooperate fully in further federal investigations.

If the court interrupts the argument, instructs the jury fully on the defendant\u2019s constitutional right not to testify and the jury\u2019s obligation not to draw unfavorable inferences and, in addition, states to the jury that the U.S. Attorney was guilty of misconduct, we may find no prejudice; otherwise we will reverse.\u201d <em>United States v. Flan-nery, </em>451 F.2d at 882.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b913-9\">. The following instructions were given:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-10\">THE COURT: Now, I interrupted the opening statement of the Government counsel which was nearing its conclusion to give you an instruction on the law so that there could not be any misinterpretation of the statement by Mr. Woodlock, the prosecution attorney. He said, and was interrupted in mid-sentence quite appropriately by defense counsel Zal-kind, that Mr. Maccini would have an opportunity to present evidence. And at that point there was a proper objection, and that objection is sustained by the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-11\">But I take this occasion to state to the jury one of the fundamental principles of American jurisprudence, which is that the burden is upon the Government in a criminal case to prove every essential element of every alleged offense beyond a reasonable doubt. That is, the burden is upon the Government to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. This burden never shifts throughout the trial. The law does not require a defendant to prove his innocence or to produce any evidence. There\u2019s no burden on Mr. Maccini to produce any evidence. In every case, and I have no doubt in this case as well, the defendant will be presenting evidence by way of cross-examination of Government witnesses. The defendant relies upon evidence elicited by cross-examination. So that the opportunity that Mr. Maccini will have, as the defendant in every case has, to bring out certain facts by way of cross-examination and by way of argument and analysis to the jury, does not in any way imply a necessity on the part of the defendant to produce any evidence. That\u2019s fundamental. There is no need of the defendant to produce any evidence. There is no need in law for him to take advantage of the opportunity. He doesn\u2019t have to put a single question on cross-examination if counsel decides not to do so. The bottom line is that the burden is on the Government to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. There is no burden on the defendant to prove his innocence, and there\u2019s no burden on the defendant to come forward with a single item of evidence or testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-16\">Now, that\u2019s a fundamental principle of law, and nothing that the Government lawyer said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>should leave any doubt in your mind as to that fundamental principle or dilute the importance of those basic rules.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-7\">That concludes the Court\u2019s comment on that particular statement by Mr. Woodlock.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-8\">And, please resume your opening statement.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b914-9\">. \u201cOnce the constitutional threshold is satisfied, a trial court may exclude certain of the defendant\u2019s questions on cross-examination so as to restrict repetitive cross-examination and conjectural testimony. Such a limitation on cross-examination is not a denial of the constitutionally protected right of confrontation; rather it is a legitimate evidentiary ruling entrusted to the discretion of the trial judge. <em>Vanetzian v.
