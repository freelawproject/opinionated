We conclude that the board erred in holding that the record established the equivalency of the expressions. Thus, no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number><em>prima facie </em>case was made for denial of registration under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052(d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">The goods of appellant and those identified in the registrations for the mark SECOND CHANCE are in part identical and otherwise closely related cosmetic products which would be likely to come from a single source. The issue of likelihood of confusion, therefore, turns on the similarity of the marks.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">To support the finding of equivalency of SECOND CHANCE and REPECHAGE, the examiner had relied on the following French-English dictionary definition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-7\"><em>The New Cassell\u2019s French Dictionary: </em>repechage, Rescuing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-8\"><em>\u00c9preuve de repechage, </em>supplementary heat (to give a second chance to the second bests of preliminary heats); second chance (for candidate who has failed an examination).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">Appellant relies on the above and on the following authorities as showing that \u201crepechage\u201d and \u201csecond chance\u201d are <em>not </em>equivalent French-English terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-10\"><em>Harrap\u2019s New Standard French and English Dictionary, </em>J.E. Mansion, 1977: repechage, (a) fishing up (again), fishing out (again); picking up (of torpedo, etc.); Min. [Mining]: fishing up (broken drill, etc.); (b) helping, lending a hand to, rescuing (s.o. in difficulties); Sch. [School]: supplementary, second chance, examination (for candidates who have failed); <em>\u00e9preuve de r., </em>(i) second chance; (ii) Sp. [Sport]: repechage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-11\"><em>Heath\u2019s Standard French and English Dictionary, </em>J.E. Mansion, Part I: repechage, (a) Fishing up (again), fishing out (again); picking up (of torpedo, etc.). (b) Lending a hand (to s.o. in difficulties); rescuing. Sch. [School] F: Supplementary examination (esp. that held in October for candidates who failed in July at the baccalaureat examination). <em>\u00c9preuve de r., </em>second chance (offered to those who have failed in a test of any kind.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-17\">None of these definitions makes \u201csecond chance\u201d the exact translation of \u201crepechage.\u201d The above authorities indicate that \u201c\u00e9preuvre de repechage\u201d has that meaning, but not \u201crepechage\u201d itself. In special circumstances, \u201crepechage\u201d appears to have the connotation of a reprieve or, loosely, a second chance. In the academic world, \u201crepechage\u201d means a make-up or second chance examination; in mining, the retrieval of equipment; in marine salvage, fishing things out of the water. Each of these meanings in a broad sense connotes giving a second chance, but this is not the same as saying that \u201crepechage\u201d is <em>equivalent </em>to \u201csecond chance.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The test to be applied to a foreign word vis-a-vis an English word with respect to equivalency is not less stringent than that applicable to two English words. \u201cSecond chance\u201d in English, for example, is not the equivalent of the word \u201crescue.\u201d Moreover, such similarity as there is in connotation must be weighed against the dissimilarity in appearance, sound, and all other factors, before reaching a conclusion on likelihood of confusion as to source. <em>Sure-Fit Products Co. v. Saltzson Drapery Co., </em>254 F.2d 158, 160, 117 USPQ 295, 297 (CCPA 1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-18\">We do not, of course, rule out the possibility that likelihood of confusion may be shown between an English word mark and a foreign word mark which are not exact synonyms, just as two English word marks need not be exact equivalents in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>meaning to create a likelihood of confusion. But where the only similarity between the marks is in connotation, a much closer approximation is necessary than has been shown here to justify a refusal to register on that basis alone where the marks otherwise are totally dissimilar.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">The board also looked to the definition of \u201crepechage\u201d in Webster\u2019s Collegiate and Unabridged dictionaries,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which show that the French word is part of the English vernacular. The definition found there is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMo\">repechage [....]: a trial heat (as in rowing) in which first-round losers are given another chance to qualify for the semifinals. [Derivation omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">The above-quoted definition indicates that \u201crepechage\u201d is not the equivalent of \u201csecond chance\u201d in English, but rather has only a very specialized meaning, in sports parlance, of a trial heat.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">While the PTO may reject an application ex <em>parte </em>solely because of similarity in meaning of the mark sought to be registered with a previously registered mark, similarity which would lead one to conclude that confusion is likely has not been shown between SECOND CHANCE and REPCHAGE whether \u201crepechage\u201d is considered as a French word or as a word in the American vernacular.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">The decision of the board is, accordingly, <em>reversed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b423-17\">.

We do not hold that equivalency necessarily means there is a likelihood of confusion, but only that the initial fact of equivalency was not here established. Further, our holding does not mean that the registrant of SECOND CHANCE could not prevail in an <em>inter partes </em>proceeding on a different record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b425-11\">. Appellant requested rehearing because of the board\u2019s reliance on additional source material by judicial notice. Contrary to appellant\u2019s argument, Fed.R.Evid. Rule 201 does not require a hearing, <em>ipso facto, </em>upon request of a party whenever judicial notice is taken. Appellant made no offer to show that judicial notice was improper under the rule. The board noted the fact that \u201crepechage\u201d was a word adopted into English. This can be confirmed by checking the cited dictionary. No hearing could have established the contrary and the board\u2019s action was entirely in accordance with the rule. Appellant is, in fact, attacking the board\u2019s conclusion, not the definition noticed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
