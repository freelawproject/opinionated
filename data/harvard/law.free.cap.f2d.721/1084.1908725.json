The United States Government cross-appeals the trial judge\u2019s sentencing of the appellant under the Federal Youth Corrections Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5005-5026. We affirm the conviction and remand this case to the district court for resentencing of the appellant as an adult offender under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 846.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-22\">The evidence at trial revealed that in early September, 1980, appellant, Thomas Mayo, while aboard one of his chartered sailboats originating in Miami, Florida, engaged in conversations with Wayne Shapley concerning the purchase and resale of cocaine. Shapley expressed an interest in purchasing cocaine in the State of Florida for resale in the State of Michigan, \u201cbecause it is cheaper back in Florida than it is in Michigan.\u201d In mid to late September, 1980, Shapley returned to Muskegon, Michigan and contacted Jerry Hanson who knew people in the Muskegon area that \u201cused\u201d and \u201cdealt in cocaine.\u201d Shapley and Hanson discussed Shapley\u2019s plan and Hanson agreed that if Shapley could purchase a large quantity of cocaine in Florida, the two of them could make a profit by reselling the cocaine in Michigan at higher prices. Following this discussion Shapley phoned Mayo in Miami, Florida to arrange for a cocaine purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-23\">On October 20, 1980, Shapley collected $4,400.00 from Hanson and added $1,000.00 of his own money for the purchase of a \u201clarge quantity\u201d of cocaine. The following day Shapley flew to Miami and upon arrival he phoned Mayo to confirm arrangements for the cocaine purchase. Mayo arrived at the airport within ten minutes, met Shap-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1086\">*1086</page-number>ley, drove him around Miami, and along the way, stopped at public phone booths to place phone calls in an attempt to \u201cset up a [cocaine] deal.\u201d Mayo next proceeded to a motel where he and Shapley checked into the same room. Shortly thereafter Mayo left the motel and placed another phone call from a public phone booth across the street. Within an hour a source by the name of \u201cRon\u201d arrived at the motel with eight ounces of cocaine. In the presence of Mayo and \u201cRon,\u201d Shapley tested the cocaine by \u201csnorting it.\u201d \u201cRon\u201d left the motel and another source by the name of \u201cRich\u201d entered the room. Shapley tested \u201cRich\u2019s\u201d cocaine by \u201csnorting it\u201d and decided to buy three ounces of cocaine from \u201cRon.\u201d When \u201cRon\u201d returned, Shapley gave the money to Mayo who in turn gave it to \u201cRon.\u201d Following this transaction Mayo and \u201cRon\u201d exited the room for \u201cabout an hour\u201d to transfer the eight ounces of cocaine into a three ounce package. Upon their return, Mayo, Shapley, and \u201cRon\u201d \u201csnorted\u201d cocaine and the three of them made arrangements for Shapley to return to Miami for another cocaine purchase following the resale of his newly acquired three ounces. According to the arrangement Mayo was to meet Shapley at the Miami airport and transport him to \u201cRon\u2019s\u201d house where Shap-ley would purchase another quantity of cocaine for resale in the State of Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-4\">The following day, October 22, 1980, Mayo drove Shapley to the Miami airport for Shapley\u2019s return flight to Muskegon, Michigan. While enroute, Shapley informed Mayo that he would arrive at O\u2019Hare Airport in Chicago, Illinois and from there board a commuter flight to Muskegon, Michigan. When Shapley arrived at O\u2019Hare Airport in Chicago he was stopped by agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration (\u201cDEA\u201d). The agents asked Shapley for his travel bag, found 2.7 ounces of 73% pure cocaine contained therein, arrested Shapley, and processed him at the DEA airport office. Shapley signed a waiver of rights form, supplied the agents with the name of his cocaine supplier, Thomas Mayo, and agreed to place recorded phone calls to Mayo in Miami, Florida. That evening Shapley, while still in Chicago, Illinois, placed two recorded phone calls to Mayo informing Mayo that the sale of cocaine in Michigan \u201cwent over well\u201d and that Mayo should fly to Chicago with a \u201csix-pack.\u201d According to the code words that Mayo had supplied Shapley, a \u201csix-pack\u201d meant eight ounces of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-6\">On October 25, 1980, Mayo phoned Shap-ley, who by this time had returned to Musk-egon, Michigan, and informed him that Mayo would be arriving that day on Delta Flight 1136 at 2:40 p.m. at O\u2019Hare Airport in Chicago with eight ounces of cocaine. Shapley relayed this information along with a physical description of Mayo to DEA agents. The agents proceeded to O\u2019Hare Airport, positioned themselves at the appropriate terminal, \u201cspotted\u201d Mayo at approximately 2:40 p.m. departing from Delta Flight 1136, and followed him down the concourse. At approximately 3:30 p.m. the agents approached Mayo, identified themselves, and with Mayo\u2019s consent conducted a search which uncovered no cocaine. At approximately 6:10 p.m. that evening, DEA agents, based upon the information obtained from Shapley and the recorded phone conversations between Mayo and Shapley, arrested Mayo in the Hyatt Regency Hotel, across from O\u2019Hare Airport, for conspiracy to violate the narcotics laws. Mayo voluntarily signed a waiver of rights form, and told police that he had sold \u201capproximately four ounces of cocaine\u201d to Shapley \u201ca few days earlier.\u201d Mayo also stated that he had flown to Chicago in an attempt to persuade Shapley to come to Florida for another cocaine purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-7\">On December 23, 1981, a Federal Grand Jury returned an indictment against Mayo charging him with conspiracy to supply Wayne Shapley with cocaine in the State of Florida for resale in the State of Michigan, between the months of July, 1980 and October, 1980, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 846. On March 18,1982, Mayo pleaded not guilty to this charge. On July 9, 1982, following a three-day bench trial, the trial judge found Mayo guilty as charged. On August 18, 1982, the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1087\">*1087</page-number>judge entered judgment on the finding of guilt and sentenced Mayo to a term of three years incarceration, suspended all but thirty days of the imprisonment, and imposed a four-year probationary period to follow the one month period of confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-5\">On August 18, 1982, Mayo filed a motion with the district court requesting imposition of the sentence under the Federal Youth Corrections Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5005-5026, as extended in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4216. Sentencing Mayo under this Act would allow the court, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(a), to suspend Mayo\u2019s entire sentence and place him on probation. The Government claimed that Mayo failed to qualify for sentencing under the Federal Youth Corrections Act because he reached the age of twenty-six years on April 14,1982, some four months before the date of his conviction. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4216 mandates that an offender be under twenty-six years of age at the time of conviction in order to qualify for sentencing under the Federal Youth Corrections Act. The trial judge, in spite of this express age limitation contained in the statute, granted Mayo\u2019s motion and sentenced him under the Federal Youth Corrections Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(a), on August 19, 1982. The trial judge reasoned that Mayo should not be compelled to waive his right to a trial just to qualify for sentencing under the Federal Youth Corrections Act and that Mayo had no control over the Government\u2019s delay in bringing this case to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-6\">On appeal, Mayo contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1157-7\">A. That the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to establish, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Mayo violated 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 846.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1157-8\">B. That venue in the Northern District of Illinois was improper for purposes of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1157-9\">On cross-appeal, the Government contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1157-10\">C. That the trial judge exceeded his authority by sentencing Mayo under the Federal Youth Corrections Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5005-5026.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1157-11\">We shall consider these issues individually-</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-13\">A. SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE OF CONSPIRACY</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-14\">Appellant Mayo contends that the Government\u2019s portrayal of the events which occurred during the months of September and October, 1980, as constituting an ongoing conspiracy between Mayo and Shapley, is inaccurate. Instead, appellant fabricates a novel and unique theory, referring to these events as three separate and distinct episodes. As appellant would have us believe, episode one consisted of a buyer-seller relationship between Mayo and Shapley beginning in September, 1980 and continuing through the October 21,1980 sale of cocaine to Shapley. Episode two was comprised of tentative plans about future cocaine dealings between Mayo, Shapley, and \u201cRon,\u201d discussed in a Miami, Florida motel room immediately following the October 21, 1980 sale of cocaine. Episode three, on the other hand, consisted of Shapley\u2019s conversations with Mayo, concerning the purchase of additional cocaine in the State of Florida for resale in the State of Michigan, following Shapley\u2019s agreement to cooperate with the Government. Despite appellant\u2019s novel attempt to delineate the events which transpired during September and October, 1980, as being separate and distinct from each other, we hold that these episodes merge into one ongoing conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and to distribute cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 846.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-15\">This court has, on numerous occasions, had the opportunity to review convictions for violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 846. As we have previously stated, and again reiterate, when reviewing the sufficiency of evidence to establish a conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute narcotics, we will affirm the trial court unless the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Government, could not have persuaded any rational trier of fact of defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>677 F.2d 602, 609 (7th Cir.1982); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Garza-Her</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1088\">*1088</page-number><em>nandez, </em>623 F.2d 496, 501 (7th Cir.1980); <em>United States v. Washington, </em>586 F.2d 1147, 1152 (7th Cir.1978); <em>United States v. Page, </em>580 F.2d 916, 919 (7th Cir.1978); <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>562 F.2d 411, 414 (7th Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-5\">We begin our analysis of the events which occurred in September and October, 1980, with the basic tenet that \u201ca conspiracy consists of a combination or confederation between two or more persons formed for the purpose of committing, by their joint efforts, a criminal act.\u201d <em>United States v. Hedman, </em>630 F.2d 1184, 1192 (7th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 965, 101 S.Ct. 1481, 67 L.Ed.2d 614 (1981). <em>Accord United States v. Dalzotto, </em>603 F.2d 642, 644 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Young </em>v. <em>United States, </em>444 U.S. 994, 100 S.Ct. 530, 62 L.Ed.2d 425 (1979); <em>United States v. Mancillas, </em>580 F.2d 1301, 1307 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 958, 99 S.Ct. 361, 58 L.Ed.2d 351 (1978). To this we add that, \u201cMy its nature conspiracy is conceived and carried out clandestinely, and direct evidence of the crime is rarely available. Thus, circumstantial evidence from which the jury could reasonably infer the existence of an agreement is permissible.\u201d <em>United States v. Washington, </em>586 F.2d at 1153 (citing <em>United States v. Santos, </em>385 F.2d 43, 44 (7th Cir.1967)); <em>Accord United States v. Page, </em>580 F.2d at 920.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-7\">Our review of the evidence reveals that in September, 1980, Shapley inquired of Mayo, \u201cif I got the money together ... could [you] score me or get me some cocaine and in an ounce quantity because it is cheaper in Florida than it is in Michigan.\u201d To this Mayo responded that, \u201che would look into it, and ... would keep in touch.\u201d Contrary to appellant\u2019s single and separate episode theory, the relationship between Mayo and Shapley was, at this time, one of concerted actors.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Shapley sought not only to purchase cocaine for a low price in the State of Florida, but to transport it to the State of Michigan for resale at a profit. In furtherance of this plan, Mayo agreed to seek out, arrange for, and establish cocaine \u201ccontacts\u201d for Shapley in the State of Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-10\">Mayo\u2019s participation in this concerted activity to \u201cbuy low, sell high\u201d is evidenced by his meeting Shapley at the airport, driving him to the motel, arranging to introduce him to sources named \u201cRon\u201d and \u201cRich,\u201d vouching for the reliability of these sources, accepting Shapley\u2019s payment for three ounces of cocaine and giving it to \u201cRon,\u201d and leaving with \u201cRon\u201d to repackage the cocaine. Further evidence of Mayo\u2019s participation is found in the conversation following the cocaine purchase on October 21, 1980. At that time Mayo, Shapley, and \u201cRon\u201d made \u201carrangements\u201d for another cocaine transaction the following week with Shapley flying from Muskegon, Michigan to Miami, Florida, meeting Mayo, staying at \u201cRon\u2019s\u201d house and purchasing another quantity of cocaine.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Still further evidence of Mayo\u2019s participation is found in Mayo\u2019s conveying Shapley to the Miami airport on October 22, 1980, so that Shapley could return to Michigan, supplying Shapley with and instructing him to use a list of code words whenever discussing cocaine dealings over the telephone, and arranging to re-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1089\">*1089</page-number>mam m contact with Shapley once he returned to Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-5\">We hold that based upon the totality of the evidence presented, a rational trier of fact could very reasonably and logically find beyond a reasonable doubt that Mayo participated with Wayne Shapley in a conspiracy to purchase cocaine in the State of Florida for resale in the State of Michigan. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Mancillas, </em>580 F.2d at 1307. Thus, the evidence is sufficient to establish that Mayo conspired to possess with intent to distribute and to distribute cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 846.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-6\">B. VENUE UNDER 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1159-7\">Appellant next contends that if a conspiracy does exist, venue in the Northern District of Illinois is improper because no agreement between Mayo and Shapley ever occurred in that district. Appellant premises this argument upon <em>United States </em>v. <em>Umentum, </em>547 F.2d 987, 991 (7th Cir.1976), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>430 U.S. 983, 97 S.Ct. 1677, 52 L.Ed.2d 376 (1977), where this court held that to establish a conspiracy in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 the Government need only prove an agreement and need not allege or prove an overt act. This differs from general conspiracy law where an agreement and an overt act in furtherance of the agreement must be proved to establish a conspiracy. <em>See, e.g., </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. Appellant asserts that because 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 requires no allegation or proof of an overt act, in furtherance of the agreement, venue under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 is limited to any district where the agreement occurred as contrasted to the general conspiracy law principle which allows for venue in any district where the agreement occurred or any district where an overt act, in furtherance of the agreement, occurred. <em>See, e.g., Hyde </em>v. <em>United States, </em>225 U.S. 347, 32 S.Ct. 793, 56 L.Ed. 1114 (1912). Appellant claims that if, in fact, an agreement was consummated between Mayo and Shap-ley that agreement occurred in Miami, Florida, thus venue properly lies in the Southern District of Florida rather than the Northern District of Illinois. Appellant further contends that by allowing this case to remain in the Northern District of Illinois, the district court violated Fed.R. Crim.P. 18 and appellant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a trial in the district where the crime was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-11\">The fact that no overt act need be alleged or proved for conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, <em>United States v. Umentum, </em>547 F.2d at 991. <em>Accord United States v. Cortwright, </em>528 F.2d 168, 172 n. 1 (7th Cir.1975); <em>United States v. Garfoli, </em>324 F.2d 909, 910-11 (7th Cir.1963), does not affect the place of venue for purposes of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-12\">A review of recent case law reveals that the United States Courts of Appeals for the Fifth, Eighth, and Ninth Circuits have held that venue under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 is proper in the district where an overt act, in furtherance of the conspiracy, occurs. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>685 F.2d 252, 255 (8th Cir.1982); <em>United States v. Nicoll, </em>664 F.2d 1308, 1311 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>457 U.S. 1118, 102 S.Ct. 2929, 73 L.Ed.2d 1330 (1982); <em>United States v. DeLeon, </em>641 F.2d 330, 336 (5th Cir.1981); <em>United States v. Schoor, </em>597 F.2d 1303, 1308 (9th Cir.1979); <em>United States v. Strickland, </em>493 F.2d 182, 187 (5th Cir.1974), <em>cert. dismissed, </em>419 U.S. 801, 95 S.Ct. 9, 42 L.Ed.2d 32 (1975). In addition, we refer to <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>606 F.2d 96, 97 (5th Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1024, 100 S.Ct. 685, 62 L.Ed.2d 657 (1980) where the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, considering the constitutionality of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1159-13\">\u201cIn permitting the Government to bring conspiracy charges in any district where an overt act was alleged to have been committed, the statute [21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846] is not inconsistent with the Sixth Amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1090\">*1090</page-number>ment right of the accused to \u2018trial, by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1160-4\">In line with this authority and based upon our reading of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s language in <em>Hyde </em>v. <em>United States, </em>225 U.S. 347, 32 S.Ct. 793, 56 L.Ed. 1114 (1912) we hold that venue under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 is proper in any district where an overt act, in furtherance of the conspiracy, occurs.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1160-5\">In <em>Hyde, </em>the Court was considering whether v\u00ed me in a conspiracy case under \u00a7 5440 Rev.Stat. (1901) properly lies in the state or district where the conspiracy was entered into or any state or district where an overt act, in furtherance of the conspiracy, was performed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The statute required that for conviction the Government had to prove that two parties conspired to commit an offense against the United States and that at least one of the parties had performed an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy. In .its well-reasoned analysis, the Court stated \u201cthat a conspiracy is not necessarily the conception and purpose of the moment, but may be continuing.\u201d 225 U.S. at 363, 32 S.Ct. at 800. Additionally, \u201c[t]he law considers that wherever [conspirators] act there they renew, or perhaps, to speak more properly they continue, their agreement, and this agreement is renewed or continued as to all whenever any one of them does an act in furtherance of their common design.\u201d 225 U.S. at 365, 32 S.Ct. at 801 (quoting <em>Robinson v. United States, </em>172 F. 105 (8th Cir.1909)). <em>Accord United States v. Kissell, </em>218 U.S. 601, 608, 31 S.Ct. 124, 126, 54 L.Ed. 1168 (1910); <em>United States v. Read, </em>658 F.2d 1225, 1234 (7th Cir.1981). The Court went on to hold that venue was proper in any state or district where an overt act, in furtherance of the conspiracy, occurs. Though the Court in <em>Hyde </em>was analyzing a statute which required allegation and proof of an overt act, and thereby differed from 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, the characterization of a conspiracy as \u201ccontinuing\u201d lends credence to the ongoing nature of conspiracy.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1160-10\">Applying the Supreme Court\u2019s conspiracy analysis to the facts before us, the agreement between Mayo and Shapley, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1091\">*1091</page-number>purchase cocaine in the State of Florida for resale in the State of Michigan, occurred at the time Mayo and Shapley initially entered into discussions in September of 1980 and also at the time any overt act' was committed in furtherance of the conspiracy. Thus, the overt act committed in the Northern District of Illinois, namely Shapley\u2019s arrival at O\u2019Hare Airport in Chicago, Illinois, while enroute to Muskegon, Michigan with 2.3 ounces of cocaine purchased in a transaction with Mayo and \u201cRon,\u201d was merely a continuance of the conspiracy which Mayo and Shapley entered into in the State of Florida. This overt act was just another brick in the pyramid we call a conspiracy. Accordingly, venue was proper, for purposes of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, in the Northern District of Illinois.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-5\">We recognize, as did the Supreme Court in <em>Hyde, </em>that our holding provides the Government with a power which may be abused. We also realize that substantial countervailing considerations exist which justify our conclusion that venue is proper in any district where an overt act, in furtherance of the conspiracy, is committed. As the Court so aptly stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1161-6\">\u201cWe realize the strength of the apprehension that to extend the jurisdiction of conspiracy by overt acts may give to the Government a power which may be abused, and we do not wish to put out of view such possibility. But there are counter considerations. It is not an oppression in the law to accept the place where an unlawful purpose is attempted to be executed as the place of its punishment, and rather conspirators be taken from their homes than the victims and witnesses of the conspiracy be taken from theirs. We must not, in too great a solicitude for the criminal, give him a kind of immunity from punishment because of the difficulty in convicting him \u2014 indeed, of even detecting him. And this may result, if the rule contended for be adopted. Let him meet with his fellows in secret and he will try to do so; let the place be concealed, as it can be, and he and they may execute their crime in every State in the Union and defeat punishment in all. And the suppositions are not fanciful, as illustrated by a case submitted coincidently with this. <em>Brown v. Elliott, post </em>[225 U.S.] p. 392 [32 S.Ct. p. 812, 56 L.Ed. p. 1136]. The possibility of such a result repels the contention and demonstrates that to yield to it would carry technical rules and rigidity of reasoning too far for the practical administration of criminal justice. We see no reason why a constructive presence should not be assigned to conspirators as well as to other criminals .... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1161-10\"><em>Hyde, </em>225 U.S. at 363-64, 32 S.Ct. at 800-01. As noted by the Court, to hold otherwise, i.e., to require that venue only be in the district where the agreement occurred, would allow conspirators to execute their crime in every state of the Union and, if the place of agreement were concealed, to escape prosecution. <em>See Brown v. Elliott, </em>225 U.S. 392, 401-02, 32 S.Ct. 812, 815-16, 56 L.Ed. 1136 (1911). Thus, our decision promotes the practical administration of criminal justice in conspiracy cases under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 without violating either Fed. R.Crim.P. 18 or the Sixth Amendment since in our view, each time conspirators commit an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy, they renew or continue their conspiratorial agreement. <em>Accord Hyde, </em>225 U.S. at 365, 32 S.Ct. at 801.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-11\">C. SENTENCING UNDER THE FEDERAL YOUTH CORRECTIONS ACT</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-12\">The Government, cross-appellant, contends that the sentencing of Mayo under the Federal Youth Corrections Act, specifically 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(a), was improper.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Government\u2019s position is that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4216 expressly provides that to fall within the Federal Youth Corrections Act, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1092\">*1092</page-number>defendant must be under the age of twenty-six years at the time of conviction.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Because Mayo turned twenty-six on April 14, 1982 and he was convicted, as that term is defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5006(g), on August 18,1982, Mayo falls outside the ambit of the statute. The trial judge, however, explained that he sentenced Mayo under the Federal Youth Corrections Act because \u201ca defendant should not be compelled, in order to have the advantages of the Youth Corrections Act, to waive any claims he may make, constitutional claims\u201d and \u201cthere was almost a year\u2019s delay between the dismissal of the magistrate\u2019s complaint on the Government\u2019s motion and the filing of the indictment.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1162-4\">We approach appellant\u2019s contention from the well-established principle that the sentence imposed by a trial judge, within the applicable statutory limit, is only subject to review on appeal for an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Madison, </em>689 F.2d 1300, 1312 (7th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 754, 74 L.Ed.2d 971 (1983); <em>United States v.

We add, however, that when interpreting a statute, we must first look to the language of the statute itself. <em>Greyhound Corp. v. Mt.

The statutes confer no authority upon the federal courts to make exceptions to this expressed rule of law. Accordingly, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1093\">*1093</page-number>appellant reached the age of twenty-six years some four months before his conviction, he fails to fall within the express confines of the statute and thereby does not qualify for sentencing under the Federal Youth Corrections Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-5\">Though judicial inquiry is ordinarily at an end when the language of a statute is unambiguous, <em>United States v.

Barton, </em>566 F.2d 1106, 1107 (9th Cir.1977) the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1163-9\">\u201cThe statute [Federal Youth Corrections Act] is specifically limited to \u2018a defendant who has attained his twenty-second birthday but has not attained his twenty-sixth birthday at the time of conviction.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1163-10\"><em>See also United States </em>v. <em>Boydston, </em>622 F.2d 398, 399 (8th Cir.1980).

No. 2979, 81st Cong., 2nd Sess. 1 <em>reprinted in </em>1950 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Adm. News 3983. In 1958 Congress extended the Federal Youth Corrections Act by enacting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4209, to include defendants from ages twenty-two to twenty-six. The House Report revealed that this new sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1094\">*1094</page-number>tion applied to those \u201coffenders who have attained their 22nd birthday and are under the age of 26 at the time of conviction.\u201d H.R.Rep.

At that time, the term conviction was defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5006(h) as the judgment on a verdict or finding of guilty, a plea of guilty, or a plea of <em>nolo contendere. </em>From this language, which is presently embodied in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 4216, it is clear that Congress intended the Federal Youth Corrections Act to apply only to those offenders who had not reached the age of twenty-six years at the time of conviction. <em>See, e.g., Dorszynski </em>v. <em>United States, </em>418 U.S. 424, 433 n. 9, 94 S.Ct. 3042, 3048 n. 9, 41 L.Ed.2d 855 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-4\">In light of the express language of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5006(g) and \u00a7 4216, the judicial interpretation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4216, and the Congressional intent in enacting the Federal Youth Corrections Act, as extended in 18 U.S.C. 4216, we hold that to qualify for sentencing under the Federal Youth Corrections Act, the offender must be under the age of twenty-six years at the time of conviction, as that term is defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5006(g). Because Mayo reached the age of twenty-six on April 14, 1982, some four months before his conviction on August 18, 1982, the sentencing of Mayo under the Federal Youth Corrections Act constitutes an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-6\">We affirm the judgment of conviction and remand this case to the district court for resentencing of the appellant under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 846 as an adult offender.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1158-8\">. Appellant contends that during these conversations in September, 1980, Shapley wanted to purchase a quantity of cocaine for his own use, thus, his relationship with Mayo was one of a buyer and seller. Appellant relies upon <em>United States v. Ford, </em>324 F.2d 950, 952 (7th Cir.1963) to argue that because Mayo and Shapley were simply in a buyer and seller relationship, no conspiracy was formed. The evidence, however, reveals that Mayo knew of Shapley\u2019s intention to resell cocaine in the State of Michigan following the conversations in September, 1980. Furthermore, after returning to Michigan Shapley spoke with Jerry Hanson about getting a \u201clarge quantity\u201d of cocaine so that he could resell it and make a profit. Shapley then relayed this information to Mayo in Miami, Florida.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1158-12\">. Appellant claims that, at best, these plans were tentative and because the whole arrangement depended upon Shapley\u2019s successful resale of the three ounces of cocaine in Michigan, Mayo and Shapley never \u201cagreed\u201d to future cocaine purchases. On cross-examination, however, Shapley testified that \u201cfuture items would just involve Tom [Mayo] and Ron ... we made definite arrangements.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1159-8\">. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1159-9\">\u201cAny person who attempts or conspires to commit any offense defined in this subchap-ter is punishable by imprisonment or fine or both which may not exceed the maximum punishment prescribed for the offense, the commission of which was the object of the attempt or conspiracy.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1160-6\">. Our holding finds further support at common law where courts held venue in a conspiracy case to be proper in the district where an overt act, in furtherance of the conspiracy, occurred even though the law at the time did not require allegation or proof of an overt act to establish a conspiracy. In <em>Hyde </em>the Court stated, \u201cIt is true that the conspiracy, the unlawful combination, has been said to be the crime, and that <em>at common law it was not necessary to aver or prove an overt act....\u201d </em>(emphasis added). 225 U.S. at 359, 32 S.Ct. at 799. The Court then referred to the common law principle that, \u201c[a]t common law the venue in conspiracy could be laid in any county in which it could be proven that an overt act was done by any one of the conspirators in furtherance of their common design.\u201d 225 U.S. at 365, 32 S.Ct. at 801 (quoting 1 Archbold\u2019s Criminal Practice and Pleading 226 (8th ed.)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1160-7\">.

The Supreme Court merely addressed the issue of whether overt acts had to be alleged for a conspiracy to violate the Sherman Act. The Court determined that no overt act need be alleged. Based upon these facts, we do not believe that the above language precludes us from relying upon <em>Hyde </em>for an insight into the nature of conspiracy for purposes of determining where venue properly lies under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1161-7\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(a), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1161-8\">\u201cIf the court is of the opinion that the youth offender does not need commitment, it may suspend the imposition or execution of sentence and place the youth offender on probation.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1162-6\">.

The appellant contends, in a post-oral argument motion, that this court was without jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s sentencing of Mayo under the Federal Youth Corrections Act. In this instance, however, the district court\u2019s determination that Mayo qualified for sentencing under the Act constituted a final decision, independent from Mayo\u2019s conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 846, <em>see Carroll v. United States, </em>354 U.S. 394, 403, 77 S.Ct. 1332, 1338, 1 L.Ed.2d 1442 (1957), and thus, this court\u2019s review of that decision will not place defendant Mayo in double jeopardy for the same crime. Accordingly, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, this court has jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s erroneous, independent determination that Mayo did qualify for sentencing under the Federal Youth Corrections Act. <em>See United States v.

Villar, </em>416 F.Supp. 887 (S.D.N.Y.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-12\">We distinguish the holding in <em>Villar </em>because in that case the court, concerned that the defendant was denied the effective assistance of counsel, exercised its power to fashion an appropriate remedy for the deprivation of that right. No such concern exists in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-13\">We admittedly have a more difficult time distinguishing <em>Rivera </em>as the facts in that case appear to be very near on point to those in this instance. We do, however, disagree with the court\u2019s statement that to hold that the Act cannot apply to a defendant who turned twenty-six, because he chose to adjudicate his constitutional right, would obviously discourage such a person from pursuing these rights. We reason that such a person can still pursue these rights with the realization that he must accept the consequences of his decision outside the benefit of the Federal Youth Corrections Act. The Constitution provides no right to be sentenced under the Federal Youth Corrections Act, rather, the Act is intended by Congress as a \u201ccorrective and preventative guidance\u201d provision to be applied at the trial judge\u2019s discretion. <em>See, e.g., Dorszynski v.
