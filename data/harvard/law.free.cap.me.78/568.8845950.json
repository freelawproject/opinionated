Levant? For it is an elementary principle of law too familiar to repeat that \" <em>quifacit per aliam qui fac\u00fc per se,\u201d </em>and that \" advances made by an agent in the proper execution of a regular authority, are to be repaid by his principal, with this qualification, that the transaction out of which they arise is not of an illegal nature.\u201d Dunlap\u2019s Paley on Agency, 4th ed., and that the rule applies as well to municipal corporations as to individuals. <em>Sanborn </em>v. <em>Inhab. of Deerfield, </em>2 N.

It is well settled that he can not. The compensation of some town officers is provided for by statute. The compensation of assessors, selectmen, and overseers of the poor, is thus provided for. R. S., c. 6, \u00a7 102. Such compensation may of course be recovered, whether the town is willing1 to pay it or not. So, if the town has expressly voted a compensation. But in the absence of any such statute or vote, no compensation can be recovered. <em>Talbot </em>v. <em>East Machias, </em>76 Maine, 415; <em>Sikes </em>v. <em>Hatfield, </em>13 Gray, 347; <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>129 Mass. 578; Dillon\u2019s Mun.

Unfortunately for him, neither the town nor the legislature has annexed any compensation to his office. The verdict, therefore, is contrary to law, and must be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">\n<em>The motion is sustained, the verdict set aside, and a neto trial granted.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b569-7\">Peters, C.
