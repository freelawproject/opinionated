The question in controversy involved the location of the line between those two lots. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>verdict was in favor of the plaintiff and the defendant alleged exceptions to the ruling stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b185-4\"><em>Davis and Bailey, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Alq\">cited: <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Spaulding, </em>29 Maine, 112 ; <em>Heaton </em>v. <em>Hodges, </em>14 Maine, 66; <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Patten, </em>13 Maine, 329; <em>Esmond </em>v. <em>Tarbox, </em>7 Maine, 61; <em>Pike </em>v. <em>Dyke, </em>2 Maine, 213.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b185-5\"><em>A.

No extraneous aid can be called in except in the single case of latent ambiguity. Here there is none such and the rule must have its legitimate course. This rule itself settles all doubt and all question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-8\">A second 'rule applicable to this case is so well established as to admit of no doubt, that where a plan is mentioned to establish or help define the premises conveyed, it becomes a part of the deed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-9\">The plan not only makes a part of the deed but a controlling part and is as if incorporated into it, a part of its very corpus, not only establishing lines, but conditions, restrictions and appurtenant rights not even alluded to in the deed.

Herrick then made a plan of the surveyings of the whole town, which plan was in the case. The defendant\u2019s lot was in the south half .that had been surveyed by Herrick.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">The jury were instructed in effect, the lines run by Herrick upon the surface of the earth, as and for the boundaries of lot five would still be the boundaries of that lot, if their locality could be found, that the question for them to decide was, the locality upon the surface of the earth of the lines actually run by Herrick in making the survey of that lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">The instruction was correct. <em>Esmond </em>v. <em>Tarbox, </em>7 Maine, 61, is express authority for it. See also <em>Pike </em>v. <em>Dyke, </em>2 Maine, 213; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Spaulding, </em>29 Maine, 112. The plan was merely a picture. The survey was the substance. The plan was not made to show where the lots were to be hereafter located, or how they were to be hereafter bounded. It was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>made as evidence of where they had before been located and bounded. The lot actually surveyed, bounded by the lines actually run, was the lot intended to be conveyed. The plan was named in the deed, rather as a picture indicating the location and lines of the lot. Still the actual boundaries, rather than the pictured boundaries were to be sought for. The picture might not be wholly accurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">The defendant\u2019s counsel urges that the words of the deeds in the cases cited, are merely of \"reference to the plan,\u201d which he claims, simply indicate the relative location of the lot without attempting to define the boundaries. He claims that the language of his deed being \"according to the plan,\u201d does undertake to define the boundaries and to limit them to the plan. In <em>Esmond </em>v. Tarbox, supra, it does not appear that the language was of reference merely. Such language however, has full as much force. There is no difference in the effect. <em>Lincoln </em>v. <em>Wilder, </em>29 Maine, 179; <em>Erskine </em>v. <em>Moulton, </em>66 Maine, 276.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b187-6\">Peters, C.
