R. R. Co. </em>v. Veazie, 39 Maine, 571, 577-8. It cannot be presumed that persons agreeing to become shareholders in a corporation with a fixed capital intend to become members of a corporation with a less capital. Morw. Corp. 259.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">\"It is a rule of law too well settled to be now questioned,\u201d says Shaw C. J., \"that when the capital stock and number of shares are fixed by the act of incorporation, or by any vote or bylaw passed conformably to the act of incorporation, no assessment can be lawfully made on the share of any subscriber, until the whole number of shares has been taken. This is no arbitrary rule; it is founded on a plain dictate of justice and the strict principles regulating the obligation of contracts. When a man subscribes a share to stock to consist of one thousand shares, in order to carry on some designated enterprise, he binds himself to pay a thousandth part of the cost of such enterprise. If only five hundred shares are subscribed for, he would be held, if liable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>to assessments, to pay a five hundredth part of the cost, besides incurring\u2019the risk of entire failure and loss of the amount advanced toward it.\u201d <em>Stoneham B. R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>2 Gray, 278; <em>Cabot and W. S.B. Co. </em>v. <em>Chapin, &amp; </em>Cush. 50; <em>Atlantic Col. Mills </em>v. <em>Abbott, </em>9 Cush. 423 ; <em>Salem Mill Dam Corp. </em>v. <em>Ropes, </em>6 Pick. 23; S. C. 9 Pick. 187; <em>Central T. Corp. </em>v. <em>Valentine, </em>10 Pick. 142; N. <em>H. Cent. R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>30 N. H. 390.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">This rule may be changed by a provision in the articles of subscription. Or if a subscriber, with a full knowledge of the want of the requisite amount of subscriptions attend meetings of the corporation and cooperate in such of its acts as could only be properly done on the assumption that the subscribers intended to proceed with the stock partially taken up, he might be estopped from setting up such defence. <em>Cabot &amp; W. S. B. </em>v. <em>Chapin, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">In the case at bar, the defendant\u2019s intestate agreed to become responsible for one-fortieth of the cost of the plaintiff\u2019s enter-prize. There is no evidence that the whole capital stock was taken. If all have paid who subscribed except the defendant\u2019s intestate, then the maintenance of this action would oblige him to become responsible for one-thirtieth, which contract he never made.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b169-7\">Putees, C.
