The plaintiff lost all the fingers of one hand by the injury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-12\">At the trial the plaintiff\u2019s counsel requested that the following instruction be given to the jury :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-13\">\" When defendants set plaintiff at work sawing pickets upon their circular saw, they were in duty bound to provide good and sufficient machinery for that purpose, with such safeguards against injury to him in running the saw, as common experience in that business had shown tobe necessary, whether the defendants - personally knew that such safeguards were necessary or not.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-14\">The presiding judge instructed the jury upon the point, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-15\">\" Gentlemen : I so instruct you. Upon that point I rule the law as it is claimed by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel. To that extent their liability is absolute. When they engage in a business that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>requires machinery, they must see to it at their peril that the machinery, which they require their workmen to operate, is reasonably safe. The law does not require extraordinary care to apply to their machines all modern improvements instantaneously, but they must provide such safeguards, they must see-, that their machinery is provided with such safeguards against injury to their workmen, as is usual in the business; or, as I stated before, they must see to it at their peril that the machinery is reasonably safe.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-4\">The verdict was for the plaintiff for nine hundred and thirty-five dollars, and the defendant alleged exceptions to the foregoing instruction.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b115-5\"><em>A.

Smith, 28 Yt. 59, the plaintiff was in the-employ of the defendants as engineer, with a defective fire-box, of which neither plaintiff nor defendants were aware. In consequence of such defect an explosion occurred, by which the plaintiff was injured.

C. the court say : \"Every person who admits another into \u25a0his employment, whereby constitutes him a servant, is bound to furnish and maintain such instruments as are suitable to his work, and as may be used with safety to the person employed. 'The law, by implication, makes such a stipulation a part of every \u25a0contract for service; and in proportion as the employment is \u00a1hazardous, so is the rigid enforcement of the master\u2019s duty.\u201d See also <em>Hough </em>v. <em>Railroad Go. </em>10 Otto (100 U.

In such case, it is implied' among other things, on the part of the master, that he shall use ordinary care and diligence in supplying and maintaining for the servant\u2019s use in that more or less hazardous business, such saws and appliances as are reasonably safe. And the correlative implication on the part of the servant is, among other things, that he shall take upon himself the risks which ordinarily attend or are incident to the business in which he thus voluntarily engages.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">The implied duty of the master being measured by the legal standard of ordinary care, his knowledge or want of knowledge of the actual condition of the machinery when it falls below the' legal standard of being reasonably safe and causes the injury,, becomes a material element. <em>Buzzell </em>v. <em>Laconia Man'f Co. </em>48 Maine, 113, 122. Hence, although not a complete defence-necessarily, it is admissible for the defendant to testify that he had no knowledge or information of its defective condition. <em>Boyle </em>v. <em>Mowry, </em>122 Mass. 251. When the master, therefore, does not know of the dangerous condition of the machinery and, has exercised that standard of care in relation thereto, he has-discharged his duty and there is nothing of which negligence-can be predicated. And such is the result of all the cases. Hence writers upon this topic have said : \" If the master knew or ought to have known, and the servant did not know, and was not bound to know of its existence, the liability of the master \u2014 the servant having been otherwise in the exercise of due care \u2014 is fixed. And it is equally true in every case, that unless the master knew of the defect which subsequently produced the-injury, or was under a duty of knowing it, he cannot be held\u2019 liable.\u201d 2 Thomp. Neg. 992-3. Or as the same view is expressed! <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>by another: \" To render the master liable, it must appear that he knew, or from the nature of the case ought to have known of the unfitness of the means of labor furnished to the servant, and that the servant did not know, or could not reasonably be held to have known of the defect.\u201d Beach Con. Neg. \u00a7 123.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">We are of opinion, therefore, \u25a0 that since knowledge on the part of the master, or its equivalent \u2014 negligent ignorance \u2014 is essential to hold the master, the first instruction making the master\u2019s liability absolute was not sufficiently favorable to the defendants and may have misled the jury. Having no occasion to pass upon the other exception, therefore, the entry must be,</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b118-6\">Peters, C.
