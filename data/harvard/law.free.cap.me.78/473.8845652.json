You may state the circumstances, so far as you remember, of your dealings with John H. Higgins in the year 1884. \u25a0 \u2018 ,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-6\">Ans. In that year a certain fellow told me, I was informed that John Higgins and Sidney Brown stole those two heifers from my pasture, one was mine and the other William-, and I called Brad Higgins over to my house, as he didn\u2019t live but a few steps, and told him the story that I heard; that I heard that those two fellows stole my heifers ; and we talked there a few minutes and I told him that I afterwards went with him and saw John Higgins. I told them over there what I had heard and they wanted to know who told me, and I told them I should not tell them then, at that time, and passed back home; and in a few minutes John Higgins came over to my house and wanted to know of me if Chester Brown told me that he stole my heifers. Said I, \u201cNo.\u201d Said I, \"Chester Brown didn\u2019t tell me that you stole them.\u201d Said I, \"He told me that you and Sidney Brown stole them.\u201d. Well, he said he was going to put Chester through for telling such a story as that about him. Said I, \" I can\u2019t help what you do about that.\u201d Said I, \"If there is any proof I can get about the heifers,\u201d said I, \"I shall try to prove about my heifers.\u201d Well, he came to Ellsworth that day he said, and I saw nothing more of them until the time that the meeting was here, the city meeting, fall meeting, in September. I met John Higgins here on the street; he said he had seen Chester Brown, and Chester Brown said he never told me no such thing, and I was a damned liar, \"and now,\u201d said he, \"If you don\u2019t drop this,\u201d said he, \"I will make hot work for you,\u201d and I took it he was going to burn me up, burn my buildings. There was nothing more said then for a day or two, and I went over to Bradford Higgins after my tackle that I had lent a man, rope pullies that I had lent a man to kill a beef critter there, and spoke to John Higgins about the heifers, then told him if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>lie would pay for my heifers I would drop it, wouldn\u2019t go any further. He said he wouldn\u2019t do no such thing, and he didn\u2019t steal the heifers, and wouldn\u2019t pay me for the heifers. He said he had something against me he was going to State\u2019s prison me for, said he had been to see as good a lawyer as there was in town. I didn\u2019t make much talk to him, but went home with my tackle. . . . When I went over this second time, John and Bradford Higgins were both present. At that time there was something said about the crime I had committed. They said I had committed a crime. John said so, and he said if I didn't come out and fix it up with them that they were going to put me in State\u2019s prison, or could do it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-5\">Q. What did they want you to do ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-6\">A. They wanted me to give them $100.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-7\">Q. State what was said.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-8\">A. I will state as near as I can remember. John Higgins said if I didn\u2019t come out to Ellsworth and fix up with them that he would State\u2019s prison me for a crime I had done when I was a boy, against a mare. His father and mother see me do it; and 1 told them I didn\u2019t know whether I would or not. I would think it over ; and I went back home, and along in the evening I went there \u2014 dare\u2019sn\u2019t stay there alone, and went over and got Herman Hooper to get him to come over and stay with me. Herman said he would come over. I met him on the road and went to his house, and stayed there and talked a few minutes, and went down back of the house the back way and stopped a few minutes, and then went down to John Carter\u2019s. I stayed and talked with John Carter a few minutes, as John lives off from the county road, passed up on the county road and passed along a little ways to the main back road that goes through from my place to Bangor, and up to the private way that goes across to my house, and when I got there I see \u2014 when we got there, Herman and I, we see two men\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-9\">Q. Where did you go next?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-10\">A. Standing in the door, and went out to see who they were, and then went into the house. John Higgins was one of them and Hollis Hooper was the other. Then we went into the house. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>Herman stayed there. This was between 10 and 11 o\u2019clock at night. Herman stayed there a little while with me, and said he must go home to feed his horse, and he was gone a few minutes .and came back again. I was in my bed-room when he came, making my bed, I think, and he says : I was informed that\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-4\">Q. Did any one come to the door soon after ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-5\">A. They did. Bradford Higgins and John came to the door. I went to the door, I asked Herman to go with me, and Herman went to the door with me, and there was John Higgins and Bradford stood at the door. John Higgins said that he thought Herman was going to carry mo away somewheres, and I was going to dispose of my property and run away, and \"we are going to watch you to-night, and if you go away anywheres we shall telegraph after you to stop you.\u201d \"Now,\u201d said he : \"If you don\u2019t go to Ellsworth and fix up with us to-morrow, why, we will State\u2019s prison you,\u201d and they started away; and I went back into the house. There was nothing more stated at all\u2014 well, it was that they would State\u2019s prison me on this mare scrape, he said; and there was nothing more said till the next morning. I came to Ellsworth and they overtook me out here on the road. I don\u2019t remember justly what they said. They overtook me up to Mr. Grant\u2019s. That is about half or three-quarters of a mile from here. I had slept none for a number of nights, none to amount to anything. \u2022 We came in here and they watched me around, and at last I saw John down there on the corner. He told me, said he :\u2022 \"Come, go up into this office and fix up with me as I want you to and I went up into the office. I don\u2019t remember what was done up there, to amount to anything. I know there was some papers passed to me and I signed them, and I had no more talk with them after, from that time to this, anything more than, just speak.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b476-6\"><em>.Wiswell and </em>King, for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b476-7\"><em>John B.
