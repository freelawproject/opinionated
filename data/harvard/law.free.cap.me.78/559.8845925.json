The defendants rely with full confidence on their exception to the exclusion of Dr. Martin\u2019s testimony. Mr. Lawson in his recent work on expert evidence, on p. 107, rule 27, states that the opinion of a medical man upon the condition of the human <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>system, or the likelihood of recovery, is admissible, and on pp. 114 and 115, under D he cites various cases illustrating the point; and such is, undoubtedly, familiar law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b562-4\">2. It is submitted that the testimony of Ethel Brackett, that she had been previously bitten by the defendant\u2019s dog, was inadmissible.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b562-5\">At common law the action for damages by a dog, is based on the negligence of its owner, and hence cannot be maintained without proof of scienter. <em>Le Forest </em>v. <em>Tolman, </em>117 Mass. 109 ; 1 Thompson on Negligence, p. 218, \u00a7 32. 0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b562-6\">And in such an action evidence of a habit of a dog to bite is receivable, as tending to show knowledge on the part of the owner. But even then we submit the fact sought to be proved must be brought home to the owner\u2019s knowledge. That is the gist and object of the evidence. <em>Le Forest </em>v. <em>Tolman, </em>117 Mass. 110; Shearman,and Redfield on Negligence, \u00a7 \u00a7 189, 190, 191, and eases cited in the note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b562-7\">The evidence if strong enough, is perhaps also admissible at common law to, show motive on the part of the defendants and to lay the foundation for punitive damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b562-8\">But under our statute the action is not based on negligence, but is arbitrary and in a sense penal, and requires no proof but the fact of defendant\u2019s ownership and plaintiff\u2019s injury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b562-9\">Hence in the statutory action no scienter need be approved. <em>Pressey </em>v. <em>Wirth, </em>3 Allen, 191; 1 Thompson on Negligence, p. 218, \u00a7 32 and cases cited in note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b562-10\">Under such a statute the evidence received is in any view wholly irrelevant and inadmissible and only tends, as here, to prejudice the defendant and unjustly to swell the already penal damages given by the statute. This has been distinctly passed upon by the Supreme Court of New Hampshire, under a statute substantially the same as ours. The case is, <em>Fast Kingston </em>v. Towle, 48 N. H. 57; 2 Am. Rep. 174. See also <em>Ogle </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>87 Xnd. 600, 44 Am. Rep. 778.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b562-11\">In <em>Whitney v. Bayley, </em>4 Allen, 173, the court hold that the introduction of immaterial evidence is no ground for a new trial if the jury are instructed to disregard it, and there is no reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>to apprehend that it could have prejudiced the minds of the jurors. See also, <em>Railroad </em>v. <em>Levy, </em>59 Texas, 542 (46 Am. Rep. 269).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b563-3\">8. We urge also upon the court\u2019s attention the exception to the narration by Dr. Wilbur, the plaintiff\u2019s witness, on direct examination, of the symptoms, history, results and assumed causes of a case which occurred in California, from some accident of which the witness had no personal knowledge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b563-4\">In <em>(Jlarh </em>v. <em>Willett, </em>83 Cal. 534, the court held that an expert cannot, on direct fexamination be questioned as to the facts and history of cases on which he may wholly or partly have formed his opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b563-5\">It is clear that the attempted withdrawal was unavailing for two reasons.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b563-6\">First, that the evidence was not in fact permitted to be withdrawn, nor is it pretended that the jury were instructed to disregard it. Second, because at the stage of the case the evidence could not legally be withdrawn. <em>Railroad </em>v. Levy, 59 Texas, 542 (46 Am. Rep. 269).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b563-7\">4. We contend that the question asked by the defendants of Dr. Howe, the plaintiff\u2019s attending physician, should have been admitted. It was a hypothetical question based on an assumed fact not then in evidence, but which was put in evidence by the defendants\u2019 witness, Dr. Taylor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b563-8\">5. We submit that the declaration sets out no injury except from the bite of the dog. Under a declaration somewhat similar, \u25a0and under practically the same statute, the Supreme Court of Massachusetts sustained the ruling of the court below, that unless it was proved that the dog bit the plaintiff the action could not be maintained.\u201d <em>Searles </em>v. <em>Ladd, </em>123 Mass. 580.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b563-10\">Walton, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALTZ\">As the plaintiff, a little girl, nine years of age, was walking quietly along the street, she was suddenly set upon by the defendants\u2019 dog, a large English mastiff, and thrown down upon the ground, and bit with such force and violence that the dog\u2019s teeth went through her clothing and into her flesh, and inflicted a wound upon her left hip nearly two inches in length <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>.and half an inch or more in depth. For these injuries she has \u25a0obtained a verdict for $1,450.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">The first question is whether this amount is so large as to \u00a1require the court to set the verdict aside and grant a new trial. We do not think it is. The assault was a severe one. Not only was the plaintiff severely wounded, but she must have been .greatly shocked and frightened. And the evidence tends to show that she was taken sick immediately after the assault and \u2022confined to her bed for several weeks, and that she has been \u2022lame ever since. There is no reason 'to believe that she is shamming. In fact, we understand it to be conceded that she is .now suffering from \"hip disease.\u201d The defendants contend, and it may be true, that this is the result of hereditary scrofula, .-and not the bite of the dog. To this, it is readied, that while it \u25a0may be true that the plaintiff has a naturally weak and delicate \u25a0constitution, and ivas for that reason more likely to be seriously affected by wounds and shocks and frights, still, the assault of the dog must have been the direct and proximate cause of much, if not the whole, of her subsequent sufferings and sickness, and that \u00a1the amount assessed by the jury is by no means excessive. We lhave read the evidence with care, and in our opinion another trial would be as likely to result in an increase as a diminution of the \u25a0damages. Certainly the defendants can have no reasonable expectation of reducing the damages enough to cover the costs of \u25a0auother trial. The trial already had lasted eight days, and the expense for counsel and for witnesses, and especially for the medical expert witnesses from a distance, must have been large; and there is no reason to suppose that another trial would occupy less time or be less expensive. A new trial would not therefore be likely to be of any benefit to the defendants. It might result in a serious loss to them. To the plaintiff it would be a great hardship. That she is lame and feeble there can be no doubt. .During the trial already had, she was subjected to many painful irnd indelicate examinations. Her spine was examined by percussion. Her diseased limb was tested by pressure and by bending and flexing the joints. In one instance, in a state of nudity, she was laid upon a board and thus examined. And all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>tills, not with a view to her medical treatment, but to ascertain the extent of her injuries, and whether or not she was shamming. Surely, to justify granting another trial, and again subjecting this little girl to similar treatment, the court ought to have strong reasons. We find no such reasons in the amount of the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">Nor do we find any thing in the exceptions to justify granting a new trial. All the rulings admitting and excluding evidence, and the instructions to the jury, were, under the circumstances disclosed in the report, so obviously correct, that we do not deem it necessary to discuss them.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">\n<em>Motion and exceptions overruled. Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b565-7\">Peters, C. J., DaNeortii, Emery, Foster, and Haskell,. JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
