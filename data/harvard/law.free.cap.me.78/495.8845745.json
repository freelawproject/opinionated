Gray, called by the state, testified on direct exami<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>nation that he had a conversation with Devereaux Fenlason in the spring of 1885. He was talking over the matter of the trouble between his uncle Stillman and aunt Sophronia; he said if his aunt Sophronia got that property away from Stillman that the buildings would be burned. I told him to be careful how he talked; that the town had a mortgage on that property and the mortgage and notes were in my hands, and he said he did not care if they had, nevertheless there would be a brand put in inside of two months. That was in \u00bfreference to the same premises upon which Munson afterwards lived, which were burned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-4\">The respondent objected to the conversation, but the objection was overruled, and exception was duly taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-5\">In the charge to the jury the court used the language following, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-6\">\" I do not understand that there is any controversy here in regard to this fact; that the dwelling house of Mrs. Munson was burned in the night time of the 17th of July last, I do not understand to be controverted; nor do I understand that it is material^ controverted that it was done by some person with the criminal intent, wilfully and maliciously.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-7\">The respondent took exception to this expression of opinion, but no objection was made nor exception taken before the jury retired, and no such contention was made.

After being out some time the jury were brought into court, and, after further instruction from the court, were required to retire and consider the case further. This was about eleven o\u2019clock Saturday evening. After twelve o\u2019clock Saturday night, at about half past twelve o\u2019clock, on the Lord\u2019s day, the court still being in open session, the court directed the officer to give to the jury blank forms, with directions that when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>they agreed upon a verdict they should make it in writing and seal it up. The respondent and his attorney were present when this direction and instruction was given, and they neither \u2022objected nor assented to it.

To this inquiry there was no direct response, and it does not appear that the jury had considered or formed any opinion on this point, further than that expressed in these words of the foreman, namely :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b497-7\">Court: Mr. Clerk, you may inquire of the foreman whether they found that no person was lawfully in the house.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b497-8\">Clerk : What say you, Mr. Foreman, was any person lawfully within the house at the time it was burned?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b497-9\">Foreman : The house that was burned?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b497-10\">Court: It means whether any person was actually, lawfully in it, when it was burned-.

As to the admission of the testimony of Gray about threats made by the respondent to burn the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Evidence of prior threats by a respondent to do the particular act he is charged with doing, is clearly admissible. No citation of authorities is needed to establish this proposition. The threats testified to by Gray were threats to burn the same building the respondent was charged with burning. It is urged in the argument that the ownership of the building had changed between the time of the threats and the time of the burning. The bill of exceptions does not state any such change of ownership. If there had been such a change it would weaken the force of the evidence, but we doubt if it would entirely exclude it. The evidence would still have some tendency to prove some element of the crime charged, the act, the intent, the malice, or at least the disposition of mind of the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">II. As to the presiding justice\u2019s statement in his charge of what was uncontroverted.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">It is the duty of the presiding justice to present the case to the jury as plainly as possible. He should eliminate uncontro-verted matters and distinctly point out the precise issues. If he errs in assuming a matter to be uncontroverted which a party intended to controvert, his attention should be called to the error before the jury retire, that he may make proper corrections. Rule XT. <em>Murchie </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>78 Maine, 300. In this case no. objection was made to the judge\u2019s statement of the controversy, and indeed the bill of exceptions states that no such contention was made as the counsel now suggests. We therefore assume, that the controversy was correctly stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>III. As to the expression in the charge upon the matter of the respondent\u2019s attempted <em>alibi.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">It is true, the respondent need not prove his <em>alibi </em>beyond a reasonable doubt. He may show where he was at the time the act was committed, and perhaps the farther off he was from the scene of action, the more doubt he raises as to his guilt. Still he may have \u25a0 participated, though at a distance, and hence distance is not a conclusive answer to the indictment, unless it be so great as to render it impossible for him to have participated in the crime. It appears from the charge (the whole charge being made a part of the bill of exceptions) that the respondent\u2019s counsel had claimed in his argument to the jury, there was \"the most perfect proof of an <em>alibi,\u201d </em>while the testimony of the respondent\u2019s own witnesses showed that he was within twenty-five rods or thereabouts. The judge suggested to the jury to ascertain if the respondent was near enough to assist by giving warning or otherwise, and then in alluding to the counsel\u2019s claim that an <em>alibi </em>was proved, used the expression complained of. Counsel seemed to contend that proof of any distance was proof of <em>alibi, </em>and hence a conclusive answer to the indictment. The judge simply stated in effect, that to make mere distance a conclusive answer, as an <em>alibi, </em>it must be shown to be so great as to render it impossible for the respondent to have participated. This was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">IV. As to the Sunday proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">It is settled in this state that a jury may deliberate on Sunday and may write out and seal up their verdict on Sunday. <em>True </em>v. <em>Plumley, </em>36 Maine, 466. The weight of authority is in favor of the proposition that the court may receive a verdict on Sunday, the case having gone to the jury before Sunday. <em>Hoghtaling </em>v. <em>Osborn, </em>15 Johns. 119; <em>Hurdekoper </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>3 Watts, 56<em>; Baxter </em>v. <em>People, </em>3 Gil. 368, cited with approval in <em>True </em>v. <em>Plumley; </em>see also <em>Van Riper </em>v. <em>Van Riper, </em>1 Southard, 176; <em>Webber </em>v. <em>Merrill, </em>34 N. H. 202; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ricketts, </em>74 N. C. 187; <em>Reed </em>v. <em>State, </em>53 Ala. 502; see also notes to 12 Am. Dec. 291.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">If the jury may deliberate on Sunday and write out and seal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>up their verdict on Sunday, if the court may receive the verdict on Sunday, it would seem the presiding justice might on Sunday send blank forms to the jury with instructions to write out and seal up the verdict when agreed upon, without thereby invalidating tlio entire proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">V. As to the sealing the verdict and the separation of the jury, before returning the verdict into court and there affirming it.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">It was resolved by this court as reported in 63 Maine, 590, that in any criminal case, where the punishment was not death or imprisonment for life, the jury might lawfully seal up their verdict, when agreed upon, and might then separate during a temporary adjournment of court. In this case the judge, in his charge, had expressly instructed the jury that the evidence showed no person lawfully in the house at the time of the firing, and that they must so find. This lowered the grade of the offence, from one necessarily punishable by life imprisonment, to one only discretionally so punishable. No verdict could he recorded for the greater offence. It is contended by the state that the case, at the time of the giving the directions to seal up the verdict, was thus one within the resolution of the court above cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">But however all this may be, and whatever might be our duty if the respondent had seasonably objected to what he now calls irregularities, it appears from his bill of exceptions that he and his counsel were present in court and saw all these things done and made no objection. No intimation was given to the presiding justice that the respondent or his counsel had any objection to any of these proceedings, or regarded them as possibly detrimental, or even irregular. An objection from the respondent would probably have prevented them. He probably saw no harm in them. They were not matters of substance. They were matter\u2019s of purely formal procedure, which perhaps he might have insisted should be carried on after strict, ancient forms, but he did not so insist, nor even suggest. Having thus tacitly waived the irregularity, if any, and having permitted, without remonstrance, the court to order things for the admitted convenience of all persons concerned, he should not now have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>these proceeding's quashed and another trial ordered, unless it appears he was at least probably prejudiced by the alleged irregularities. After conscientious study and reflection upon the case, we are satisfied that no harm was likely to come to him, and none did in fact come to him from the proceedings now complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">VI. As to the dii'ection of the presiding justice to the jury to sign and return the special finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">This direction^ and the consequent special finding that no person was lawfully in the house at the time of the firing, was clearly for the benefit of the respondent. He did not object to it, and was not prejudiced by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled. Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b504-7\">Peters, C.
