The defendants claimed it was an act only to empower a New Hampshire corporation to exercise its franchise in Maine. The act was made a part of the case. Also, the acts of the legislatures <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>of New Hampshire and Massachusetts, mentioned in the act of Maine.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-4\">Since 1841 the stock of the toll-bridge constructed by the defendant corporation, if it be such, has been and still is owned by the Eastern Railroad, a corporation in Massachusetts, and the P. S. &amp; P. R. R., a corporation in Maine, in equal shares. Only one issue of stock was ever made; and this was made in New Hampshire, where the management, offices and seat of administration of said corporation have always been, its records always kept, and all its meetings required by its by-laws to be, and in fact, are held. No meeting was ever held in Maine.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-5\">In 1880 the defendant corporation held no estate or property in the town of Kittery, except its franchise and that part of its bridge which covered the Piscataqua river, between the shore end thereof and the New Hampshire line, situated in the town of Kittery. The bridge rests on piles and lands, at its easterly end, at and wholly within a public highway. There is no pier at the eastern or Kittery end of said <em>bridge; </em>but piers are erected at the two sides of the draw for the passage of vessels, and which are constructed in that half of the .bridge situated in Maine, and in said town.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-6\">The tax which the plaintiff town seeks to recover was assessed upon that portion of the Portsmouth toll-bridge situated in the limits of theState of Maine, being in the town of Kittery aforesaid, for the year 1880, by the assessors of said town.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b94-7\"><em>J.

Section 19 provides for assessing the property in event of a failure to make returns required by section 21, chap. 46. (The latter provision, of course, applies only to domestic corporations.) The two sections, construed together, plainly negative the legislative intent to tax both stock and property in any case, except those specifically mentioned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-6\">For the provisions of section 19, applying only in cases when a duty has been neglected, and not when it has been performed, must be wholly without effect if it prescribe a mode of taxation in a single class of cases which is also applicable to all cases. None but a construction in violent opposition to all familiar rules could admit of this conclusion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-7\">(2.) But again, if the phraseology were not so pointed, the double taxation which ensues, if in all cases the property may be taxed, as well as the stock, is never presumed to be intended by the legislature. If the power to impose double taxation be conceded, nothing short of a clearly expressed intent to exercise such power will suffice to warrant a court in thus interpreting statutes. Here is not merely an entire absence of any words evincing such intent, but the words actually used in both sections 16 and 19, cannot be given full effect consistently with the theory of any such legislative intent. <em>Augusta Bank </em>v. <em>Augusta, </em>36 Maine, 259 ; Cooley on Taxation, 164, 165 ; <em>Oity and County of San Francisco, Applts. </em>v. <em>Spring Valley Water Works, </em>63 Cal. 524.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-8\">Defendant corporation held no real estate in Maine; it owned no land at all; its bridge occupied no land in Maine, excepting only such as its easterly end landed upon, on the bank of the river, which was wholly within the limits of, and a part of the public highway. The State of Maine owned the land \u2014 unless a portion of it were flats \u2014to the middle of the river <em>(vide State </em>v. <em>'Wagner, </em>61 Maine, 178-190), and granted the privilege of erecting this bridge, by means of which defendant corporation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>could enjoy the franchise it had. This privilege thus to land travellers it was authorized to receive tolls from in the public highway was in no sense to be regarded as real estate. The bridge (that is, whatever of it was in Maine) stood upon no land owned by the corporation; its only value was as incidental to the franchise itself \u2014 one of the means of utilizing which it was. It could not bo separately sold apart from the franchise itself, and hence, as such, in itself, it was valueless. This is the reasoning of C. J. Shaw in <em>Central Bridge Oo. </em>v. <em>Loioell, </em>15 Gray, 106.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b97-4\">Haskell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ARM\">Debt for a tax assessed by the town of Kittory upon that part of Portsmouth toll bridge situated within that town.
