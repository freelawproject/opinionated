The case comes before the court on demurrer to the declaration which contains three counts, in each of which the words are alleged to have been uttered \"about the first of April, 1884.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b41-17\">In neither count has the plaintiff definitely set out the time when the alleged words were uttered. There is not that certainty as to time, which the fundamental rules of pleading require to be alleged in reference to traversable facts. \"In personal actions, the pleadings must allege the time; that is, the day, month and year when each traversable fact occurred.\u201d Stephen on Pleading, Ch. II, \u00a7 IY, Rule 2 ; 1 Chitty\u2019s PI. 257. \"It is a general rule of pleading in personal actions, that the time of every traversable fact must be stated; that is, that every such fact must be alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>to have taken place on some particular day.\u201d Gould on Pleading, Ch. Ill, \u00a7 63. And it is held that this rule applies where it is not material to prove the time as laid. <em>Platt </em>v. Jones, 59 Maine, 241. The word \" about \u201d renders the allegation of time indefinite and uncertain. <em>Platt </em>v. <em>Jones, supra; State </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>34 Maine, 52. A reference to the decisions where this question has been adjudicated is all that is necessary. <em>Gilmore </em>v. <em>Mathews, </em>67 Maine, 520; <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Sidelinger, </em>72 Maine, 114; <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Lathrop, </em>75 Maine, 302; <em>Ring </em>v. <em>Roxbrough, </em>2 Crompt. and Jervis, 418-.
