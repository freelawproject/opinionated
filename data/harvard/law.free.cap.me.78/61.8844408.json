The case was heard by a sheriff\u2019s jury presided over by a commissioner appointed by the county commissioners. At the hearing the petitioners\u2019 counsel noted certain exceptions to the rulings of the commissioner, and upon the filing of the verdict and report of the commissioner in the Supreme Judicial Court the petitioner filed a motion in writing to set aside the verdict, because, among other reasons, of the rulings of the commissioner which are sufficiently stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-7\">The case came to the law court under the provision of Stat. 1880, c. 242. The report states that the party filing the motion did not agree to an adjudication by the court, for the reason that it believed that the questions could be more satisfactorily presented upon report than by exceptions, and therefore reported the case to the law court for judgment upon the law and the facts.

Putnam, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-9\">By various acts of legislation, the railroad corporation is obliged, not only to build and maintain so much of the way as is within the limits of its railroad, if at grade, as in the case at bar, but also, inasmuch as the road is laid out at grade, to do the following things: First. By the provision contained in the present Revised Statutes, c. 51, \u00a7 75, to delay running its trains to the low speed of six miles per hour. Second. By \u00a7 33, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>the necessity of maintaining signs. Third. By \u00a7 34, to the order of municipal officers of the town which laid out the way, to erect gates or maintain flagmen ; and Fourth. To the necessity of fencing across the location, or otherwise preventing the access upon its track of cattle and persons from the way laid out.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b63-4\">Part of these things were imposed upon railroad corporations, undoubtedly in the exercise of the police power of the state. So far as they were the exercise of the police power of the state, corporations were compelled to observe them with reference to all ways existing when the several statutes requiring these things were enacted, and to do this, without receiving compensation ; but aside from the mere matter of the obligation to construct and maintain the way within the limits of the location, which is expressly imposed upon the corporation, we believe there is no statute, Avhich either denies or affirms that all these matters may or may not be taken into consideration in determining the damages which railroad corporations are entitled to recover by reason of the laying out of new ways.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b63-5\">Therefore it will .be observed, the question is not at all the question of the police powers of the legislature, or of the powers of the legislature under the provision subjecting corporations to the general laws of the state ; but only a question whether, with reference to damages, the same rule applies to railroad corporations which applies to individuals, and whether they are not, like individuals, entitled upon the consideration of damages to have allowance made for all the existing circumstances and reasonable probabilities, arising either out of tlie natural condition of things, or out of the condition of things existing by reason of the impositions of the statutes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b63-6\">In <em>Old Golony &lt;&amp; Fall River Railroad Go. </em>v. <em>County of Plymouth, </em>14 Gray, 155, the court held upon general principles, that a railroad corporation situated as the petitioner\u2019s, was entitled to some damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b63-7\">The reasoning of the court in <em>Ford </em>v. <em>The County Commissioners, </em>64 Maine, 408, clearly assumes that the owner of aright of way may be entitled to damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b63-8\">Being entitled to damages, ive claim that the same rule is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>be applied to us as to any other person or corporation ; that' as in case of such other persons or corporations, the town having entered upon our exclusive possessions and laid its way across part of our location, we are entitled to be compensated for all the incidents arising therefrom. <em>Bangor &amp; Piscataquis Railroad Go. </em>v. <em>McGomb, </em>60 Maine, 290.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b64-4\">The jury were expressly confined to considering the value of the strips fifty or more feet wide on each side of the main track, in their existing unused condition, and to estimate them precisely as they would estimate them if they were parts of desolate sand plains, removed from all inhabitants, used only for the main track of the road and with no prospect of any possible use for any other purpose.'</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b64-5\">We claim that this was a clear violation of law and of justice. <em>Pinkham </em>v. <em>Chelmsford, </em>109 Mass. 225 ; <em>Boom Go. </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>98 II.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALo\">The town of Deering laid out two of its new ways over the track of a railroad company, and the question before a sheriff\u2019s jury was as to the damages sustained by the company for the easements taken. The commissioner presiding at the hearing instructed the jury that they were simply to estimate the natural and actual direct damages sustained by reason of the crossings, regard being had to the use which the crossings were put to, namely, town ways; but that, in estimating such damages they should not consider the mere probable use in the future to which the land taken might be put by the railroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">We think the latter branch of the instruction was erroneous. It too closely qualifies or construes the general rule. The jury, in order to decide what the damages were, should have been allowed to take into consideration, not only the use which the railroad was then making of their land, but the use which in all probability it would thereafter make of it. The error, no doubt, occurred from the commissioner having another principle in mind, which he was endeavoring to inculcate correctly to the_ jury, and that is, that prospective and speculative damages are not recoverable. But a distinction is to be observed between what land may be worth in the future and what it is now worth in view of the future. And as no man can foresee the future with any certainty, we are allowed to base calculations to some extent on the reasonable probabilities of the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">There is a vast amount of land which is useless, unproductive, and costly to keep, and valuable only for the use which the future is quite sure to bring to it. If the railroad is not likely to make any more extended use of the land than it now does, the damages would be one sum, while if it be sure or in a high degree probable that it will soon make a greater and more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>beneficial use of the land, the damages may be another sum. And so it is a general principle affecting such questions, that iff the future use of land will in all probability be greater and more valuable than its present use, such probability may be an element to be received into the calculation to establish present value. Properly is more valuable on a rising than on a stationary market.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">The principle, however, has not expansive tendencies. It is. not what use the railroad may possibly make \u2014 likely as not, make \u2014 of the land in the future, nor even what need it may probably have for it at some uncertain and far off day. It is the' near, immediate future that may influence; the uncertain, indefinite, doubtful future can not. The doctrine is to be carefully applied. The subject itself does not admit of exact limits. Supposed future value is by no means to be taken as present. value. It is an element only, among other considerations, which' may afford light upon the question. <em>Moulton </em>v. <em>Newburyport Water Co. </em>137 Mass. 163, 167. The general- idea is safely expressed in <em>Boom Co. </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>98 U. S. 403, where it is-said: \" The compensation to the owner is to be estimated by reference to the uses for which the property is suitable, having regard to the existing business or wants of the community, or such as may be reasonably expected in the near future. \u201d And. the authorities are generally to the same effect, the one most, fitting the question of the present case being <em>Railroad </em>v. <em>McComb, </em>60 Maine, 290.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">We think all other matters were delivered by the commissioner \u25a0 to the jury correctly and clearly. One point taken by the company, however, deserves especial consideration. The jury were instructed not to allow to the company, in the assessment of damages, any of the expense which will be incurred by them, in building and maintaining so much of the new ways as are-within the limits of their own location. The statute (R. S., c. 51, \u00a7 38,) lays that burden on the railroad corporation. The railroad is obliged to build and maintain these crossings at its own expense. But the company contends that, inasmuch as the statute was passed after their charter was granted, it would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>\u00a1unconstitutional to apply its provisions to highways not in 'existence when their road was built.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">By an amendment of the company\u2019s charter, accepted by them, iit was provided that \" the company shall be subject to the general \u00a1laws existing in the state, or which may be hereafter passed by \u00a1the state. \u201d Pr. Laws, 1853, ch. 180. (Webb\u2019s Bailroad Laws, Maine, 497.) See Con. Maine, Art. 4, part 3, \u00a7 14. One of \u25a0those laws is that a railroad charter, such as this, may be \u00a1amended or altered by the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">The question, therefore, is whether, in view of the power thus .reserved to the legislature, the statute relating to railroad crossings, as affecting this railroad in this instance, is or not constitutional. It is impossible to lay down any exact rule as to the \u00a1lawful extent of the exercise of this reserved legislative power, .and each case depends largely on its peculiar facts. But it is \u00a1universally admitted that the power of alteration and amendment \u00a1is not without limit. The alterations must be just and reasonable. '\u25a0The vested rights of property of corporations must be respected. \u2018The power should be confined to reasonable amendments regulating the mode of using and enjoying the franchise granted, which do not defeat or essentially impair the object of the grant. Lierce \u00a1R. \u00a1R. 459, and cases; Cool. Con. Lim. * 710, and cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Under any of the current definitions of this power of amendment, we think the statutory provision under discussion should mot be regarded as an unreasonable exercise of such power. Bailroad corporations, especially under \u25a0 present laws, receive \u25a0many compensations for all the burdens imposed on them. The \u2022company pays nothing for its franchise; pays no tax upon it; \u25a0may take a grant under general laws without recourse to the legislature ; its road crosses public ways and runs in places along \u25a0such ways, without compensation to the town which paid for its easement to the original owner; may cross canals and navigable streams under some conditions (and this imposes burdens on other public interests) ; highways may be raised or lowered for its accommodation (thus affecting the grade of highways and often the convenience and safety of travelers) ; railroads to a reasonable extent may occupy highways with their trains; and other privileges and accommodations are accorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>By building and maintaining the town crossing within its own located limits, the railroad company has a control of it \u2014 as it should have \u2014 and can shape it as best for its own needs, and that is some compensation. Instead of the legislature allowing, as it no doubt might, the right of passing over a railroad in all places whore a passage could be effected without injury to the road, it coniines the right to a few places \u2014 to the public roads. The law' even forbids a person walking or standing on a track.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">Another reason why the statutory requirement can not be deemed unjust, is, that it could not have been in the mind of the legislature or of the company, when the charter was granted, that so much of the public power was to be surrendered as the argument for the company assumes. Had the present statute been then in existence, it would not have been complained of as unreasonable. Railroad law was at that date in its infancy. Neither party knew what provisions for the preservation of all public rights and interests were needed. They were not inserted in the charter, nor were they then to be found in the statutes of the state. The charter was general, and the location of the line most indefinitely stated. While details were largely omitted, there must have been an unwritten, unexpressed understanding \u2014 an implication \u2014 that the charter should be subject to all reasonable legislative control. Since then the law has become better defined. The powmrs and privileges of railroads have been both curtailed and increased. Upon the whole, the legislative treatment of them has been reasonable and just. While the reserved power in this instance may not be deemed strictly a part of the police power of the state, it is something at least akin to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">The tendency of the authorities sustain these views, and in some of the cases precisely the same question as arises here has been discussed and decided adversely to the railroad. Cool. Con. Lim. * 577, and discussion in note ; Pierce R. R. 457, and cases, in <em>note; Chapman v. Railroad, </em>37 Maine, <em>92; Norris </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>39 Maine, 273 ; <em>Bangor O. and M. R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>47 Maine, 34; <em>Railroad Commissioners </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>63 Maine, 269; <em>Albany Northern R. Co. </em>v. <em>Brownell, </em>24 N.

A contrary decision, however, was made in <em>Detroit </em>v. <em>Plank Road Co. </em>43 Mich. 140. If this result is possibly in some degree inconsistent with the case of <em>State </em>v. <em>Noyes, </em>47 Maine, 189, decided in 1859, it is because that was a strict decision, and the law has made some advancement since that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">It is not questioned by the town that some damages are recoverable by the railroad; and such must be the law. But damages are not assessable for the interruption and inconvenience occasioned to the business of the railroad by the opening of the new highways, nor for increased expenses nor increased risks in running their trains occasioned thereby. Those are matters clearly of police- regulation, damages for which would be too vague and uncertain for calculation. The claim is illogical if \u25a0not unjust. <em>Mass. Cent. R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>121 Mass. 124.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">It was ruled that witnesses could testify to their opinions of \u2022the amount of damages that are sustained by the easements taken. It is presumed that the witnesses were, from their experience and observation, competent to express their judgments upon \u2022the question, and that they understood the elements upon which the question was based. We think the testimony comes within .the limits which renders opinion-evidence admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b70-7\">YirgiN, Libbet, Foster and Haskell, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b70-8\">'Walton, J., did not sit.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
