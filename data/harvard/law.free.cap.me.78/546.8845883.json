The indictment does not allege that any offence was committed by these defendants in Franklin county or state of Maine.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-6\">\" 2nd. No offence is alleged against these defendants in the indictment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-7\">\"3rd. No valid judgment can be rendered on the verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-8\">\" 4th.

No part of the forfeiture under said chapter goes to the state, or county, although the county is subjected to the expense of this prosecution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-10\">\" 6th. The indictment does not show who is entitled to the forfeiture, if the defendants are convicted.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-11\">The motion was overruled and the defendants alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b547-12\"><em>Joseph O.
