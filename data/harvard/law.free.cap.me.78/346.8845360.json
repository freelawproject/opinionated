It has been applauded by all our citizens, with reason, too, for its efforts in aid and encouragement of the slumbering industries of the state; in every instance it has offered and afforded accommodation and conveniences for those engaged in b.uilding up and carrying on business enterprises contiguous to its road. In this case, it built a little station close by these Knickerbocker Ice Houses and Haynes <em>&amp; </em>DeWitt Ice Company\u2019s houses, for the convenience of these two ice companies in carrying their agents and employees back and forth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-5\">This road leading across the railroad is for the convenience of Knickerbocker Ice Company, and no one else. It is the only route for teams from the public ways to its premises. If the Eailroad Company can stop their crossing, then it can stop the business, for there is no public convenience and necessity for the way. But we say again that the defendant is not aggrieved at this ruling. The evidence all the way along shows a license to the Knickerbocker Ice Company and their employees to use <em>a </em>crossing, and this is the only one they could use. They could not use either of the other two in the vicinity without trespassing on other land owners. The building of the station shows in the most emphatic manner the expression of a wish on the part of the railroad company to promote the ice business there, and it must be held to have knowledge of the fact that the business could not be carried on without employing large numbers of teams which could only reach the premises by this crossing. Many of the employees went back and forth on the trains every day, and sometimes whole carloads of men were brought. There is no difficulty in finding the license nor the manner in which the railroad company was compensated for it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-6\">The questions of negligence of the defendant and contributory negligence of the plaintiff were for the jury. <em>Webb </em>v. <em>P. &amp; K. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number><em>R.

Considering the nature of the use to which the company must put the land, the damages for taking it would be diminished by the easements to which it should be subjected; and there is a vast difference between an easement for a farm crossing and an easement for a way upon which, as was claimed at the trial, there is more travel than upon the majority of the highways in the town. The imposition of a greater easement is the basis of the company\u2019s right to damages for laying out a way over it. That the easement of a railroad in its road-bed is property, for the taking of which, or the encumbering of which by laying out a way over it, the company is entitled to damages, under the Constitution, is now well settled. <em>Old Colony, &amp;c., Railroad Go. </em>v. <em>Oounty of Plymouth, </em>14 Cray, 155.

The rule is now firmly established in this State, as well as by courts generally, that it is negligence <em>per se </em>for a person to cross a railroad track without first looking and listening for a coming train. If his view is unobstructed, he may have no occasion to listen. But if his view is obstructed, then it is his duty to listen, and to listen carefully. And if one is injured at a railroad crossing by a passing train or locomotive, which might have been seen if he had looked, or heard if he had listened, presumptively he is guilty of contributory negligence; and if tins presumption is not repelled, a recovery for the injury can not be had. These rules have been so recently and so fully considered by this court, that we refrain from discussing them further. It is sufficient to say that they are now the settled law of this State. <em>Lesan </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>77 Maine, 85; <em>State </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>77 Maine, 538; <em>State </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>76 Maine, 357.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">The evidence in this ease shows that the crossing where the deceased was injured ivas in one particular peculiarly dangerous. It was at the northerly end of a cut, and between the cut and the road leading westerly from the crossing, were high land and other obstacles, which would prevent one approaching from the west from seeing a train coming from the south for a considerable distance before reaching the crossing. This would make it the traveler\u2019s duty to listen, and to listen carefully and attentively. To do this, if riding in a sleigh, and especially if riding in a sleigh with bells attached, it would be necessary to stop his horse. For surely he could not listen carefully and effectually' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>without stopping his horse, and thus stilling the noise of his own team. And yet the deceased did not observe this caution. The evidence shows that he approached the crossing where he was injured, in a sleigh, with bells attached, his horse trotting. He did not stop his horse \u2014 he did not even reduce the speed of his horse to a walk. The result was such as might reasonably have been apprehended. Just as his horse\u2019s head reached the crossing-, a train of cars which had been concealed from his view shot out of the cut and on to the crossing directly in front of him. When the train had passed, he was found lying within a few feet of the track, and, if not wholly unconscious, so badly injured that he was unable to speak, and he died within half an hour. Just how he was struck does not appear. The tracks of his horse and of his sleigh indicate that when the train shot on to the crossing in front of him, his horse turned quickly to the left, and that the momentum of the sleigh caused it to tip toward the track, and that the deceased was thrown out and fell so near \"to the track that some part of the passing train struck him and inflicted the injuries of which he died. Neither the horse nor the sleigh was struck,\u2014 at least no injuries were found upon either. But the driver was found, after the train had passed, fatally injured, as already stated. We can not doubt that if the deceased had stopped his horse at a proper distance from the crossing, so as to still the noise of his own team, and had then listened, he would have become aware of the near approach of the train, and the accident would have been avoided. He did not do so. We think the omission was negligence \u2014 contributory negligence,\u2014 and that an action for the injury can not be maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">Having come to a conclusion favorable to the railroad upon the motion to set aside the verdict, it is unnecessary to consider the questions raised by the exceptions. But perhaps we ought to add that the counsel for the railroad contend strenuously that the road has been guilty of no wrong; that the crossing where this accident happened was a mere farm crossing; that the deceased in attempting to use it was a trespasser; and that the railroad was under no obligation to signal the approach of its trains to this crossing by either bell or whistle, and especially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>that it owed no such duty to the deceased. But upon this branch of the case we express no opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\"><em>The motion is sustained, and the verdict set </em>aside.</p>\n<judges id=\"b355-5\">Peters, C.
