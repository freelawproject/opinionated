It is a single offence \u2014 that of nuisance \u2014 no matter in what form the defendant\u2019s participation consists. The count describes the moans by Which his guilt may be proved.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b71-4\">A scheme is none the less a lottery, because it promises a prize to each ticket holder, the prizes to be drawn being of different values; nor because prizes are called presents in the prospectus; nor because the tickets consist of receipts for subscriptions to a newspaper, but numbered to compare with the numbers upon the articles to be distributed.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b71-5\">A count, which charges a defendant with inserting a lottery advertisement in a newspaper published in New York, and circulated in this state, without an averment that the defendant had something to do with its circulation in this state, is bad upon demurrer.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b71-6\">It is averred against the defendant, that, at a place and on a day named, he was concerned in a lottery by selling a ticket to one Henry May; the count describing the lottery and ticket. It would have been more finished pleading to allege that he was so concerned by \u201c then and there\u201d selling the tickets. But the law, not standing upon such nicety, regards the omitted words as immaterial.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b71-7\">The lottery ticket may be set out in an indictment by copy, and, if it does not appear upon its face to be a ticket, it may be alleged and proved to be such.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-8\">ON EXCEPTIONS from the superior court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-9\">The exceptions were to the <em>proforma </em>ruling of the court in overruling defendant\u2019s demurrer to the indictment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-10\">The facts are sufficiently stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b71-11\"><em>W.

Heath, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AH\">contended that the indictment should have disclosed the' name of the prosecutor. The opinion in the case of <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>64 Maine, 425, does not seem to be supported by the cases there cited. The case at bar however is different from that and the cases there cited. <em>Com. </em>v. <em>Messenger, </em>4 Mass. 462, cited approvingly in <em>State </em>v. <em>Grand Trunlc Railway, </em>60 Maine, 145, would seem to bo precisely in point. The court say: \" If the statute had authorized a proceeding by information in any court of record for the recovery of the penalty and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>information had been drawn like the complaint, it is very clear that such information would have been bad, because there is no allegation of the sum of money forfeited, nor of the share which the informer claims, \u201d etc. The reasons given for the decision of <em>/State </em>v. <em>Grand Trunlc R\u2019y, supra, </em>are applicable to the case at bar.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b72-4\">By the statute each act in the operation of a lottery is made a distinct and independent offence. To print an advertisement of a lottery is an offence, itself; to publish such an advertisement is another; while to circulate it is still another. By the very nature of these acts neither act includes the other as was said in <em>Gom. </em>v. <em>Olapp, </em>5 Pick. 41, where it was said that offering for sale and selling tickets was but one offence because selling included the offering for sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b72-5\">Counsel further contended that the advertisement set out in the indictment was not the advertisement of a lottery. It is well settled that a lottery is a scheme for the distribution of prizes by chance. The element of chance is essential. <em>People </em>v. <em>Koelke, </em>94 N. Y. 137 ; <em>U. 8. </em>v. <em>Olney, </em>1 Abb. (U. S.) 275 ; <em>Kohn </em>v. <em>Koehler, </em>96 N. Y. 367; <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>People, </em>40 Ill. 465.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b72-6\">To be illegal it should appear affirmatively iii the advertisement that the distribution of prizes is to be by lot or chance.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b72-7\">Peters, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AVy\">The defendant demurs to an indictment which alleges against him participation in a lottery nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">It is objected that it is not stated, either in or upon the indictment, who. the prosecutor is. The law apportions the penalty between the prosecutor and the town where the offence is committed. If the law was ever critical enough to destroy an indictment because it did not disclose the name of the prosecutor or informer, when such an averment requires no proof and has nothing to do with the guilt or innocence of the person prosecuted, it was intended, by the decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>64 Maine, 423, to dispense with such useless technicality.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">It is contended that each count is ill for duplicity, because the allegation is that the defendant was engaged in\" a lottery, scheme or device of chance. \u201d There is no contradiction in the terms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>They are descriptive of only one tiling, \u2014 the pleader trying to describe the offence by as apt a word as possible. The word lottery has no technical meaning. A lottery is nothing more or less than a scheme or device of chance. <em>People </em>v. <em>Noelke, </em>94 N. Y. 137.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">The indictment avers that the defendant was concerned in a lottery by printing, publishing and circulating an advertisment of it; and also in other ways. It is argued that this is ill for duplicity. The argument is based upon a misconception of the design and scope of the law against lotteries. The statute (E. S., c. 128, \u00a7 13,) does not establish numerous independent offences, \u2014 it establishes but one offence. It declares \" every lottery, scheme or device of chance\u201d to be a nuisance. The offence to be alleged and proved is nuisance. The statute particularizes some of the modes in which the offence may be committed, and also declares generally that whoever aids in a lottery or is connected therewith shall be punished. It is but one offence and the same punishment, no matter in what form the guilty participation consists. There are not as many distinct offences as there may be forms of the offence. The indictment describes the means by which the defendant\u2019s guilt may be proved. The same rule applies as in indictments for liquor nuisances. <em>State </em>v. Lang, 63 Maine, 215; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>13 Allen at p. 539.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">The indictment gives the nature of the scheme by setting out the advertisement by copy; by allowing it to speak for itself. This mode of pleading is not unusual. But it is denied by counsel that the paper indicates a game of chance. It is contended that the word chance in the paper means opportunity. We do not concur in this interpretation. It is conceded that the careless reader might see in the advertisement a game of chance. But that would be so, only because the meaning is there to bo seen. In such case the reader gets the author\u2019s real meaning, which must be the same for all persons. However disguised by indirect or deceptive expression, the paper, as a whole, discloses a lottery. If it were not so, readers would not become buyers. It informs its patrons that every subscriber is sure to get a present, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>presents \u00e1re of various values. Assurance is given that the presents will be \" -awarded fairly. \u201d How can presents of unequal Value be fairly awarded unless by some lot or chance ? A purchaser or subscriber receives for his money \"a numbered receipt.\u201d What can be the purpose of numbers if all numbers are favored alike?- Each number will take \" a prize, \u201d and has \"a chance to win\u201d a very valuable one. Of course all cannot win the highest prize or present; It is not an opportunity to win, so much as it is an opportunity for a chance to win. It is not an easy thing for a notice to have the effect of advertising vice to one and virtueto another.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">The first Count in the indictment may not be good. It alleges the defendant\u2019s complicity in the nuisance to consist of a notice inserted in a newspaper published in New York. It charges that the newspaper was Circulated in Augusta, but it is not said when or by whom, or'whether the defendant had any knowledge of that fact or not. See S<em>tate </em>v. <em>Paul, </em>69 Maine, 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">The remaining counts are sufficient. The most of an objection is, that the words \"then and there\u201d are not employed in them. The use of the phrase would have made the declaration more finished. The second count charges that the defendant at Augusta, on a-day named, was unlawfully concerned in a lottery (described) \" by selling to one Harry May one ticket, \u201d and so on. It is contended that, to be correct, it should read, \" by then and there selling \u201d the ticket described. In a capital case the omission would probably b\u00f3 considered fatal. '' But the rule requiring time ' and place to be repeated to the traversable averments is not so much regarded in indictments for inferior offences as in bases where the life of the prisoner is in danger. PBisk. Stat; Pro; \u00a7 413, and cases. The sense here is by no means uncertain. There would be more ground for the objection if a series' of distinct overt acts were alleged, all essential to the commission of the offence. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doherty, 10 </em>Cush. 52. The words then and there- need not be repeated to an averment which merely declares a legal conclusion. The averment of being concerned in a lottery was of that nature, although preceding other allegation, the potent fact being the sale of a ticket. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>6 Gray, 477; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Langley, 14 Gray, 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">In the last counts the ticket is set out in its own words. It may not on its face appear to be a ticket. Still, it may be proved to be such. It is averred that it is a ticket. The advertisement proves it. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ochsner, </em>9 Mo. App. 216.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">\n<em>Demurrer sustained as to first count only.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b75-6\">WaltoN, Danforth, Libbey, Emery and Foster, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
