While thus employed a large quantity of earth fell upon him producing injuries which caused his death in a few minutes.

We think it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">It is settled law in this state that an employer is not responsible to an employee for an injury received through the carelessness of a fellow laborer; and it is equally well settled that the foreman, superintendent, or overseer of a job of work, is not on that account to be regarded as other than a fellow laborer with those who are at work under him. Such an employment does not elevate him to the dignity of a vice-principal. And these questions have been so fully and so recently discussed by this court that a further discussion of them can not be profitable. See <em>Doughty </em>v. <em>Log Driving Co. </em>76 Maine, 143, and <em>Cassidy v. Railroad, </em>76 Maine, 488, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">\n<em>Plaintiff nonsuit.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b221-7\">Peters, C.
