Crockett of Rockland, in said county of Knox, on the \u25a0tenth day of April, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight .hundred and eighty-five, in behalf of said state, on oath complains that Silas W. McLoon of Rockland, in the county of Knox, \u25a0laborer, on the ninth day of April aforesaid, at Rockland \u25a0aforesaid, in the county aforesaid, did voluntarily drink intoxi\u25a0cating liquors to excess, and was then and there guilty of drunkenness by said voluntary use of said intoxicating liquors, and was then and there found and seen drunk and intoxicated and disturbing the peace of the public, against the peace of said \u25a0state, and contrary to the form of the statute in such case made and provided.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-16\">\"Wherefore, the said complainant prays that the said respondent may be apprehended and held to answer to this complaint, and dealt with relative to the same, as law and justice may require.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>\"Dated at Rockland aforesaid, this tenth day of April, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and eighty-live.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-4\">(Signed.)

Crockett.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b421-5\"><em>True P. </em>Pierce, county attorney, for the state.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b421-6\"><em>Robinson and Rowell, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b421-7\">VirgtN, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A8j\">The complaint is based on R. S., c. 27, \u00a7 48, as amended by St. 1885, c. 366, \u00a7 6, which creates two classes of offences: (1.) \"Being found intoxicated in any street or highway and (2.) \"Being intoxicated in one\u2019s own house, or in any other building or place, becoming quarrelsome, or in any other way disturbing the public peace, or that of his own or any other family.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">The complaint sets out neither of these offences. The \" place \u201d in which the defendant was alleged to have been found intoxicated is not specified. It is not sufficient to allege simply that he was found intoxicated in Rockland, without specifying whether in the street, highway, building, or other particular locality.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">The clause \"and if found guilty of being intoxicated as aforesaid,\u201d was substituted by the legislature in the revision of 1883, for the phrase (found in the original statute of 1858, c. 33, \u00a7 26, and retained in all of the amendatory statutes of 1874, c. 255, 1880, chaps. 228 and 247) \"and if found guilty of being intoxicated in the streets or highways, or of being intoxicated in his own house, or any other building or place, and becoming quarrelsome and disturbing the public peace.\u201d So that merely being found intoxicated otherwise than in the public or private places enumerated is not an offence in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">\n<em>Demurrer sustained.
