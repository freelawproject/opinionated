In the former case it was determined that the bond in suit was a good common law bond and that the action could be maintained in the name of Judge Waterman.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-6\">It is true the writ does not allege any authority in the plaintiff to prosecute this suit derived from the order authorizing Mitchell to sue.

Dockray to this plaintiff, described as \"judge of probate of wills,\u201d and payable to him or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>his successor. Instead of craving oyer of the conditions of the bond and pleading thereto, the defendants have demurred to the writ and declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">The action is in the name of the obligee, the writ alleging, however, that the \"suit is prosecuted by Lewis Pierce, administrator <em>de bonis non </em>with the will annexed, of the estate of James E. Dockray.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">While an administrator <em>de bonis non administratis </em>is understood in general terms to be the successor of the executor, still he derives his title directly from the testator and not from the executor. <em>Am. Board\u2019s Appeal, </em>27 Conn. 344. On his appointment there vests in him, as is indicated by his commission and official designation, title only to the unadministered property of the testator, in trust for those to whom it belongs. Therefore, in the absence of any statutory provision to the contrary, he has no recourse against his official predecessor for devastavit or maladministration, the remedy therefor being reserved to the creditors, legatees and distributees directly; the executor being responsible, in general terms, to his successor only for the goods, effects and credits which were of the testator at the time of his decease, and remain unadministered, that is, in specie, unaltered or unconverted by any act of the executor or the proceeds thereof not mixed with the latter\u2019s own money. <em>Potts </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>3 Rawle, 361; S. C. 24 Am. Dec. 359; Sch. Exrs. &amp; Admrs. \u00a7 \u00a7 408 <em>et seq.; </em>Wms. Exrs. 915 <em>el </em>seq.; <em>Beall </em>v. <em>New Mexico, </em>16 Wall. 535, 540; <em>U. S. </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>109 U. S. 265. Though in several of the states statutory provisions allow an administrator <em>de bonis non </em>to call for a full accounting by his predecessor and resort to an action on his bond. Cases <em>supra </em>and notes, and an elaborate note in 24 Am. Dec. 379-390.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">There are no such liberal statutory provisions in this state. E. S. c. 64, \u00a7 \u00a7 20-24; c. 87, \u00a7 \u00a7 4, 5, 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Being confined to the record, we have no means of knowing for what purpose the administrator <em>de bonis non </em>is seeking to maintain this action. He is officially interested in the defendant\u2019s bond to the amount of the unadministered estate which she holds, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>if any, for such property vested in him in trust for those' to whom it belongs, legatees or creditors. Being \" interested in his official capacity,\u201d he had a right to originate a suit on such bond without applying to the judge of probate, provided \" his interest has been specifically ascertained\u201d as provided in R. S., c. 7-2, \u00a7 10, and this should be alleged if such preliminary action has been taken; and if not, the action can not be maintained under that section. Nor could he maintain the action under B.. S., c. 72, \u00a7 15, for no authority by the judge of probate is alleged, which that section makes essential. Nor can the administrator <em>de bonis non </em>prosecute the action for Am mi Mitchell, although the latter might. Assuming, therefore, that the defendant\u2019s bond is a statute probate bond, the demurrer must be sustained, and the plaintiff may amend his writ and declaration upon payment of costs from the time when the demurrer was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">\n<em>Demurrer sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b142-5\">Petees, C.
