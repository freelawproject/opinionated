In <em>Hapgood </em>v. <em>Doherty, </em>8 Gray, 373, the court held that the one hundred dollar <em>ad damnum </em>was the debt or damage demanded, but it was a case where the account annnexed was one hundred and twenty-three dollar\u2019s.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b540-10\">In the cases in the Mass. Reports, where the court has held that the debt or damage demanded means the <em>ad damnum, </em>the decisions are based upon a different statute from ours.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b540-11\">Libbey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7c\">By R. S., c. 83, \u00a7 3, trial jnstices \"have original and exclusive jurisdiction of all civil actions, . . . when</p>\n<p id=\"b540-12\">the debt or damages demanded do not exceed twenty dollars,\u201d except certain cases therein specified.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-13\">In this case the note declared on is for twelve dollars and interest. The <em>ad damnum </em>is for more than twenty dollars. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>is claimed by the defendant that the \" debt or damages demanded\u201d is to be determined by computing the amount due on the note when the action was commenced, and not by the <em>ad damnum. </em>We think this is not the law. It appears to be well settled that in all actions sounding in damages as assumpsit and tort, the jurisdiction depends upon the <em>ad damnum, </em>which is the amount of damages demanded. <em>Estes </em>v. <em>White, </em>61 Maine, 22; <em>Hapgood </em>v. <em>Doherty, </em>8 Gray, 373; <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Pearson, </em>14 Gray, 521.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">In such case, it can not be judicially determined that the debt or damages which the plaintiff is entitled to recover, are less than the <em>ad damnum, </em>until judgment is rendered; and then, if it is for a sum less than twenty dollars, it does not affect the jurisdiction. <em>Ladd </em>v. <em>Kimball, 12 </em>Gray, 139.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b541-6\">Peters, C.
