The remaining portions of Bauer\u2019s indictment were then tried to a jury, which found Bauer guilty of forcing hostages to accompany him during the bank robbery, a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(e) (1988), and using a firearm during the commission of a crime of violence, a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (1988). In a separate case which was consolidated for Bauer\u2019s trial, Bauer was also convicted of being in possession of an unregistered firearm (a silencer), a violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5861(d), 5871 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-22\">These two cases have been consolidated for appeal. Bauer presses three issues on appeal: (1) his guilty plea to armed bank robbery, combined with his conviction for use of a firearm during a crime of violence, constitutes double jeopardy because the combination punishes Bauer twice for essentially the same offense; (2) his conviction for possession of an unregistered silencer is invalid because no reasonable person could have known that a silencer is a \u201cfirearm\u201d which must be registered; and (3) there was insufficient evidence to convict on the forced accompaniment charge because the government did not prove that Bauer ever left the bank\u2019s premises with his hostages. Bauer\u2019s first two issues are foreclosed by clear Eleventh Circuit precedent; Bauer\u2019s last issue is foreclosed by our review of the record and the relevant statute. Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>(1) Double Jeopardy</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">Bauer\u2019s claim that the Double Jeopardy Clause forbids cumulative punishment for armed bank robbery (Section 2113(d)) and for using a firearm during a crime of violence (Section 924(c)) is without merit. In <em>United States v. Ricks, </em>817 F.2d 692 (11th Cir.1987), we rejected this exact argument, <em>see id. </em>at 694-95, 698-99, because \u201cCongress specifically authorized the cumulative punishment in section 924(c).\u201d <em>Ricks, </em>817 F.2d at 699. Although principles of double jeopardy forbid courts from imposing greater punishment than intended by Congress, <em>see id. </em>at 698, those principles do not bar courts from imposing the exact punishment intended by Congress (even when contained in two different statutes). Even if such double punishment is not \u201cfair, just or proper,\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 9, Bauer\u2019s remedy lies within his legislature, not within the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">(2) The Unregistered Silencer</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Bauer\u2019s claim that his conviction for possession of an unregistered firearm must be reversed is also without merit. Essentially, Bauer asserts that this conviction is invalid because he could not have known that his silencer was a \u201cfirearm\u201d which needed to be registered. Bauer\u2019s argument is foreclosed by direct Eleventh Circuit precedent. <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>719 F.2d 1516, 1522 (11th Cir.1983) (\u201c[T]he government does <em>not </em>have to prove that the defendant knew that the weapon in his possession was a \u2018firearm\u2019 within the meaning of the statute, or that he knew registration was required.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>465 U.S. 1037, 104 S.Ct. 1312, 79 L.Ed.2d 710 (1984); <em>United States v. Montes-Cardenas, </em>746 F.2d 771, 779 (11th Cir.1984) (\u201cPossession [of unregistered silencers] is sufficient, and the government need not prove that the defendant knew that registration was required.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-11\">(3)The Evidence Relating To Forcible Accompaniment</p>\n<p id=\"b327-12\">Bauer\u2019s claim that there was insufficient evidence to convict on the forcible accompaniment charge is belied by the record. The evidence shows that (1) after noticing that the police had arrived, Bauer stated \u201cI am not going alone\u201d and \u201cI guess I am going to have to take hostages\u201d; (2) from the group of people he had herded to the back of the bank, Bauer singled out two women bank employees as his hostages, stating \u201cyou come with me and you come with me\u201d; (3) without the consent of these frightened women, Bauer forced the women at gunpoint to accompany him from the back of the bank to the front door; (4) Bauer forced the women to accompany him with the intention of leaving the bank with them so he could avoid apprehension; and (5) only when Bauer realized that the police presence outside was overwhelming did he end the women\u2019s ordeal, ordering one of the hostages to exit the bank with his gun so she could tell the police he was surrendering. As a matter of law, this evidence was sufficient to sustain Bauer\u2019s conviction for forcible accompaniment.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-13\">We acknowledge that Bauer never left the bank\u2019s property with his hostages. Nevertheless, that fact alone does not defeat the conviction. The statute requires that the defendant \u201cforce[] any person to accompany him without the consent of such person\u201d while committing an armed bank robbery. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(e) (1988). There is no requirement that the government prove that the defendant crossed a property line. Nor does the statute require that the hostages traverse a particular number of feet, that the hostages be held against their will for a particular time period, or that the hostages be placed in a certain quantum of danger. Such factors may bear upon the defendant\u2019s sentence for forcible accompaniment,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> but they do not affect the underlying conviction. We hold that in order to sustain a conviction under Section 2113(e), the government need <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>not prove that the defendant took his hostages off the bank\u2019s premises. In this case, the government\u2019s proof was more than sufficient to convict under Section 2113(e).</p>\n<p id=\"A00W\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b327-7\"> It is possible to infer that Bauer\u2019s sentence may have been influenced by the fact that Bauer surrendered before leaving the bank with the hostages. Bauer received the statutory minimum (ten years). Subject to constitutional limitations, the statutory maximum is death. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(e) (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
