The recoupment took the form of an offset of the overpayments against subsidy payments due to Doko for subsequent years. The United States Claims Court held that Doko was entitled to recover the withheld payments, on the ground that a 1981 district court decision that the statute of limitations barred the government\u2019s suit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1138\">*1138</page-number>to collect the overpayments, was <em>res judicata </em>with respect to the government\u2019s claim to recover the overpayments. <em>Doko Farms v. United States, </em>21 Cl.Ct. 696 (1990). We reverse, and remand the case to the Claims Court to decide the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">Under the Upland Cotton Price Support Program, 7 U.S.C. 1444(e) (1988), the government made subsidy payments to reflect farmers\u2019 limitations on the amount of cotton they planted and grew on their land. Following an investigation of payments made in a Texas county in 1972 and 1973 that appeared to be abnormally high and administrative proceedings (including hearings), the Department of Agriculture held that a number of farmers in that county, including Doko, had committed various violations of the governing regulations that constituted a \u201cscheme or device\u201d to defeat the purpose of the upland cotton program or had avoided limitations upon the amount of payments. <em>See United States v. O\u2019Neil, </em>709 F.2d 361, 364-65 (5th Cir.1983). In each of those proceedings the government ordered the recipients of the excess payments to refund them. <em>Id. </em>at 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">The farmers refused to do so. The United States then filed in 1978 and 1979 eleven suits in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas seeking to recover the overpayments. Each defendant filed a counterclaim seeking (1) the removal of the farmers\u2019 names from the Federal Debt Register, a listing of persons indebted to the government, the effect of which listing was that the government would withhold from amounts subsequently owing to the debtors the amount of the indebtedness, (2) release of the withheld money and (3) the return of cotton allotments that the government had cancelled as a result of its determination that the defendants had violated the upland cotton program.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-7\">On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court, on April 3, 1981, granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants in each of the cases. The court held that the six-year statute of limitations in 15 U.S.C. 714b(c) (1988), barred the suit or, alternatively, that one of the regulations upon which the government based its refund claim was unconstitutionally vague. The separate judgment entered in the <em>Doko </em>case stated that the United States \u201ctake nothing of and from\u201d Doko, dismissed the complaint against Doko with prejudice, and \u201csevered\u201d Doko\u2019s counterclaim from \u201cthe cause of action alleged by plaintiff\u201d and set it for trial \u201cseparately and at a later date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b967-9\">The government failed to file a timely appeal from the judgment in the <em>Doko </em>case and three others, in the belief that the pendency of the severed counterclaim made the judgments non-final. When the government failed to appeal the <em>Doko </em>judgment within sixty days, the district court granted summary judgment for Doko on its counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-10\">The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that the government\u2019s appeals were untimely, and \u201caffirm[ed] the district court in the government\u2019s suits against appellees.\u201d <em>O\u2019Neil, </em>709 F.2d at 375. <em>(O\u2019Neil </em>decided <em>Doko </em>and the three other cases.) The court reversed the summary judgments on the counterclaims, however, and remanded the counterclaims to the district court to determine whether that court had jurisdiction over them. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b967-11\">(Shortly before its decision in <em>O\u2019Neil, </em>the court of appeals had decided <em>United States v. Batson, </em>706 F.2d 657 (5th Cir.1983), involving the other seven cases in which the United States had filed timely appeals. In <em>Batson, </em>the court of appeals held (1) that the statute of limitations had not run on the government\u2019s suits based on the 1973 subsidy payments, but had run on the 1972 payments and (2) that the regulation was not unconstitutionally vague. <em>Id. </em>at 674, 677, 683.)</p>\n<p id=\"b967-12\">On remand, the district court held that it had jurisdiction over the counterclaims under the mandamus statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361 (1988) and again held for Doko (and the three other defendants). The Fifth Circuit dismissed, holding that mandamus was improper and that the Claims Court had exclusive jurisdiction over the counterclaims, and granting Doko leave to refile in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1139\">*1139</page-number>that court. <em>United States v. O\u2019Neil, </em>767 F.2d 1111, 1113 (5th Cir.1985). Doko then filed its complaint in the Claims Court, seeking the identical relief it had sought in its counterclaim in the district court, and the government filed a counterclaim, seeking the identical relief it had sought in its complaint in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">Litigation followed over whether the Claims Court or the district court had jurisdiction over the case. The Claims Court transferred the case back to the district court, which again held for Doko. On the government\u2019s appeal, this court held that under <em>Christianson v. Colt Indus. Operating Corp., </em>486 U.S. 800, 108 S.Ct. 2166, 100 L.Ed.2d 811 (1988), the earlier decision of the Fifth Circuit that the Claims Court had exclusive jurisdiction was the law of the case, vacated the judgment of the district court and remanded the case to that court to transfer it to the Claims Court. <em>Doko Farms v. United States, </em>861 F.2d 255, 257 (Fed.Cir.1988). The parties then filed in the Claims Court a new complaint and a new counterclaim, seeking the same relief as in their previous filings.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-6\">The Claims Court granted Doko\u2019s motion for summary judgment, denied that of the government, and awarded Doko $1,011,-721.70, plus interest. <em>Doko Farms, </em>21 Cl.Ct. at 713.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-7\">The court held that the 1981 district court judgment that the statute of limitations barred the government\u2019s suit was <em>res judicata </em>of the issues raised in the government\u2019s counterclaim. The court ruled that that judgment met the three requirements for <em>res judicata (id. </em>at 709): (1) it was a final judgment on the merits because \u201c \u2018[a] ruling based on the statute of limitations is a decision on the merits for <em>res judicata </em>purposes,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 703 (quoting <em>Mathis v. Laird, </em>457 F.2d 926, 927 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 871, 93 S.Ct. 201, 34 L.Ed.2d 122 (1972)); (2) the government\u2019s counterclaim was for the same cause of action as that asserted in the government\u2019s original claim that the district court held barred by limitations <em>(id. </em>at 706-08); and (3) the parties in the present suit were the same as those in the district court case, even though they changed roles as plaintiff and defendant <em>(id. </em>at 708). The court ruled that since the district court decision extinguished Doko\u2019s debt to the government, the latter had no basis for continuing to withhold Doko\u2019s funds and that Doko, therefore, was entitled to the relief it sought. <em>Id. </em>at 712.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-9\">The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b968-10\">[T]he district court, with the validity of the debt at issue before it, found the actions to be barred by the statute of limitations and the regulation that Doko Farms allegedly violated to be unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The finality of this judgment was thereafter affirmed by the Fifth Circuit as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_K\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court in the government\u2019s suits against appellees [Doko Farms].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b968-11\"><em>United States v. O\u2019Neil, </em>709 F.2d at 375. Consequently, the Government no longer has a debt due and owing by Doko and can no longer justify maintaining Doko Farms\u2019 name on the debt register and withholding funds due the plaintiffs on this and other agriculture subsidies earned as an administrative offset.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b968-12\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b968-13\">\u201cIn an effort to simplify the issue and bring this matter to a close,\u201d the government challenges only the summary judgment against it, but not the dismissal of its counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-15\">A. The Claims Court held that the 1981 district court judgment that the statute of limitations barred the government\u2019s attempt to recoup the amount by which it administratively had determined that Doko\u2019s cotton subsidy payments were improper, was <em>res judicata </em>of the issues before the court because the effect of that judgment was to eliminate Doko\u2019s indebtedness to the government for those over-payments. According to Doko, the debt merged in the judgment and ceased to exist after the government failed timely to appeal from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1140\">*1140</page-number>The district court judgment, however, did not purport to and did not adjudicate the merits of the government\u2019s claim against Doko. The court did not find, as the Claims Court stated, \u201cthe alleged debt to be invalid,\u201d 21 Cl.Ct. at 711, or that Doko had not engaged in a scheme or device to defeat the uplands cotton subsidy program. The district court held only that the government could not maintain its suit to recover the overpayments because the statute of limitations barred the suit. That holding determined nothing with respect to the merits of the government\u2019s claim, but only that the district court could not entertain the government\u2019s suit to enforce the claim because the suit was untimely. \u201c[S]tatutes of limitation go to matters of remedy, not to destruction of fundamental rights.\u201d <em>Chase Sec. Corp. v. Donaldson, </em>325 U.S. 304, 314, 65 S.Ct. 1137, 1142, 89 L.Ed. 1628 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-4\">The fact that the ordering portion of the district court\u2019s judgment, which reflected the court\u2019s decision that the government\u2019s suit was time-barred, stated that the government would \u201ctake nothing of and from\u201d Doko did not convert that judgment into an adjudication that Doko\u2019s indebtedness to the government no longer existed. The reason the government would \u201ctake nothing\u201d from Doko in its suit was because the statute of limitations had run on the government\u2019s claim, not because the government\u2019s claim had been discharged or eliminated. The phrase, which apparently is one frequently used by Texas state courts in their judgments, <em>see, e.g., Permian Petroleum Co. v. Petroleos Mexicanos, </em>934 F.2d 635, 640 (5th Cir.1991); <em>Permian Oil Co. v. Smith, </em>129 Tex. 413, 73 S.W.2d 490 (1934), was but the result of the court\u2019s dismissal of the government\u2019s complaint as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">Courts have recognized and held that the fact that the statute of limitations bars a government suit to collect an amount due to it does not bar the government from invoking its administrative remedies to offset the indebtedness against other claims by the debtor. <em>E.g., Thomas v. Bennett, </em>856 F.2d 1165, 1169 (8th Cir.1988); <em>United States v. Missouri Pac. R.R. Co., </em>250 F.2d 805, 808 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>358 U.S. 821, 79 S.Ct. 33, 3 L.Ed.2d 62 (1958); <em>Union Pac. R.R. Co. v. United States, </em>137 Ct.Cl. 267, 147 F.Supp. 483, 484-85, <em>cert. denied, </em>353 U.S. 950, 77 S.Ct. 861, 1 L.Ed.2d 858 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-7\"><em>Union Pacific </em>was a suit by the railroad to recover overpayments it voluntarily had refunded to the United States. After the statute of limitations had run on the government\u2019s right to sue for the over-payments (the same statute here involved, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 714b(c)), the railroad sued to recover them. Our predecessor court, the Court of Claims, the decisions of which bind us, <em>South Corp. v. United States, </em>690 F.2d 1368, 1369, 215 USPQ 657, 658, 1 Fed.Cir. (T) 1, 2 (1982), held that the government could offset the amounts the railroad had refunded. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3r\">Congress did not, by [15 U.S.C. \u00a7 714b(c) ] mean more than it said, which was that no suit could be brought upon claims more than six years old. We think it did not intend to disturb the normal processes of administrative settlement____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b969-8\">147 F.Supp. at 485.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-9\">Indeed, in the second appeal in <em>O\u2019Neil, </em>which included the <em>Doko </em>case, the Fifth Circuit, in holding that the district court improperly had granted mandamus, pointed out that the farmers \u201chave not demonstrated a clear right to receive the disputed funds or a corresponding duty by the USDA to disburse these funds to them. The government may attempt to collect the alleged overpayments through administrative channels, even though its right to sue in the courts is now foreclosed.\u201d <em>O\u2019Neil, </em>767 F.2d at 1113.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-10\">In <em>Block v. North Dakota, </em>461 U.S. 273, 103 S.Ct. 1811, 75 L.Ed.2d 840 (1983), the Supreme Court dealt with a similar question. North Dakota, which claimed ownership of a riverbed in the State on the ground it had belonged to the State when North Dakota was admitted to the Union, filed suit in the district court against federal officials under the Quiet Title Act of 1972, to establish its ownership. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1141\">*1141</page-number>government contended that the Quiet Title Act\u2019s statute of limitations, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2409a(f) (1982) (current version at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2409a(g) (1988)), barred the suit. The court of appeals held that the limitation provision did not apply to the States.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">The Supreme Court held that the limitations period applied to the States. The Court also rejected North Dakota\u2019s contention that the limitations period was unconstitutional insofar as it barred suits for land the State owned when it was admitted to the Union. The Court stated that a statute \u201cdepriving a State of land vested in it by the Constitution\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARL\">would constitute a taking of the State\u2019s property without just compensation, in violation of the Fifth Amendment. Section 2409a(f), however, does not purport to strip any State, or anyone else for that matter, of any property rights. The statute limits the time in which a quiet title suit against the United States can be filed; but, unlike an adverse possession provision, \u00a7 2409a(f) does not purport to effectuate a transfer of title. If a claimant has title to a disputed tract of land, he retains title even if his suit to quiet his title is deemed time-barred under \u00a7 2409a(f). A dismissal pursuant to \u00a7 2409a(f) does not quiet title to the property in the United States. The title dispute remains unresolved. Nothing prevents the claimant from continuing to assert his title, in hope of inducing the United States to file its own quiet title suit, in which the matter would finally be put to rest on the merits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b970-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 291-92, 103 S.Ct. at 1821-22 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-6\">Similar reasoning supports the conclusion in the present case that the district court\u2019s determination that the statute of limitations barred the government\u2019s suit did not determine the merits of the government\u2019s claim that the subsidy payments to Doko were improper. Like the title dispute in <em>Block, </em>the validity of the payments \u201cremains unresolved\u201d despite the dismissal of the suit as time-barred, and that dismissal did not \u201cpurport to effectuate\u201d the discharge of Doko\u2019s debt to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-7\">In <em>Amoco Prod. Co. v. United States, </em>852 F.2d 1574 (10th Cir.1988), the court of appeals held that a district court decision that the same statute of limitations barred the plaintiff\u2019s quiet title action against the United States did not preclude litigation of the title question under the United States\u2019 counterclaim. The district court had decided the merits of the title question. Applying <em>Block, </em>the court of appeals held that \u201cthe district court[\u2019s] determin[ation] that plaintiffs\u2019 suit was time-barred by section 2409a(f) ... does not effect the substantive rights and claims of the parties to title in the property____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1578. The court also ruled: \u201cThe district court\u2019s conclusion that the time-bar finding extinguished the United States\u2019 counterclaim was also incorrect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1579.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-10\">Although both <em>Block </em>and <em>Amoco </em>involved the statute of limitations of the Quiet Title Act, the reasoning of those cases is equally applicable in determining the effect of the statute-of-limitations bar that the district court applied in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-11\">Thus, even if, as the Claims Court stated, \u201ca dismissal based on the statute of limitations is a decision on the merits\u201d for <em>res judicata </em>purposes, <em>Doko Farms, </em>21 Cl.Ct. at 703-04, that principle would bar the government only from again bringing its own suit against Doko to recover the over-payments. It would not bar the government from recovering the money by administratively offsetting the over-payments against subsidy due to Doko for subsequent years, as it did in this case, or from defending against Doko\u2019s suit by relying upon the basis for the offset.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-12\">B. Doko contends, however, that the government\u2019s failure to appeal from the Claims Court\u2019s dismissal of its counterclaim bars it from now seeking to enforce its claim against Doko, because it was the counterclaim in which the government asserted its right to offset Doko\u2019s debt for the 1973 overpayments against amounts due to Doko for subsidy payments for subsequent years.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-13\">The substantive issues under Doko\u2019s complaint and the government\u2019s counter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1142\">*1142</page-number>claim were identical, however. Under each, the ultimate question is whether, as the government administratively found, Doko had engaged in a scheme or device to defeat the upland cotton program. If the government were to prevail on Doko\u2019s complaint, the result would be the same as if it had prevailed on its counterclaim: Doko could not recover the withheld amount from the government, which could retain it.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-4\">Indeed, Doko\u2019s complaint in the Claims Court sought the same relief as its counterclaim in the district court, and the government\u2019s counterclaim in the Claims Court sought the same relief as its complaint in the district court. As the Claims Court pointed out in holding that, for <em>res judicata </em>purposes, the parties were the same in the two cases, \u201c[w]hen Doko initially asserted its counterclaim against the Government in the district court action, the relief sought was merely the flip side or the consequence of denying the Government\u2019s claim.\u201d 21 Cl.Ct. at 710. The fact that up to this point in the litigation each side had filed either a complaint or a counterclaim at every stage of the proceedings and had pressed its position under the particular pleading then involved, did not require the government to continue the practice in this court in order to preserve its right to litigate the underlying merits issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">C. It is unclear to what extent, if any, the Claims Court relied upon the district court\u2019s alternative ground for dismissing the government\u2019s claim that the regulation was unconstitutionally vague, as a basis for its holding that the district court judgment was <em>res judicata </em>on the merits of the government\u2019s claim. <em>Cf. </em>21 Cl.Ct. at 712. Any such reliance, however, was misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">As the Supreme Court pointed out in <em>Block, </em>\u201cIf North Dakota\u2019s suit is barred by \u00a7 2409a(f), the courts below had no jurisdiction to inquire into the merits.\u201d 461 U.S. at 292, 103 S.Ct. at 1822. <em>Accord, Amoco, </em>852 F.2d at 1578 (\u201cOnce the district court determined that plaintiffs\u2019 suit was time-barred ..., the suit was extinguished procedurally and the district court was precluded from reaching the substantive merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 suit.\u201d) Upon deciding that the statute of limitations barred the government\u2019s suit, the Texas district court had no authority to determine that the regulation. was unconstitutional. The latter ruling was dictum and, therefore, could not be <em>res judicata </em>in the present case. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) Judgments, \u00a7 27, comments h &amp; i.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-9\">The governing statutes and regulations authorized, if not required, the withholding offset the government administratively made and justified the government\u2019s reliance on that offset to oppose Doko\u2019s attempt to recover the withholding through its Claims Court suit. \u201cThe government has the same right \u2018which belongs to every creditor, to apply the unappropriated moneys of his debtor, in his hands, in extinguishment of the debts due to him.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Munsey Trust Co., </em>332 U.S. 234, 239, 67 S.Ct. 1599, 1601, 91 L.Ed. 2022 (1947) (quoting <em>Gratiot v. United States, </em>40 U.S. (15 Pet.) 336, 370, 10 L.Ed. 759 (1841)).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-10\">Section 2415(a) of Title 28, provides a six-year statute of limitations for any suit by the government for \u201cmoney damages.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2415(a) (1988). Section 2415(f), however, states that this provision \u201cshall not prevent the assertion, in an action against the United States or an officer or agency thereof, of any claim of the United States or an officer or agency thereof against an opposing party, a co-party, or a third party that arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party\u2019s claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 2415(f). Section 714b(c) of Title 15 provides that \u201c[t]he defendant in any suit by or against the [Commodity Credit] Corporation may plead, by way of set-off or counterclaim, any cause of action, whether arising out of the same transaction or not, which would otherwise be barred by such limitation if the claim upon which the defendant\u2019s cause of action is based had not been barred prior to the date that the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action arose.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 714b(c). Finally, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3716(a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1143\">*1143</page-number>(1988) authorizes agency heads, when an attempt to collect a debt due to the United States has failed, to \u201ccollect the claim by administrative offset,\u201d in accordance with regulations they have prescribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">Department of Agriculture Regulations specifically require withholding or setoff \u201cagainst debts of the recipients,\u201d of amounts disburseable under programs the Department administers. 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 13.1 (1982) (current version at 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 1403.7 (1991)). One of the cases in which \u201c[withholding shall be made\u201d is \u201cWhere there has been a serious breach of contract or violation of program requirements and the withholding action is considered necessary to protect the financial interest of the Government.\u201d 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 13.3(a) (1982) (current version at 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 1403.8 (1991)). The Department\u2019s administrative determination found that Doko\u2019s conduct involved a violation of program requirements and found Doko liable for a refund of $1,116,957; the large refund owed justified a withholding to protect the government\u2019s financial interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">Doko argues that these statutes are inapplicable and that other regulations bar the government from the withholding. Those arguments all are premised upon Doko\u2019s contention that the 1981 district court judgment extinguished Doko\u2019s debt and the government\u2019s cause of action to collect it. As we have held in Part II of this opinion, the 1981 judgment did not have that effect. Moreover, the government administratively offset the amount of the improper subsidy payments to Doko against subsidy payments to Doko for subsequent years before the 1981 judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-7\">Finally, in its reply brief the government urges us not only to vacate the Claims Court judgment in favor of Doko, but, also, to \u201csustain the Department of Agriculture\u2019s authority to offset Doko Farms\u2019 liability for payments procured, as a matter of law, by scheme or device to evade the Upland Cotton Price Support Program for their personal gain and the taxpayer\u2019s loss.\u201d It refers to 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1385 (1988), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-9\">The facts constituting the basis for ... payment under the ... upland cotton ... programf ] ... when officially determined in conformity with the applicable regulations prescribed by the Secretary ... shall be final and conclusive and shall not be reviewable by any other officer or agency of the Government.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b972-10\">The government notes that in the second <em>Batson </em>appeal, <em>United States v. Batson, </em>782 F.2d 1307, 1310 (5th Cir.) <em>cert. denied, </em>477 U.S. 906, 106 S.Ct. 3277, 91 L.Ed.2d 567 (1986), the court of appeals held that \u201cthis provision precludes this court from reviewing [Agriculture\u2019s] findings of fact,\u201d and it contends that the administrative findings in this case \u201cestablish[ ] Doko Farms\u2019 debt as a matter of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b972-11\">We decline the government\u2019s invitation and conclude that the proper disposition of this case is the one the government proposed in its opening brief: \u201cto remand the case for a determination of whether the Department of Agriculture properly exercised its authority to offset Doko Farms\u2019 debt.\u201d As the Fifth Circuit noted in the first <em>Batson </em>appeal, the precise scope of this preclusion of judicial review is unclear. 706 F.2d at 684-85. Like the court in <em>Bat-son, </em>\u201c[w]e leave that judgment initially to the [Claims Court] on remand.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 685.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-12\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b972-13\">The judgment of the Claims Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court for further proceedings on the merits consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-14\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-15\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"AqpX\">No Costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
