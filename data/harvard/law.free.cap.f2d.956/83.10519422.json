Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-16\">Cleto filed a motion, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence, claiming sentence credit under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585 for time spent \u201cin custody\u201d during his release on bond pending trial and appeal. The district court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-18\">The government correctly points out that Cleto\u2019s claim should have been filed as a petition for writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, as he challenges the execution of his sentence rather than the validity of his conviction and sentence. <em>See United States v. Gabor, </em>905 F.2d 76, 77-78 (5th Cir.1990). The district court had jurisdiction, nevertheless, because Cleto is incarcerated at the La Tuna federal prison camp, which is located in the Western District of Texas. <em>See Gabor, id. </em>at 78. Thus, in the interest of efficiency, we will consider Cleto\u2019s petition, as it makes no practical difference whether the claim is filed under section 2255 or section 2241. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b170-19\">Although exhaustion of administrative remedies is a prerequisite to filing a section 2241 petition, <em>see Gabor, </em>905 F.2d at 78 n. 2, the government\u2019s brief does not address whether Cleto has exhausted his administrative remedies. The exhaustion requirement thus is waived. <em>See United States v. Woods, </em>888 F.2d 653, 654 (10th Cir.1989); <em>United States v. Bleike, </em>950 F.2d 214, 219 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-20\">Cleto\u2019s offense was committed in March 1989. Therefore, he is entitled to a sentence credit for any time \u201cspent in official detention prior to the date the sentence commences_\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(b) (effective November 1, 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-23\">Title 18 \u00a7 3568, the predecessor statute to section 3585, entitled a defendant to sentence credit \u201cfor any days spent in custody in connection with the offense or acts for which sentence was imposed.\u201d We exclude from the definition of \u201ccustody,\u201d under section 3568, pretrial release on bail and time spent on bail pending appeal. <em>United States v. Mares, </em>868 F.2d 151, 152 (5th Cir.1989). \u201cCustody\u201d for purposes of section 3568 is \u201ccharacterized by incarceration\u201d; credit does not accrue on a federal sentence \u201cuntil the prisoner is received at the place of imprisonment.\u201d <em>Polakoff v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number><em>United States, </em>489 F.2d 727, 730 (5th Cir.1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">Other courts have found case law concerning section 3568 directly applicable to \u00a7 3585(b). <em>See United States v. Insley, </em>927 F.2d 185, 186 (4th Cir.1991) (finding that \u201c[f]or the purpose of calculating credit for time served under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585, \u2018official detention\u2019 means imprisonment in a place of confinement, not stipulations or conditions imposed upon a person not subject to full physical incarceration\u201d); <em>United States v. Woods, </em>888 F.2d at 655 (no credit allowed under section 3585 for time spent at a halfway house as a condition of release). The <em>Woods </em>court noted that although section 3568 refers to \u201ccustody\u201d and section 3585 to \u201cofficial detention,\u201d there is \u201cnothing in the language of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585 itself or its legislative history to indicate a departure from the precedents decided under the predecessor statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing S.Rep. No. 225, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 128-29, <em>reprinted in </em>1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3182, 3311-12).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">We agree with these authorities and reject Cleto\u2019s contention that he was in \u201ccustody\u201d during his release on bond. The district court\u2019s dismissal of his petition is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
