John C. FitzGerald, a Judge of the Court of Common Pleas.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b105-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>MEMORANDUM FILED OCTOBER 3, 1941.</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b105-6\"><em>John Chapnick, </em>of New Haven, for the Plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b105-7\"><em>Arthur Klein, </em>of New Haven, for the Defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b105-9\">FITZGERALD, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ADI\">The above action is predicated on chapter 307 of the General Statutes, Revision of 1930, entitled \u201cForcible Entry and Detainer.\u201d The right of action is solely the creature of statute. As indicated by the caption of this memorandum, the plaintiff is not claiming a \u201cforcible entry\u201d by the defendant upon the premises in question, but a \u201cforcible detainer\u201d of the same by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">Section 5889 of the General Statutes, Revision of 1930, constituting one of the four sections in said chapter 307, so far as is material to this case, reads as follows: \u201cWhen any person shall make forcible entry into any lands or tenements and with a strong hand detain the same <em>or, having made a peaceable entry, without the consent of the actual possessor, shall hold and detain the same with force and strong hand </em>(italicization mine for emphasis), the party thus ejected....\u201d'</p>\n<p id=\"b105-11\">The plaintiff\u2019s case at its best, and in the light of the evidence, may be reduced to this statement of fact: the defendant took possession of the premises known as No. 114 Sound View Terrace, New Haven, owned by the plaintiff, on or about September 18, 1941; said premises were then unoccupied but were in the process of being painted; a key to the house was in the house itself and taken possession of by the defendant; the defendant had paid over certain money to the president of the plaintiff corporation; the defendant and his family now refuse to vacate the premises, although the plaintiff has demanded them to do so, because of a \u201cdispute\u201d on the question of whether or not the defendant has in fact acquired a leasehold estate of the defendant for a period of at least one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-12\">A fair balancing of all the evidence does not lead to the conclusion that after the defendant\u2019s entry upon the premises (and assuming such was without the consent of the plaintiff), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>he \u201chold[s] and detain[sj the same with force and strong hand.\u201d The defendant is standing on what he considers to be his rights, but <em>certainly not \u201cwith force and strong hand\u201d </em>within the meaning of the statute. Having moved his family and \u201chousehold goods\u201d to No. 114 Sound View Terrace, and having paid over to an officer of the plaintiff money totalling $110, claimed by him to represent two months\u2019 rent, his position is understandable. Be that as it may, nothing in the evidence warrants a finding that the defendant has said or done anything to constitute \u201cforce and strong hand\u201d in his declination to quit the premises in question. The statutory elements are lacking. <em>See Gray vs. Finch, </em>23 Conn. 495, 515, quoted in <em>Hartford Realization Co. vs. Travelers Ins. Co., </em>117 id. 218, 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">It may be that the plaintiff has a redress in some other form of action, but clearly not in this statutory form of action for reasons stated above.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s complaint is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
