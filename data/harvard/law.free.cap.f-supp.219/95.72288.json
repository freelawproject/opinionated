The complaint alleges that the Bulletin is contrary to the New York Alcoholic Beverage Control Law and in violation of the Supremacy, Commerce, Due Process, Privileges and Immunities, and Equal Protection Clauses of the United States Constitution. We hold, (1) that federal question jurisdiction exists under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, and that this three-judge District Court was properly convened under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2281, 2284; (2) that the Pullman doctrine of \u201cequitable abstention\u201d (Railroad Comm. of Texas v. Pullman Co., 1941, 312 U.S. 496, 61 S.Ct. 643, 85 L.Ed. 971) should not be applied to the instant case; (3) that as applied to plaintiff\u2019s business operation Bulletin No. 359 is neither contrary to the New York Alchoholic Beverage Control Law, nor in violation of the Supremacy, Commerce, Due Process, Privileges and Immunities, or Equal Protection Clauses of the United States Constitution. Accordingly, the complaint is dismissed on the merits and judgment is granted for defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-18\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b143-19\">The Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b143-20\">Based upon the testimony given and the exhibits received into evidence at the hearings held before this Court, the details of plaintiff\u2019s business operation and the nature of the controversy that has arisen between the parties may be stated as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b143-21\">Plaintiff was incorporated in Delaware in March of 1960 and maintains its principal place of business at the Crossway Idlewild Inn near Idlewild Airport in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>City of New York. Paul Stevens, the president and principal stockholder of plaintiff, testified that plaintiff \u201caids overseas travelers in making purchases and providing information related to local conditions and also engages in the mail order business of liquor, cigarettes and gifts.\u201d The liquor phase of the business, with which this suit is exclusively concerned, has been conducted since December of 1960. Plaintiff has never received or applied for any sort of license issued by the New York State Liquor Authority. On December 28, 1962, defendants, the Chairman, Members and Commissioners of the New York State Liquor Authority, issued Bulletin No. 359 addressed to \u201cAll Common Carriers of Passengers or Freight\u201d on the subject of the \u201cImportation of Alcoholic Beverages.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendants thereafter advised the United States Commissioner of Customs of the issuance of such bulletin, which superseded the previous Bulletin No. 263, dated July 20, 1954,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the Surveyor of Customs, Outside Division, Port of New York, has issued Surveyor\u2019s Order No. 3-1963 in implementation of Bulletin No. 359.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The result has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>been that the Customs Service has refused to release liquor arriving in the Port of New York subsequent to March 1, 1963, and which was declared by plaintiff\u2019s customers on arrival from foreign countries as duty-free liquor \u201cto follow.\u201d Since March 1, 1963, the Customs Service in the Port of New York has also refused to issue Customs Form 3351, entitled \u201cRelease For Unaccompanied Tourist Shipment,\u201d to plaintiff\u2019s customers for alcoholic beverages declared \u201cto follow\u201d on the standard Customs Form 6063. The proof is to the effect that plaintiff has been able to clear shipments for residents of the State of New Jersey, and there is no evidence that shipments to residents of states other than New York have been affected. The Surveyor\u2019s Order expressly states that it does not apply to alcoholic beverages which physically accompany returning tourists, and we understand this suit to concern only the right of plaintiff to conduct its unlicensed business operation with respect to alcoholic beverages which \u201cfollow\u201d returning New York residents.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">The evidence shows that during the fiscal year commencing April 1, 1962 and ending March 31, 1963, the gross volume of mail orders handled by plaintiff amounted to $450,000, of which approximately eighty-five per cent represented orders for liquor. The gross volume of business orders for the two previous years was $127,000 for the year ending March 31, 1962 and $225,000 for the year ending March 31, 1961, approximately eighty to eighty-five per cent of such business consisting of liquor orders. Of the liquor orders received by plaintiff approximately sixty per cent were from New York State residents, approximately forty per cent being from residents of other states, including Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The shipments of liquor which arrived in the United States but have been denied release have an approximate value of $90,000 and are impounded at the United States Free Trade Zone on Staten Island, New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>Plaintiff\u2019s business operation was conducted in <em>the </em>following manner:</p>\n<p id=\"b146-3\">Plaintiff prepared and published order forms which were distributed to departing travelers by certain travel agents, commercial airlines and large corporations located in New York City and other urban parts of the Greater New York City area, and in a number of other states.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> These order forms were also distributed to travelers in foreign countries by hotels, airline counters, sightseeing companies, guides and other persons who come in contact with American travelers. Occasionally, plaintiff made direct distribution to travelers upon request. Each form contains a code number assigned to the particular travel agent or other distributor, and commissions averaging $2.50 per order form were paid to such distributors. During the fiscal year ending March 31, 1963 plaintiff paid approximately $12,000 in commissions to distributors in the State of New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">The order form invites United States residents in certain listed states to select five-fifths (one gallon) of liquor per household member traveling together, and to mail the order form for this duty-free liquor from a point outside the United States or its possessions addressed to plaintiff, together with check or money order. The purchase price is stated to include \u201call shipping charges and insurance,\u201d and plaintiff \u201cguarantees prompt delivery\u201d of the liquor to \u201chome or office,\u201d with replacement for breakage or loss in transit \u201cat full U. S. retail value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Plaintiff returned all order forms which were not mailed from outside the United States or its possessions. \u201cSubstantially all\u201d of the orders and checks mailed to plaintiff were received at its New York City office, a \u201cvery minute\u201d portion being received at plaintiff\u2019s office in Antwerp, Belgium. Upon receiving an order form in New York plaintiff deposited the accompanying check in its bank account at the Idlewild branch of a New York bank. At this time plaintiff owned no supplies or stocks of liquor from which the orders might be filled. The orders were then transcribed onto a purchase order form and once each week plaintiff mailed this transcribed order form containing the names, addresses and liquor selections of each of its customers to Societe Commerciale Avimar, Antwerp, Belgium, a Belgian company which specializes in the sale of such liquors. At the same time plaintiff sent Avimar its own check, drawn to the order of Avimar, covering the cost of such liquors, at fixed prices which were approximately fifty per cent of the prices paid to plaintiff by its own customers. Upon receipt of these items Avimar withdrew the specific quantities and brands called for by each order from its liquor stocks in Antwerp, and prepared and made up a separate package for each order, a label being physically affixed to the outside of each package bearing the name and address of the purchaser and stating the brands and quantities making up his purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">These individual packages, bound by two metal straps, were placed in large sealed containers, bearing the name of the plaintiff, American Travelers Club, Inc. These containers were shipped by steamer from Antwerp to the Port of New York under a bill of lading which identifies a freight forwarder selected by Avimar as consignor and plaintiff or its own Customs House broker in New York as consignee. Avimar paid all freight and shipping charges until delivery in New York. Avimar also paid for insurance of the liquor for the account of \u201cwhom it may concern,\u201d until delivery in New York, plaintiff paying all transit and insurance costs thereafter. When the liquor arrived in the Port of New York the sealed containers were unloaded and placed in a crib on the pier where they were subsequently broken down to individual packages.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>Upon his arrival in the United States the returning resident completed Customs Form 6063 in which the liquor ordered through plaintiff is declared under the classification of \u201carticles being shipped to you\u201d and stated to be for the personal or household use of the returning resident and not for purposes of sale. Only one declaration was made for each family traveling together. Until March 1, 1963 the tourist also received and completed Customs Form 3351, entitled \u201cRelease For Unaccompanied Tourist Shipment.\u201d Customs Form 3351 was then forwarded by the tourist to plaintiff, who in turn forwarded it to its own Customs House broker licensed by the United States Customs Bureau, who secured the release of the individually packaged orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">After such clearance the liquor was picked up at the pier by persons paid by plaintiff on the basis of the quantity handled. These individuals used trucks rented by them and for which no license or permit from the New York State Liquor Authority had been obtained or applied for. The liquor was delivered by them to the addresses furnished by plaintiff\u2019s customers in New York City, and to the Railway Express Agency terminal in Long Island City for delivery by that common carrier to addresses outside of New York City. Occasionally, liquor was delivered to plaintiff\u2019s premises near Idle-wild Airport, where it was stored overnight, or sometimes longer, before final delivery to plaintiff\u2019s customers. Plaintiff has no means of determining whether any particular order was mailed by a minor, and liquors have been ordered for members of households including children. Approximately twenty per cent of the liquor orders were mailed from points in Canada for delivery in the United States. The prices paid to plaintiff by New York residents ranged from fifty to seventy per cent below the minimum consumer resale prices which New York\u2019s licensed retail dealers charge pursuant to \u00a7 101-c of the New York Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, and are substantially lower than the prices fixed for the sale of liquor by the liquor control commissions of the Provinces of Quebec and Ontario, Canada.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">There is testimony that five other companies have also engaged in mail order liquor supply operations, and that four of these companies do a substantially greater volume of business than plaintiff. It also appears that the activities of various of these companies have been the subject of suits brought in the New York courts by the Attorney General of the State of New York, and by various of these companies against the State of New York, and that motions in two of these suits are now <em>sub judice. </em>Railway Express Agency, Inc., which is also a participant in these suits, has sought to intervene in this proceeding and has been allowed to appear as <em>amicus curiae. </em>Counsel for the <em>amicus </em>urges this Court to apply the doctrine of \u201cequitable abstention\u201d because the New York courts might decide issues of state law which would be helpful to us in disposing of the case before us. On the other hand, as these suits have been described to us it appears that the factual situations and the precise legal points there involved are significantly different from the facts and issues in the case before us, and the <em>amicus </em>alternatively urges the Court to confine its decision to the facts and legal points presented herein. The parties to the action now agree that the doctrine of \u201cequitable abstention\u201d should not be applied and that the Court should proceed to an adjudication on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">The Jurisdiction Of The Court</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">As will appear from the relevant portion of the opinion below, we are of the opinion that as applied to its business operation the various constitutional claims of the plaintiff cannot be sustained on the merits. Nevertheless we hold that on the complaint before us plaintiff has raised substantial federal questions under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, and that the United States District Court has jurisdiction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>the action.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In so holding we are mindful of the basic rules that in determining federal question jurisdiction we must look to the allegations of the complaint \u201cand not by the way the facts turn out or by a decision of the merits\u201d (Mosher v. City of Phoenix, 1932, 287 U.S. 29, 30, 53 S.Ct. 67, 77 L.Ed. 148); and that a federal claim may be dismissed for want of jurisdiction only if the claim is \u201cobviously without merit,\u201d or plainly unsound because previous decisions \u201cforeclose the subject and leave no room for the inference that the question sought to be raised can be the subject of controversy.\u201d Ex Parte Poresky, 1933, 290 U. S. 30, 32, 54 S.Ct. 3, 4, 78 L.Ed. 152. See Baker v. Carr, 1962, 369 U.S. 186, 199, 82 S.Ct. 691, 7 L.Ed.2d 663; cf. Wylie v. State Board of Equalization, S. D.Cal., 1937, 21 F.Supp. 604.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\"> Although 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2281 applies only where an injunction is sought against state action on the ground of its \u201cunconstitutionality,\u201d the fact that the suit also involves nonconstitutional challenges does not render the statute and the three-judge procedure prescribed by Section 2284 inapplicable. Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Jacobsen, 1960, 362 U.S. 73, 80, 80 S.Ct. 568, 4 L.Ed.2d 568. Section 2281, therefore, is not inapplicable to the instant case because of the joinder of the state law issues,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and we are otherwise satisfied that this three-judge District Court was properly convened under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2281, 2284.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">As will also appear from the relevant portion of the opinion below, we think it clear that as applied to plaintiff\u2019s business operation Bulletin No. 359 does not violate the New York Alcoholic Beverage Control Law. There is therefore no occasion for us to apply the Pullman branch of the doctrine of \u201cequitable abstention\u201d (Railroad Comm. of Texas v. Pullman Co., supra, 312 U.S. 496, 61 S.Ct. 643, 85 L.Ed. 971) as there are no uncertain issues of state law in the case. N. A. A. C. P. v. Bennett, 1959, 360 U.S. 471, 79 S.Ct. 1192, 3 L.Ed.2d 1375; City of Chicago v. Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co., 1958, 357 U.S. 77, 84, 78 S. Ct. 1063, 2 L.Ed.2d 1174; All American Airways, Inc. v. Village of Cedarhurst, 2 Cir., 1953, 201 F.2d 273, 276-277; Note, Judicial Abstention from the Exercise of Federal Jurisdiction, 59 Col.L.Rev. 749, 756-757 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">We reach this same conclusion by applying other factors considered by Judge Hays, writing for a statutory three-judge court, in Idlewild Bon-Voyage Liquor Corp. v. Epstein, S.D.N.Y., 1962, 212 F. Supp. 376. Although the constitutional issues in the case are quite significant, neither party urges the Court to abstain; plaintiff would certainly be subject to additional expense and delay if we did abstain ; and the several suits now pending in the state courts differ in substantial respects both as to the facts and the law from the one before us. Cf. Chicago v. Fieldcrest Dairies, Inc., 1942, 316 U.S. 168, 173, 62 S.Ct. 986, 86 L.Ed. 1355; Note, Stay of Federal Proceedings in Deference to Concurrently Pending State Court Suits, 60 Col.L.Rev. 684, 688, 702 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">The New York Law</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Turning to the merits, we think it clear that the New York Alcoholic Beverage Control Law renders this plaintiff\u2019s business operation subject to requirements of regulation and licensing, and prohibits the shipment into the State of New York of liquor where these requirements have not been complied with.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">Section 102(1) (c) of the New York statute just referred to declares that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AP\">\u201cNo alcoholic beverages shall be shipped into the state unless the same shall be consigned to a person duly licensed hereunder to traffic in alcoholic beverages.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">It is clear from the evidence that plaintiff ships alcoholic beverages, or causes them to be shipped, into New York State, and that the liquor is consigned to a person, either plaintiff itself or its Customs House broker, who is not licensed by the New York State Liquor Authority. If the language of \u00a7 102(1) (c) is taken at its face value, then, it must be construed as prohibiting plaintiff\u2019s arrangement for the shipment of liquor into the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">Plaintiff\u2019s reliance upon People v. Ryan, 1937, 274 N.Y. 149, 8 N.E.2d 313, is entirely misplaced. This case involved an indictment charging the defendant with carrying liquor and wine, which he had purchased in Connecticut, into the State in violation of \u00a7 102(1) (d) of the New York Law.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It appeared that the beverages were purchased by the defendant solely for his own personal use and were not intended for sale or distribution. Reasoning that \u201cthe definite, fixed, and expressed purpose of the Legislature was to regulate and control the <em>manufacture, sale, </em>and <em>distribution </em>of alcoholic beverages\u201d within the State, and that there was \u201cno prohibition of consumption of alcoholic beverages by private individuals in their own homes\u201d (274 N.Y. at 152-153, 8 N.E.2d at 315; court\u2019s own emphasis), the court held that the expression \u201cNo common carrier or other person\u201d in \u00a7 102(1) (d) should be read under the maxim <em>ejusdem generis, </em>that is, to embrace only persons engaged in commercial transportation. Section 102(1) (c), however, does not contain similar language which could be given this statutory construction, and, in any event, if the holding in Ryan can be extended to cover \u00a7 102(1) (c) as well plaintiff is not in any way assisted since plaintiff is engaged in commercial transportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-14\">In reaching its conclusion the court in Ryan also stated that it did not wish to deny to the defendant the right secured to him by \u00a7 116(b) of the New York Law<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to \u201ctransport within the State liquor owned by him as long as the purpose of transportation is not for distribution or sale.\u201d 274 N.Y. at 153, 8 N.E.2d at 315. But plaintiff's contention that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>it also falls under the shield of \u00a7 116(b) cannot be sustained. Even if we agreed that the Section is not limited to transportation by the owner himself, on the evidence before us we cannot accept plaintiff\u2019s attorney\u2019s characterization of his client as an \u201cagent\u201d for those who submitted orders to it. The evidence clearly sustains the conclusion that plaintiff maintains an independent business whereby it purchases liquor from a third party, taking title in its own name, and that it contracts to sell such liquor to its customers at a fixed price. The fact that plaintiff additionally imports and delivers the liquor to its customers does not establish that it is acting primarily for their benefit and not for itself. See Restatement (Second), Agency \u00a7 14 K (1958). Moreover, there is serious question whether the liquor is \u201cowned\u201d by plaintiff\u2019s customers prior to the fulfillment by plaintiff of its contractual duty to deliver to the customer\u2019s home or business address. N.Y. Personal Property Law \u00a7 100, Rule 5.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">Plaintiff also mistakenly relies upon Matter of Wylegala v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., 177 Misc. 1071, 32 N.Y.S.2d 814 (Sup.Ct.1942), affirmed, 264 App.Div. 937, 36 N.Y.S.2d 440 (4th Dep\u2019t 1942). Wylegala merely held that \u00a7\u00a7 102(1) (e), (d) and (e) do not apply to mail order purchases of liquor by New York consumers from New York retail dealers and the subsequent intrastate delivery of such purchased liquor. The court in Wylegala also noted the applicability of \u00a7 116(c) to the shipments from the licensed retail dealers to the defendant common carrier and then to the consumer-purchasers. The Wylegala decision, however, is clearly inapplicable to the instant case, for here the shipments are not intrastate and there is no licensee under \u00a7 116 (c) .<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">The conclusion which emerges most clearly from a study of the evidence taken before us is that plaintiff is engaged in the liquor business in New York; and this does not depend solely upon \u00a7 102 (1) (c).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-8\">Section 100(1) provides that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-9\">\u201cNo person shall manufacture for sale or sell at wholesale or retail any alcoholic beverage within the state without obtaining the appropriate license therefor required by this chapter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">The evidence establishes that it is part of plaintiff\u2019s regular business operation to solicit and receive orders for, and to effect the delivery of liquor within New York State, and that it also occasionally stores liquor on its premises within the State. Under the broad definition of \u201csale\u201d in \u00a7 3(28) of the New York statute <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> we find that plaintiff has violated \u00a7 100(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-11\">Defendants also contend that plaintiff\u2019s unlicensed trucking activities violate \u00a7 94(1); that its unlicensed storing violates \u00a7 96(1); and that its unlicensed soliciting violates \u00a7 102(1) (b). Section 65(1), relating to sales to minors, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>and \u00a7 101-c, relating to minimum consumer resale prices, have also been called to our attention. No useful purpose would be served by a detailed discussion of these additional alleged violations. When we consider the purpose and policy of the New York Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, as set forth in \u00a7 2 thereof,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> as well as the statutory provisions already referred to, it is abundantly clear to us that the very heart of plaintiff\u2019s liquor operation falls within the coverage of the New York statute and that it is subject to requirements of regulation and licensing.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">This conclusion is not altered by the Liquor Authority\u2019s issuance in 1954 of Bulletin No. 263, which the present Bulletin No. 359 superseded. Plaintiff acquired no vested rights and the plain import of the statute could not be changed by this administrative ruling, which defendants now characterize as \u201cadministrative indulgence.\u201d See McGoldrick v. Family Finance Corp., 1942, 287 N.Y. 535, 539, 41 N.E.2d 86, 88, 141 A.L.R. 909; Matter of Restaurants &amp; Patisseries Longchamps, Inc. v. O\u2019Connell, 271 App.Div. 641, 644, 67 N.Y.S.2d 362, 365 (1st Dep\u2019t 1947), appeal dismissed, 1947, 296 N.Y. 239, 72 N.E.2d 174; F. C. C. v. WOKO, Inc., 1946, 329 U.S. 223, 227-228, 67 S.Ct. 213, 91 L.Ed. 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">At this point we may conveniently also dispose of an additional claim presented by plaintiff\u2019s briefs, namely, that the New York Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, and Bulletin No. 359 which purports to be based upon it, are so vague and indefinite as to be in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Assuming that plaintiff may anticipate criminal proceedings not yet brought against it, or that plaintiff otherwise has standing to raise the point, the answer to this claim is that it is perfectly clear that plaintiff\u2019s business is subject to regulation and licensing under the state law. Whatever doubts may or may not exist as to the application of the New York statute to other persons and other situations need not be considered in the instant case. Jordan v. De George, 1951, 341 U.S. 223, 231-232, 71 S.Ct. 703, 95 L.Ed. 886; United States v. Wurzbach, 1930, 280 U.S. 396, 399, 50 S.Ct. 167, 74 L.Ed. 508; Note, The Void-For-Vagueness Doctrine in the Supreme Court, 109 U.Pa.L.Rev. 67, 101 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-11\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b151-12\">The Federal Law</p>\n<p id=\"b151-13\">Plaintiff\u2019s primary federal claim is that Bulletin No. 359 and the New York Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, if the administrative ruling is found to be authorized by the statute, are inconsistent with federal rights granted under a federal statute, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201, par. 1798, and that the State action must be declared null and void under the Supremacy Clause, U.S.Const. Art. VI, Cl. 2. We reject this claim as we interpret the federal statute merely to grant an exemp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>tion from the levy of customs duties and not to confer an affirmative federal right upon a commercial enterprise to import liquor into a state notwithstanding the state\u2019s prohibitions against such transportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201, par. 1798, in relevant part, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-5\">\u201c\u00a7 1201. Free list \u201cExcept as otherwise specially provided in this chapter, the articles mentioned in the following paragraphs, when imported into the United States * * * shall be exempt from duty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-6\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-7\">\u201cPar. 1798</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-8\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-9\">\u201c(c) In the case of any person arriving in the United States who is a returning resident thereof- \u2014 \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-10\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-11\">\u201c(2) articles (including not more than one wine gallon of alcoholic beverages * * *) ac-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-12\">quired abroad as an incident of the journey from which he is returning, for his personal or household use, but not imported for the account of any other person nor intended for sale, if declared in accordance with regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury, up to but not exceeding in agggregate value \u2014 [$100, $200 or $300, as specified in (A) and (B) ].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-13\">We may note at the outset that this customs statute is significantly devoid of any language purporting to create an affirmative federal \u201cright\u201d to import into a state a quantity of liquor in violation of a state\u2019s liquor laws. On its face the statute does no more than exempt for tourists a certain quantity from the payment of the customs duty. The statutory language, \u201cwhen imported,\u201d naturally read may be elaborated to mean \u201cwhen lawfully imported in accordance with applicable state laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-14\">Certainly we have not been cited to, nor have we ourselves found anything in the legislative history of the statute to suggest the contrary. For all that appears the Congress has merely sought to grant an exemption from the levy of customs duties as an act of legislative grace and perhaps also to develop foreign travel and related interests. See U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Adm.News (1961), pp. 2333-2335; H.R.Rep. No. 1870, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 10-11 (1935); S.Rep. No. 2028, 74th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 15 (1936); Hearings on H.R. 9185 Before a Subcommittee of the Senate Finance Committee, 74th Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 33, 147-148 (1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-16\">Plaintiff\u2019s interpretation of the statute is all the more difficult to accept in view of the broad regulatory powers which have been accorded to the states with respect to the importation of liquor into a state for delivery or use therein. U.S. Const. Amend. XXI; \u201cWilson Act,\u201d 27 U.S.C. \u00a7 121; \u201cWebb-Kenyon Act,\u201d 27 U.S.C. \u00a7 122; \u201cFederal Alcoholic Administration Act,\u201d 27 U.S.C. \u00a7 204(a) (2) (C). If the Congress had intended to circumscribe such powers by creating an affirmative federal right to import liquor into a state without regard to the state\u2019s prohibitions against such transportation, we may assume that it would have employed language more apt for that purpose than is found in the customs statute relied upon by plaintiff. Cf. Ziffrin, Inc. v. Reeves, 1939, 308 U.S. 132, 140-141, 60 S.Ct. 163, 84 L.Ed. 128.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-17\">This analysis is confirmed by the only judicial interpretation of the statute that has been brought to our attention. Wylie v. State Board of Equalization, supra, 21 F.Supp. at 605. This is also the practical construction adopted by the Commissioner of Customs, U.S. Treasury Department, in the booklet, \u201cUnited States Customs Hints For Returning Residents of the United States,\u201d page 3 (September 1961):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-18\">\u201cCustoms officers will not release liquors destined to any State for use in violation of its laws. Check your State laws!\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>Moreover, even if we agreed that the customs statute does grant to a returning resident an affirmative federal right to import liquor without regard to state laws, in view of the statute\u2019s proviso that the liquor must not be \u201cimported for the account of any other person nor intended for sale,\u201d we cannot say that the statute accords such a right to plaintiff, whose commercial enterprise is engaged in the business of importing liquor for resale or for the account of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">In thus construing the federal statute we also avoid the necessity of passing upon the grave constitutional issue of whether the broad sweep of the Twenty-first Amendment renders the state law superior to a conflicting federal statute.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See Rosenberg v. Fleuti, 374 U.S. 449, 451, 83 S.Ct. 1804, 10 L.Ed.2d 1000. In addition, as we hold that the customs statute does not confer upon plaintiff an affirmative federal right to import liquor, it is not necessary for us to consider whether such right would be protected by the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s other claims of constitutional infringement are to the effect that the Commerce, Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Constitution have been violated because of the disruption of plaintiff\u2019s business and the intrusion into its affairs. Plaintiff\u2019s main reliance here is upon the decision in Idle-wild Bon-Voyage Liquor Corp. v. Epstein, supra, 212 F.Supp. 376, where Judge Hays, writing for the statutory three-judge court, held invalid an attempted state prohibition of a commercial enterprise whereby liquor was purchased and paid for by departing travelers in New York City, but there was no delivery or use until arrival at the foreign destination. The Twenty-first Amendment<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> was found inapplicable because there was no \u201cdelivery or use\u201d within New York, and close Customs inspection reduced to \u201cminimal\u201d proportions the possibility of diversion within the State. The State action was struck down as a violation of the Commerce Clause because New York had not sought to \u201cregulate or supervise,\u201d but to \u201cterminate,\u201d and this attempted prohibition was not found to be \u201creasonably necessary to protect the local public interest in preventing unlawful distribution or use of liquor within the state.\u201d 212 F.Supp. at 382-383, 386.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">The instant case, however, is different in two critical respects. New York\u2019s action is directed at the importation of liquor for delivery and use within the State, so there is here no question but that the Twenty-first Amendment is applicable.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> And New York has merely sought to impose conditions of regula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>tion and licensing upon a commercial enterprise which imports liquor for delivery and use to New York residents within the State. Whether one takes the position that the Twenty-first Amendment frees the states entirely from the ambit of the Commerce, Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> or whether one takes the view that reasonable regulations of liquor traffic by a state constitute a proper exercise of the police power,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> it is abundantly clear that New York has not violated any of the constitutional provisions relied upon by plaintiff.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">.
