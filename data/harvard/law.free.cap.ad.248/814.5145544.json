Hence we may not regard such direction for compensation as a judicial precedent controlling in actions where the parties are not in agreement and do not by complaisance and non-resistance waive objection or dissent. We think too that the present application is not based on services of a similar nature to those rendered in the other cause and that accordingly we may not regard the cited authority as authorizing an award here.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-12\">The motion to reargue or for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeals should be denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
