Pappaconstantinou, also known as Michael J. Pappas, was indicted on twelve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>counts of theft under $300 and one count of theft over $300 for stealing merchandise and money from his employer. On October 31, 1996, appellant was brought to trial before a jury in the Circuit Court for Charles County (Nalley, J). At the beginning of the trial, appellant moved to suppress statements he made to his former employer in which he confessed to the theft. The court held a hearing, outside of the jury\u2019s presence, and determined that the confession was admissible because there was no violation of Pappas\u2019s constitutional rights, and the circumstances surrounding the statement showed that the statement was not \u201cinherently unreliable.\u201d The jury convicted appellant on all counts and the court sentenced him to a nine-month term of incarceration in the county jail. Appellant noted this appeal and argues that the trial court erred in admitting the confession because it was the product of threats and promises and, therefore, involuntary. We conclude that the trial court properly admitted the confession and, accordingly, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">In examining the question presented, the record at the suppression hearing is the exclusive source of facts for our review. <em>Lee v. State, </em>311 Md. 642, 648, 537 A.2d 235 (1988). We extend great deference to the suppression court\u2019s fact-finding, particularly that court\u2019s ability to \u201cdetermin[e] the credibilities of contradicting witnesses and to weight] and determin[e] first-level facts.\u201d <em>Perkins v. State, </em>83 Md.App. 341, 346, 574 A.2d 356 (1990). When conflicting evidence is presented, we accept the facts as found by the suppression court, unless clearly erroneous. <em>Riddick v. State, </em>319 Md. 180, 183, 571 A.2d 1239 (1990), After giving due regard to the suppression court\u2019s findings of fact, we then make our own independent appraisal by reviewing the law and applying it to the facts of the case. <em>Aiken v. State, </em>101 Md.App. 557, 563, 647 A.2d 1229 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">SUPPRESSION HEARING FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">Michael Pappas was employed by Auto Row Auto Parts (Auto Row) in Waldorf, Maryland for approximately three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>years. In January 1996, Auto Row terminated Pappas when his employers suspected that he had been stealing from the company. Pappas then went to work for Pep Boys Auto Store and, as of the time of trial, Pappas was manager of Yates Auto Parts (Yates), also located in Waldorf.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">On March 29, 1996, shortly after his termination from Auto Row, Pappas had a telephone conversation with employees of Auto Row to discuss allegations that Pappas learned his former employer had been making against him. Specifically, Pappas testified that he \u201cheard on the street\u201d that an Auto Row employee was \u201csaying that I was a crook.\u201d The State contends that Pappas, upon hearing these allegations, initiated contact with Auto Row by paging Auto Row\u2019s sales manager, Len Gentilcore, on the afternoon of March 29, 1996. William Clark, another Auto Row employee, testified at the suppression hearing that he observed Len Gentilcore call Pappas immediately after Gentilcore received Pappas\u2019s page. According to Clark, Pappas told Gentilcore, \u201cI understand I\u2019m being prosecuted, what\u2019s going on, what do I need to do.\u201d Gentilcore told Pappas to \u201ccall Bill Clark.\u201d Clark testified that, approximately two minutes later, he received a phone call from Pappas. Pappas asked Clark, as he had asked Gentilcore, what, if anything, he could do with respect to the allegations against him. According to Clark:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-5\">[Pappas] stated that I understand I\u2019m being prosecuted, what do I have to do to stop this. We talked for a minute. Really caught me off guard, I told Mike [Pappas] that in my opinion you would have to do three things.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-6\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-7\">[O]ne, make a monetary reimbursement back to the company for what he stole, [two], not to work in an auto parts store in the Waldorf area, and [three], write a confession of what he did because of all the grief he put everybody through at Auto Row ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">Clark then testified that Pappas called yet again, and the two spoke for \u201ctwenty to thirty minutes.\u201d Clark stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>[Pappas] called back. Said that if I did [those three things], was there any guarantee, how do I know if I would be prosecuted. I [Clark] said, my word is good ... I told him we need to meet tonight if we are going to do this. Consequently, he called back the third time and the meeting was set up.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">Not surprisingly, Pappas presented a starkly different account of how the meeting between him and Clark was arranged. Pappas claimed that it was Auto Row\u2019s Len Gentilcore who made the initial phone call to Pappas. Pappas testified that \u201cLen [Gentilcore] called me at work on the 29th\u201d and said \u201cyou better do something, the dogs are after you, Brian [Puckett, Auto Row\u2019s owner] is playing golf with the State\u2019s Attorney, he will have all files as of Saturday.\u201d Pap-pas further testified, consistent with Clark\u2019s testimony, that Gentilcore told Pappas to call Clark. Pappas continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-5\">So I called [Clark] and I asked him. And he said, I don\u2019t know if Brian\u2019s playing golf with the State\u2019s Attorney. He said, To tell you the truth, being you don\u2019t have any money, it doesn\u2019t matter if they\u2019re playing tennis, whatever they say is what\u2019s going to happen. You don\u2019t have any money, you intend to go to settlement on your house Friday.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">Later in his testimony, Pappas again stated that Clark referred to an upcoming meeting he was supposed to have with the State\u2019s Attorney. According to Pappas, Clark said, \u201c[w]e\u2019re meeting with the State's Attorney on Saturday. Once the State\u2019s Attorney is involved, it doesn\u2019t matter what we say, it\u2019s the State [sic] now.\u201d Under cross-examination, however, Clark unequivocally denied saying anything about the State\u2019s Attorney:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-7\">[Defense Counsel]: Do you know anything about someone playing golf with the State\u2019s Attorney?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-8\">[Clark]: There was something Mike said about that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-9\">[Defense Counsel]: There wasn\u2019t any mention that [Brian Puckett] was going to be playing golf with the State\u2019s Attorney?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-10\">[Clark]: No, sir. Mike called me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>Clark also denied another of Pappas\u2019s allegations, namely, that he threatened to have Pappas arrested on his wedding day.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">Clark and Pappas agreed to meet that evening at Jaspers, a restaurant in Crofton, Maryland. Again, the stories regarding this meeting are markedly different. According to Clark, Pappas arrived at Jaspers at the agreed-upon time, accompanied by his then fiancee, Dawn Rae. Dawn Rae immediately went to the bar and remained there for the duration of Pappas\u2019s meeting, while Pappas went to the booth in which Clark and Len Gentilcore were seated.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At this point, according to Clark, Pappas sat down and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ad9\">apologized for what had happened and we had a conversation about those things that had took [sic] place at the store. He also talked about him getting married and I said that I wasn\u2019t aware. Just pleasantries.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Clark continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-6\">[Pappas] said, What do I need to write and I said, What you did. And he started actually trying to handwrite.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">Clark testified that Pappas wrote the confession on his own and, on cross-examination, denied dictating or otherwise directing Pappas.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-8\">[Defense Counsel]: You didn\u2019t tell him what to write?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqeG\">[Clark]: Absolutely. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-9\">$ $ $ $</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-10\">[Defense Counsel]: Did Mike ever stop in the middle of writing and say, This doesn\u2019t sound right, and you said just write?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-11\">[Clark]: No, sir ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-12\">Pappas\u2019s account of the meeting at Jaspers conflicts with Clark\u2019s account in almost every respect. First, Pappas testified that when he and Dawn Rae entered the restaurant, Clark told Pappas that Dawn Rae was not to be involved:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>[Clark] said, this is between us, This is business, this is not concerning your wife. [Clark] goes, We will not talk about anything until she leaves.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">Pappas then recounted his version of the rendering of the confession in the following colloquy \u00f3n direct examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADr\">[Pappas]: [Clark] said I want you to write this statement saying that you weren\u2019t wrongfully fired and I think that was all he wanted in the statement. And I basically took dictation of what he said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-5\">[Defense Counsel]: What do you mean you basically took dictation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-6\">[Pappas]: I mean I signed my name myself, but I mean the wording of it is his.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-7\">[Defense Counsel]: What was your understanding you were getting in exchange for writing this statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-8\">[Pappas]: For writing this statement, he was going to drop all charges, if they even had any. I didn\u2019t know at the time. He didn\u2019t show me any paperwork. He was going to drop everything he had against me and move on. In his own words, I never want to hear your name again.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-9\">The handwritten confession, State\u2019s Exhibit # 1 at the suppression hearing, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-10\">I Michael John Pappas wrongfully took merchandise and money from Auto Row Auto parts. I realize that I was correctly terminated from this establishment. Property was destroyed and incorrectly marked as return item [sic]. I realize that what I did was wrong and I unjustly cause [sic] a lot of difficulties to the members of Auto Row Auto Parts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-11\">The confession was dated March 29, 1996 and signed by Pappas and the three Auto Row representatives present at Jaspers.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-12\">The court concluded that Pappas\u2019s statement was not \u201cinherently unreliable,\u201d and admitted it. Though the trial court did not specifically articulate the test that it used, the court apparently based its ruling on common law evidentiary princi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>pies. The court viewed Pappas\u2019s statement as an \u201cadmission,\u201d and noted the \u201cgeneral rule\u201d that such statements are normally \u201cinherently reliable because [the declarant] is putting himself in some kind of peril by admitting something.\u201d The court noted that, although threats and promises may cast doubt on the reliability of a statement, the circumstances of this case showed that the statement was freely given and, thus, constituted competent evidence for the jury\u2019s consideration.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-4\">[N]ot every admission that follows on the heels of a promise or even a threat necessarily is inherently unreliable. And I think this case fits that exception.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-5\">sf*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-6\">[Pappas\u2019s statement] ... was not the product of such promise or threat as to render it inherently unreliable ... I am persuaded, at least by the preponderance standard, that whatever discussion was had about prosecution was in the context of defendant\u2019s having asked what can I do to get out of it, what can I do to avoid it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">The court emphasized that its decision turned, in large part, on the credibility of Clark and Pappas, respectively.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-8\">Mr. Pappas said in response to my question that it was he and not Len Gentilcore who initiated the conversation \u2014 the part of the conversation that had to do with prosecution ... I conclude from this that, though [Pappas\u2019s] account and Clark\u2019s account vary substantially as to particulars, that meeting was as much the product of Mr. Pappas bringing up the topic of prosecution as it was Clark\u2019s or Gentilcore\u2019s.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b685-10\">Pappas\u2019s sole argument on appeal is that the trial court erred by not suppressing the confession he made to his former employer, Auto Row. In particular, Pappas claims that, because his \u201cstatement was made in light of [a] promise not to prosecute, it is \u2018involuntary\u2019 ... and should have been inadmissible.\u201d Under Maryland law, a defendant\u2019s confession is admissible if it is:</p>\n<p id=\"b686-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>(1) voluntary under Maryland nonconstitutional law [common law],</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">(2) voluntary under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">(3) elicited in conformance with the mandates of <em>Miranda.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A16\"><em>Ringe v. State, </em>94 Md.App. 614, 621, 618 A.2d 266 (1993); <em>see also Hoey v. State, </em>311 Md. 473, 484, 536 A.2d 622 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">Pappas does not and, indeed, could not argue that his confession was obtained in violation of <em>Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 </em>S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). It is well settled that <em>Miranda </em>warnings need be given only when \u201can individual is taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom <em>by the authorities </em>in any significant way and is subjected to questioning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 478, 86 S.Ct. at 1630. (emphasis added). In addition, \u201c[w]here an accused\u2019s statements are elicited by persons other than police,\u201d official interrogation has been held to exist only \u201cwhere the State is otherwise involved.\u201d <em>Hamilton v. State, </em>62 Md.App. 603, 610, 490 A.2d 763 (1985). Pappas has conceded that the State was not involved in his confession, either directly or indirectly; he acknowledges that the representatives from Auto Row were private actors, and does not claim that Auto Row colluded with law enforcement officers in obtaining the statement from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">Similarly, Pappas does not argue that admitting the confession violates his due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. Again, as he has conceded that there is no State action in this case, we agree that such an argument is foreclos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>ed. <em>See, e.g., Reynolds v. State, </em>327 Md. 494, 504, 610 A.2d 782 (1992); <em>Colorado v. Connelly, </em>479 U.S. 157, 164, 107 S.Ct. 515, 520, 93 L.Ed.2d 473 (1986).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">Rather, Pappas concedes that the only basis upon which his confession could possibly be suppressed is under Maryland\u2019s common law doctrine of voluntariness. Under that doctrine, Pappas argues that his confession may not be used against him \u201cunless it first be shown to be free of any coercive barnacles that may have attached by improper means to prevent the expression from being voluntary.\u201d <em>Hillard v. State, </em>286 Md. 145, 150, 406 A.2d 415 (1979). Pappas further claims that \u201cthe government must shoulder the responsibility of showing affirmatively that the inculpatory statement was freely and voluntarily made and thus was the product of neither a promise nor a threat.\u201d <em>Hillard, </em>286 Md. at 151, 406 A.2d 415. For the reasons discussed below, we find the common law voluntariness test, at least as appellant has articulated it, inapplicable in cases in which a private party has elicited a confession, which is later offered and received in evidence in a criminal prosecution of the confessor. Instead, we hold that privately-extracted confessions should be viewed like any other hearsay statement, such as a declaration against penal interest, and that the test, therefore, should be whether the statement is inherently trustworthy. See <em>Powell v. State, </em>85 Md.App. 330, 342-43, 583 A.2d 1114, 1120 (1991) (quoting <em>Brady v. State, </em>226 Md. 422, 429, 174 A.2d 167 (1961)) (\u201cTo what extent a confession or admission ... bears the indicia of trustworthiness [and is thus admissible] is a question which we think should be entrusted in the first instance to the sound discretion of the trial judge.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">At the outset, we note that appellant has not directed us to a single decision in which the common law voluntariness test, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>the test he asks us to follow, has been applied to a privately-extracted confession. Indeed, the cases upon which Pappas has relied, <em>Hillard, Kidd, Abbott, </em>and <em>Reynolds, </em>discussed <em>infra, </em>all involved state action. Consequently, the test that he urges this Court to adopt has been ripped from its proper context and presented as though it were a rule applied uniformly to all confessions. Nothing could be further from the truth. In <em>State v. Kidd, </em>281 Md. 32, 35-36, 375 A.2d 1105 (1977), the Court stated that \u201c[f]or a statement to be the free and voluntary act of an accused, it must be obtained without force applied, coercion used, hope held out or promise made <em>on the part of the authorities\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). In <em>Hillard v. State, </em>286 Md. 145, 153, 406 A.2d 415 (1979), the Court found that the defendant\u2019s statement had been involuntarily obtained because \u201cthe <em>officer </em>had promised the defendant help if he would make a statement....\u201d In <em>Abbott v. State, </em>231 Md. 462, 463, 190 A.2d 797 (1963), the question before the Court was whether the defendant\u2019s confession \u201cwas induced by <em>threats of the police </em>to also charge [the defendant] with murder unless he confessed committing armed robbery----\u201d (emphasis added). And finally, in <em>Reynolds v. State, </em>327 Md. 494, 507, 610 A.2d 782 (1992), the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-8\">Maryland has followed the old common law rule, which has seemed to adopt a per se exclusion rule that <em>official </em>promises of leniency to a defendant in custody that induce a confession render the confession inadmissible. In a line of cases reaching back into the last century, this Court has explored challenges to the voluntariness of statements made by suspects who had been offered promises. If a confession \u201chad been induced by any threat of harm, or promise of worldly advantage held out to him by <em>[the interrogating detective </em>], or <em>by his authority, </em>or in his presence and <em>with his sanction, </em>it ought to be excluded.\u201d <em>Nicholson v. State, </em>38 Md. 140, 153 (1873) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">We find it particularly significant that the <em>Reynolds </em>Court added the words, \u201cthe interrogating detective,\u201d to the quotation from <em>Nicholson, </em>ostensibly, to emphasize that the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>mon law exclusionary rule has been applied only in cases of <em>governmental </em>overreaching.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">In short, the fallacy of Pappas\u2019s argument is that, because the voluntariness test inheres in common law rather than the Constitution, it must necessarily apply to private actors. On the contrary, since its inception in <em>Nicholson v. State </em>in 1873, the common law voluntariness doctrine has been viewed as yet another element of the \u201csuperstructure of procedural safeguards\u201d to protect individuals from having government-coerced confessions admitted against them. <em>Jacobs v. State, </em>45 Md.App. 634, 654, 415 A.2d 590, 601 (1980) (citing <em>Jackson v. Denno, </em>378 U.S. 368, 84 S.Ct. 1774, 12 L.Ed.2d 908 (1964)). It reflects the \u201cstrongly felt attitude of our society that important human values are sacrificed where an agency of the government, in the course of securing a conviction, wrings a confession out of an accused against his will....\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>378 U.S. at 386, 84 S.Ct. at 1785. We conclude that statements made to private individuals should not be viewed in the same light as statements made to government officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">Instead, we believe the proper framework for analysis of this case was articulated by Judge Moylan in <em>Jacobs v. State, </em>45 Md.App. 634, 415 A.2d 590 (1980). In <em>Jacobs, </em>three co-defendants were charged with murder. While awaiting trial in the Baltimore City Jail, two of the co-defendants were questioned by Harry Conyers, a social worker assistant at the jail and a notary public. This interrogation was apparently orchestrated at the behest of the third co-defendant\u2019s attorney. Conyers testified that he presented the two defendants with statements that had been typed in advance. The statements were full acknowledgments of guilt. The defendants signed the statements in Conyers\u2019s presence; the statements were notarized and admitted at trial. As in the case at bar, the defendants conceded that State action was not involved. Rather, the trial court based its ruling on the \u201ccommon law of evidence.\u201d Finding that the statements were material, relevant, and competent, the trial court admitted the statements. <em>Id. </em>at 646-47, 415 A.2d 590.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>On appeal, Judge Moylan, writing for the Court, noted initially that the challenged \u201cconfessions\u201d made to private individuals were not confessions at all but, rather, declarations against interest. <em>Id. </em>at 643, 415 A.2d 590. He reasoned that \u201cthe very word \u2018confession\u2019 carries too much highly charged connotative baggage, with its images of police interrogation, of third-degree sessions under naked lightbulbs, of question and answer formats----\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Addressing the admissibility of the statements, Judge Moylan agreed with the trial court\u2019s analysis that the case turned on the \u201cdistinction between the common law of evidence and the constitutional law of evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 653, 415 A.2d 590.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AA4e\">In essence, evidentiary law is a set of sieves and devices that pass through to the fact finder data that is competent, relevant, and material but screen out all data that is incompetent, irrelevant, and immaterial. The common law of evidence is interested fundamentally in the integrity of the fact-finding process ...

The jury may always ask, \u201cWas the utterance truly spontaneous?\u201d; \u201cWas the admission ambiguous?\u201d; \u201cWas the declaration truly against interest?\u201d; \u201cDid the interest threatened outweigh the benefit to be gained?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 656, 415 A.2d 590.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">In support of its position that privately-extracted confessions \u2014 or, declarations against interest \u2014 are admissible, absent some indication that the statement is inherently unreliable, the <em>Jacobs </em>Court cited approvingly two cases, the facts of which are strikingly similar to the case at bar. In <em>Trinkle v. State, </em>259 Ind. 114, 284 N.E.2d 816 (1972), the defendant challenged the admissibility of admissions or confessions made by him to the owner of the carpet he was in the process of stealing. Even though that court found that the statements were the product of \u201cphysical persuasion,\u201d <em>Id. </em>284 N.E.2d at 817, it, nonetheless, found the statements admissible. It noted, 284 N.E.2d at 819:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-6\">While the standard of voluntariness is necessary to prevent police abuse of defendants, the same policy does not exist in circumstances involving private citizens. The factor of control is not present. Where police may lock one up and impose burdens on an accused which necessitates [sic] protection, [private citizens] ... lack[ ] the leverage for abuse which the law enforcement officers possess.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">Similarly, in <em>United States v. Biggerstaff, </em>383 F.2d 675 (4th Cir.1967), the defendant, an assistant vice president of a bank, was taken to a motel room by several of the bank\u2019s officers who suspected that he had defrauded the bank. They interrogated him and threatened him with the loss of his job if he did not make a statement. The defendant confessed and, at trial, argued that the confession was involuntary. The Fourth Circuit affirmed the lower court\u2019s admission of the statement, holding that the conduct of the bank officers did not constitute \u201cgovernment coercion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 680.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">In short, the gravamen of the <em>Jacobs </em>Court\u2019s decision is that confessions taken by private persons lack the element of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>unseemliness that exists when the government extracts a confession and should, therefore, be examined like any other piece of evidence. If the statement manifests sufficient indicia of reliability, then it should be admitted and the jury may accord the statement whatever weight it deems appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">We conclude that the trial court properly applied that principle in deciding to admit Pappas\u2019s confession. The trial court stated that \u201cnot every admission that follows on the heels of a promise or even a threat necessarily is inherently unreliable.\u201d The court then looked at the particular circumstances surrounding Pappas\u2019s statement to determine whether the statement was inherently unreliable. The court found, as a matter of fact, that it was Pappas, and not an Auto Row employee, who initiated the conversation concerning the allegations against him, and it was Pappas who asked what he could do to avoid those charges. The court further found that \u201c[the] meeting [at Jaspers] was as much the product of Mr. Pappas bringing up the topic of prosecution as it was Clark\u2019s or Gentilcore\u2019s,\u201d and \u201c... that whatever discussion was had about prosecution was in the context of the defendant\u2019s having asked what can I do to get out of it, what can I do to avoid it.\u201d \u201cAnd [Pappas] told me just now that he understood from the telephone conversation with Clark that among the things Clark was going to insist on ... to avoid prosecution [was] an account, if you will, regarding what he had allegedly taken.\u201d The court concluded, therefore, that Pappas knew exactly what he was doing when he met with Clark and Gentilcore at Jaspers, that he gave the confession knowingly and voluntarily, and that the confession \u201c... was not the product of such promise or threat as to render it inherently unreliable.\u201d We agree and, accordingly, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; APPELLANT TO PAY COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b683-13\">. According to the record, a third Auto Row employee, Jim Puckett, joined Clark, Gentilcore, and Pappas later in the evening.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b686-8\">. As Judge Moylan noted in his thorough review of Maryland confession law in <em>Hof v. State, </em>97 Md.App. 242, 250, 629 A.2d 1251 (1993), aff'd 337 Md. 581, 655 A.2d 370 (1995), although challenges to confessions may also be based on Article 22 (privilege against self-incrimination) or Article 23 (due process) of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, \"[a]s a practical matter, those provisions are never used.\u201d Moreover, since the Maryland constitutional provisions have been interpreted <em>in pari materia </em>with their federal counterparts, challenges based on the Maryland provisions would succeed or fail precisely as they would under the federal provisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b687-6\">. In holding that coercive police activity is a necessary predicate to finding a confession involuntary under the due process clause of the United States Constitution, the Court noted that \"[t]he most outrageous behavior by a private party seeking to secure evidence does not make that evidence inadmissible.\u201d 479 U.S. at 166, 107 S.Ct. at 521.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
