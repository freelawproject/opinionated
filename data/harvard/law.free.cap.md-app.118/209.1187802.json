Appellant filed a case alleging legal malpractice on the part of appellee. Appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment was granted on the basis of judicial estoppel. The only question presented for our review is whether the circuit court erred in granting that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">The Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">Appellant was involved in an automobile accident that gave rise to the underlying lawsuit. He was stopped at a traffic-control device in Glen Burnie, Maryland. Stopped immediately behind his vehicle was an automobile operated by Stephan Queen. While both appellant and Mr. Queen were stopped, an automobile driven by Rufus Brumfield ran into the rear of the Queen vehicle, thereby driving it into the rear of appellant\u2019s automobile. Appellant retained the services of appellee to initiate an action on his behalf to recover for the damages he suffered in the accident. This action constituted the underlying suit. After the limitations period had expired, however, appellee realized he had named only Mr. Queen as a defendant and had not included the real tort-feasor, Mr. Brumfield, in the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>Appellee, recognizing a potential liability and a potential conflict of interest because of that potential liability, contacted appellant\u2019s proposed new attorney and advised him of his oversight in failing to name Mr. Brumfield as a defendant. The case then was transferred formally to appellant\u2019s current attorney. The parties in the underlying case, Mr. Queen and appellant, thereafter were denied a continuance, which they both desired. In order to circumvent the trial court\u2019s denial of the continuance, the parties agreed appellant would dismiss that case, refile it, and Mr. Queen would not present a limitations defense, thus giving to themselves that which the circuit court had denied them.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">When the suit was refiled by appellant\u2019s current attorney, the complaint made several allegations relevant in the case <em>sub judice. </em>The new complaint again named only Mr. Queen as a defendant. It asserted that Mr. Queen \u201coperated his vehicle in a negligent, reckless and careless manner ..., failing to slow for traffic stopped at a red light\u201d; was \u201creckless, careless and negligent in that he failed to keep a proper lookout\u201d; and he \u201cfailed to take the proper steps so as to avoid the collision.\u201d The concluding paragraph of the complaint stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-5\">The Plaintiff, Joseph Wilson, further alleges that all of his injuries, damages and losses, past, present and prospective, were caused <em>solely </em>by the negligence of the Defendant [Queen], without any negligence or want of due care on the part of the Plaintiff contributing thereto. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">At the time this complaint was filed, appellant\u2019s current attorney was fully aware that Mr. Queen had been stopped behind appellant and that it was Mr. Brumfield who had struck Mr. Queen\u2019s vehicle. Appellant was at that point, however, attempting to obtain a settlement from Mr. Queen\u2019s insurance carrier. Appellant\u2019s counsel believed Mr. Queen\u2019s attorney was not aware that the real tort-feasor was Mr. Brumfield, who could not be sued because appellee had allowed the statute of limitations to expire. In a letter to appellee\u2019s insurance agent before the second suit was filed, appellant\u2019s counsel informed the agent that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>Mr. Wilson\u2019s car was struck by a vehicle which had been struck by a vehicle behind it. The lawsuit was filed against the driver of the middle vehicle only. The statute of limitations ran in November, 1994.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-5\">Further complicating the matter are the following facts: <em>The Defendant\u2019s attorney may be under the mistaken belief that his client was the driver of the car causing the accident. </em>The Defendant\u2019s policy limits are $25,000. The Plaintiff is currently seeking an opinion regarding surgery ..., which would cost in the neighborhood of $40,000 and result in paramount loss of mobility to his neck. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">With full knowledge that Mr. Queen was not the responsible party, and a belief that Mr. Queen\u2019s attorney was unaware of that fact, appellant\u2019s current attorney filed the new case alleging the virtually identical claim of negligence against Mr. Queen. Apparently, it was necessary that the suit be framed in nearly identical terms as the original complaint in order for appellant to maintain his bargaining position with Mr. Queen\u2019s carrier.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Ultimately appellant received a settlement offer of $20,000 from Mr. Queen\u2019s insurance carrier, accepted it, and entered that lawsuit as \u201csettled, paid and satisfied, and dismissed with prejudice.\u201d Appellant then filed the instant case against appellee. In it he alleged in pertinent part that Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>Brumfield had been the negligent party in the accident. The complaint provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-4\">Plaintiff [appellant] learned that Defendant [appellee] had sued the driver of the vehicle which struck Plaintiffs vehicle, but not the driver of the vehicle which struck that vehicle and pushed it into Plaintiffs vehicle. Plaintiff further learned that the statute of limitations had expired on his claim against the driver of the vehicle ultimately responsible for the collision, and that it was too late to assert a claim against that driver.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">We initially note, with serious concern, that appellant, in filing the second suit against Mr. Queen, did so with full knowledge that Mr. Queen had committed no wrong. Moreover, as is apparent from the correspondence we mentioned above, appellant\u2019s counsel believed that Mr. Queen\u2019s counsel was unaware of that fact. Rule 1.2(d) of the Rules of Professional Conduct provides that \u201c[a] lawyer shall not counsel a client to engage, or assist a client, in conduct that the lawyer knows is ... fraudulent.\u201d Rule 3.1 provides: \u201cA lawyer shall not bring ... a proceeding, or assert ... an issue therein, unless there is a basis for doing so that is not frivolous.... \u201d Moreover, Rule 3.3(a), CANDOR TOWARD THE TRIBUNAL, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-6\">(a) A lawyer shall not knowingly:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-7\">(1) make a false statement of material fact or law to a tribunal ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-8\">(4) offer evidence that the lawyer knows to be false.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">Rule 4.1(a)(1) forbids a lawyer from making \u201ca false statement of material fact or law to a third person\u201d in the course of representing a client.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">It clearly appears that the second case against Mr. Queen, which alleged he was negligent, was filed by appellant with full knowledge that Mr. Queen was not in fact negligent. It equally clearly appears that one of the purposes in filing and maintaining that second Queen suit was to maintain a negotiating position with Mr. Queen\u2019s attorney in order to effectuate a cash settlement from a party whom appellant knew was not responsible for the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>We conclude our factual discussion by noting, in summary, that the erroneous and inconsistent averments as to Queen\u2019s negligence, made in the second Queen suit, were not inadvertent but were made intentionally and with full knowledge that they were either inaccurate or false. Moreover, they were made, or maintained, for the purpose of extracting from a non-negligent party compensation for appellant\u2019s alleged injuries, which were caused by a nonparty to that case. We also note, as the cases will indicate, that the purpose of the doctrine of judicial estoppel is <em>to protect the courts, </em>not the parties, from frivolous, false, and misleading allegations being made in judicial proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The Law</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Quoting from <em>Kramer v. Globe Brewing Co., </em>175 Md. 461, 469, 2 A.2d 634 (1938), the Court of Appeals recently reaffirmed the nature of the \u201cconcept of judicial estoppel\u201d when it opined in <em>WinMark Ltd. Partnership v. Miles &amp; Stockbridge, </em>345 Md. 614, 620, 693 A.2d 824 (1997):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-7\">\u201c \u2018If parties in court were permitted to assume inconsistent positions in the trial of their causes, the usefulness of courts of justice would in most cases be paralyzed; the coercive process of the law, available only between those who consented to its exercise, could be set at naught by all. But the rights of all men, honest and dishonest, are in the keeping of the courts, and consistency of proceeding is therefore required of all those who come or are brought before them. It may accordingly be laid down as a broad proposition that one who, without mistake induced by the opposite party, has taken a particular position deliberately in the course of litigation, must act consistently with it; one cannot play fast and loose.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">\n<em>See also Billman, infra.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">In <em>Stone v. Stone, </em>230 Md. 248, 253, 186 A.2d 590 (1962), the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-10\">\u201cThe test [of estoppel by admissions] is not as to whether the admission is true, but as to whether it would be contrary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>to public policy and good morals to allow it to be disputed.\u201d \u201cGenerally speaking, a party will not be permitted to occupy inconsistent positions or to take a position in regard to a matter which is directly contrary to, or inconsistent with, one previously assumed by him, at least where he had, or was chargeable with, full knowledge of the facts and another will be prejudiced by his action.\u201d [Brackets in original, citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">In the case at bar, another person, Mr. Queen, already has been prejudiced by appellant\u2019s prior assertion of false allegations of negligence. Appellant has benefitted to the extent of $20,000 from his improper and admittedly incorrect assertions of negligence on the part of Mr. Queen. Moreover, as we have said, appellant\u2019s present counsel, whose knowledge is chargeable to appellant, knew that the allegations of Queen\u2019s negligence were incorrect. It also is clear that the improper allegations were made intentionally for an improper purpose. Addressing the somewhat similar \u201cclean hands\u201d doctrine, the Court of Appeals noted in <em>Adams v. Manown, </em>328 Md. 463, 474-75, 615 A.2d 611 (1992), that \u201c[t]he clean hands doctrine is not applied for the protection of the parties nor as a punishment to the wrongdoer; rather, the doctrine is intended to protect the courts from having to endorse or reward inequitable conduct.\u201d Although <em>WinMark </em>and <em>Adams </em>were bankruptcy cases, it would appear that the observations of the Court of Appeals, in respect to judicial estoppel and the \u201cclean hands\u201d doctrine, apply to the current case.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">This Court also has commented on judicial estoppel or, in the language of some of the cases, judicial admissions. In <em>Billman v. State of Md. Deposit Ins. Fund Corp., </em>86 Md.App. 1, 585 A.2d 238, <em>cert. denied, </em>323 Md. 1, 590 A.2d 158, and <em>cert. denied, </em>502 U.S. 909, 112 S.Ct. 304, 116 L.Ed.2d 247 (1991), the appellants argued that the case we were reviewing was barred under res judicata principles because the issues in the case could, and should have been, litigated in a prior case. We noted that when attempts had been made in that prior case to consolidate it with another case, the appellants contended that the two cases were \u201c entirely separate and dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>crete transactions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19, 585 A.2d 238. We ultimately stated: \u2018We hold that appellants are estopped from arguing <em>res judicata </em>because it directly contradicts their position in their Opposition to Appellees\u2019 Motion to Consolidate.\u201d <em>Billman, </em>86 Md.App. at 20, 585 A.2d 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">The Court of Appeals noted in the title dispute case of <em>Van Royen v. Lacey, </em>266 Md. 649, 651-652, 296 A.2d 426 (1972), that both in a prior case and in a prior pleading, the appellees had made title claims inconsistent with the positions they were then taking. The Court noted that \u201cestoppel by admission or by pleading\u201d had long been a part of Maryland law. <em>Id. </em>at 651, 296 A.2d 426. It cited, among other cases, <em>Edes v. Garey, </em>46 Md. 24, 41 (1877), in which the Court quoted the even earlier English case of <em>Cave v. Mills, </em>7 H. &amp; W. 927, which provided: \u201c A man shall not be allowed to blow hot and cold, to claim at one time and deny at another.\u2019 \u201d <em>Van Royen, </em>266 Md. at 652. In the mechanic\u2019s lien case of <em>Brunecz v. DiLeo, </em>263 Md. 481, 283 A.2d 606 (1971), Brunecz, a general contractor, brought a previous action against DiLeo to enforce a mechanics\u2019 lien. Brunecz, however, asserted his claim against lot 5, which was the wrong property, instead of lot 6. The Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-6\">Since the DiLeos throughout the proceeding seem to have conceded that the house was built on lot 5, and Mr. DiLeo confirmed this in his sworn deposition, it would appear that they are estopped by record or estopped judicially from challenging the validity of the lien insofar as it applies to lot 5.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 485, 283 A.2d 606 (citations omitted). <em>See also Wilson Bros. v. Cooey, </em>251 Md. 350, 359, 247 A.2d 395 (1968)(noting that where the \u201cLienors\u201d\u2019had acknowledged the senior status of another mortgage in a previous proceeding but had thereafter challenged that mortgage\u2019s validity, the doctrine of estoppel by admission may have been applicable); <em>Mobberly v. Mobberly, </em>60 Md. 376 (1883)(holding that a party who had previously contended in a different suit that he had no defenses under the common law could not later assert that title was in himself by way of adverse possession).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>We have not discovered any Maryland case in which the doctrine of judicial estoppel has estopped a plaintiff from suing (the plaintiffs former attorney) in malpractice because of the improper actions of an attorney the plaintiff later retained to bring the malpractice suit against the defendant. We are cognizant that our affirmance of the lower court\u2019s granting of appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment may well not end the litigation in this matter, although it will end, absent further appellate review, this litigation against appellee. We also are aware that if appellant was unaware of his current attorney\u2019s incorrect assertions in the second Queen suit, our affirmance terminates his cause of action against appellee through no direct fault of his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">We are especially cognizant, however, that the doctrine of judicial estoppel has evolved to protect the courts from just the type of egregious conduct that occurred, on appellant\u2019s behalf, during the second Queen case and the instant case. If we were to hold that the doctrine did not apply under these circumstances, it would be hard to imagine when it would be applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b222-7\">. Had appellant identified Mr. Brumfield in the second complaint, as the party causing the accident and asserted that Mr. Queen's vehicle was the middle vehicle, Mr. Queen\u2019s attorney would likely (hopefully) have realized that his client was not responsible for the accident. With the statute of limitations having expired, it could be expected, although not certain, that had the real facts been disclosed and Mr. Brumfield been made a party defendant, he would have inadvertently, or we presume even intentionally, waived the defense, it would have been extremely unlikely. Therefore, in order to keep Mr. Queen's attorney in the dark as to Mr. Queen's real status in respect to liability, appellant\u2019s current attorney made assertions that, at the least, he knew to be inaccurate. While Mr. Queen apparently did not know that someone else other than himself was liable, he had no limitations defense because his attorney had waived it when he consented to the dismissal and refiling of the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
