Mr. Gallagher\u2019s appeal raises issues regarding the award of indefinite alimony, monetary award, and attorneys\u2019 fees. We shall affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">I. THE FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">Appellant and appellee were married in 1987. At the time of their marriage, appellee had been married twice before and appellant had never been married. Appellant was a professional gambler and investor, and appellee worked as a secretary and sales clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-11\">While married, appellant continued to work as a professional gambler and investor. There also was testimony that appellant acted as a \u201cfacilitator,\u201d one who assists another in placing bets on sporting events. Appellant testified that he made approximately $50,000 per year from personal bets and as a facilitator. He stated he expected a decrease in his income because he would no longer be acting as a \u201cfacilitator,\u201d as appellee\u2019s counsel had informed him that such conduct was illegal. Appellee continued to work during the marriage and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>at the time of the divorce, had a part-time job from which she earned $12,827 per year.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Appellee introduced, over appellant\u2019s objection, the testimony of Regis Burke, a Certified Public Accountant. Mr. Burke was offered as an expert witness in the areas of taxation, accounting, finance, and asset valuation and was accepted as an expert by the court. Appellant never objected to Mr. Burke\u2019s credentials as an expert witness; appellee\u2019s objection related solely to the summaries that were prepared by the expert witness from the financial documentation and testimony given by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Mr. Burke testified extensively regarding the summaries he had prepared relative to appellant\u2019s cash flow and assets. He testified that appellant \u201cspent well in excess of what he reported as income in each given year.\u201d For example, Mr. Burke testified that in 1995, appellant spent approximately $31,375 more than his reported income. Mr. Burke testified that some of his assets, however, were cashed in during that time period and that this would have given appellant additional liquidity. Mr. Burke testified that this added liquidity could have been used to pay for the personal expenditures that exceeded his income, but he could not make a determination as to \u201cwhat proportion was spent on living expenses and what proportion was rolled over into an investment account.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">In the court\u2019s memorandum opinion, it granted appellee an absolute divorce on the grounds of adultery. The court also determined the parties\u2019 marital and non-marital property and valued that property. The court determined the parties\u2019 respective incomes and ultimately made a monetary award. It noted it was difficult \u201cto determine precisely Mr. Gallagher\u2019s income given the nature of his business\u201d and that \u201c[sjeveral exhibits were introduced in an attempt to persuade the Court that Mr. Gallagher\u2019s income exceeds that which is reported on his tax returns.\u201d The court also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-8\">Mr. Gallagher testified that in the past, his personal wagering produced a $50,000 per year net income, but presently, the amount produced is only $25,000. He further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>testified that his present income from \u201cfacilitating\u201d is $30,-000 per year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-5\">The Court is persuaded that Mr. Gallagher has net income from personal wagering and \u201cfacilitating\u201d in excess of $80,000 per year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-6\">Mr. Gallagher is approaching social security benefits eligibility. However, considering the nature of his business, it is not likely he will be forced to retire any time soon, barring any \u201cunforseen legal intervention.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-7\">Mr. Gallagher lists his monthly personal living expenditures at $3630.00. Ms. Gallagher attacks this figure, arguing that it is artificially low to conform to his grossly understated earnings. [Footnote omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">After considering the factors set forth in section 8-205 of the Family Law Article, the court granted appellee a monetary award of $175,000. In making this award, the court noted: 1) the \u201cmarriage came to an end because of the adultery committed by Mr. Gallagher;\u201d 2) \u201cMs. Gallagher\u2019s physical health is more limiting than Mr. Gallagher\u2019s physical health;\u201d 3) \u201c[w]hen the parties lived together, Mr. Gallagher was the major monetary contributor while Ms. Gallagher used her earnings for her personal needs and desires;\u201d 4) Ms. Gallagher relinquished her full-time employment at the insistence of Mr. Gallagher; and 5) \u201c[b]oth parties made some nonmonetary contributions, mainly, the important contribution of companionship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">The trial court also awarded appellee indefinite alimony in the amount of $1,500 per month. In doing so, the court acknowledged that both parties were accustomed to a high standard of living. The court also noted that, following the monetary award, appellee would have $380,778 in assets while Mr. Gallagher would hold assets totaling $267,117. It noted appellee\u2019s income was $19,937 and her investment income would increase due to the monetary award while appellant\u2019s would decline. The trial court further stated: \u201cHowever, there is every reason to believe, and the court so finds, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>Mr. Gallagher\u2019s earned income from his business will continue to be substantially greater than that of Ms. Gallagher.\u201d It also found that the \u201crespective living standards of the parties will be unconscionably disparate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Finally, the court granted appellee attorneys\u2019 fees of $20,-684.95. It specified that appellee had substantial justification for prosecuting the proceeding and noted the financial resources of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">At a later hearing on April 23, 1997, after the judgment of divorce was entered and this appeal taken, appellee\u2019s counsel requested that the court reduce the marital award and counsel fees to judgment. Appellant\u2019s counsel asserted that the court lacked jurisdiction to do so because he had filed an appeal to this Court and such a filing had divested the trial court of jurisdiction. The court reduced the marital award to judgment, finding that doing so was collateral to the initial judgment which was appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">Appellant presents three questions on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">I. Did the circuit court err in making a monetary award and granting indefinite alimony?</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">II. Did the circuit court err in granting an award of attorney fees and other costs to Ms. Levine [appellee\u2019s former counsel]?</p>\n<p id=\"b584-10\">III. Did the circuit court have jurisdiction to reduce the monetary award to judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b584-11\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b584-12\">In the resolution of this case, we shall examine A) the monetary award; B) the award of alimony; C) the award of counsel fees; and D) the reduction of the monetary award and counsel fees to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-13\">A. Monetary Award</p>\n<p id=\"b584-14\">Appellant\u2019s primary assignment of error concerning the monetary award relates to the trial court\u2019s determination that his income was approximately $80,000 per year. He gives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>multiple reasons as to why the trial court erred in its determination of his then current income and argues that this error resulted in an exorbitant monetary award.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">We note initially that appellant has not raised any contention as to the characterization and valuation of the marital property. His only argument relates to his income.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Before addressing appellant\u2019s various arguments, we shall state the law applicable to the granting of a monetary award. Maryland law requires that the trial court undertake a three-step process prior to granting a monetary award:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AtL\">(1) the trial court must initially characterize all property owned by the parties, however titled, as either marital or nonmarital; (2) the court shall then determine the value of all marital property; and, finally, (3) the court may then make a monetary award as an adjustment of the parties\u2019 equities and rights in the marital property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-7\"><em>Strauss v. Strauss, </em>101 Md.App. 490, 501, 647 A.2d 818 (1994) (citations omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>337 Md. 90, 651 A.2d 855 (1995); <em>see also </em>Md.Code (1984, 1991 Repl-Vol, 1997 Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 8-203 to 8-205 of the Family Law Article (FL). With respect to this last step in the process, the court must consider the following factors:</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">(1) the contributions, monetary and nonmonetary, of each party to the well-being of the family;</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">(2) the value of all property interests of each party;</p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">(3) the economic circumstances of each party at the time the award is to be made;</p>\n<p id=\"b585-11\">(4) the circumstances that contributed to the estrangement of the parties;</p>\n<p id=\"b585-12\">(5) the duration of the marriage;</p>\n<p id=\"b585-13\">(6) the age of each party;</p>\n<p id=\"b585-14\">(7) the physical and mental condition of each party;</p>\n<p id=\"b585-15\">(8) how and when specific marital property or interest in the pension, retirement, profit sharing, or deferred compensation plan, was acquired, including the effort expended by each party in accumulating the marital property or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>interest in the pension, retirement, profit sharing, or deferred compensation plan, or both;</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">(9) the contribution by either party of property described in \u00a7 8-201(e)(3) of this subtitle to the acquisition of real property held by the parties as tenants by the entirety;</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">(10) any award of alimony and any award or other provision that the court has made with respect to family use personal property or the family home; and</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">(11) any other factor that the court considers necessary or appropriate to consider in order to arrive at a fair and equitable monetary award or transfer of an interest in the pension, retirement, profit sharing, or deferred compensation plan, or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">FL \u00a7 8-205(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">An appellate court, when an action has been tried without a jury, \u201cwill not set aside the judgment of the trial court on the evidence unless clearly erroneous, and will give due regard to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d Md.Rule 8-131(c).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-9\">The decision whether to grant a monetary award is generally within the sound discretion of the trial court. Nevertheless, even with respect to a discretionary matter, a trial court must exercise its discretion in accordance with correct legal standards.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-10\">It is important that courts not lose sight of th[e] history and purpose [of the equitable distribution statute] when making decisions about marital property. The \u201cfunction [of the monetary award] is to provide a means for the adjustment of inequities that may result from distribution of certain property in accordance with the dictates of title.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AGY\"><em>Alston v. Alston, </em>331 Md. 496, 504-06, 629 A.2d 70 (1993) (citations omitted) (footnotes omitted) (some alterations in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-11\">We shall next examine appellant\u2019s specific allegations of error regarding the trial court\u2019s grant of a monetary award. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>We note all of appellant\u2019s assertions of error relate to his and appellee\u2019s income, factors two and three of section 8 \u2014 205(b) of the Family Law Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">1. Overestimation of Income Based on Condominium Sale</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Appellant argues the court erred in calculating his income because it failed to consider that the sale of his West Palm beach condominium resulted in a loss. In support of this argument, appellant notes the court stated: \u201cPlaintiff exhibit 23 reveals that in 1995, he had a total income of $48,633 and net proceeds from the sale of stock in the amount of $117,702.\u201d He argues that all of the $117,702 did not come from the sale of stock and that some of that amount came from the sale of his West Palm Beach home. The sale of this home, however, created a loss, as reflected on his tax return.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">We believe that whether the $117,702 came from the sale of stock or from the sale of the condominium is irrelevant. While the court may have misspoken as to the amount and the nature of net proceeds that resulted from the two sales, it is clear the court did not consider these proceeds in setting appellant\u2019s income. In making a determination as to appellant\u2019s income, the court merely stated it was persuaded \u201cthat Mr. Gallagher has net income from personal wagering and \u2018facilitating\u2019 in excess of $80,000 per year.\u201d The trial court did not refer to any sales of assets in setting appellant\u2019s then current income. Accordingly, any argument relating to the $117,702 is not relative to the court\u2019s determination of income. Additionally, appellant alleges no error in regard to his assets and characterization of those assets as marital or nonmarital property.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">2. Overestimation of income based on stock sales</p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">Appellant makes similar arguments as those made above relative to the sale of the condominium. He asserts the court erred in stating that appellant had net proceeds from the sale of stock in the amount of $117,702 because this amount resulted from both the sale of stock and the sale of the condominium. For the reasons noted above, we need not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>address this argument. As we stated, the court did not consider the $117,702 in setting appellant\u2019s income.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">3. Testimony of Mr. Burke</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">Appellant next challenges the testimony of appellee\u2019s expert, Mr. Burke. Appellant presents a two-fold argument; first he asserts that Mr. Burke did not testify as an expert witness and second, that Mr. Burke\u2019s testimony was speculative.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">As initially noted, appellant never objected at trial to Mr. Burke\u2019s qualifications. In fact, appellant did not elect to voir dire the witness prior to his testimony. Appellant\u2019s sole objection at trial related to the introduction of certain reports prepared by the expert that were used to explain the assets, cash flow, and income of appellant. As to these reports, appellant\u2019s counsel argued they were inadmissible because they had not been presented to him prior to trial; appellant did not challenge the expert witness\u2019 testimony. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s argument is not preserved for our review. <em>See </em>Md.Rule 8-131(a). Nevertheless, appellant\u2019s arguments are without merit. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">As to his first argument, appellant asserts that the trial court stated: \u201c \u2018[tjurns out [Mr. Burke] is <em>only a fact witness. He hasn\u2019t become one who gave an opinion as an expertf.]\u2019 </em>\u201d Appellant directs this Court to page 860 of the extract for this statement. We have been unable to discern whether this statement was made by the trial court because the extract does not contain a page 860. We believe, however, the testimony of Mr. Burke was proper expert witness testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">Although the court may have misstated that Mr. Burke did not testify as an expert witness, we believe his testimony was qualified as such. The numerous, complex, financial transactions in which appellant was involved required that an expert, such as a Certified Public Accountant, be consulted in order to determine the nature and extent of appellant\u2019s income and expenditures. It is clear that Mr. Burke testified as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>appellant\u2019s income and expenditures and traced certain assets held in various bank accounts. He also took certain statements and income tax records and drew from them conclusions. This is precisely what experts do. Maryland Rule 5-702 provides: \u201cExpert testimony may be admitted ... if the court determines that the testimony will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\u201d Mr. Burke\u2019s testimony clearly did so in the instant case. Accordingly, we believe Mr. Burke properly testified as an expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">As to the speculative nature of Mr. Burke\u2019s testimony, the transcript clearly shows Mr. Burke was careful to draw only certain conclusions from the information he obtained. For example, Mr. Burke testified that appellant spent approximately $81,375 more than his income in 1995. The witness, however, carefully noted that he could not determine where this additional money may have come from and indicated that it could have come from proceeds that were obtained from the sale of other assets during that year. There are many other instances where the witness refused to draw speculative conclusions and indicated merely what the accounts and records showed. We do not believe that the expert\u2019s testimony was unfairly speculative. We also note that the court made no mention of this testimony when determining appellant\u2019s income. Accordingly, the trial court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">4. Facilitating Income</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Appellant lastly asserts, as to the monetary award, that the trial court erred in determining his income because it considered income from facilitating, an endeavor he was not engaged in at the time of the granting of the marital award.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">Appellant testified that he was facilitating during the first few months of 1996. While he clearly denied facilitating at the time of the trial, the court was not required to accept his testimony. Under Maryland Rule 8-131(c), we shall \u201cnot set aside the judgment of the trial court on the evidence unless clearly erroneous, and will give due regard to the opportunity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d We stated in <em>Hollander v. Hollander, </em>89 Md.App. 156, 175, 597 A.2d 1012 (1991) (quoting <em>Shapiro v. Chapman, </em>70 Md.App. 307, 318, 520 A.2d 1330 (1987)), that \u201c \u2018[t]he trier of fact is not bound to accept the testimony of any witness even if it is uncontradicted.\u2019 \u201d Additionally, appellee testified that the income reported on the parties\u2019 tax returns did not adequately reflect the income appellant earned from his gambling activities. Based on all this evidence, the court did not err in determining appellant\u2019s income or determining a marital award was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">B. Indefinite Alimony Award</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Appellant also presents numerous arguments relating to- the trial court\u2019s grant of indefinite alimony to appellee. A trial court may grant indefinite alimony if it finds that:</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">(1) due to age, illness,' infirmity, or disability, the party seeking alimony cannot reasonably be expected to make substantial progress toward becoming self-supporting; or</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">(2) even after the party seeking alimo\u00f1y will have made as much progress toward becoming self-supporting as can reasonably be expected, the respective standards of living of the parties will be unconscionably disparate.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">FL \u00a7 ll-106(e). In order to make a fair and equitable alimony award, the court considers:</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">(1) the ability of the party seeking alimony to be wholly or partly self-supporiing;</p>\n<p id=\"b590-10\">(2) the time necessary for the party seeking alimony to gain sufficient education or training to enable that party to find suitable employment;</p>\n<p id=\"b590-11\">(3) the standard of living that the parties established during their marriage;</p>\n<p id=\"b590-12\">(4) the duration of the marriage;</p>\n<p id=\"b590-13\">(5) the contributions, monetary and nonmonetary, of each party to the well-being of the family;</p>\n<p id=\"b590-14\">(6) the circumstances that contributed to the estrangement of the parties;</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>(7) the age of each party;</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">(8) the physical and mental condition of each party;</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">(9) the ability of the party from whom alimony is sought to meet that party\u2019s needs while meeting the needs of the party seeking alimony;</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">(10) any agreement between the parties;</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">(11) the financial needs and financial resources of each party, including:</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">(i) all income and assets, including property that does not produce income;</p>\n<p id=\"b591-10\">(ii) any award made under \u00a7\u00a7 8-205 and 8-208 of this article;</p>\n<p id=\"b591-11\">(iii) the nature and amount of the financial obligations of each party; and</p>\n<p id=\"b591-12\">(iv) the right of each party to receive retirement benefits; and</p>\n<p id=\"b591-13\">(12) whether the award would cause a spouse who is a resident of a related institution as defined in \u00a7 19-301 of the Health \u2014 General Article and from whom alimony is sought to become eligible for medical assistance earlier than would otherwise occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-14\">FL \u00a7 ll-106(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-15\">We shall address appellant\u2019s contentions individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-16\">1. Income from Facilitating</p>\n<p id=\"b591-17\">Appellant makes numerous interesting arguments regarding his income from facilitating as it relates to the alimony award. Appellant essentially asserts that by including the money earned from facilitating in determining his total income, the trial court has required him to continue in this illegal occupation.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-18\">Appellant misperceives the trial court\u2019s order in this case. As we noted above, section ll~106(b)(ll) requires the trial court to consider the financial resources of a party before granting alimony. In the trial court\u2019s order, it attributed to appellant approximately $80,000 in income during the year. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>Appellant asserts that this amount includes income from facilitating and that he has stopped this type of activity, so his income cannot be $80,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">As we perceive the trial court\u2019s order, the court obviously believed that appellant continued facilitating despite his contentions that he no longer engaged in this type of activity. The trial court makes credibility determinations, and in this case evidently made a determination that appellant was not credible. The trial court did not require that appellant remain in this type of work; it found that appellant continued to engage in this type of activity. If appellant is able to show at a later point in time that he no longer engages in facilitating, this may constitute a circumstance allowing for a modification in the alimony award. Unfortunately for appellant, he was not able to persuade the trial court that he was not engaged in such activity at the time of trial, and it was from his current activities that the court determined appellant\u2019s income. Accordingly, the trial court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">2. Potential Income</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">Appellant asserts the trial court, in its determination of the alimony award, considered his potential income, not his actual income. As we have explained above, appellant did not persuade the court that he no longer was engaged in facilitating. The court took into consideration actual income from this activity and appellant\u2019s earnings from his gambling activities. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s assertion that the court did not determine his actual income is inaccurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">3. Application of \u00a7 11-106</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">Appellant\u2019s last assertion of error in regard to the alimony award relates to the trial court\u2019s application of section 11-106 of the Family Law Article. He asserts numerous errors in the application of the factors listed in section 11-106. Before addressing appellant\u2019s contentions, we shall examine the trial court\u2019s order in regard to the alimony award. The order provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b593-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>The parties enjoyed a fairly high standard of living. They dined out regularly and traveled frequently. Considering the monetary award made to Ms. Gallagher, she will have assets totaling $380,778. Mr. Gallagher will have assets of $267,117.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">Ms. Gallagher\u2019s 1995 total income was $19,937. Her investment income will increase by virtue of the monetary award. On the other hand, Mr. Gallagher\u2019s investment income will decline. However, there is every reason to believe, and the court so finds, that Mr. Gallagher\u2019s earned income from his business will continue to be substantially greater than that of Ms. Gallagher.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">The court is persuaded that Ms. Gallagher can again become employed but because of her health, age, education level and lack of employment skills beyond sales and secretarial, she will not have an income level sufficient to maintain a standard of living similar to that enjoyed during the marriage. Under these circumstances, the court is persuaded that the respective living standards of the parties will be unconscionably disparate.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">There can be no doubt that Mr. Gallagher can meet the needs of Ms. Gallagher from his business. The Court has determined his income to be in excess of $80,000 per year, more than that is only limited by his efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">Therefore, indefinite alimony is awarded in the amount of $1,500 per month. [Footnotes omitted.]</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">a. Presumption against indefinite alimony</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">Appellant correctly notes that the law favors rehabilitative alimony over indefinite alimony. <em>See Tracey v. Tracey, </em>328 Md. 380, 391, 614 A.2d 590 (1992). In <em>Tracey, </em>the Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-10\">[T]he purpose of alimony is not to provide a lifetime pension, but where practicable to ease the transition for the parties from the joint married state to their new status as single people living apart.... The concept of alimony as a life-long support enabling the dependent spouse to maintain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>an accustomed standard of living has largely been superseded by the view that the dependent spouse should be required to become self-supporting, even though that might result in a reduced standard of living.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">328 Md. at 391, 614 A.2d 590.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">The court, however, may award indefinite alimony if</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">(1) due to age, illness, infirmity, or disability, the party seeking alimony cannot reasonably be expected to make substantial progress toward becoming self-supporting; or</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">(2) even after the party seeking alimony will have made as much progress toward becoming self-supporting as can reasonably be expected, the respective standards of living of the parties will be unconscionably disparate.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">FL \u00a7 ll-106(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">It is clear the court made both of the findings contained in section ll-106(c), even though only one such finding is required in order to grant indefinite alimony. The court was \u201cpersuaded, that Ms. Gallagher can again become employed but because of her health, age, education level and lack of employment skills beyond sales and secretarial, she will not have an income level sufficient to maintain a standard of living similar to that enjoyed during the marriage.\u201d In addition, the court noted that despite the marital award, \u201cthe respective living standards of the parties will be unconscionably disparate.\u201d We cannot say that these determinations were clearly erroneous. Accordingly, the court had authority to award indefinite alimony based on its findings and did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-11\">b. Appellee\u2019s Income</p>\n<p id=\"b594-12\">Appellant next asserts the trial court erred because it \u201cnever determined with any specificity [appellee\u2019s] expected future earnings, and failed altogether to quantify her expected future income from other sources.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-13\">With respect to appellee\u2019s income level, the court explicitly noted that appellee lacked marketable employment skills and found that the most she probably could earn was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>same amount she earned during the previous year. This amount was found to be approximately $12,827 in wages and investment income of approximately $7,110 for a total of $19,937. We believe this finding was sufficiently specific with respect to appellee\u2019s income.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">Appellant also argues the court failed to quantify appellee\u2019s future earnings, especially in light of the marital award granted by the court. He cites <em>Newman v. Newman, </em>71 Md.App. 670, 527 A.2d 61 (1987), and <em>Rosenberg v. Rosenberg, </em>64 Md.App. 487, 497 A.2d 485, <em>cert. denied, </em>305 Md. 107, 501 A.2d 845 (1985), in support of his contention. More specifically, appellant faults the trial court for failing to assign a numerical value to any income that may be generated from the marital award.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">We do not believe <em>Newman </em>and <em>Rosenberg </em>require that the trial court assign a numerical value to income that may be earned from a marital award. In both of those cases, the trial court failed to consider any income that could have been generated by the marital award in setting the amount of alimony. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the trial court clearly considered the effect of the marital award on appellee\u2019s income. It stated: \u201cHer investment income will increase by virtue of the monetary award. On the other hand, Mr. Gallagher\u2019s investment income will decline.\u201d Accordingly, appellant\u2019s claim is without merit as the court clearly addressed the effect of the monetary award prior to granting alimony to appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">c. Other \u00a7 ll-106(b) Factors</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">In addition to the monetary factors discussed above, appellant asserts the court failed to consider other factors such as the length of marriage and other equitable considerations in granting appellee indefinite alimony. We stated in <em>Hollander, </em>89 Md.App. at 176, 597 A.2d 1012:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-8\">We cannot reverse the judgment of the trial judge unless we conclude his findings were clearly erroneous or that in awarding alimony, he abused his discretion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>The trial judge ... is not required to use a formal \u201cchecklist\u201d but may declare an award for alimony in any way that shows consideration of the necessary factors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">The trial court, in its written memorandum, clearly considered all of the relevant factors in section ll-106(b) of the Family Law Article in granting the indefinite alimony award. We cannot say it abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">C. Counsel Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">Section 11-110 of the Family Law Article gives the court the authority to award \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d expenses associated with a proceeding for alimony. Before awarding a party expenses, the court must consider \u201c(1) the financial resources and financial needs of both parties; and (2) whether there was substantial justification for prosecuting or defending the proceeding.\u201d FL \u00a7 ll-110(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">In its memorandum, the trial court, granting appellee reasonable and necessary expenses, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-9\">Clearly, there was substantial justification for Ms. Gallagher to prosecute this proceeding. She met with considerable resistance along the way from Mr. Gallagher. She has proven her claim of adultery and persuaded the court on the issue of monetary award and alimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-10\">The court has considered the testimony of the parties and has examined the exhibits, particularly Plaintiff exhibit 18. The work and expenses required to properly prosecute this case were reasonably necessary. The fees charged by the lawyers and other professionals are reasonable for the work done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-11\">The court again considers the financial resources of the parties to determine how much of these expenses can be reasonably born[e] by each party. Considering the monetary award, the award of alimony, the assets of the parties, and the respective income of the parties, Mr. Gallagher is ordered to pay the sum of $25,000 toward Ms. Gallagher\u2019s expenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>Appellant asserts that many of the fees associated with the prosecution of this case by appellee were unjustified. He notes the deposition of Ms. Kelly Carney, appellant\u2019s alleged mistress, the private investigator fees, the testimony of Mr. Burke, appellee\u2019s expert financial witness, and the counsel fees of appellee\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">As is clear from the trial court\u2019s memorandum opinion, the court considered the two requisite factors of section ll-110(c) of the Family Law Article. Appellant\u2019s only argument relates to the reasonableness of such fees. As to the deposition of Ms. Carney and the investigator fees, the information gathered from these sources, although much was not used at trial, was necessary to establish appellee\u2019s ground for divorce. As we indicated previously in this opinion, Mr. Burke\u2019s expert testimony was relevant and helpful in determining appellant\u2019s assets, income, and expenditures. Finally, as to the counsel fees, we stated in <em>Hollander </em>that \u201ca detailed list of expenses is not necessary. \u2018A chancellor may well be able to appraise the value of an attorney\u2019s services on the basis of the record and his own knowledge and experience without an account of the number of hours spent by the attorney.\u2019 \u201d 89 Md.App. at 177-78, 597 A.2d 1012 (quoting <em>Holston v. Holston, </em>58 Md.App. 308, 326, 473 A.2d 459, cert. <em>denied, </em>300 Md. 484, 479 A.2d 372 (1984)). We, therefore, conclude that the granting of expenses for the prosecution of the alimony claim properly were awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">D. Reduction of Monetary Award and Fees to Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Appellant\u2019s last assertion of error relates to the entry of a judgment for the monetary award in favor of appellee and for counsel fees in favor of appellee\u2019s former attorney by the circuit court during a later hearing. Appellant avers the court was without authority to reduce these amounts to judgment because he had entered a Notice of Appeal to this Court that deprived the circuit court of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">With respect to the monetary award, the trial court stated in its memorandum opinion and order that the amount was \u201cpayable in cash, in two equal installments, due on December <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>31, 1996 and February 28, 1997.\u201d In regard to the necessary fees and expenses, the court stated that \u201c[t]he sum of $20,-684.95 is to be paid directly to Ms. Gallagher\u2019s attorney within thirty days hereof, and the balance of $4,315.05 shall be paid directly to Ms. Gallagher not later than December 31, 1996.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ALq\">At an April 24, 1997 hearing, the trial court reduced the monetary award and the attorney\u2019s fees to judgment. Appellant asserts the court was without jurisdiction to do so because he had filed a notice of appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Section 8-205(c) of the Family Law Article provides that \u201c[t]he court may reduce to a judgment any monetary award made under this section, to the extent that any part of the award is due and owing.\u201d Likewise, section 11 \u2014 110(f) of the Family Law Article states: \u201cAs to any amount awarded for counsel fees, the court may: (1) order that the amount awarded be paid directly to the lawyer; and (2) enter judgment in favor of the lawyer.\u201d As is clear, the trial court has the authority to reduce to judgment any monetary award due and owing and attorney\u2019s fees to be paid directly to the lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">The interesting issue presented by appellant is whether the trial court, after a notice of appeal has been filed, has the authority to reduce to judgment a marital award that becomes due and owing at some point after the initial order providing for the monetary award was granted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">In <em>McClayton v. McClayton, </em>68 Md.App. 615, 515 A.2d 231 (1986), we examined the phrase \u201cdue and owing\u201d as used in present section 8-205(e) of the Family Law Article. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-8\">A monetary award, unlike a judgment at law, is not based upon any antecedent debt or obligation, but is a present adjustment of equities existing at the time of the award. In granting such an award, the chancellor\u2019s discretion extends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>not only to the amount of the award but also the method of payment. The entire award can be made immediately due and payable or all/or part of it can be made payable in the future. Subsection [ (c) ] of \u00a7 8-205 authorizes the court to reduce to a judgment any monetary award granted under \u00a7 8-205(a), but only \u201cto the extent that any part of the award is due and owing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-5\">Senate Bill 604 (1978) originally contained a provision (\u00a7 3-6A-05(c)) that a monetary award <em>\u201cshall </em>constitute a judgment.\u201d That language was stricken, however, and the current language of \u00a7 8 \u2014 205[ (c) ] was substituted for it. 1978 Md. Laws, ch. 794. This change indicates that the Legislature intended that only those decrees for monetary awards then due and owing in the sense of then immediately payable could be reduced to judgments under \u00a7 8-205[ (c) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqo\"><em>Id. </em>at 622-24, 515 A.2d 231 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Although <em>McClayton </em>gives us insight as to whether an initial monetary award constitutes a final judgment, it does not answer whether the court has the authority to reduce to judgment a monetary award due and owing after a notice of appeal has been filed. Both parties cite to <em>Kirsner v. Edelmann, </em>65 Md.App. 185, 192-93, 499 A.2d 1313 (1985), in which we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-7\">It is well settled that \u201c[ajfter an appeal has been perfected, [the appellate court] is vested with the exclusive power and jurisdiction <em>over the subject matter </em>of the proceedings, and the authority and control of the lower court with reference thereto is suspended.\u201d The lower court may act only with respect to collateral or independent matters not relating to the subject [matter] of the appeal. [Citations omitted; brackets in original].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">Although the parties both agree on the applicability of this general rule, they disagree as to its effect on this case. Appellant asserts the judgment entered on April 24,1997, was not collateral to the subject matter of the appeal. Appellee asserts that the subsequent judgment was collateral to the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>The subject matter of this appeal, as it relates to this issue, is the grant of the monetary award, the amount of the monetary award, and the award of litigation expenses. The later trial court proceeding and judgment did not concern the amount or the award of the monetary award, or the amount or the award of litigation expenses. The proceedings at issue involved whether appellant had paid the monetary award and litigation expenses as directed by the trial court\u2019s previous order. These amounts, not having been paid by appellant, caused a judgment to be entered against him. As we perceive this case, the subsequent reduction of the monetary award and counsel fees to judgment was a collateral matter. Accordingly, the trial court properly reduced to judgment the monetary award then due and owing and the counsel fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">We affirm the judgment of the trial court that granted appellee a monetary award, indefinite alimony, and counsel fees. We likewise affirm the trial court\u2019s reduction of the monetary award and counsel fees to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b598-9\">. It seems appellant would agree that the trial court would have the authority to reduce to judgment a marital award so long as the judgment was entered prior to the notice of appeal. He is concerned only with the court reducing a monetary award to judgment after the filing of a notice of appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
