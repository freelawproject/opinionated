THE STATE BAR OF CALIFORNIA et al., Respondents.</parties>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b146-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>John E.

He charges that although he passed the examination with a higher grade than 70 per cent, the board \u201carbitrarily and capriciously\u201d reduced this to below a passing mark and refused to certify his name for admission to the bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">In support of his charge against the committee, the petitioner alleges that he \u201csuccessfully completed the law course\u201d of the University of Michigan in 1914, and also \u201csuccessfully completed\u201d a post graduate course in legal instruction at Southwestern University, Los Angeles. He also states, generally, that he has the legal learning and ability of the average candidate who successfully passes the bar examination of the State of California. More specifically, he alleges that he has been a commissioned officer in the armed forces of the United States and studied and passed the subject of military law, and that he has practiced before the Industrial Accident Commission with great success.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">In a supplemental petition, the petitioner has set out in full the questions asked of him, the answers given, and the grade assigned to each. These grades amount, in the aggregate, to 940 points as against the 1820 required to pass. In criticism of such marking, there is presented a certificate of Charles E. MeGinniss that he has read the petitioner\u2019s papers and has assigned to his answers a total of 2,121 grade points, which is above the passing grade. Mr. MeGinniss states that he is a member of the California bar, that he has been a law editor and professor of law, and that in his opinion the petitioner \u201cis educationally qualified to practice law in the State of California and elsewhere. \u2019\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>By their return, the respondents deny that the petitioner\u2019s answers were arbitrarily or capriciously graded. It specifically alleges that his answers to the questions asked of him were carefully, fully and completely read and graded by highly skilled readers who were chosen for their ability to do this work, and it sets forth in detail the methods under which the examination taken by the petitioner was carried on. It also alleges that the records of the committee show that the petitioner has taken eight examinations since the year 1926, and has passed none of them although each examination was determined on its own merits. It also denies that the petitioner successfully completed the regular academic course of law at the University of Michigan, asserting that although the petitioner was at one time a student there, he did not pass a sufficient number of subjects to entitle him to a degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">The allegations of the petitioner amount to nothing more than a general statement that his answers entitle him to a passing grade notwithstanding the grade given his papers by the Committee of Bar Examiners. He makes no charge of fraud, imposition or coercion, and does not assert that he was denied a fair opportunity to take the examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Such a petition falls far short of the requirements laid down by this court in a proceeding to review the examinations given by the committee in 1933. At that time it restated the rule which had been adopted in a previous consideration of the question as follows: \u201cThe attitude of this court is that if any dissatisfied applicant can show that he was denied passage of the state bar examinations through fraud, imposition, or coercion, or that in any other manner he was prevented from a fair opportunity to take the examinations, this court will be willing to listen to his complaint. Inability to pass the examinations, which are successfully passed by other applicants, will, of course, not be inquired into by the court. Also, as you have no doubt found out, one\u2019s general qualifications are not to be substituted for the requisite knowledge of law which one must possess in order to be admitted into the legal profession. \u2019 \u2019 <em>(In re Admission to Practice Law, </em>1 Cal.

J., Traynor, J., and Spence, J., <em>pro tem., </em>concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b148-7\">HOUSER, J., Dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"Azg\">I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">Section 6060 of the Business and Professions Code contains various provisions which relate to the qualifications necessary to be possessed by applicants for admission to practice law in this state, which provisions, among others, include the following requirements: That such applicants shall \u201cBefore beginning the study of law, have completed at least two years of college work or have reached the age of twenty-five years\u201d; shall have either \u201cGraduated from a law school accredited by the examining committee requiring substantially the full time of its students for three years . . . ; Graduated from a law school accredited by the examining committee requiring a part only of its students\u2019 time for four years . . . ; Studied law diligently and in good faith for at least four years . . . ; [and] Have passed a final bar examination given by the examining committee\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">The sub-title to section 6066 of the same code is \u201cAppeal to Supreme Court\u201d. The language of that section is as follows: \u201cAny person refused certification to the Supreme Court for admission to practice may have the action of the board, or of any committee authorized by the board to make a determination on its behalf, pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, <em>reviewed by the Supreme Court, </em>in accordance with the <em>procedure </em>prescribed by the court.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">From the title of section 6066 and the language employed jn_ said section, it is clearly apparent that in enacting such provision it was the intention of the legislature to give to a rejected applicant for admission the right to <em>\u201cAppeal </em>to [the] Supreme Court\u201d from a \u201cdetermination\u201d or \u201caction of the board, or of any committee authorized by the board to make a determination on its behalf\u201d,\u2014and thereupon to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>have such \u201cdetermination\u201d or \u201caction . . . <em>revieived </em>by the Supreme Court\u201d. And, in that connection, it would seem extremely unlikely that by such enactment the legislature ever contemplated anything other than that on the taking of such an appeal the Supreme Court, by and through the members thereof, would actually personally <em>review </em>the \u201cdetermination\u201d or \u201caction\u201d by the board of governors, or its examining committee, by a genuine and painstaking re-examination of the several questions which theretofore had been propounded to the applicant, as well as the respective answers which had been made by the applicant to such questions,\u2014and thereupon, as an independent action by the court, reach a conclusion on the question whether in truth and in fact the applicant was <em>entitled </em>to be admitted to practice law in this state. In my opinion, the fact that by the terms of the statute the Supreme Court is authorized to prescribe the <em>\u201cprocedure\u201d </em>to be followed in such a matter cannot affect the <em>substantive </em>right that is conferred upon the applicant to have his examination papers <em>\u201creviewed\u201d </em>by this court. In other words, other than by prescribing <em>\u201cprocedure\u201d </em>this court has no authority to legislate and thereby attach conditions under which the right of the applicant may be affected. Nor can the fact that literally hundreds of rejected applicants simultaneously may seek relief from a situation identical in all respects with that here presented alter or in anywise affect the substantive right accorded to each of such individual applicants. The time of the Supreme Court may be, and without doubt is, fully occupied with the ordinary business of the court; but that fact should not of itself present a good or a sufficient reason for it either to neglect or to refuse to perform the additional and burdensome duty thrust upon it by reason of such legislative enactment. Clearly, any <em>\u201cprocedure\u201d </em>which this court may adopt in the premises must relate not to any diminution of the primary right of a petitioner, but, rather,\u2014as is indicated within the terms of the act,\u2014must be concerned solely with the manner in which he must act or proceed in bringing to the official attention of the court the essential fact that he is or has been an \u201cunsuccessful applicant for admission to practice, after he has taken any examination\u201d (sec. 6065, Bus. &amp; Prof. Code), and that the board of bar governors has \u201crefused certification to the Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>for [applicant\u2019s] admission to practice\u201d (see. 6066, Bus. &amp; Prof. Code).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">In his petition for \u201creview\u201d, neither by express language contained in the statute, nor by any meaning to be implied therefrom, is the rejected applicant required to ascribe any reason, whether real or fanciful, why the board refused to certify the fact that he be entitled to be admitted to the practice of law in this state. However, as is stated in the prevailing opinion herein, the instant proceeding is a hearing by this court which has occurred by reason of the fact that heretofore, at the instance of petitioner, an alternative writ of mandate was issued by which <em>\u201cthe Committee of Bar Examiners and The State Bar\u201d </em>were required \u201cto show cause why he [petitioner] should not be admitted to practice law in this state\u201d. By its judgment, as is expressed in its majority opinion herein, this court has decided that \u201cThe <em>burden </em>is on the <em>petitioner </em>to show wherein the determination of the board was incorrect or unfair, ...\u201d (Emphasis added.) It here may be noted that the bar of this state formerly\u2014although possibly erroneously\u2014has entertained that which now may be termed a ridiculous notion, to wit: That when, as a consequence of the issuance of an alternative writ of mandate, the <em>respondent </em>therein has been specially directed or ordered to <em>show </em>cause why the said respondent had not pursued a designated course, as expressly indicated in such order,\u2014-in response thereto,\u2014the final duty was cast upon such respondent (and not upon the petitioner for the writ) to actually <em>show cause as directed. </em>(Sec. 71, \u201cMandamus\u201d, 16 Cal. Jur., p. 875.)</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Within the prevailing opinion herein the rule is quoted that, in a proceeding of this kind, unless the <em>petitioner </em>therein made a showing of \u201cfraud, imposition, or coercion\u201d, or that he had been denied \u201ca fair opportunity to <em>take </em>the examinations\u201d, this court would not \u201cbe willing to listen to his complaint\u201d. (Citing <em>In re Admission to Practice Law, </em>1 Cal. (2d) 61, 64 [33 Pac. (2d) 829]; <em>Salot </em>v. <em>State Bar, </em>3 Cal. (2d) 615 [45 Pac. (2d) 203]; <em>Spears </em>v. <em>State Bar, </em>211 Cal. 183, 191 [294 Pac. 697, 72 A. L. R. 923].) However, on examination of the cited authorities, particularly with respect to the facts of those respective cases, it becomes apparent that none of them is clearly applicable to the factual situation here involved. Moreover, the rule set forth in the pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>vailing opinion, as was announced in <em>In re Admission to Practice Law, </em>1 Cal. (2d) 61, 64 [33 Pac. (2d) 829], was amplified in the later case of <em>Salot </em>v. <em>State Bar, </em>3 Cal. (2d) 615, 617 [45 Pac. (2d) 203]. In that case, following the statement that the remedy (if any) of a rejected applicant for admission to practice law in this state in effect must be based upon \u201cfraud, imposition, or coercion\u201d, the important, if not controlling, and necessarily essential and conclusive language of the court is: <em>\u201cor that he has been treated unfairly or </em>unjustly\u201d. (Emphasis added.) It therefore would seem to follow that even though a petitioner be unable, or should fail, to <em>show </em>either \u201cfraud, imposition, or coercion\u201d, nevertheless (assuming that the burden is upon him), if he can show that he has been treated either \u201cunfairly or unjustly\u201d, he still may be entitled to the relief which he seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Considering the complete language of the announced rule <em>(Salot </em>v. <em>State Bar, </em>3 Cal. (2d) 615, 617 [45 Pac. (2d) 203]), and both the circumstances prior to and ordinarily following the process of examining applicants for admission to practice law in this state, it is difficult, if indeed possible, to comprehend the reason (if any) for the use in the announced rule of the words \u201cfraud\u201d and \u201ccoercion\u201d. Manifestly, the facts relating to any alleged fraud (except with respect to constructive or implied fraud) which was or might have been practiced upon an applicant would not be available to him; and how or in what manner any applicant could or might be \u201ccoerced\u201d with reference to his examination must be and forever remain a dark and deep secret! But as to the significance of the word \u201cimposition\u201d, it is clear that the existence of circumstances might have been surmised which would or did justify its use. As presently employed, it probably imports something akin to the words \u201cunfairly or unjustly\u201d, which so closely follow the formed word. But, again considering the nature of the proceeding at bar, it is beyond ordinary comprehension how petitioner properly could complain of an assumed fact \u201cthat in any . . . manner he has been <em>prevented </em>from a fair opportunity to <em>take </em>the examinations\u201d. (Emphasis added.) . Certain it is that such a situation did not obtain herein. In the main, petitioner\u2019s complaint consists not in the fact that he was <em>prevented </em>from <em>taking </em>the examination but is to the effect that in the grading which was given his answers to the questions that were pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>pounded to him he was either imposed upon, or he was treated \u201cunfairly or unjustly\u201d; and in order to illustrate such asserted fact to the ordinary mind, or to induce such a conclusion by this court, he has submitted with his petition a <em>verbatim, </em>copy of the several questions and his respective answers thereto. They are as follows, to wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-5\">\n<em>[The following material is quoted from the official questions submitted to and answers written by petitioner John E. Staley.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-6\">\u201cQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS AS SUBMITTED TO JOHN E. STALEY IN THE BAR EXAMINATIONS OF OCTOBER, 1939.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-7\">BOOK I.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-8\">Question No. 1. Grade 45.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-9\">Question No. 2. Grade 30.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-10\">Question No. 1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-11\">Peters owned two cows, Nellie and Bossy, which he grazed upon his ranch, Blackacre. Nellie was stolen in August, 1935, by a neighbor, Daniels, who regularly used her in his dairy until September, 1937, at which time he sold her by bill of sale to one Smith, who was unaware of her previous theft by Daniels. Smith has since kept her together with a calf to which she gave birth in October, 1937.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-12\">Bossy was wrongfully converted by Daniels in August, 1938. Peters secured a judgment for her value against Daniels in July, 1939, but has been unable to collect anything thereunder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-13\">In August, 1939, one Jones removed some grain worth $100 from Blackacre in the honest belief , that the particular area from which the grain was taken was part of an adjoining tract which he had leased. Jones has made liquor worth' $210 from the grain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-14\">All of the above facts occurred in the State of Magenta, which has a statute providing that an action for the recovery of personal property must be commenced within three years. In October, 1939, Peters asks you whether he is entitled to recover either by suit or peaceable self help:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-15\">(1) Nellie and her calf from Smith</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-16\">(2) Bossy from Daniels</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-17\">(3) The liquor or the value thereof from Jones</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>Answer No. 1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-5\">(1) It is elementary law that a thief can never give title to the stolen property so it is apparent that Daniels could not confer title in his transfer to Smith.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-6\">As the possession of Smith commenced on Sept. 1937, the three year statute of limitations is not applicable. Smith being unable to convey any title; Daniels is regarded as having only the right of temporary possession until such time as the owner, Peters, chooses to take appropriate steps to recover \u201cNellie.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-7\">As Daniels did not acquire any title to \u201cNellie\u201d from this it follows that he could not convey any and the calf of \u201cNellie\u201d is the property of the owner of the animal but as title remained at all times in Peters, the natural increase of the cow \u201cNellie\u201d, being her calf, is the property of Peters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-8\">The good faith of Smith in buying the cow from Daniels does not enter into the question as a thief cannot pass title.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-9\">The right of self help exists on the part of Peters and he may peaceably take Nellie and her calf from Smith and he has the additional legal remedy of what is known in common law states as Replevin and in the code states as Claim and Delivery, in instances where a particular chattel or personal property is demanded by the owner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-10\">(2) As Peters has a judgment in the instance of \u201cBossy\u201d, all of his remedies have been merged in the action in which he secured his judgment. One has an election of remedies and in commencing an action he may take his choice but when action is taken there is a merger of such remedies in the final judgment. Where remedies are inconsistent; the choice of one and its culmination in judgment bars the use of another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-11\">As the right of self help is inconsistent with the action taken by Peters in the case of \u201cBossy\u201d; he cannot exercise \u201cself help.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-12\">(3) As the mistake of Jones was not in any way induced by Peters no element of estoppel exists as to the parties. Something more than an \u201chonest belief\u201d on the part of Jones must exist. There must have been some act or omission on the part of Peters. The leading case on this subject is the California case of <em>Biddle Boggs </em>vs. <em>Mining Co., </em>reported in 14 Cal. 297. This case lays down the law regarding boundaries and estoppel. There must have been a misrepresentation on the part of Peters or a statement as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>boundaries made with knowledge of its falsity or in reckless disregard of the truth, coupled with an intention for the other party to act but none of these elements exist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-5\">Peters would have been entitled to the grain and the question arises as to whether the change of the grain into liquor by the process of distillation defeats Peters in his right to recover.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-6\">Jones in taking the grain was a mere trespasser and his honest belief does not alter the legal situation for the reasons stated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-7\">The change in character from grain to liquor does not defeat the right of Peters to recover his property and if the law were otherwise the rightful claim of an owner to property could be defeated by a change of form.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-8\">This being so Peters has the right of peaceable self help as Jones was a mere trespasser in the acquisition of the grain. The change of form from grain to liquor does not defeat this right and while Peters by taking the liquor acquires the right to seize his property in the altered form as the law regards the liquor as the property of Peters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-9\">Peters has the additional right of legal action. He may sue Jones for conversion of property or bring an action for a money judgment for the value of the grain. He could not recover for the value of the liquor as the law of damages limits him [to] the value of the grain and any injury to his freehold.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-10\">As the value of the liquor exceeds that of the grain by $110, it is obvious that the right of self help is the more advantageous of the remedies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-11\">While it might seem harsh that Jones should lose the additional value enhanced in the process of distillation yet the law regards him as a wrongdoer in the first instance even though he acted in good faith.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-12\">Question No. 2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-13\">Knapp owned in the State of Magenta two tracts of Land, Blackacre and Whiteacre. Blackacre he was induced to sell and convey to Brown through the fraud of the latter. Brown in turn sold and conveyed the land to Black, who had no notice of Brown\u2019s fraud and paid value for the land.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-14\">Later Knapp discovered the fraud which had been committed against him and went into possession of Blackacre, claiming that the sale to Brown was void. He stayed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>possession for one year, planting and harvesting a crop of wheat. While the grain was still lying in sacks on the ground, Black, who, not having occupied the land himself after his purchase, had just learned of Knapp\u2019s action, peaceably retook possession of Blackaere and claimed the grain as his own.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-5\">Meanwhile Knapp had leased Whiteacre to White for five years beginning January 1, 1937, at a yearly rental of $1,000, payable on the first of each year. In December, 1937, White abandoned the premises. In February, 1938, he mailed the keys to the farmhouse and other buildings on the premises to Knapp, saying he repudiated the lease. Knapp kept the keys but at no time after White\u2019s abandonment attempted to communicate in any way with him, and on February 2, 1939, he relet the premises to another for the remainder of the original term at a yearly rental of $500 the most he could reasonably secure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-6\">Knapp now asks you:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-7\">(1) Whether he is entitled to the grain on Blackaere;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-8\">(2) What his rights are against White, only the first year\u2019s rent ever having been paid under the lease of Whiteacre.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-9\">Advise Knapp.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-10\">Answer No. 2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-11\">(1) Black was an innocent purchaser for value of Black-acre and he received a good title from Brown as Black acted without any notice, actual or constructive of the fraud of Brown.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-12\">Knapp in going onto Blackaere and planting the crop was a mere trespasser and as Black did not know of Knapp\u2019s act until after the grain had ripened, there is no element of estoppel present. <em>(Biddle Boggs </em>vs. <em>Merced Mining Co., </em>14 Cal. 279.) Black having not only the title but the right to possession at all times was entitled to the grain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-13\">Knapp is not entitled to the grain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-14\">(2) The legal question involved is whether Knapp in renting Whiteacre after the default of White, has waived his right to recover for the entire term of White\u2019s lease. White in mailing back the keys and repudiating the lease clearly demonstrated his intention of non-compliance with the terms of the lease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-15\">Under these circumstances the owner, Knapp, had the right to rent the property to another and treat the lease to White <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>as breached by White. Knapp would not be required to keep the property vacant and subject to the occupancy by White as White has clearly shown he would not reoccupy. Knapp had the right to diminish damages by renting his property to another and Knapp may sue White for the period of January 1938, to February 2, 1939; at the rate of $1000 a year, and from February 2nd, 1939, to date of filing suit at the rate of $500 being the difference in the lease price and the actual second rental and Knapp may sue for such period of rent on the basis of yearly loss of $500; or Knapp may elect to wait until just before the period of 4 years from December 1937, the date of default, and sue White for the accumulated damages based upon the yearly rental of $1000, while the property was vacant and the loss of $500, at a yearly rate under the second letting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-5\">As we have a four year period of limitations for bringing actions under an instrument in writing; Knapp if he elects to wait instead of suing White, each year for the loss; may later sue at the end of the fifth year for the difference in rent; as the breach would have been for the last year of the lease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-6\">BOOK II.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-7\">Question No. 3.

Green-acre had originally cost Adams only $100,000 but its present market value is $200,000. Adams paid $50,000 for Blaekacre, although its present market value is $100,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-11\">In pursuance of his plan, Adams organized the Enterprize Corporation, installed his wife and two sons as the first directors, and caused stock to be issued to the public. The corporation then purchased Greenacre and Blaekacre from Adams for $200,000 and $100,000, respectively. Shortly, thereafter, a new board of directors was elected and now desires to bring suit against Adams.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-12\">(1) What damages, if any, can the corporation recover from Adams as a result of its purchase of Blaekacre ? Greenacre ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>(2) Is the corporation liable to Adams for the reasonable amount of the expenses he incurred in organizing the corporation ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-5\">(3) Discuss the liability of the corporation and of Adams on a contract made by Adams prior to incorporation in the name of \u201cEnterprize Corporation\u201d with one Thomas, who agreed to furnish certain goods to the corporation for six months after incorporation at a stipulated price.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-6\">The corporation received the goods knowing of the contract made by Adams, but now refuses to pay Thomas on the basis that neither its board of directors nor officers had taken any action to affirm the contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-7\">Answer No. 3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-8\">(1) It is assumed that the time of organization of the Enterprize Corporation is contemporaneous with the \u201cpresent market value\u201d of the parcels of land involved. Under this assumption there would have been no fraud or unfairness on the part of Adams.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-9\">A corporate officer has a fiduciary relation regarding the corporation. He may not make secret profits and in all his dealings with the corporate property he is required to show good faith.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-10\">While there had been an increase in the increment of the parcels of land involved it seems that Adams could have marketed the land at the time he sold it to the corporation for the same price. This being true, there was no advantage gained by Adams. The circumstance that his relatives were also officers does not affect the situation as there is not any breach of fiduciary relation on the part of Adams.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-11\">The corporation cannot recover on either parcel as they did not sustain any loss and there was no irregularity as a corporate officer in the conduct of Adams.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-12\">(2) A corporation is liable for the reasonable amount of money in the form of expense incurred and paid by one of its officers but where the expense is incurred only the money may never be paid. Adams has only a contingent liability for them but until his liability becomes absolute by payment by him the corporation would not be liable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-13\">(3) While there was no corporate entity at the time that Adams contracted with Thomas, yet when the Enterprize Corporation received the goods, knowing that Adams had contracted with Thomas anticipating the formation of the cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>poration; the Bnterprize Corporation ratified the act of Adams.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-5\">Under the law of Agency the acts of an agent, who was not at the time authorized to act, may be ratified and this may be done by assuming the benefit of the acts of the agent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-6\">The corporation cannot both hold the goods and refuse to pay. Formal ratification is not required as the corporation has retained the goods. The retention of the goods purchased by Adams is an act of ratification and the corporation must pay the stipulated price.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-7\">Question No. 4.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-8\">On a trial for the murder of P, D\u2019s defense is that P was the aggressor and that D reasonably believed it necessary to shoot P in self-defense. D offers to prove that P and D had been rivals for the same girl, that P had approached D with a gun in his hand, and that P, as D learned after the killing, had told others shortly before that he would kill D on sight.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-9\">D offers testimony of W, a service station attendant, that W saw P shortly before the shooting heading toward D\u2019s house, that P \u201cappeared to be angry\u201d and that he was then carrying a weapon (previously introduced in evidence) which, though in fact incapable of shooting, \u201cwould reasonably be mistaken for a real gun.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-10\">On cross-examination of W the prosecution asks him if he is related to D and the witness answers \u201cNo.\u201d The prosecution then asks W his age.

The prosecution also offers a certified copy of W\u2019s birth certificate showing him to be 30 years old.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-11\">(1) For what purposes, if any, may the statements made by P be introduced ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-12\">(2) Is W\u2019s testimony admissible?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-13\">(3) Is C\u2019s testimony admissible?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-14\">(4) Is the certified copy of the birth certificate admissible?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASr\">Answer No. 4.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-15\">(1) The statements of \u201cP\u201d are not admissible for any purpose as it appears that such statements were not communicated to \u201cD\u201d until after the killing; and as the pretended weapon would not in fact shoot; the declarations of \u201cP\u201d could not be introduced even for the purpose of proving a plan of action. While statements of an assailant to homi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>tide cases are admissible for the purpose of proving a plan of action or for the purpose of showing that the defendant had known of the statements and on that basis had reasonable cause to fear for his life; the circumstances of this case do not warrant the introduction of \u201cP\u2019s\u201d statements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-5\">In self defense it is required to show that the threats were communicated; that they were believed by the defendant and that the defendant also believed that the assailant also had the power to execute the threats at the time of the act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-6\">(2) Under section 2052 of our Code of Civil Procedure, a witness may be impeached by asking him regarding inconsistent statements made at variance with his testimony. The procedure is to ask the witness if he made such statements; if he wishes to explain them, and then to introduce the impeaching testimony. The first step is \u201claying the foundation\u201d and the second is the impeachment. The inconsistent statements may have been made out of court and if they are material or relevant and not incompetent, they may be introduced.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-7\">W may be impeached by showing that he stated falsely regarding his age as the court or jury may be entitled to this information in forming an opinion as to the maturity of the witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-8\">His relationship, according to his statements may also be shown as it would prove bias and favor. The principle of <em>\u201cfalsus in uno falsus in omnibus\u201d </em>enters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-9\">(3) The statement of \u201cW\u201d may be proven by \u201cC\u201d as the latter is an impeaching witness. The law regards one who makes inconsistent statements as subject to impeachment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-10\">(4) Yes. The court or jury estimate the witness by his age, among other attributes; and the copy of the birth certificate being certified it tends to show that \u201cW\u201d testified falsely. It is conventional procedure, in examining a witness to ask him about his age, among other qualifications. The cross examining attorney may impeach the witness by introducing the certificate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-11\">BOOK III.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-12\">Question No. 5.

One day the bull escaped from A\u2019s pasture without negligence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>on the part of A, and entered B\u2019s land. B saw the bull rush at him, but carelessly waited too long before running for cover and was gored. .C, the wife of B, was standing with B when the bull appeared; she ran at once, but in her excitement tripped and fell, thereby suffering a minor injury. She then managed to proceed to safety. However, she sustained fright and mental shock resulting from realization of her own danger and her husband\u2019s injuries, and she ultimately suffered a miscarriage therefrom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-5\">For what, if anything, may B and C, or either of them, recover ? Discuss fully.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-6\">Answer No. 5.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-7\">The degree of care which the law requires <em>\u201cA\u201d </em>to manifest in the custody of a domesticated animal seems to have been satisfied in this case. While an owner of a domestic animal might, under some circumstances, be held liable when the owner had notice or knowledge of the vicious propensities of the animal; in this case it appears that the escape of the bull from the pasture was \u201cwithout negligence on the part\u201d of \u201cA\u201d.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-8\">The law does not impose upon the owner of a domesticated animal the same extraordinary degree of care that it imposes upon one who harbors a wild animal. The owner of domesticated animal is not absolutely liable for any damage caused by the animal even tho\u2019 he knew its vicious propensities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-9\">Applying the rule above stated in reference to the facts of the case it seems that \u201cB\u201d in carelessly waiting too long was guilty of contributory negligence and that bars his recovery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-10\">The law consistently refuses to give damages for mere mental shock or nervous fright. The cases hold that there must be some actual, physical injury, before one may recover. The statement of facts concerning \u201cC\u201d states a minor injury but she managed to proceed to safety. The miscarriage suffered by \u201cC\u201d was not directly resultant from any actual injury inflicted by \u201cA\u2019s\u201d bull and she cannot recover for that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-11\">The recovery of \u201cC\u201d would be limited to the minor injury mentioned in her escape; if there had been negligence on the part of \u201cA\u201d but as there was none there can be no recovery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>Question No. 6.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-5\">A agreed in writing with B to sell B a specified pleasure car which he promised to deliver to B \u201cas soon as it could possibly be secured from the factory.\u201d In consideration thereof, B promised to pay $1500 \u201cif A delivered the car with reasonable promptness after the same could be obtained from the factory.\u201d A delivered the car to B\u2019s premises, during the latter\u2019s absence, two days later than it would have been possible for him to do so.

The director may not remain quiescent concerning a secret profit he may have made when the source of knowledge comes to him thru his functioning as a director of the corporation. The director may not tacitly engage in profitable operations for himself when such operations conflict with any duty he owes to the corporation as an artificial entity, or to the stockholders as persons in whose behalf the director functions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-12\">Had the corporation purchased the stock of Smith at the price which Blake paid, it is obvious that the corporation would have enjoyed the same profit, on resale, or would have reduced the outstanding stock.

The defense, on cross-examination of Adams, is allowed to ask, over the objection of associate counsel for the plaintiff, whether Adams had not taken the ease on a contingent fee basis. The court further rules, over plaintiff\u2019s objection, that the defense may ask Adams if Phillips had not been drunk when Adams, an hour after the collision, was called to the jail in which Phillips was incarcerated, and also whether Phillips at such consultation had not admitted that he had been intoxicated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-7\">The court also overrules a defense objection to Adams calling one of the jurors, who thereupon testifies to overhearing Dodge say he had been intoxicated at the time of the injury to Phillips.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-8\">After judgment for the defendant the plaintiff moves for a new trial on the ground, among others, that one of the jurors had accepted a bribe for the defendant.

He completed the painting and advised Byers it was ready; whereupon Byers, in a personal letter to his wife, mentioned, among other things, that \u201cI have bought a picture from Abbott for $750\u201d. The letter was read by Mrs. Byers and some mutual friends of hers and Abbott\u2019s and destroyed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-5\">Later, Byers wrote Abbott as follows: \u201cI will pay $200 for a life-size painting of Moses,\u201d and the next day he wrote: \u201cI will pay $200 for a life-size painting of Joshua.\u201d Abbott, without notifying Byers, commenced work on both pictures. Hearing from a friend that Abbott was working on the painting of Moses, Byers, without the knowledge of Abbott, contracted to sell it to a customer for $300. When both pictures were one-half completed, Abbott notified Byers of this fact and that he had decided not to finish the painting of Moses, but would finish that of Joshua forthwith. Byers immediately advised Abbott that he had had no idea Abbott had commenced on the painting of Joshua, that he no longer wanted it, that Abbott should consider this offer revoked, but that he would hold Abbott for breach of contract unless the painting of Moses was finished. Abbott completed the picture of Joshua but not that of Moses. Byers now refuses to pay for the painting of Elijah and refused Abbott\u2019s tender of that of Joshua.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-6\">1.

C.

Abbott, relying upon this offer of Byers, commenced the work of artistic production.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-5\">Abbott has a cause of action for the failure of Byers to accept the picture of Joshua. The orders for the pictures were separate transactions concerning different subjects and the contracts were individual matters. The offers having been communicated at different times we have two distinct contracts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-6\">(3) Abbott by commencing work on the picture of Moses established the contemporaneous construction and his act was an acceptance of the offer of Byers. Byers offering the picture for sale to a customer confirmed the contemporaneous construction. The artist apparently refused to finish the picture because he had heard of the profit which Byers expected to enjoy from the transaction but as he had commenced the picture, a contract exists.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-7\">Byers has a cause of action against Abbott.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-8\">Question No. 13.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-9\">Intending to make a will, Wilson typed a one-page document entitled \u201cLast Will\u201d.

It was given impetus in the N. R.

Since the N. R A. campaign there has been a great reversal of opinion on that subject. It will be r\u00e9called that the famous section \u201c7A\u201d of the National Recovery Act provided that there be no discrimination. It provided that an employee might join and belong to any labor organization of his own choosing, or none if he so pleased.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-12\">If an employer could require an employee to refrain from joining a labor union the employee could in turn require the employer not to join any employers association or group.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-13\">Is freedom of contract affected by the Statute?

This is not only an arbitrary but an illogical and paradoxical method of determining racial extraction. The criterion of determination under the Statute is a way of saying that the lesser is as great as the whole. This evaluation violates the dictates of common sense and what is not common sense is rarely good law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-8\">There may be educational merit in the separation of races. Courts could take judicial notice if the <em>lex loci </em>were Los Angeles, instead of Magenta, that in the Japanese district of the City of Los Angeles there are more than 55 thousand Japanese, racially spe'aking. If the State of Magenta, embraced within its boundaries a similar subdivision the Courts of Magenta might also judiciously notice; it being a matter of widespread knowledge that the public schools in the Japanese district, at least in the primary grade, were overwhelmingly composed of those Japanese descent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-9\">The court might under the same circumstances also judiciously know that it is common practice among Japanese parents to place their offspring in Japanese Kindergartens where they are taught by native Japanese teachers in the Japanese language. In these private schools the children of tender years are taught only the Japanese language and culture. They learn the \u201cKata-Kana\", a simplified Japanese <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>alphabet of some 75 characters, as distinguished from the \u201cKanjai\u201d, the conventional language of Japan; expressed by the calligraphy borrowed from the Chinese.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-5\">Thus, the court of Magenta might indicate their realization of the situation that the legislators might have had in mind, in their attempt to establish a racial school.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-6\">Probably legislation which did not conflict with the constitutional restrictions regarding race and religion might be drafted but the determination of racial character in the method employed by the legislators of Magenta is racial discrimination and conflicts with the constitutional guarantees against laws which are restrictive under the conventional language invariably utilized in State Constitutions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-7\">BOOK X.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-8\">Question No. 17.

The subject matter purchased with such earning is also community unless the parties by some act change the nature of the property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>Jones having purchased Blackacre with community funds and the deed having been made to him and his wife in the conventional manner, this parcel is community property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-5\">The husband during the marriage has the right of management of community property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-6\">As Jones is seriously ill we must assume that Mary inquires as to the possible effect of her property interests in the event of her husband\u2019s demise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-7\">As no will is mentioned we must assume that none exists and as no children are mentioned the property which is community, being Blackacre, would go to Mary under our code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-8\">(2) Joint Tenancy is a distinct and peculiar estate in the eye of the law. There exists unity of time, title and interest. On the death of a joint tenant, the estate goes to the surviving joint tenant, or tenants. The joint tenants having unity of time, title and interest, they have equal and indivisible rights to management, occupancy and control.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-9\">By the terms of the deed under which the parties here held title the estate in joint tenancy is created. While the earnings of the husband in the absence of the deed to him and his wife, in joint tenancy, would otherwise have been community property, the parties in this case have, by taking under the deed, created an estate in joint tenancy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-10\">Mary has a co-equal estate with her husband in joint tenancy during her lifetime and if he should die the entire estate of Greenacre becomes hers by operation of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-11\">(3) The insurance policy having been maintained and having been executed during the marriage, the payments being made with community funds, is likewise community property, even though the beneficiary is John\u2019s mother. As Mary never acquiesced in the payments made under the policy she should avoid the expense of litigation and clarify the matter by asking her husband to change the policy or make some congenial arrangement. In the event of John\u2019s death without such policy change litigation would be necessary to establish the nature of the insurance estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-12\">Question No. 18.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-13\">B purchased from S, a retail tobacco merchant, a box of nationally advertised cigars manufactured by M, B having designated that particular brand as his choice. B told S that he was having a party that evening and wanted to be sure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>the cigars were fresh. That evening when B opened the box by breaking the seal, he discovered that each cigar was carefully wrapped and sealed in cellophane. While B was smoking one of the cigars it exploded and burned a hole in B\u2019s coat. Almost simultaneously, P, a guest, had the same thing happen to his cigar which had also come out of the same box. P\u2019s eye was so badly injured that it was necessary to remove it by surgical operation. The remaining cigars in the box were excellent in every respect. Neither S nor M had been negligent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-5\">B and P come to you to see whether they have remedies against S or M or both. What you would tell them ? Discuss.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-6\">Answer No. 18.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-7\">It is generally held that a retailer is not liable for a substance sold by him in an instance where the defect is so concealed and he would have no way of knowing of it and where he purchased the goods in the ordinary channels of trade. There are some exceptions to these decisions in the ease of foods served by restaurants but ordinarily the law does not give an action against the retailer of so-called package goods for any damage done by a concealed defect or vice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-8\">It is obvious that the explosions were due to some bit of cellophane, which in some way became concealed in the cigars. How this could happen without negligence on the part of \u201cM\u201d is not disclosed by the question. The wrapping of the cigars in cellophane is a part of the fabrication of the complete box of cigars in the plant of \u201cM\u201d. While it is difficult to conceive of circumstances wherein a foreign element such as cellophane is concealed with the wrapper of a cigar without negligence in the manufacturing process; yet the question must be discussed as it stands.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-9\">It is generally known that cellophane, being a cellulose product, may be highly inflammable and when compressed, explosive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-10\">A manufacturer who utilizes this substance must at his peril see that none of it could be concealed within s.uch an article as a cigar, which in the process of consumption is subjected to heat and fire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-11\">Discussing the question on the basis that the manufacturer, \u201cM\u201d, had utilized the highest degree of care in the manufacture of the cigars, yet the facts of the case clearly demonstrate that some cellophane was concealed within the cigars <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>and the fact that other or all cigars in the box were perfect does not alter the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-5\">It is not beyond the realm of possibility that the only two cigars in the box that were dangerous were chosen by the guests or that chance determined this happening.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-6\">One who utilizes cellophane of the explosive character used in this matter is \u201cplaying with dynamite\u201d considering the effect of heat and fire and \u201cM\u201d is liable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-7\">BOOK XII.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-8\">Question No. 20.

The contract provided that the installments were to be paid upon the first day of every month; that time was of the essence and that non-payment of any installments when due would forfeit all payments previously made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-13\">The installments were paid promptly until September 1938 when Wing neglected to tender payment until September third. This was accepted as were the next two installments, which were both tendered on November seventh. At that time, however, the company notified Wing that future installments were payable promptly when due. Wing tendered the final installment December second, which tender was refused as was Wing\u2019s demand for conveyance of the lot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-14\">Wing, in the meantime, having secured a better offer from a competing company, is preparing to fly for it. The Seaside Company seeks your advise in regard to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-15\">(1) Securing an injunction to prevent Wing from performing for the rival company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>(2) A suit instituted by Wing to enforce the specific performance of the contract of sale.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-5\">(3) The right of Wing to recover the money paid on the purchase price, if he cannot secure specific performance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-6\">Answer No. 20.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-7\">(1) The courts have uniformly held that services which were unique in their rendition may be the subject of equitable relief where a contracting party rendering such services attempts to breach the contract. The leading case on this subject, <em>Lumely </em>vs. <em>Wagner, </em>involved the services of an opera singer and most of the cases are concerned with the performance of histrionic or artistic talent but the courts, in many instances, have enjoined business executives who possessed unusual and distinctive ability, at the instance of their employers, from becoming the employee of another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-8\">The employee cannot be compelled to continue work but he may be enjoined from entering the service of another or engaging in service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-9\">The services need not be unique, they may only be unusual or distinctive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-10\">The services for which Wing engaged himself were distinctive as he had acquired a national reputation as a stunt flyer. The purpose of the Seaside Realty Company was to exploit their property by an attraction which would lure prospective purchasers to the site.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-11\">Were the services rendered and to be rendered by Wing less unusual or distinctive than those of the average movie star? A stunt flyer engages in an occupation in which there is a high degree of mortality. There is not much future in that vocation. Such men must not only practice for years to control their planes in their gyrations but they must be exceptionally endowed physically, mentally and nervously with most unusual qualifications. Vision must be perfect and a high degree of mental and physical coordination is required.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-12\">The various \u201cstunts\u201d consist of complicated maneuvers such as \u201cwing overs\u201d, \u201cInnelman Turns\u201d, \u201cWhip-stalls\u201d and other manipulations which require the highest degree of talent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-13\">The average stunt flyer requires a higher degree of ability and mental and moral stamina, with unusual physical and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>nervous attributes to perform his work, than does the average movie star.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-5\">As the offer from the rival company came to Wing and he is preparing to fly for it during the period of time for which he contracted to fly for the Seaside Realty Company, an injunction could be secured restraining Wing from so doing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-6\">(2) It is a general rule of equity that specific performance lies to compel the transfer of realty under contract because each piece of land is unique. For this reason there is no remedy at law which is plain, speedy or adequate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-7\">Our California Supreme Court, in a ease similar to the one presented has held that where the parties to an installment contract accept installments when past due that the parties themselves have established a contemporaneous construction of the contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-8\">This is the law even tho\u2019 the contract contains a clause reciting that time is of the essence, as this one did in the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-9\">The courts of California, of general jurisdiction, such as the Superior Court have equitable jurisdiction. This is granted under the Constitution of the State of California. They have all the equitable jurisdiction exercised by the Chancery Courts of England. There is an academic question as to whether their jurisdiction, in the subject matter, is determined as of the time of the American Revolution or of the organization of the State as one of the States of the Union.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-10\">However, the practical question presented is to be determined by the rule that equity will compel specific performance of contracts for the purchase of land.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-11\">While the contracts of service and the contract to purchase were entered into by Wing at the same time they are to be considered as entirely separate and distinct agreements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-12\">Neither has any bearing on the other.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-13\">It is an oftquoted maxim of chancery that \u201cEquity abhors a forfeiture.\u201d Or \u201cEquity abhors forfeitures.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-14\">Wing having paid all but the last installment would be subjected to a forfeiture and when we consider that the California Courts have observed the doctrine of contemporaneous construction and have given relief to those who substantially fulfilled their contracts; the tardiness of Wing, in a few instances was excused by the acceptance of his money by the Realty Company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>The Seaside Realty Company could not wait until the last payment and refuse to accept it; having condoned the previous instances of dilatory payment by accepting them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-5\">Wing may compel specific performance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-6\">(3) The same doctrine of contemporaneous construction discussed in the previous question applies here, and for the same reasons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-7\">The jurisdiction of our California Courts is somewhat different than most of those of sister states in the Union.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-8\">Under our Code law and equity are wedded. When the Code was adopted in 1873 it was considered advantageous to give legal and equitable relief in the same action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-9\">While it is unusual to hear a California attorney recite the equitable maxims in court and while too frequently according to Professor Pomeroy in his introduction to his monumental work on the subject of equity, the equitable powers of the courts are overlooked in this jurisdiction, yet our Superior Courts do have, and they are required under our Code to apply equitable and legal rights in an action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-10\">This being true, as a matter of law, Wing could invoke in an action for damages all of the equitable rights, as distinguished from the equitable remedies, that he could invoke in the previous matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-11\">In other words the substantive law of equity is applied in a legal action but not the adjective law of equity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-12\">Wing can sue in an action for money for breach of contract and his damages are measured by the profit on the lot sale, commission to the salesman, administrative expense on the <em>transaction; </em>and other proper charges which might be deducted from his demand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-13\">Question No. 21.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-14\">Adams, through the fraud of Blake, was induced to give the latter a negotiable promissory note for $5,000, dated October 23, 1938, payable one year after date, in consideration of Blake conveying Blackaere to Adams.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-15\">Six months later Blake, without fraud, induced Adams, as yet unaware of Blake\u2019s prior fraud, to execute to Blake a mortgage on Blackaere securing payment of the note. No new consideration was given for the mortgage, it reciting that it was executed \u201cas security for that certain obligation in the sum of $5,000 represented by a promissory note bear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>ing date of October 23, 1938.\u201d This mortgage was never recorded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-5\">On October 21, 1939, Clay, who was unaware of the Adams-Blake mortgage, secured against Adams a judgment for $10,-000, an abstract of which he immediately recorded in the county where Blackacre was situated, which by statute created a lien.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-6\">On October 22, 1939, Blake surrendered the October 23, 1938, note to Adams in exchange for a new negotiable note due October 23, 1940. Adams still being unaware of Blake\u2019s prior fraud. No new mortgage was executed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-7\">(1) Assuming Blake retains the new note and at the maturity thereof sues for foreclosure of the mortgage on Black-acre, discuss all points which a careful lawyer would consider as possible defenses for Adams.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-8\">(2) If Blake, prior to maturity of the second note, negotiated it to a holder in due course, could such holder at maturity foreclose the mortgage? If so, what would be the priority as between such holder and Clay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-9\">Answer No. 21.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-10\">It would be advantageous in the discussion of this question to know the kind and extent of the fraud practiced.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-11\">It is difficult to conceive how Blake \u201cwithout fraud\u201d secured a mortgage from Adams; as the original transaction was tainted with fraud in its inception and certainly the securing of such an instrument as a mortgage would be, at lease, a continuation of the initial fraud.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-12\">There being no consideration for the execution of the mortgage that instrument is regarded as having been based upon a past consideration and between the original parties. The recitals of the instrument, altho \u2019 specific, do not control. The real consideration of the instrument may always be shown.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-13\">Before the execution of the mortgage there was in existence only the note.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-14\">\u201cFraud vitiates everything.\u201d As the original transaction was conceived and executed in fraud, Adams may defend on that ground. The execution of the new note does not alter the situation as Adams was unaware of Blake\u2019s prior fraud. Under our Code one may sue for fraud within three years after the <em>discovery </em>of the fraud. (338 CCP.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>Certainly one could defend on the ground of fraud and there has been no laches nor estoppel in the making of the new note because the maker, Adams, did not know of the fraud.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-5\">A very practical question arises as to the value of the property involved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-6\">In defending Adams may take the position of fraud in the original transaction, not discovered by him at the time of execution of the various documents involved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-7\">No consideration for the making of the mortgage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-8\">No new mortgage was executed at the time of the execution of the new note.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-9\">No action lies for foreclosure for the reason that the old note was extinguished by the new one and the mortgage is not a security based upon the new note.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-10\">(2) An innocent purchaser for value would be regarded as having acquired the second note under the mortgage security and he would take free of all the equities existing between the parties. It follows that he could foreclose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-11\">Clay having recorded the abstract of judgment and the mortgage not having been recorded, Clay has priority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-12\">BOOK XIII.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-13\">Question No. 22.

He arranged with Green, an odd job man in the neighborhood, for the latter to clean the windows of the building at the rate of fifty cents per hour. As Jones knew, Green had caused two injuries during the past year while engaged in window cleaning through dropping tools on passersby.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-17\">An ordinance of the City of Fairview prohibited the use by window cleaners of any brush other than a special type so designed as to strap around the hand. Neither Green nor Jones had such a brush, however, and Jones told Green to use a short mop with which Jones supplied him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-18\">Jones saw that Green was working without a safety belt but made no objection, although a city ordinance required such a belt to be used. He gave no direction or suggestions other than as stated above as to how Green should do the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>work. While Green was cleaning one of the higher windows, he negligently slipped, and, due to not having a safety belt, was forced to grab the window sash with both hands, as a result of which the unattached mop fell striking and injuring Paulson, who was walking on the sidewalk in front of Jones\u2019 building.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-5\">Is Jones liable to Paulson? Discuss all possible bases upon which such liability might be predicated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-6\">Answer No. 22.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-7\">As the contract of employment is on a time basis for wages, Green is an employee of Jones and not an independent contractor. Green, being an employee, came under the rule of <em>respondeat superior </em>as he is a servant of Jones in this undertaking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-8\">We have a violation of two city ordinances here. Ordinances which are reasonable in their scope are proper objects of municipal legislation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-9\">The violation of these ordinances in the acts in which the servant was engaged on behalf of his master, is the very cause of the injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-10\">The proximate cause of the injury was the failure of the servant to properly use a brush which could have been strapped to his hand, obviating injury by dropping to those below; and the failure to use a safety belt, which failure resulted in his efforts to observe the first law of nature and save himself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-11\">Both of these proximate causes, or the division of the proximate cause into two parts, as you may prefer; was the causative factor in the injury and both had been proscribed by the city ordinance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-12\">All of the \u201cpossible bases\u201d would include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-13\">a. common law liability under Master [and] Servant Doctrine.

The courts have held that \u201cSpendthrift Trusts\u201d are valid where the trust created is not in its inception a device for defrauding creditors. As the period of time between the creation of the trust and it becoming effective thru\u2019 the death of Smith is sufficient to rebut any inference of that kind the trust is valid; with the proviso that the <em>cestui que trust </em>is deprived of control of the subject matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-10\">The decisions say that one cannot create a spendthrift trust and endow the beneficiary with any control over the subject matter to the extent that he may enjoy the increment of its earnings secure from his creditors and at any time control for his own benefit the subject matter of the trust.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-11\">The provisions of the trust in the question seem to have fully met all the requirements of the law in this regard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>(a) Bob\u2019s creditors cannot successfully attack the trust estate nor the income paid to Bob, with the proviso that after the income is paid to Bob that such income then becomes subject to execution, attachment or other appropriate remedy.

The older decisions hold that if an agent sign his name instead of that of his principal the agent is bound but the modern trend is to exempt one who acts in a representative capacity from personal liability when the qualifying words appear with the signature, even tho\u2019 the words indicative of representation appear below the signature.

A dyke had been erected on Whiteacre to prevent water on Whiteacre from running over into Greenacre, adjoining farm land owned by Jones. The dyke was in disrepair and leaked, damaging crops on Greenacre, and the lease provided that White was to repair it within two weeks. After White had taken possession, a separate contract was entered into whereby Jones agreed, for adequate consideration, to install on Whiteacre a system of pipes for irrigation. White failed to repair the dyke as agreed, and Jones has failed to install the irrigation system.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-11\">(1) Can Allen compel specific performance of Jones\u2019 promise to convey Blackaere?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-12\">(2) Can Jones compel specific performance of White\u2019s agreement to repair the dyke?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-13\">(3) Can White compel specific performance of Jones\u2019 agreement to install the irrigation system ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-14\">Answer .No. 25.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-15\">(1) Contracts in which personal skill or the credit or probity or personal qualification of a contracting party are involved are not assignable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>Contracts which embody a clause prohibiting assignment are likewise not assignable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-5\">As the contract under question involves none of these features [it] is of an assignable nature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-6\">Allen tendered the money required to be paid and offered to execute the purchase money mortgage so it is apparent that the vendor relied upon the mortgage for security rather than personal credit of the vendee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-7\">The courts grant specific performance of land contracts as each parcel of land is unique and the purchaser has for that reason no \u201cplain, speedy nor adequate remedy at law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-8\">Allen can compel specific performance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-9\">(2) As specific performance is purely equitable in origin and application one who invokes the remedy and who has failed to carry out his agreements with the Deft, may be challenged with the equitable maxim, \u201cHe who seeks equity must do equity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-10\">While the subject matter of the dyke and the irrigation are not directly concerned with each other, it is well settled that in equity when jurisdiction is taken concerning one justiciable question between the parties it is assumed for all matters that may be adjudicated, whether they are equitable or legal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-11\">In a previous paper the jurisdiction of our Superior and Appellate Courts in equity was ascribed to the provisions of the State of California constitution and the codes made in pursuance of that jurisdiction and to save time and space, this matter will not be set out at length.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-12\">One of the grounds of equitable jurisdiction is the prevention of a multiplicity of legal actions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-13\">If Jones were required to sue on the covenant requiring White to repair the dyke it follows as a logical sequence that such suits would be required to be filed and prosecuted as often as the water, due to natural causes, the terrain and other matters might accumulate and run over into Jones\u2019 land.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-14\">Pursuing this ratiocination, this would result in a multiplicity of legal actions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-15\">Jones can compel specific performance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-16\">(3) As was intimated in the previous question White could in a proceeding by Jones for specific performance, in the same action, compel performance. (By cross-complaint.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>For the purpose of discussion we will assume that Jones did not sue, as contemplated in the previous subdivision of this question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-5\">If White could not compel specific performance he would be relegated to an action of law. Under the strictly legal situation he would be limited to the damage sustained by the failure of Jones to install the irrigation system, the interim being the elapsed time from the date of the contract for the installation of irrigation to the date of the suit. Damages could not be anticipated as they would depend upon climatic and meteorological conditions and other vagaries which would be impossible of ascertainment, or even surmise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-6\">From time to time as damages would accrue during the period of the lease White would be compelled to repair to court. In a semi-arid country irrigation is necessary to most forms of husbandry and White to raise his crop, would be compelled to install some sort of irrigation system, mechanical or manual, as the case might be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-7\">Under these circumstances equity would compel specific performance at the instance of White for the purpose of preventing a multiplicity of suits and for the reason that White had no plain, speedy nor adequate remedy at law; which is the basis of all equitable jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-8\">Question No. 26.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-9\">X, a logger, had been supplying logs for Y\u2019s sawmills for several years.

The question presented hinges upon the operation of the Statute of Frauds, among other matters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-8\">While partial performance may take a contract to sell realty \u201cout of the statute\" there must be more performance than is shown here, up to the time that B recorded his deed. By so doing B, who was entrusted with his deed demonstrated his intention of becoming the owner of the land. True he recorded the deed because he learned of the previous transaction but whatever motive prompted him; he did by this act take the matter out of the Statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-9\">In determining questions based upon the Statute it is sometimes helpful to recollect the purpose of the Statute and its history throws light on this doubtful and sometimes bewildering application of this universal bit of Anglo-Saxon legislation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-10\">When the quaint \u201clawyer\u2019s lat\u00edn\" and Norman French in which the Statute is couched, is translated; the preamble assures us that it was devised to \u201cprevent frauds and perjuries.\" The legal history of the day indicates that it did more to prevent the perjuries than the frauds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-11\">In plain language the statute was designed to prevent doubt as to certain transactions therein enumerated. The doctrine of part performance was developed in instances where the acts of the parties clearly showed that there could be no legal doubt as to the intentions of the parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-12\">Applying this reasoning to the case the recordation of the deed by B would take the matter out of the statute. The deed then became a matter of public record and doubt resolved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-13\">B is liable to A for the purchase price.

The retention of B of the deed for the period,in which he retained it without payment or tender of payment was lax, as was A, in not demanding the purchase money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-5\">D was an innocent purchaser for value because the extinguishment of an antecedent debt is a good and valuable consideration and D took free of the equities existing between the various parties. The recordation of the deed by C made a good record title and his deed to D put title in D as it was the laxity of A in delivering a deed to C which resulted in the record title having been made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-6\">D has title as against A and B.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-7\">Question No. 28.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-8\">For value then received, Jones executed and delivered to Smith the following instrument:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-9\">\u201cFairview, State of Magenta, October 23, 1938.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-10\">I.

As explained by the respondent board, such failure on the part of petitioner is due to the fact that \u201cAt recent examinations a total of twenty-nine questions have been given, of which, <em>through the use of options, </em>each applicant has been required to answer <em>twenty-six questions </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">The respondents\u2019 return to the order to show cause consists chiefly in a detailed explanation of the system which is employed by the board in preparing the questions proposed to be submitted to applicants for admission, as well as the method used in grading the respective answers of such applicants thereto. However, such answer of the respondents also contains several independent allegations of fact which appear to have some material bearing on the question submitted for consideration by this court. Among the other facts thus presented it may be noted that, at least in the first instance, if ever, neither any member of the board of governors of The State Bar, nor any member of its \u201ccommittee of bar examiners\u201d ever reads or grades the answers which theretofore have been made or given by any applicant for admission to practice; but it appears that in the first instance that arduous and all-important duty is delegated to at least fifteen <em>\u201crecent graduates of a number of different law schools, </em>out-of-state, as well as California\u201d, and that to each such \u201creader\u201d is assigned not more than two questions \u201cin fields for which he is particularly equipped\u201d. However, notwithstanding the lack of practical experience of such \u201creaders\u201d in the practice of the law, by the respondents\u2019 answer herein it appears that \u201cpetitioner\u2019s answers to said examination questions were carefully, fully, and completely read and graded by a corps of <em>competent, </em>efficient, trained and <em>highly shilled </em>readers, particularly chosen for their ability to perform this special service\u201d.

The scope of the analyses has been increased only so that an applicant who includes a discussion <em>which is not necessary </em>for <em>full </em>credit, but which, nevertheless, is relevant, <em>may be given a bonus.\u201d </em>The \u201canalyses\u201d or <em>formulae </em>to which reference has been had are thus defined: \u201cThere is prepared for each question a <em>thorough analysis, </em>complete not only with statements of the <em>weight of authority </em>and minority rules for <em>each </em>legal problem, amply supported by the citation of pertinent authorities, but also with an exposition of the various views and approaches of different authorities, and including an application of the relevant rules to the particular facts.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">In the first place, it might be interesting to learn when, where, and under what particular circumstances the said \u201crecent graduates of different law schools\u201d were distinguished as \u201chighly skilled\u201d; and by whom they were originally declared so entitled? On a careful consideration of their work in the instant matter, it would seem just possible that they have not sustained their reputation. But that conclusion, of course, would be but a matter of opinion, regarding which experts (if any) as well as individual, common lawyers might differ, one from the other, or the others.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">As may be noted, on the face of the respective answers here under consideration nothing appears that is indicative of any credit which was given to any item that properly was involved in the total credit,\u2014the only showing being that 20, or 30, or 60, or some other per cent was accorded. Anyone who has had occasion to .observe the grades which may have been given by different, independent, \u201cnon-expert\u201d graders on examination questions will readily attest the statement that a difference of 25, 50 or 75 per cent may be, and frequently has been discovered. In the instant matter, that fact is illustrated by a comparison of the respective grades that were given by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>the \u201chighly skilled . . . recent graduates of different law schools\u201d and those which were accorded by Mr. McGinnis. For example: by the former, to petitioner\u2019s answer given to question No. 1 he was awarded 45 per cent,\u2014whereas by the latter he was credited with 85 per cent; on question No. 2 the \u201chighly skilled\u201d gentleman thought petitioner had earned a credit of 30 per cent, although Mr. McGinnis was of the opinion that 76 per cent was nearer the correct mark; on question No. 3 the respective marks were 35 and 85; and on No. 4 the grades were 30 by the one and 75 by the other. In such circumstances, it would seem impossible that any person, however learned, might accurately and with any assurance assert that any given answer was entitled to be rated as \u201cperfect\u201d. But however difficult of solution the problem of grading such answers may be, unquestionably the announced conclusion would be more graciously received by an unsuccessful applicant, and more readily approved by the bar in general, if the fact were widespread and greatly publicized that the answers to the Questions had been graded by long-experienced, liberal-minded lawyers of unquestioned ability and integrity, rather than by recent law graduates of whatever skill they might possess and however rightfully they might be entitled to the laurels which by someone had been accorded to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Remembering that the instant proceeding is before this court by reason of its issuance of an order directed to the <em>respondents </em>\u201cto sIloav cause why he [petitioner] should not be admitted to practice law in this state\u201d (page 1 of majority opinion),\u2014-paragraph VII of the respondents\u2019 \u201cReturn to Alternative Writ of Mandate ...\u201d presents a point of considerable interest. Said paragraph is as follows: \u201cThe respondents allege that the records of the Committee of Bar Examiners show that this petitioner is <em>not qualified </em>for admission to practice law in this state <em>as indicated by the fact that he had taken eight examinations </em>since the year 1926, at <em>none </em>of which has he been successful, although each examination was determined on its own merits and in each instance all books remained anonymous during the grading period.\u201d (Emphasis added.) And clearly as implying emphasis to that point, in their brief herein the respondents again refer to petitioner\u2019s \u201crecord\u201d\u2014for the very apparent purpose of supplying a good reason for not making a recommendation to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>the effect that petitioner be admitted to the practice of law within this state. Such reference in the respondents\u2019 brief is as follows, to wit: \u201cThe petitioner, John E. Staley, is a man 50 years of age. In June 1926 he first took a bar examination in California. He <em>failed </em>that examination. He <em>has subsequently failed </em>the examinations given in August 1927, August 1928, July 1929, April 1930, August 1930, February 1934, and October 1939. In each examination his papers were anonymous when graded. <em>He seeks admission to the bar of California despite this record.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) And as though to clinch the fairness of the respondents\u2019 conclusion that petitioner was not nor ever could be entitled to practice law in this state, on the \u201cfly leaf\u201d of their brief herein the respondents include the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-5\">\u201cQUESTION INVOLVED. <em>A person who has failed to pass eight examinations </em>given by the Committee of Bar Examiners seeks admission on a petition alleging his answers to the October 1939 examination were arbitrarily and capriciously graded but alleging no facts to substantiate such charge. . . . The petition for rehearing having been granted and an alternative writ of mandate issued the issue is: Does the petition state facts sufficient to entitle the petitioner to the relief prayed for ? \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">In other words, according to the pleading and the brief of the respondents,\u2014irrespective of petitioner\u2019s integrity and his ability as illustrated by his respective answers to the several questions which were propounded to him,\u2014the asserted fact that on each of seven previous examinations petitioner failed to be accredited a passing grade constitutes its real <em>cause, </em>and in and of itself presents a good and sufficient reason for a recommendation by the board of bar governors that in the instant matter the petition for admission to practice law in this state should be peremptorily denied. Basically, such a suggestion or conclusion is manifestly unfair and unjust.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">However, in apparent contradiction of such conclusion, in another connection in the respondents\u2019 answer may be noted the allegation that \u201cno factor other than the applicant\u2019s work on the examination <em>has any bearing </em>upon his success or failure in the examination\u201d. The purport of that language is that whatever may be petitioner\u2019s background, scholastically or otherwise, or however extensive and varied and otherwise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>important may have been his life-work, or his experience or his training in the law, in business, or in other pursuits of life, or whatever may be his established\u2014practical or demonstrated\u2014fitness to practice law by reason of his general legal or other knowledge, or his integrity,\u2014none of nor all such and other qualifications has or have <em>\u201cany </em>bearing\u201d but, to the contrary, count for naught. Therefore, it would seem that no reason appears for an applicant, prior to being granted permission to take the examination, to be required to make any showing regarding either or any of such various or other matters hereinbefore set forth. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">As related to the system employed by the respondents in grading answers to questions, it should be obvious that in grading an examination paper the giving of \u201ca <em>bonus\u201d </em>to any applicant <em>\u201cwho includes a discussion which is not necessary for full credit, but which, nevertheless, is relevant\u201d </em>may or might result in unjust discrimination as to other applicants. As a single illustration of how such rule injuriously may have affected petitioner, it is clear that if on examination of the several questions and the respective answers made thereto by petitioner it should appear that in reality, as to one or several answers, he was entitled to \u201ca perfect mark\u201d, the fact that he was not accorded a bonus as to one particular answer, or a bonus as to each of several different answers, may have unjustly affected his total appropriate credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Contained within the respondents\u2019 \u2018\u2018Return to Alternative Writ of Mandate and Brief on Behalf of the State Bar\u201d is the allegation that \u201cAt that examination [October, 1939] 718 applicants for admission to practice were examined and of that number 254 were found to have passed the examination and were certified to this court and recommended for admission to practice law in the State of California. Respondents have discharged the duties imposed upon them by law in connection with said examination and the Committee of Bar Examiners has heretofore exercised <em>the best judgment which it has in the premises </em>and has rendered to this court its carefully considered determination as to the result of that examination and has already moved the admission of those applicants which it in good conscience could recommend to the court.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Apparently that allegation, in its entirety, was made inadvertently or, if not, it must have been made for the express purpose of inviting adverse and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>drastic criticism with regard to <em>the best judgment </em>of the committee. And although the respondents have placed themselves in that vulnerable position, it may be that the dignity of the court should forbid any direct response to the invitation thus extended.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Suggested as a matter of great consequence, and as impliedly constituting an additional if not an impelling reason why petitioner should not be permitted to practice law in this state,\u2014in effect, the respondents assert that petitioner was afforded a reasonable period of time to consider the questions and to make his respective written answers thereto, in that he was allowed 48 minutes for each answer. In that regard, the statement of the respondents is as follows: \u2018 \u2018 Inasmuch as applicants at the present time are required to answer twenty-six questions given in six three-and-one-half-hour sessions, they have an average of <em>slightly more than 48 minutes for each anstver.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">In that connection, further requirements on the part of such applicants are set forth by the respondents as follows: \u201cAll questions on the examination are of the long-form or essay type. They consist of a hypothetical case involving <em>several </em>principal points of law and require from the applicant <em>careful analysis of the facts </em>presented and <em>a full discussion of the legal problems </em>involved. The questions are from 200 to 300 words in length and are so expressed as not <em>unduly to confuse the applicant </em>while yet retaining <em>the necessity for legal analysis and a display of legal reasoning.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) In view of the points presented by such statement, it might not be inappropriate to refer to some of the questions (without again setting them forth herein) which petitioner was required to answer, in writing, in the allotted space of 48 minutes. To my mind, the situation presented to an applicant of requiring from him, within such allotted time, a <em>\u201ccareful analysis of the facts\u201d, </em>\u201ca <em>full discussion </em>of the legal problems involved\u201d and <em>\u201ca display of legal reasoning\u201d </em>would be, to say the least, both bewildering and disconcerting, if not actually alarming. It seriously may be questioned whether any reputable lawyer, who has successfully practiced law in this state for a period of 10 years or longer, would consider such a feat possible within a space of 48 minutes, even with respect to any one of the several minor points of law here presented for solution in any of the major <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>questions which the applicant was called upon to answer. Furthermore, as to any one of such major questions, it would be even doubtful that, provided with a well-equipped law office, with all pertinent digests, law reports, secretaries and research workers necessary or advisable for the purpose, any lawyer who valued his good reputation as such would undertake to present, in much less than 48 hours, \u201ca careful analysis of the facts\u201d and \u201ca full discussion of the legal problems involved\u201d, together with \u201ca display of legal reasoning\u201d. And especially would such performance be doubtful where, in addition to the difficulties already present, the said lawyer would have to bear in mind the fact that the correctness of his answer to such question was to be tested, not by a group of experienced, practical and tolerant lawyers, who might recognize the fact that law is not an exact science, but by a body of \u201c15 recent graduates of a number of different law schools \u2019 and that the answer given, to be considered \u201cperfect\u201d, or even entitled to a passing grade, must first be deemed to practically coincide with the \u201canalysis\u201d or formula theretofore prepared by the committee of bar examiners, and thereafter be graded by the said body of \u201crecent graduates\u201d. To my mind, if the conditions prescribed and approved by the respondents, which were required and demanded of petitioner, did not amount to an imposition as to him, and did not result in unfair and unjust treatment as far as he was concerned, it would be difficult to imagine just what conditions should exist in order to invoke the application of the rule reiterated by this court in its opinion in the Salot ease <em>(Salot </em>v. <em>State Bar, </em>3 Cal. (2d) 615 [45 Pac. (2d) 203]). In that case it was intimated that if an unsuccessful applicant for admission to practice law in this state could show that his application was rejected \u201cthrough fraud, imposition or coercion, or that he had been treated unfairly or unjustly\u201d, this court <em>would </em>\u201clisten to his complaint\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">But to return to the specific questions and the respective answers thereto that are involved in this proceeding: In the first place, realizing, if possible, my own lack of legal knowledge, nevertheless, with the fullest confidence I venture to predict that if, for the purpose of passing upon the question of the fitness of petitioner to practice law in this state, the identical questions which were propounded to petitioner and the respective answers that were made thereto by him were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>submitted to a committee composed of 15 average members of the bar, the result of its consideration thereof would be favorable to petitioner, and would be followed by a recommendation by such committee that petitioner be admitted to practice law in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">As hereinbefore has been indicated, most lawyers are painfully cognizant of the fact that law is not an exact science, and that with reference to practically any controversy which involves an admitted set of facts a given conclusion of law regarding the respective rights of the several parties thereto will prove almost impossible of agreement as among any considerable number of practicing attorneys,\u2014which is to intimate that as great a number of attorneys will be found who favor a given legal conclusion as will be found who dissent therefrom. If that were not true, very few actions or suits would ever reach the courts. In every lawsuit, or appeal from a judgment, about as many lawyers appear therein in the interest of the defendant as appear in behalf of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Although it is vigorously asserted by the respondents that they do not require \u201ca perfect answer\u201d to each or any of the questions that are propounded to an applicant, but that, to the contrary, they accord him some credit for an answer that does not agree with their previously prepared \u201canalysis\u201d or formula (provided such answer be logical and well-reasoned) ,\u2014nevertheless, the several grades that were given to petitioner herein on Ms respective answers compel the obvious conclusion that petitioner\u2019s answers could not have been accorded more than a negligible credit in those instances where it was apparent that his answers had failed to agree with the analysis or <em>formulae </em>which previously had been prepared by the respondents. A careful check of the cases that are reported in the last two issued volumes of the reports of the United States Supreme Court reveals the following facts: that 7 eases therein were decided by a vote of 8 to 1 of the honorable justices of that court; that 5 cases were decided by a 7 to 2 vote; that 2 cases were decided by a 6 to 2 vote; 3 cases by a 6 to 3 vote; 3 cases by a 5 to 3 vote; and that 2 cases were decided by a 4 to 3 vote. Another illustration of the inability of judges to agree with respect to the law which should apply to a ease that has been decided on findings of fact is as follows: where an appeal from a judgment has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>been taken to the appellate court, a decision thereon contrary to that of the trial court may be rendered by a 2 to 1 vote of the justices of the said appellate court; thereafter, should a hearing be granted in this court, the decision that was rendered by the appellate court may be reversed by a 4 to 3 vote of the members of this court; and if the case should be one of which the Supreme Court of the United States will or may take cognizance, the decision therein may be rendered by a 5 to 4 vote, by which the judgment theretofore rendered by this court will be reversed. Such is the certainty of the law! From which it should follow that the opinion of one lawyer may be deemed to be as.good as that of any other, and that each of such opinions is entitled to respect, dependent on the reasoning which may be urged or presented in its support,\u2014at least until after a final decision on the issue therein involved has been rendered by the court of last resort.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">As though constituting an additional argument why petitioner should not be accorded the relief sought by him, the respondents direct attention to the fact that when the bar examination under consideration was conducted, although there were 718 applicants for admission to practice law in this state, 463 of that total number were unsuccessful. In that connection, considering the several statutory requirements of an applicant under .the age of 25 years with which he must comply before he may even take the examination,\u2014 which include \u201cat least 2 years of college work\u201d, graduation either from \u201ca law school accredited by the examining committee requiring substantially the full time of its students for three years\u201d or \u201cfrom a law school accredited by the examining committee requiring a part only of its students\u2019 time for four years\u201d, or the study of law \u201cdiligently and in good faith for at least four years\u201d,\u2014to my mind, it amounts to a practical demonstration that there is something radically wrong with the system that is pursued by the respondents in conducting the examination and in grading the answers of the applicants to the questions presented to them. Certainly it taxes one\u2019s confidence in the fairness of an examination which will admit of the \u201cflunking\u201d of 463 out of a total of 718 duly accredited applicants. It must be apparent that, ordinarily, young men under the age of 25 years who have had \u201cat least 2 years of college work\u201d, and Avho after 3 or 4 years of study therein have been graduated from an accredited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>law school, should not, and I am persuaded would not, be unsuccessful in the taking of any fairly-conducted bar examination. The law does not demand, nor has the public any right to expect, <em>perfection </em>in legal knowledge by any person before he may be permitted to practice law in this state. The principal quality to be possessed by such an applicant should be that of personal integrity; and I suggest that if in the future the respondents were to devote a fair percentage of their official time to the task of considering and determining whether an applicant for admission to practice law in this state be unreservedly and unquestionably entitled to be respected as an honest person, and that as a matter of right and justice he should merit the entire confidence of all respectable and respected citizens, whether of this state or elsewhere,\u2014a greater and more meritorious service to the general public would be performed than may be secured by an academic examination of an applicant regarding the questioned legal ownership by John Brown or Peter Smith of either \u201cBlackacre\u201d or \u201cWhiteaere\u201d, or, indeed, whether a good title would dr could be secured by a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser of a pair of shoes that was made from leather which was obtained from the hide of Nellie\u2019s or Bossy\u2019s calf (see question No. 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">\u25a0The fact that a considerable number of the applicants to practice law in this state were successful in the examination here in question may not be considered as proof that imposition or unfairness was not exercised or present on the part of the respondents in conducting the examination. Rather, on a consideration of the questions that were propounded to the applicants as well as of the various and sundry conditions which were attached to the examination, as hereinbefore has been indicated, to my mind, the result simply is suggestive of the thought that those who were successful were cither of superintelligence as compared to the less fortunate applicants, or that each of the successful applicants was a \u201cguesser\u201d of superlative ability.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">Additionally, perhaps it should not be intimated that if, as a condition to continued tenure of office as a member of the Supreme Court of this state, each of such members were required to take and to successfully pass a yearly examination under conditions similar to those which were imposed upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>petitioner herein,\u2014it would be safe to surmise, if not to assert, that as a result thereof (with certain well-recognized exceptions thereto\u2014to which exceptions I lay no claim to membership) opportunities to the governor of this state to make appointments to fill vacancies on this bench probably would be approximately identical with the number of members of this court. However, of course in no event should such a suggested requirement (in principle) be extended to apply to the membership of any other state agency!</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Although precedents may be found and so-called \u201cauthorities\u201d may be cited to the effect that no person has a vested right to practice law in this state, nevertheless from the fact that a constitutional privilege inheres in the individual to exert and to use his faculties and energy in any manner that he may see fit,\u2014subject to pertinent constitutional inhibitions and statutory regulations,\u2014a citizen does possess a right to practice law, equally with his right to adopt and to pursue any other vocation, trade or calling. That right is a valuable asset of property\u2014as much as is a right or interest in any other kind of property, real or personal; and the denial of the privilege to practice law usually inflicts a more severe loss to the rejected applicant than would be represented by the total loss to the average man of like age of all his assets of every kind or nature. And the damage suffered by the former may not be, and generally is not, confined to a short or limited period of time following the refusal of the requested privilege, but, to the contrary, may pursue him during a long period of succeeding years, or even throughout his remaining lifetime. The examination of applicants for admission to practice law thus becomes an extremely important matter; and the examiner or person entrusted with the final disposal of so valuable a right should be mindful thereof in the conduct of such examination and the determination of the question presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Ordinarily, under our system of government, the determination of conflicting rights or privileges of individuals as between or among themselves, or of the state, is entrusted to judicial officers. Such officers should not be chosen solely because of their admitted theoretical or academic knowledge of the law. Something more than that should be required. They should be, and usually are, chosen or delegated to so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>act not merely for the reason that they are presumed to be learned in the law, but rather, particularly, because of their known integrity, open-mindedness and general tolerance in thought regarding human affairs,\u2014and, if practicable, because of their long and varied experience in considering or in dealing with the solution of problems which have affected or which may seriously affect vital interests of their fellows.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">All the respondents herein, and including the \u201creaders\u201d who are \u201chighly skilled . . . recent graduates of different law schools\u201d may be, and presumably are, possessed to a marked degree of each and all of the assumed desirable qualifications to which reference just has been had. In that regard, no complaint is or perhaps properly may be made excepting that with respect to the group last mentioned it is obvious that the members thereof could not have had such a length of experience in the practice of the law as might seem desirable.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">It is doubtful that if any member of the board of governors of The State Bar, or of the committee of examiners, were to represent a client who was a party in any litigated cause which involved a decision regarding a property right, great or small, he would be willing to have such right determined by any one or more of a group of \u201chighly skilled . . . recent graduates of different law schools\u201d. To the contrary, at least as far as might be possible or practicable, it is most probable that he would insist upon having a decision made or rendered by a regularly elected or appointed and thoroughly qualified judge, whether or not such officer possessed each and all of the recognized qualifications for his office.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">It seems irresistibly to follow that in the matter of such great importance as that of determining whether an applicant should be admitted to practice law in this state the determination thereof should rest with some person or persons of learning and experience equal to that confidently expected to be possessed by a judicial officer of the government of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">To my mind, it becomes manifest that petitioner has sustained the burden which by the terms of the majority opinion is declared to rest upon him,\u2014that is, \u2018 \u2018 to show \u2019 \u2019 either in what manner he was imposed upon, or wherein the conclusion of the board, as to petitioner, was unfair or unjust.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>In my opinion, the petition should be granted, and petitioner be admitted to practice law in all the courts of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-3\">Carter, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">A petition for a rehearing was denied February 27, 1941.
