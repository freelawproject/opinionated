P. Andrews Paper Company, to subject to a landlord\u2019s lien a soda fountain sold by appellee company, Southern Soda Fountain Company, to appellant\u2019s tenant under a conditional sale agreement. From a judgment holding the contract good as against appellant\u2019s lien the ease comes here on appeal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-12\">It appears that on April 1, 1914, appellant leased certain premises in the city of Washington to the Lady Fairfax Candy Company. On April 27, 1914, appellee company sold to the candy company a soda, fountain upon a conditional sale contract in usual form, whereby the title was to remain in the vendor until the purchase price was paid in full. The contract, though dated April 27th, was not acknowledged until May 29th, and not recorded until dune 4th. Thus, more than one month elapsed between the date of the contract and the date when it was recorded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-13\">It is contended by counsel for appellant that the contract is void as against third parties, since it was not recorded within ten days from its dale. The sections of the District Code relied upon are as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number><em>\u201cSee. </em>546. Recording.\u2014No bill of sale or mortgage or deed of trust * * * shall be valid and effectual to pass the title therein * * * unless the same be executed, acknowledged, and within ten days from the date of such acknowledgment recorded in the same manner as deeds of real estate, and * * such instrument shall be operative only from the time within said ten days when it is delivered to the recorder of deeds to be recorded.

D. Rosenberg </em>and <em>Mr. John Ridout </em>for the appellant:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b116-6\">There never has been any effective record of the conditional sale contract, so that the appellant stands in the same relation to the situation as if said conditional sales contract had never been recorded, and under the expression contained in section 547, D. C. Code, \u201cthird persons acquiring title to said property from said purchaser,\u201d the appellant in respect to his lien for rent is as fully protected as if it were literally a purchaser of the property in question in the ordinary acceptation of the term. <em>Bryan </em>v. <em>Sanderson, </em>3 McArth. 431; <em>Hechtman </em>v. <em>Sharp, </em>3 McArth. 90; <em>Beall </em>v. <em>White, </em>94 U.

Dawson Williams </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b117-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>Mr. Justice Van Orsdel</author>\n<p id=\"A7C\">delivered the opinion of the Court:</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">If will be observed that the statute requires that the instrument shall be recorded within ten days after acknowledgment. That was done in this instance. In other words, record is required within ten days after the instrument is made recordable by the act of acknowledgment There is nothing in the law which requires that acknowledgment of the instrument be of its date, and, unless the delay in' acknowledging be unreasonable and intervening rights accrue during the period of delay, the recorded instrument will have the same force and effect as if acknowledged on the date of its execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">But, passing over the doubtful proposition that a landlord\u2019s lien in this District is embraced within the provision of the statute requiring a vendor to record a conditional sale contract as a proteeton \u201cagainst third persons acquiring title to said property from said purchaser without notice of the ternas of said sale,\u201d we come to the single issue essential to the disposition of this appeal. Any lien that appellant may have had against the chattels of the candy company situated on the leased premises did not attach until long after the contract was recorded. The lease was for a term of twenty-one months, and the rent was payable in equal monthly instalments of $250 each on the first day of each month. The rent for which a lien is here claimed was for the months of September, October, and November, 1915, almost fifteen months after the contract was recorded. The indebtedness did not relate back to the beginning of the lease. We have held that where rent is payable in monthly, quarterly, or annual periods the lieu does not extend to rent to accrue for any such period unless the period has actually commenced to run and the landlord\u2019s lien as to that particular instalmeut of rent has become fixed. <em>The Richmond </em>v. Cake, 1 App. D. C. <em>447. </em>In any view of the statute, the failure to record could., at most accrue to the benefit of existing creditors, and not to debts accruing after record.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">As the debt did not accrue until after the contract was recorded, in any view of the law appellant must fail. The judgment is affirmed with costs. <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
