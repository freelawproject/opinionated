Kellogg sold to the applicant\u2019s predecessor the exclusive right to manufacture and sell \u201ctoasted corn flakes\u201d and \u201ctoasted corn flake biscuits,\u201d but did not part with the right to use the name in connection with any other cereal foods; and in a motion to dismiss the oppositions there was contained an averment indicating that the applicant understood that the right to register an essential part of the corporate name of one of the opposers was being challenged,\u2014it was <em>held, </em>reversing a decision of the Commissioner sustaining the motion to dismiss, (1) that there was a suflicieni averment of interest on the part of the opposers (following <em>Natural Food Co. </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>30 App. D.

Kellogg, in trademark opposition proceedings from decisions of the Patent Office tribunals sustaining the motions to dismiss the oppositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-12\">The first opposition involves the word \u201cKellogg\u2019s,\u201d which the applicant seeks to register. In the notice of opposition it is set forth that the Kellogg Food Company and its predecessors for many years have been engaged in the manufacture and sale of foods and food ingredients at Rattle Creek, Michigan, the home of the applicant, and that John H. Kellogg for more than thirty years has devoted a large amount of time to the production of foods and beverages, particularly nut and cereal foods and cereal beverages; that the products of the opposers, including breakfast foods, \u201chave become known throughout the civilized world as \u2018Kellogg Food Company/ \u2018Kellogg Sanitarium/ \u2018Dr. Kellogg/ and \u2018Kellogg\u2019s Foods/ and are all identified as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>opposers\u2019 products; \u201d that in about the rear 1906 said John H. Kellogg sold to the applicant\u2019s predecessor the exclusive right within the United States to manufacture, sell, and deal in \u201cToasted Com Flakes\u201d and \u201cToasted Corn Flake Biscuit,\u201d but did not part with the right to use the name \u201cKellogg\u2019s\u201d in connection with any other cereal foods; that thereafter litigation arose' which was terminated by an agreement, a copy of which was attached to the notice of opposition. Under the terms of that agreement opposers agreed not to use the word \u201cKellogg\u2019s\u201d \u201cas a part of the name or title or designating words of <em>flaked cereal food, </em>made or sold by them, or either of them. Flaked cereal food to include biscuits made from flaked cereals.\u201d This restriction was to apply to the United States only. It thus appears that the agreement is in accord with the averment in the notice of opposition that the sale to applicant\u2019s predecessor was limited to flaked cereal food.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">In applicant\u2019s motion to dismiss it is averred that neither of the opposers shows any right whatever to the name \u201cKellogg\u201d or \u201cKellogg\u2019s.\u201d The Examiner of Interferences ruled, first, that there was no sufficient averment of interest on the part of the opposers, and, second, that the notice of opposition did not raise the question as to the right of applicant to.register <em>its </em>corporate name. Both of these rulings were challenged before the Assistant Commissioner, but he sustained the decision of the Examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Both grounds of the opposition should have been sustained. It is clearly averred that the opposers\u2019 products of the same general descriptive properties were known as \u201cKellogg\u2019s\u201d foods before applicant\u2019s entry into the field, and the agreement to which applicant was a party inferentially recognizes opposers\u2019 interest, in the name. <em>Natural Food Co. </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>30 App. D. C. 348; <em>Electro Steel Co. </em>v. <em>Lindenberg Steel Co. </em>43 App. D. C. 270. As to the second ground, it is apparent from the averment of the motion to dismiss that applicant understood that the right to register an essential part of the <em>name of the opposers </em>was being challenged, and it further appears that the question was pressed before both tribunals. The decision in <em>Rockwood </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number><em>Pottery Co. </em>v. <em>A. Whilhelm Co. </em>43 App. D. C. 1, therefore, does not apply. In that case it was held merely that such a question could not be raised for the first time in this court. The statute clearly prohibits such a registration. <em>Asbestone Co. </em>v. <em>Philip Carey Mfg. Co. </em>41 App. D. C. 507; <em>Mansfield Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co. </em>44 App. D. C. 205; <em>Re United Drug Co. </em>44 App. D. C. 209; <em>D. H. Burrell &amp; Co. v. Simplex Electric Heating Co. </em>44 App. D. C. 452.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">The second opposition involves the proposed registration of the words, \u201cKellogg\u2019s Toasted Rice Bubbles,\u201d the use of which, it is alleged, commenced in 1915. In addition to the averments in the prior opposition, opposers allege the manufacture and sale for many years of rice products in various forms, known as cereal breakfast foods. Applicant filed a disclaimer to the words \u201cKellogg\u2019s,\u201d \u201cToasted,\u201d and \u201cRice,\u201d \u201capart from the mark shown in the drawing.\u201d Opposers\u2019 interest appearing, it is necessary merely to refer to our recent decisions in <em>Nairn Linoleum Co. </em>v. <em>Ringwall Linoleum Co. ante, </em>64, and <em>O. &amp; W. Thum Co. v. Dickinson, ante, </em>306, present term.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">The decision in each case is reversed and the opposition sustained. <em>Reversed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">Mr. Chief Justice Covington, of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, sat with the Court in the hearing and determination of this appeal in the place of Mr. Chief Justice Shepard.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
