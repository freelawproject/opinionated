Trimble to recover the possession of five promissory notes for $1,000 each from the District National Bank. The notes were executed July 12, 1904, by Washington Nailor, payable three years after date, with 4-| per cent interest, to the order of Francis P. Morse, and secured by trust deed upon real estate of said Nailor. They were indorsed with the name of Francis P. Morse, \u201cwithout recourse.\u201d Washington Nailor died, and bis estate passed to Mrs. Trimble and her sister Mrs. Clark, who were bis heirs at law, subject to the said trust deed. Mrs. Clark was not prepared to pay her proportion of the notes, and Mrs. Trimble paid them July 12, 1910, but they were not stamped as canceled. The certificate of title, expired trust deeds, tax certificates, and insurance policy were received and kept by Mrs. Trimble. Mrs. Clark wished to continue to pay interest on the notes until she could pay her proportion, and Mrs. Trimble, who kept a bank account with Lewis Johnson <em>&amp; </em>Company, delivered the notes to them for safe-keeping and for the purpose of receiving the interest on them. The interest was paid half yearly by a real estate firm, and all that Lewis Johnson &amp; Company did was to receive the money and place it to the credit of Mrs. Trimble. The notes were not hypothecated to Lewis Johnson &amp; Company, but only deposited for safe-keeping, and they had nothing to do save to receive the interest when paid. Mrs. Trimble demanded he,r notes, but they were not delivered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-7\">Defendant introduced proof tending to show that on October 27, 1914, Lewis Johnson &amp; Company executed a note to the District National Bank for $11,000, payable on demand.

October 23xd, Lewis Johnson &amp; Company deposited with the bank, when their account was considerably overdrawn, two drafts for $1,000 each. These were returned protested.

The notes had been paid at maturity by plaintiff, who was jointly bound on them with Mrs. Clark. Mrs. Clark became indebted to plaintiff for one half of the amount of the notes by reason of plaintiff\u2019s payment of the whole amount, and plaintiff was merely subrogated to the right of Morse for her protection. The notes were paid, and there was no attempt to put them in circulation again. They were deposited with Lewis Johnson &amp; Company for the receipt of interest thereon. They had possession of them for safe-keeping merely and the receipt of the interest, and the bank was bound to investigate and inquire into their title. The transfer of the notes to defendant was a mere bailment for a particular purpose, and it could pass no title. <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>6 Wall. 492, 18 L. ed. 931. The sellers could pass no better title than they had themselves. See also <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>United States, </em>113 U. S. 476-479, 28 L. ed. 1044, 1045, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 588.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">While we feel that this disposes of the case, wo may consider the contention of the defendant that it took title by estoppel for this is the only way in which one cotdd obtain title to a promissory note against the true owner after its maturity. The defendant knew that the notes were more than seven years past due, and made no inquiry whatever. The maker of the notes was dead, and while it is true that interest had been paid upon them regularly, this was part of the understanding with which they were left with Lewis Johnson &amp; Company. They, in violation of their trust, undertook to assign the notes to the bank as collateral security for their overdrafts. If they could procure title to the notes under such circumstances, their situation would be the same as a purchaser without notice before maturity.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">The judgment was right and is affirmed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\"><em>A </em>motion for a reargument was denied April 27, 1917.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
