Stat. 1910, \u00a7 9490), providing that no mark consisting merely of words \u201cwhich are descriptive of the goods with which they are used, or of the character or quality of such goods\u201d shall be registered under the act (citing <em>Re Meyer Bros.

C. 591) ; and the fact that the applicant for registration has exclusively used the word as a trademark for lieat-insulating materials containing cork for more than ten years prior to the passage of the Trademark Act, and lias registered it under the ten-year proviso of that act, does not give it such a secondary meaning in respect of cork materials as to make it nondescriptive as to a particular class of such materials.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b34-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>Note.\u2014On descriptive word adopted from foreign language as subject of trademark, see note in- 32 L.11.A..(N,.S.) 439.</syllabus>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b35-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>No. 1054.</docketnumber>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"A7b\">Patent Appeals.</p>\n<otherdate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"A5\">Submitted November 20, 1916.</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Ac\">Decided January 9, 1917.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-6\">Hearing on an appeal from a decision of the Commissioner of Patents denying an application for registration of a word as a trademark.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"Aj\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-7\">The facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b35-8\"><em>Mr. C.

The decision of the Assistant Commissioner was in affirmance of the decision of the Examiner of trademarks and designs refusing registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-12\">The single question presented by this appeal is whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>word \u201cNonpareil\u201d as applied to cork tiling and the like is descriptive of the character or quality of such cork tiling within the meaning of section 5 of the existing Trademark Act. \u201cNonpareil\u201d is undoubtedly a fancy word. It is not an adjective in every-day use by persons to describe the superlative qualities of various articles. The Trademark Act leaves to the court, however, no judicial discretion to determine when an English word, which is in fact descriptive, is sufficiently understood or accepted as to be considered descriptive of the quality of certain goods by a whole people. Section 5 of the act provides broadly that no mark consisting merely of words <em>\"which are descriptive of the goods with which they are used, or of the character or quality of such goods,\u201d </em>shall be registered under the terms of this act. The word \u201cNonpareil\u201d is to-day an English word. It is true that it is a combination of the two Erench words \u201cnon\u201d and \u201cpareil,\u201d but very many other words in 'our language have been likewise etymologically evolved. It is found in all our leading dictionaries as an adjective, and is defined as \u201chaving no equal,\u201d \u201cof unequaled excellence,\u201d and \u201cof unrivaled excellence.\u201d It is therefore unquestionably' an English word descriptive of such quality as might well want to be claimed by any manufacturer of cork tiling.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">This court affirmed a decision of the Commissioner of Patents, holding that the word \u201cTrophy,\u201d associated with a picture of a loving cup, as a trademark for coffee, was descriptive and therefore not entitled to registration, because intended to indicate that the goods were of a superior quality. <em>Re Meyer Bros. Coffee &amp; Spice Co. </em>38 App. D. C. 520. The word \u201cSterling\u201d as a trademark for ale was also held descriptive and declared unregistrable. <em>Worster Brewing Corp. </em>v. Rueter, 30 App. D. C. 428. Likewise unregistrable was said to be the word \u201cCrystal\u201d as applied to beer. <em>Re New South Brewery &amp; Ice Co. </em>32 App. D. C. 591. These cases are in full harmony with the other decisions of this court since the existing Trademark Act became law.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">The applicant urges, however, that having been in exclusive uso of the word \u201cNonpareil\u201d as a trademark for heat-insulating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>materials containing'cork, for more than ten years prior to the passage of the Trademark Act of February 20, 1905, registration has already been bad for it under the section of that act known as the \u201cten-year proviso,\u201d and that by reason of the large exclusive use of such trademark, \u201cNonpareil,\u201d in interstale and international commerce as applied to heat-insulating materials, the mark, even if it can be considered abstractly as a descriptive word, has in fact acquired a secondary meaning in respect of cork materials as simply designating such goods as the applicant\u2019s. The Trademark Act cannot be expanded so as to permit a descriptive word to be registered. To permit such a construction would be to say that a clearly descriptive word, registered as a trademark on certain particular goods of an applicant, would begin to acquire such a secondary, and nondeseriptive meaning, as to be registrable for all classes of similar goods which in years thereafter might he produced by the same applicant. That would entirely nullify the clear legislative intention as to the ten-year proviso.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">The decision will he affirmed, and this decision certified.to the Commissioner of Patents. <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
