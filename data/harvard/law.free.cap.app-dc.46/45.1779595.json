Macwilliam, of the trademark \u201cPresident\u201d for suspenders, on an application filed June 26, 1914. Appellee company also filed a petition for the cancelation of a registration of said mark to Macwilliam under date of May 16, 1899. By consent, the two cases have been heard together. The Examiner of Interferences sustained the opposition, and recommended the cancelation of the 1899 registration. These decisions were affirmed by the Commissioner of Patents, from which this appeal was taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-5\">It appears that a patent for a certain style of suspender was granted to appellant on August 16, 1898. Appellant was at that time engaged in manufacturing the patented suspenders, and had adopted and used as a trademark .thereon the word \u201cPresident,\u201d printed across a red, white, and blue banner. The mark has always been used in connection with this emblem. On October 1, 1898, appellant by written agreement gave an exclusive license to the C. A. Edgarton Manufacturing Company, which subsequently became the appellee company, to manufacture and sell suspenders containing his patented improvements. The license contract carried with it all orders for suspenders then on hand and all stock, machinery, and material which the licensor had, and contained a provision whereby the \u201csaid party of the first part agrees to, and he does hereby, turn over and transfer to the party of the second part, the good will of his present business of manufacturing and selling said suspenders within the United States, and all orders he now has or may hereafter take within the United States for the said suspender.\u201d Under the terms of the contract the license was to continue during the life of the patent, unless sooner terminated under conditions which we need not consider, since the contract was not terminated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-6\">The sole question here is whether the license and good will of the business carried the trademark with it. It was more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>than six months' after the license was granted and appellant had suspended the business of manufacturing and selling \u201cPresident\u201d suspenders that he procured in the Patent Office, at the request of appellee\u2019s predecessor, the registration of the mark. At no time during the life of the patent did appellant manufacture suspenders, or use the mark in controversy. On the other hand, appellee continued during that period to manufacture the patented article and use the mark. It spent $750,000 in advertising the goods manufactured, sold between thirty and forty million pairs of the suspenders, and paid appellant about $500,000 in royalties. The patent expired on August 16, 1916, and appellant again resumed the business of manufacturing \u201cPresident\u201d suspenders, and again resumed the use of the mark: hence this action.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b77-4\"><em>Mr. W.

By use in connection with the business the assignee acquires the title abandoned by the assignor, and the title is of that exclusive character which is entitled to protection even against such assignor. <em>Buffalo Rubber Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Batavia Rubber Co. </em>90 Misc. 418, 153 N. Y. Supp. 779; <em>Huff </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>88 N. J. L. 452, 97 Atl. 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">In the Batavia Rubber Case, the plaintiff manufactured tires and called them \u201cSecurity Tread.\u201d It gave defendant a license to make tires and call them \u201cSecurity\u201d tires. Upon failure of defendant to pay the royalty as agreed, plaintiff attempted to en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>join the use of the word \u201cSecurity.\u201d The court, denying relief, said: \u201cThe plaintiff, when it permitted or gave to the defendant the privilege to use the word in connection with tires made by it.virtually abandoned the right to claim that the word \u2018Security\u2019 in any sense indicated tires manufactured by the plaintiff. It waived and abandoned the use of the word as indicative of origin or ownership.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">It is likewise well settled that the conveyance of a business with its good will, either by sale or license, carries with it a trademark used in connection therewith, whether expressly mentioned in the instrument or not. <em>Merry </em>v. <em>Hoopes, </em>111 N. Y. 415, 18 N. E. 714; <em>Corbett Bros. Co. </em>v. <em>Reinhardt-Meding Co. </em>77 N. J. Eq. 7, 76 Atl. 243; <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Kalamazoo Buggy Co. </em>54 Mich. 215, 52 Am. Rep. 811, 19 N. W. 961, 20 N. W. 545; <em>Allegretti </em>v. <em>Allegretti Chocolate Cream Co. </em>177 Ill. 129, 52 N. E. 487. In the Corbett Case, where by a sale of the entire assets of the partnership everything pertaining to the business was conveyed, the New Jersey court said: \u201cThe transfers were effective to convey to the complainant the trademarks of the partnership, and if the color numbers are part of the trademarks the use of them by defendant company is an infringement of complainant\u2019s property rights derived under the two bills of sale.\u201d In the Allegretti Case the court said: \u201cThe transfer of the property and effects of a business carries with it the exclusive right to use such trademarks or tradenames as have been used in such business. <em>Snyder Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Snyder, </em>54 Ohio St. 86, 31 L.R.A. 657, 43 N. E. 325; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Farrand, </em>88 Mich. 473, 14 L.R.A. 161, 50 N. W. 446; <em>Fish Bros. Wagon Co. </em>v. <em>La Belle Wagon Works (Fish Bros. Wagon Co. </em>v. Fish) 82 Wis. 546, 16 L.R.A. 453, 33 Am. St. Rep. 72, 52 N. W. 595; <em>Merry </em>v. <em>Hoopes, </em>111 N. Y. 415, 18 N. E. 714; <em>Feder </em>v. <em>Benkert, </em>18 C. C. A. 549, 44 U. S. App. 99, 70 Fed. 613.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Inasmuch as appellant had no right to use the mark, having parted with that right at the date when he applied for the earlier registration in 1899, and had no such right when he filed the present application, it follows that the opposition must be sustained. A trademark right depends upon use. Appellant not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>only ceased to use the mark, but parted with the business with \u201cwhich its use was connected. Title to the mark could not exist apart from the business, and the contract contained no provision by which appellant could recover the business, and without the business no right existed in the mark. The license extended during the life of the patent. The iimmtion then became public, and appellee could continue the business which it acquired and the use of the mark in connection therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-3\">Appellant, when he conveyed the business to which the mark belonged, conveyed with it the right to use the mark, and when appellee\u2019s right to continue the business became absolute with the expiration of the patent, it had acquired a title to the use of the mark of which it could not be devested by appellant after an abandonment of actual use by him for almost eighteen years. Appellant\u2019s title was not such that he could convey it to appellee, abandon the use of tire mark, and, after this long lapse of time, regain the use in derogation of the right of appellee company. All the title appellant ever had in the mark was a right to use it in the particular business to which it belonged. Registration confers no higher title. As was said by the court in <em>Thomas G. Carroll &amp; Son Co. </em>v. <em>McIlvaine &amp; Baldwin, </em>171 Fed. 125: \u201cThe OAvner of a trademark has no estate in the trademark as such, nor does registration confer upon him any monopoly. His position bears no resemblance to that of a patentee. He is entitled to legal protection for his trademark only because bv granting the same the courts protect the business designated or indicated to the public mind by the trademark.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">It may well be that had appellee company defaulted in its contract, and the business had reverted to appellant before the expiration of the patent and the contract, the right to the use of the mark would also have reverted: but this did not occur, and appellee, succeeding to the right with the expiration of the patent to continue the manufacture of the goods, cannot be deprived of the mark which it acquired from appellant in the fulfilment of its contract in good faith. It is entitled to use it so long as it continues in the business to Avhich the mark belongs.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">The decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>and the clerk is directed to certify these proceedings as by' law required. <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Mr. Justice Gould, of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, sat with the Court in the hearing and determination of this appeal, in the place of Mr. Chief Justice Shepard.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
