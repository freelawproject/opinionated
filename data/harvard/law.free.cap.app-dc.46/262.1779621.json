In the present case the District was unable to find a purchaser for this property at the annual tax sale. No person could he found who was willing to invest his money in this property, as he knew he would be facing litigation with a rich and powerful corporation. Therefore, under the statute, the District of Columbia became the purchaser with power to sell at public or private sale to satisfy the taxes, but has been unable to sell. Where a statutory remedy is provided, diere cannot be a resort to a court at common law for the enforcement of the tax. 1 Cooley, Taxn. 3 7-19; 2 Cooley, Taxn. 836; Burroughs, Taxn. page 4 and page 253, section 105; 4 Dill.

The supreme court, in <em>Lane. Co. </em>v. <em>Oregon, </em>7 Wall. 71-79, held that a debt did not include taxes imposed by legislative authority.

The remedies found in the general statutes relating to the collection of taxes are not available. 2 Sutherland, Stat. Const. section 407; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Snyder, </em>193 Mich. 325, 53 N. W. 359 ; <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>People, </em>120 Ill. 234, 11 N. E. 202. If the court should be of the opinion, after a consideration of the provisions of the statutes, that no mode of collection is provided for, then the resort to a court of equity was entirely proper under the peculiar circumstances.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-5\">4. The streets, avenues, and alleys closed for the use of the terminal company were the property of the United States, and, prior to their occupation by the defendant, were not the subject of taxation. Upon their occupation and use by the defendant they became subject to taxation as other property, under the terms of the statutes; but the title is still in the United States. This did not mean that they should become the subject of sale for delinquent taxes. If it did, then the anomalous situation would arise of the property of the United States becoming subject to a tax sale because of delinquent taxes, and a good title, possibly, passing into the hands of strangers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-6\">Is it not the saner construction that Congress omitted, because of the very peculiar circumstances, any method for collection ?</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b296-7\"><em>Mr. George E.

The jurisdiction of the equity court cannot be sustained either on the theory that the taxes levied in this case constitute a lien upon the property or became a debt against the owner or occupier thereof which can be enforced by a bill in the nature of a creditor\u2019s suit. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>District of Columbia, </em>6 Mackey, 21; 2 Cooley, Taxn. 3d ed. p. 865; <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Pratt, </em>8 Wheat. 681.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-5\">4.

The claim as sued on is for taxes for the years 1910, 1911, 1912, and 1913. The 1910 tax was due and payable, according to law, in May, 1910, and the property was sold for default in payment of the taxes in March, 1911; and, in the same manner, the 1911 tax was due in May, 1911, and the property was sold for default in March, 1912; and the tax for 1912 was due and payable in May, 1912, and the property was sold for default in March, 1913; the tax for the year 1913 was due in May, 1913, and the property was sold for default in March, 1914.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-8\">As to some of these taxes it therefore appears that they were due and payable more than three years before the filing of this suit, and as to some of them it appears that the period allowed by law to the property owner within which he can redeem his property from tax sale, to wit, two years from the date of said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>sale, had not yet expired, and as to such taxes, if this proceeding is allowed to go on, it will have the effect of depriving the property owner of the absolute right to redeem his property, given him by the taxing statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-4\">If the tax when levied is a debt, then the statute would begin to run from the time the debt is due and payable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-5\">The provision of the law of limitations that applies on this subject is sec. 1265 D.

It is not contended by the terminal company that Congress did not possess authority to levy such an impost upon the occupied streets and avenues in question, but that an intent to do so does not appear from the language employed. The location and construction of this great terminal, with its arterial connections, was an enterprise of an enduring character. This was well known to Congress, as will be apparent from an examination of the acts authorizing it. Congress might have provided not only for the abandonment of the streets and avenues in question, but for the acquisition of title thereto by the terminal company, in which event that company would have been compelled to expend a large sum of money at the outset and thereafter pay taxes on the land acquired. Evidently desiring to relieve the company of so great a burden, permission was given to occupy these streets and avenues as though the title really was in the terminal company. In other words, all the benefits of actual ownership were conferred upon the terminal company so long as it carried out tire purposes for which it was created. There was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>special reason, therefore, for the provision that property <em>occupied </em>by the company should be taxable.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">N or is there anything in the proviso of said see. 6 inconsistent with the intent that occupied property should he subject to taxation. Largely for the benefit of the public certain bridges, tunnels, viaducts, and retaining walls were required to be constructed, and the first proviso simply eliminates from taxation such artificial structures, leaving the taxes to he assessed upon the unimproved land \u201cowned or occupied by the terminal company.\u201d But if such structures are to he used for storage or like commercial purposes, they are subject to taxation under the second proviso, the terms of which are inconsistent with the claim that it was not the intent of Congress to tax land merely occupied by the company. That proviso clearly includes structures located upon land occupied as well as upon laud owned by the terminal company. We rule, therefore, that the abandoned streets and avenues occupied by the terminal company are subject to taxation. A different conclusion would require us to disregard the plain words of the statute and the obvious intent of Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">What provision, if any, was made for the assessment and collection of these taxes? The first part of sec. 6, above quoted, declares that this property shall be subject to taxation \u201cin the same manner and to the same extent as other property in the District,\u201d while in the second proviso the words used are \u201cin the same manner as other property in the District of Columbia.\u201d The District authorities proceeded upon the assumption that these words authorized ihe sale of the property taxed, for delinquent taxes. We do not think so. In the first place, the language used evidently refers only to the maimer and measure of the assessment. The words used are \u201cshall be subject to taxation,\u201d etc. No provision whatever is made for the collection of the taxes to be assessed, and it is a well-known rule that the language of such taxing acts will not be enlarged by construction. Thus a drainage law providing that drainage taxes should be <em>collected </em>in the same maimer as general taxes was held not to adopt the penalty provision of the latter law. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number><em>Jackson Fire Clay S. P. &amp; Tile Co. </em>v. <em>Snyder, </em>93 Mich. 325, 53 N. W. 359; <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>People, </em>120 Ill. 234, 11 N. E. 202; 2 Sutherland Stat. Constr. 407. See also <em>Heine </em>v. <em>Levee Comrs. </em>19 Wall. 655, 22 L. ed. 223. In the present case there is not even a provision that the tax shall be collected in the same manner as other taxes. Indeed, as above noted, there is no provision as to how it shall be collected. And there was a reason for this. Congress knew not only that a considerable portion of the land to be occupied by the terminal company would be land of the United States, but that all land \u201cowned or occupied\u201d by the terminal company would be devoted to such a public use as would not permit of interruption or abridgment. The Act of August 14, 1894 (28 Stat. at L. 282, chap. 287), providing for real estate assessments, requires that such assessments shall be \u201cin the name of the owner, or trastee or trustees of the owner thereof.\u201d Congress knew, of course, that the terminal company would be neither the owner nor trustee of the owner of these abandoned streets and avenues, and hence that said act would not be applicable. Congress must have appreciated, also, that this terminal company would be responsible for any taxes levied. For these reasons no provision was made for the sale of any part of this property thus affected by this public use.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Where special provision for the collection of taxes is made, and it is apparent that no other remedy is contemplated, there can be no resort to a common-law action for the enforcement of the tax. 1 Cooley, Taxn. 17, 18, and 19; Burroughs, Taxn. pages 4 and 253; Dill. Mun. Corp. sec. 1414. But, says Mr. Cooley, \u201cinstances have occurred of tax laws which provided for laying the tax, but made no provision whatever for collection. In such case it may well be held that the legislature contemplated the enforcement of the tax by the ordinary remedies.; and therefore, if the tax was assessed against an individual, that assumpsit or debt would lie for the recovery thereof. The same reasoning would support a proceeding in equity to enforce a lien for the tax when assessed, not against an individual, but against property * * *.\u201d In <em>State ex rel. Kansas City, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number><em>St. J. &amp; C. B. R. Co. v. Severance, </em>55 Mo. 378, a law for the taxation of railroads had designated no particular mode for the collection of the tax, but the court adopted what it termed the well-known rule that \u201cwhere a statute creates a right and gives no remedy, the party may resort to the usual remedy applicable to such a case.\u201d See also <em>Oakland </em>v. <em>Whipple, </em>39 Cal. 112; <em>State </em>v. <em>Georgia Co. </em>112 N. C. 34, 19 L.R.A. 485, 17 S. E. 10; <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>201 Mass. 190, 87 N. E. 634. It is plain, however, that there are no equitable grounds upon which this hill may he sustained. There is no lien to enforce, nor does it appear that an action at law would be futile. The decree therefore must be affirmed, with costs. <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">On May 25, 1917, a motion to recall and amend the mandate was granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
