The commission found that petitioners were partially dependent upon their son for their support at the time of his death, and that the \u201cannual amount\u201d that he so devoted to their support was four hundred dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> Nowhere in the Workmen\u2019s Compensation, Insurance and Safety Law is any rule or basis prescribed for the determination of what shall be deemed to be the \u201cannual amount\u201d devoted by a deceased employee to the support of his dependents where, as here, the sums contributed to such support during the year preceding the demise of the injured employee have not been constant, either in amounts or times of payment. In the very nature of the case, the determination of what is such \u201cannual amount,\u2019\u2019 when, as here, the support contributed by the injured employee has fluctuated considerably during the year preceding his demise, must largely rest in the sound discretion of the commission, based upon the evidence before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The deceased employee, Lynn Popst, was injured while in the employ of the Los Angeles Gas &amp; Electric Corporation. During the greater portion of the year immediately preceding the accident he had been in the service of the United States navy. After his discharge from the navy he was unemployed for a considerable period. While in the navy he had contributed a much smaller sum to the support of his parents than during the comparatively short period that he was in the employ of the gas and- electric corporation^ Petitioners, who are dissatisfied with the amount allowed them by the commission in its award for partial dependency, say that the commission\u2019s method of computing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>\u201cannual amount\u201d contributed by their son to their support was incorrect. But the commission did take evidence upon the subject; and it made its finding upon such evidence. Under the circumstances, the \u201cannual amount\u201d was not capable of any mathematically exact measurement. The-conclusion of the commission that, at the date of their son\u2019s death, four hundred dollars was the annual amount contributed by him to his parents\u2019 support, was the determination of a question of fact based upon evidence adduced before and considered by the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> Without intimating that the method of computation adopted by the commission was erroneous or unreasonable, our conclusion is that this court has no power to set aside the award or to remand the ease for further proceedings. \u201cThe findings and conclusions of the commission on questions of fact shall be conclusive and final and shall not be subject to review.\u201d (Subd. C, sec. 67 of the Act; Stats. 1917, p. 876.) \u201cOur authority, with respect to the commission\u2019s conclusions on questions of fact, goes no further than to permit the annulment of an award where the commission\u2019s finding of a fact is without any evidence whatever to support it. Where there is a conflict in the testimony, or where opposing inferences may reasonably be drawn, the commission is the final. arbiter. \u201d <em>(Walker </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>177 Cal. 738, [L. R. A. 1918F, 212, 171 Pac. 954], See, also, <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(Cal.), 177 Pac. 989; <em>San Francisco-Oakland etc. Rys. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>180 Cal. 121, [179 Pac. 386]; <em>Frankfort Gen. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Pillsbury, </em>173 Cal. 56, [159 Pac. 150]; <em>Crosaro1 </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>38 Cal. App. 758, [177 Pac. 489].) What was said by the New York supreme court in <em>Rhyner </em>v. <em>Hueber Bldg. Co., </em>171 App. Div. 58, 156 N. Y. Supp. 904], is worth quoting here: \u201cThe appellant contends that the method of computing the deceased\u2019s wages was incorrect. We think the conclusion reached by the commission was correctly worked out. Of course, we are unable to say what mental processes the commission employed in arriving at the figures given in their decision; but it seems to us that, under the evidence, the figures given might, very properly, have been the result of the method of computation pointed out in subdivision 3 of section 14. But here again a finding of fact, based upon evidence, is presented to us, and \u00a1we are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>powerless to criticise, modify, or revoke. It is not well for this court to fall into the habit of discussing the facts, even for the purpose of showing that the findings of fact are reasonable and meet with our approbation. We cannot, except by usurpation, invade the realm of facts, for it was the clear intent of the legislature that \u2018the decisions of the commission shall be final as to all questions- of fact. \u2019 Of course, if there are no facts, and the decision is arbitrary, unfair, and unreasonable, a question of law 'arises, and we may right the wrong. <em>Matter of Lizzie Gardener </em>v. <em>Horse-heads Construction Co., </em>171 App. Div. 66, [156 N. Y. Supp. 899], handed down herewith. But it is wholly improbable that the commission will make any such decision. The commission is the sole judge and the \u2018final\u2019 judge of the facts, and this court is not only forbidden to trespass upon the jurisdiction of the commission in this field, but, by section 20 of the act, it is circumscribed, oven, in its review of questions of lq,w. It was the purpose of the legislature to create a tribunal to do rough justice\u2014speedy, summary, informal, untechnical. With this scheme of the legislature we must not interfere; for, if we trench in the slightest degree upon the prerogatives of the commission, one encroachment will breed another, until finally simplicity will give way to complexity, and informality to technicality. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">The petition for the writ is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
