It is also provided, however, that a relinquishment of marital rights \u201cshall not be considered to any extent a consideration \u2018in money or money\u2019s worth.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b990-15\">The facts are not in dispute. On May 9, 1942 the decedent and his then wife, Jean W. Watson, entered into a separation agreement, governed by the laws of New York, providing, <em>inter alia, </em>that in consideration of the relinquishment of all other rights in her husband\u2019s estate, Jean, if she survived her husband as wife, or if not his wife was unmarried, should be entitled to receive one third of his net estate, as therein defined; that the husband would provide accordingly by will, but that if he failed to do so Jean\u2019s rights under the agreement would be enforceable against his estate; and that if the parties were legally divorced or separated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b990-16\">\u201cthis agreement shall, nevertheless, remain in full force and effect, and any decree of divorce or of separation * * * shall not contain any provision contrary to the terms of this agreement nor require [the husband] to make any payments of money in excess of those provided for by this agreement, but may have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>incorporated therein any of the provisions of this agreement\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b991-4\">Jean and her husband were divorced in Nevada on January 26, 1943. The Nevada court duly adopted the agreement, and its provisions were incorporated in the divorce decree, which provided \u201cthat the right of the Defendant [Jean] to separate support and maintenance, past, present and future, is adjusted by said agreement, and is hereby decreed in accordance therewith; and that each of the parties have judgment against the other according to the terms of said agreement.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">The decedent died on March 10, 1950, leaving his entire estate to his second wife, Olga S. Watson. Jean, who had not remarried, filed her claim for one-third of the net estate, and was paid by the Executor.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-6\"> The nub of the controversy is whether this claim was \u201cfounded\u201d on the separation agreement, within the meaning of \u00a7 812(b) (3), for if it was, the amount paid by the estate was concededly not a deductible item under that Section.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Commissioner contends that the claim was so \u201cfounded\u201d because the effectiveness of the separation agreement was not contingent on the parties getting divorced, and the agreement also expressly provided that its terms should survive divorce and be the sole measure of the financial obligations of the parties to each other \u2014 the provisions of any decree of divorce to the contrary notwithstanding. That provision is <em>effective </em>under New York law. Goldman v. Goldman, 1940, 282 N.Y. 296, 26 N.E.2d 265. The taxpayer, on the other hand, argues that since the separation agreement was incorporated in the Nevada decree the divorced wife\u2019s claim should be regarded as \u201cfounded\u201d on that decree rather than upon the antecedent agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-10\">Similar questions were presented in Harris v. Commissioner, 1950, 340 U.S. 106, 71 S.Ct. 181, 95 L.Ed. 111, and in Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Maresi, 2 Cir., 1946, 156 F.2d 929, upon which the Tax Court based its decision favorable to the taxpayer. The answer to these opposing contentions turns on how those cases are properly to be read.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-11\">Maresi held deductible from a deceased husband\u2019s gross estate payments initially fixed by a separation agreement which was later incorporated in a divorce decree. The deduction was allowed despite the fact that the effectiveness of the agreement was not conditioned upon divorce, and without regard to any question as to whether the agreement survived the decree of divorce. However, three years later in Harris v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 1949, 178 F.2d 861, Judge Learned Hand, who wrote for the Court in Maresi, would seem to have narrowed the Maresi holding when he stated, 178 F.2d at page 864, that the Court had \u201cviewed the agreement, whose existence as a contract was conditional upon the entry of the [divorce] decree, to be no more than a suggested compromise until confirmed, which the court might or might not choose to accept as the measure of the parties\u2019 obligations, and which became an obligation only by the decree,\u201d and that Maresi \u201cstands for no more than that, when the validity of the settle<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>ment is made conditional upon its adoption by the decree, and when it does not by its terms survive the decree, the payments are not \u2018founded\u2019 upon the \u2018promise or agreement.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In Harris this Court held subject to gift taxes <em>inter vivos </em>payments made by a husband to his divorced wife under an \u201cincorporated\u201d separation agreement, because the agreement expressly survived the divorce decree, even though the agreement did not become operative until divorce. The Court held that the payments were \u201cfounded\u201d as much on the agreement as on the decree, and therefore subject to gift tax.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Supreme Court, however, reversed, holding that the effect of the \u201csurvivorship\u201d clause was simply to give the wife a remedy on contract in addition to that under the decree for failure of the husband to pay, but that for gift tax purposes the husband's payments should be regarded as \u201cfounded\u201d on the decree, and therefore not subject to gift taxes. Harris v. Commissioner, 1950, 340 U.S. 106, 71 S.Ct. 181, 95 L.Ed. 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">While Justice Douglas\u2019 opinion for the majority of the Court cites Maresi with approval, it is not altogether clear whether this was with reference to the original opinion or Judge Hand\u2019s later interpretation of it. Certainly the opinion did not agr-ee with Judge Hand\u2019s second qualification of, Maresi in his Harris opinion \u2014 the \u201csurvivorship\u201d point \u2014 but there is language which might be taken as approving the first qualification \u2014 that the effectiveness of such an agreement must be conditioned on divorce if the husband\u2019s subsequent payments are to escape taxation. See 340 U.S. at pages 110-111, 71 S.Ct. at pages 183-184. On the other hand, these parts of the Supreme Court opinion may be read merely as supporting, rather than as the reason for, the result reached by the Court. That was the view of Harris evidently taken by the First Circuit in McMurtry v. Commissioner, 1953, 203 F.2d 659, where a husband\u2019s payments to his divorced wife were originally fixed by a separation agreement, which was later incorporated in a divorce decree, and were held not subject to gift taxes. In that case the effectiveness of the agreement had not been conditioned on divorce, and Chief Judge Magruder said, 203 F.2d at page 662: \u201cWe read Harris v. Commissioner more broadly as supporting the proposition that, to the extent that the statute does not explicitly command adherence to meaningless formalities, all transfers agreed upon in contemplation of divorce and executed after approval by a divorce court having jurisdiction to give such sanction or in its discretion to prescribe some different property settlement, should be exempt from the gift tax.\u201d In light of what we consider to have been the purposes of \u00a7 812(b) (3), we believe this to-be the correct view of the Harris case.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-8\">These provisions of the Internal Revenue Code were not designed to impede the making of marital agreements, but rather to prevent the use of such agreements simply as a device to minimize taxation. Section 812 permits a deduction for amounts paid in satisfaction of all kinds of claims against an estate. Where such a claim is based on an agreement by the decedent with another, it might have been possible, absent anything more in the statute, for a person to \u201cagree\u201d with one of the objects of his bounty to pay him a certain amount at death, thereby creating a deductible claim against his estate. To obviate that possibility the statute included language limiting the deduction to that part of the claim as was \u201ccontracted bona fide and for an adequate and full consideration in money or money\u2019s worth\u201d. But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>that did not meet completely the situations which the statute sought to avoid. For a married man might contract to give his wife a share of his estate in return for her promise to waive dower or other statutory rights in his estate, and since such an agreement would satisfy the requirement of \u201can adequate and full consideration in * * * money\u2019s worth\u201d, this would leave the Treasury faced with the difficult problem of showing that the agreement was not \u201cbona fide.\u201d It was apparently to avoid this problem that \u00a7 804 of the Revenue Act of 1932, 47 Stat. 280, added the language now found in subdivision \u00a7 812(b) (3) to the effect that a wife\u2019s release of rights in her husband\u2019s estate is not to be deemed \u201ca consideration \u2018in money or money\u2019s worth.\u2019 \u201d See dissenting opinion of L. Hand, C. J., in Meyer\u2019s Estate v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 1940, 110 F.2d 367.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">It is quite true that under a literal reading of \u00a7 812(b) (3) claims for amounts originally fixed by a separation agreement, whose initial and continued effectiveness stand apart from the decree of divorce, may be said to be \u201cfounded\u201d on the agreement even though its terms have been incorporated in the divorce decree. But it seems to us that such an interpretation of the statute would make the remedy worse than the disease which it was sought to cure. The fact of divorce and the adoption by the decree of the financial terms agreed on by the parties governing the ending of their marital relationship should be taken, we think, as satisfying the purpose of the statute to ensure against colorable deductions. Cf. \u00a7 2516 of the Revenue Code of 1954, 26 U.S.C.A., exempting from gift taxes postnuptial payments under property settlements made within two years prior to divorce, and the Senate Committee Reports on that Section, Sen. Rep. 1622, 83d Cong., 2d Sess. 128, 481 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-7\">In the analogous situation of the deductibility of alimony payments for income tax purposes under former I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 22(k) and 23(u), we have held that the statute should be construed to effect its broad remedial purposes. See Newton v. Pedrick, 2 Cir., 1954, 212 F.2d 357; Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Moses, 2 Cir., 214 F.2d 912. And similarly here we think that the true purposes of \u00a7 812 are better effectuated by treating claims like these as \u201cfounded\u201d on the decree of divorce, rather than to make the question depend upon the refined and somewhat artificial distinction between an agreement whose effectiveness is conditioned upon such a decree and one which is not so conditioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b991-7\">. At the time of the decree \u00a7 9463 of the Nevada Compiled Laws (Supp.1931-1941) provided: \u201cIn granting a divorce, the court may award such alimony to the wife and shall make such disposition of the community and separate property of the parties as shall appear just and equitable, having regard to the respective merits of the parties and to the condition in which they will be left by such divorce, and to the party through whom the property was acquired, and to the burdens, if any, imposed upon it for the benefit of the children. * * *\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b991-12\">. One of the contentions in the Commissioner\u2019s brief is that the Tax Court erred in permitting the deduction because the taxpayer failed to show that the divorced wife\u2019s claim was allowed by the Nassau County Surrogate\u2019s Court in New York, where the estate is being administered. However, that contention was withdrawn on the oral argument before us, the Commissioner being satisfied that the claim had in fact been allowed by the Surrogate\u2019s Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b992-5\">. Actually, as appears from the Maresi Record on Appeal (pp. 21-32), the effectiveness of the agreement was not conditional on the divorce.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b992-6\">. The gift tax being complementary to the estate tax, the sections in the gift tax corresponding to \u00a7 812(b) (3) are read as <em>in pari materia </em>to those in \u00a7 812, with the result that <em>inter vivos </em>payments between spouses made in consideration of the relinquishment of marital rights are regarded as gifts. Merrill v. Fahs, 1945, 324 U.S. 308, 65 S.Ct. 655, 89 L.Ed. 963.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
