Subsequently, Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., entered into a contract with the author to publish the work in book form, Knopf published the book and, in accord with the terms of the contract, copyrighted it.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-24\">In 1930, after publication in book form and after publication of all installments of the first serial thereof, Knopf and Hammett, designated as \u201cOwners\u201d, for a consideration of $8,500.00, granted certain defined rights in and to The Maltese Falcon (called \u201cwritings\u201d in the agreement) to Warner Bros., as \u201cPurchaser\u201d.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b995-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>Coincidentally, Knopf executed an instrument to Warner called \u201cAssignment of Copyright\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for a nominal consideration, The text of the \u201cassignment\u201d shows on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>its face that it is not an assignment of the copyright but that it is a grant to Warner of specified rights to the use of the writings in The Maltese Falcon. Both the contract between Hammett-Knopf and Warner, and the \u201cassignment\u201d from Knopf, purport to grant to Warner certain defined and detailed exclusive rights to the use of The Maltese Falcon \u201cwritings\u201d in moving pictures, radio, and television.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">By the common law, the author of a writing possesses the sole and exclusive right to publish it, but upon and after the first publication the writing may be published by anyone including the author, since the writing has gone into the public domain. Bobbs-Merrill Co. v. Straus, 1908, 210 U.S. 339, 28 S.Ct. 722, 52 L.Ed. 1086; Bobbs-Merrill Co. v. Straus, 2 Cir., 1908,147 F. 15, 15 L.R.A., N.S., 766; Harper &amp; Bros. v. M. A. Donohue &amp; Co., C.C. 1905, 144 F. 491. The copyright statute extends the author\u2019s sole and exclusive right in accordance with its terms and provisions. Constitution of the United States, Art. I, \u00a7 8, Clause 8; Title 17 U.S.C.A.; Bobbs-Merrill Co. v. Straus, 1908, 210 U.S. 339, 28 S.Ct. 722, 52 L.Ed. 1086; Bobbs-Merrill Co. v. Straus, 2 Cir., 1908, 147 F. 15, 15 L.R.A.,N.S., 766. In other words, it reserves the writing from the public domain for the effective period of the copyright. What we have just said is what is meant by courts when they say: \u201cWhen the copyright comes in, the common law right goes out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">No question as to the legality of the copyright on The Maltese Falcon or to its continuing effectiveness through all times in suit, or to its complete beneficial ownership by Hammett and Knopf together, is in issue. Therefore, at the effective moment of the grants by Hammett and Knopf to Warner, the latter became possessed of the sole and exclusive right to the writing which is within the copyright, less all limiting terms of the grants. The grants are limited to defined uses in motion picture, talking pictures, radio, and television.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-6\">It is claimed by Warner that it acquired the exclusive right to the use of the writing, The Maltese Falcon, including the individual characters and their names, together with the title, \u201cThe Maltese Falcon\u201d, in motion pictures, radio, and television. The use of the title is not in issue, since the grant to Warner specifically includes it.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-7\">It is the position of Hammett and the other defendants, all of whom claim some interest under him, that the rights acquired by Warner are those specifically mentioned in the conveying or granting instruments, and that the exclusive right to the use of the characters and/or their names were not mentioned as being granted; that the instruments, properly construed, do not convey any exclusive right to the use of characters with or without names, hence Hammett could use them in other stories. However, if, by reason of the silence in the instruments as to such claimed rights, the instruments should be held to be ambiguous on this point, the custom and practice demonstrate that such rights are not customarily parted with by authors, but that characters which are depicted in one detective story together with their names are customarily retained and used in the intricacies of subsequent but different tales.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-8\">Hammett did so use the characters with their names and did contract with others for such use. In 1946 he used The Maltese Falcon characters including Sam Spade, the detective and the leading character in the Falcon, by name, and granted to third parties the sole and exclusive right, except their use in the Falcon, to use that character by name (later orally enlarged to include other characters of the Falcon) in radio, television, and motion pictures. Under such claimed rights, radio broadcasts of \u201cAdventures of Sam Spade\u201d, including \u201cThe Kandy Tooth\u201d were broadcast in weekly half-hour episodes from 1946 to 1950.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-9\">Warner claims infringement of copyright and \u201cunfair use and competition\u201d by such re-use and, as well, for infringe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>ment of parts of the story and the whole of the writing inclusive of characters and their names. Hammett and the other defendants deny infringement or unfair use and competition on any count, and Hammett requests the court to declare his rights in the premises. Knopf is a nominal party asking and claiming nothing, and is made a plaintiff under the right granted Warner in the Hammett-Knopf-Warner contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-4\">The trial court denied relief to Warner, declared Hammett\u2019s rights, and assessed costs against Warner, who appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">The instruments under which Warner claims were prepared by Warner Bros. Corporation which is a large, experienced moving picture producer. It would seem proper, therefore, to construe the instruments under the assumption that the claimant knew what it wanted and that in defining the items in the instruments which it desired and intended to take, it included all of the items it was contracting to take.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We are of the opinion that since the use of characters and character names are nowhere specifically mentioned in the agreements, but that other items, including the title, \u201cThe Maltese Falcon\u201d, and their use are specifically mentioned as being granted, that the character rights with the names cannot be held to be within the grants, and that under the doctrine of <em>ejusdem generis, </em>general language cannot be held to include them.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As was said in Phillip v. Jerome H. Remick &amp; Co., S.D., N.Y., Op. No. 9,999,1936, \u201cSuch doubt as there is should be resolved in favor of the composer. The clearest language is necessary to divest the author of the fruits of his labor. Such language is lacking here.\u201d See, also, Tobani v. Carl Fischer, Inc., 1942, 263 App.Div. 503, 507, 33 N.Y.S.2d 294, 299, affirmed 1942, 289 N.Y. 727, 46 N.E.2d 347.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-9\">The conclusion that these rights are not within the granting instruments is strongly buttressed by the fact that historically and presently detective fiction writers have and do carry the leading characters with their names and individualisms from one story into succeeding stories. This was the practice of Edgar Allen Poe, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and others; and in the last two decades of S. S. Van Dine, Earle Stanley Gardner, and others. The reader\u2019s interest thereby snowballs as new \u201ccapers\u201d of the familiar characters are related in succeeding tales. If the intention of the contracting parties had been to avoid this practice which was a very valuable one to the author, it is hardly reasonable that it would be left to a general clause following specific grants. Another buttressing fact is that Hammett wrote and caused to be published in 1932, long after the Falcon agreements, three stories in which some of the leading characters of the Falcon were featured, and no objection was voiced by Warner. It is also of some note that the evidence shows that Columbia, long subsequent to the conveying instruments, dickered with Warner for the use of the Falcon on its \u201cSuspense\u201d radio program and, failing in its efforts, substituted \u201cThe Kandy Tooth\u201d which uses the Falcon characters under license of Hammett. Warner made no claim against Columbia at or reasonably soon afterward. The conclusion we have come to, as to the intention of the parties, would seem to be in harmony with the fact that the purchase price paid by Warner was $8,500.00, which would seem inadequate compensation for the complete surrender of the characters made famous by the popular reception of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>book, The Maltese Falcon; and that the intention of the parties, inclusive of the \u201cAssignment\u201d, was not that Hammett should be deprived of using the Falcon characters in subsequently written stories, and that the contract, properly construed, does not deprive Hammett of their use.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">Up to this point we have discussed the points at issue by construing the contract and by seeking the intention of the parties to it, and we have concluded that the parties never intended by their contract to buy and sell the future use of the personalities in the writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-5\">It will now be profitable to consider whether it was ever intended by the copyright statute that characters with their names should be under its protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-6\">The practice of writers to compose sequels to stories is old, and the copyright statute, though amended several times, has never specifically mentioned the point. It does not appear that it has ever been adjudicated, although it is mentioned in Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corp., 2 Cir., 1930, 45 F.2d 119. If Congress had intended that the sale of the right to publish a coyprighted story would foreclose the author\u2019s use of its characters in subsequent works for the life of the copyright, it would seem Congress would have made specific provision therefor. Authors work for the love of their art no more than other professional people work in other lines of work for the love of it. There is the financial motive as well. The characters of an author\u2019s imagination and the art of his descriptive talent, like a painter\u2019s or like a person with his penmanship, are always limited and always fall into limited patterns.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The restriction argued for is unreasonable, and would effect the very opposite of the statute\u2019s purpose which is to encourage the production of the arts.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-9\">It is our conception of the area covered by the copyright statute that when a study of the two writings is made and it is plain from the study that one of them is not in fact the creation of the putative author, but instead has been copied in substantial part exactly or in transparent re-phrasing to produce essentially the story of the other writing, it infringes.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-10\">It is conceivable that the character really constitutes the story being told, but if the character is only the chessman in the game of telling the story he is not within the area of the protection afforded by the copyright. The subject is given consideration in the Nichols case, supra, 45 F.2d at page 121 of the citation. At page 122 of 45 F.2d of the same case the court remarks that the line between infringement and non-infringement is indefinite and may seem arbitrary when drawn; nevertheless it must be drawn. Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corp., 2 Cir., 1930, 45 F.2d 119. See Warner Bros. Pictures v. Majestic Pictures Corp., 2 Cir., 70 F.2d 310, 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-11\">We conclude that even if the Owners assigned their complete rights in the copyright to the Falcon, such assignment did not prevent the author from using the characters used therein, in other stories. The characters were vehicles for the story told, and the vehicles did not go with the sale of the story.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-12\">We turn to the consideration of general infringement. It is agreed that a story entitled \u201cThe Kandy Tooth\u201d is the closest to The Maltese Falcon, and from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>a practical standpoint if the Tooth does not infringe the Falcon, there has been no infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-4\">We have set out in notes 7 and 8 at the end of this opinion, short summations of the two works. There is a sameness in the tricks of spinning out the yarn so as to sustain the reader\u2019s suspense as to hinted mystery, and there is a similarity in the two stories in that there is a long complicated search for a lost article of fabulous value. The searches are filled with complications, fatalities, and moral delinquencies by characters in name, description, and action of some similarities. The script of the Tooth was not composed by Hammett and, except for a few expressions, is not written in the Hammett literary style.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">We see no clear error in the trial court\u2019s holding that the similarities of the two stories do not go to the degree of constituting practically the same story. There is no textual copying; the mystery of the Tooth and the suspense to the reader would not be dulled through his having read the Falcon. In a phrase, they are different stories though of the same general nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">Unfair Use and Competition</p>\n<p id=\"b999-7\">Warner claims the radio broadcasts, \u201cThe Adventures of Sam Spade\u201d and the \u201cSuspense\u201d broadcast of \u201cThe Kandy Tooth\u201d, and others, wherein the characters of the Falcon were used by name and their peculiarities, constituted unfair use and competition. The trial court found against such contention and we think the conclusion does not constitute clear error.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-13\">It is patent that the characters of The Maltese Falcon could not fairly be used in such a manner as to cause the Falcon to be materially lessened in its commercial worth by degrading or cheapening them so that the public would not be interested in their capers.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> They could not be used in such a manner as to deceive the public or to \u201cpalm off\u201d to the public the idea that they were really witnessing The Maltese Falcon when they viewed showings of the other stories.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We think there was no reversible error in the court\u2019s conclusions on these points.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-14\">Although we have thought it necessary to arrive at some conclusions not entirely in accord with those of the district court, or to arrive at like conclusions through somewhat different reasoning, nevertheless we commend a reading of that court\u2019s opinion and notation of authorities cited. We are in complete accord with the order of the district court that the plaintiffs-appellants take nothing, and that defendants-appellees recover their costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-15\">The judgment in accordance with this opinion will settle all of the issues of the case, including all of Hammett\u2019s interest in the subject matter under Warner\u2019s claims. There is no justiciable controversy between Hammett and Knopf, the nominal plaintiff. It follows that no useful purpose could be served by considering Hammett\u2019s prayer for a declaration of his rights and his counterclaim for a declaratory judgment is therefore dismissed and the judgment running to him on it is reversed. Otherwise, the judgment is affirmed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>, <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AuG\">Reversed and affirmed in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b994-25\">.

The theme of the story of The Maltese Falcon is a complicated search for a fabulously valuable bird figurine called The Maltese Falcon. The action of the story centers in San Francisco from elsewhere, with the leading actors, or characters gathering there intent upon the objective. An attractive, alluring woman of uncertain age and reputation, by name Brigid O\u2019Sliaughnessy, assuming a false name and great distress, in search of help, called upon private detective Sam Spade, a clever, laconic, rangy-looking man whose morals and practices are none too idyllic, and well if not too favorably known to the police. Brigid qualifies within the requisite of the proverbial monumental liar, but, though Spade is not deceived, she manages to withhold the truth from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>him. A dunderheaded policeman and his partner enter the tangled story. Effie Perine is Spade\u2019s secretary, one of those see-all, know-all, self effacing paragons of loyal efficiency. A mystical character of a man who apparently is cooperating with Brigid against three others of their search-party gets shot to death and Spade is under suspicion. The leader of the search-party is a fat man named Gutman, of infinite patience and possessed of untold money. He proposes to pay a large sum to Sam who represents that he can deliver the bird. An effeminate lackey of a man by the name of Cairo does Gut-man\u2019s bidding. A young, boyish gunman is under Gutman\u2019s orders. The story runs on at accelerated tempo in mystery until the captain of a ship, just in from the Orient, appears at Spade\u2019s apartment with a package in hand and falls dead from the boy\u2019s bullets sent into him just before he entered Spade\u2019s place. All gather at Sam\u2019s for the delivery of the bird, supposed to be in the package, and for payment of the money. Sam gets the award and Gutman gets the bird, which is a worthless counterfeit of the genuine. Gutman maintains' his sang-froid. Brigid and Sam have trespassed the conventions. Yet, as somehow it is revealed the lady herself was the author of the first fatality, she is delivered over by the benevolent Sam and is sent on her way to San Quentin prison. These characters are skillfully depicted in a running, attractive style and distinctly assume individualism as distinguished from mere other persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">Warner claims ownership of all of this including the characterizations with the characters\u2019 names, and the story.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">. The Kandy Tooth Story. The script opens with Sam Spade telephoning from jail to his faithful secretary, Effie Perine, early in the morning. Effie hurries to Sam who dictates his story. Dundy, the police officer, is present. Spade has received a telegram from the fat Caspar Gutman who had been marked \u201cdead\u201d from the end of The Maltese Falcon caper. The telegram is a warning about \u201can invidious pair of rogues\u201d, a dentist, and a charming woman named Hope L\u00e1veme, who have something to do with a \u201chidden tooth\u201d. Spade is bailed out by a mystery man who deposits $20,000.00 with the law. Gutman will shortly arrive in San Francisco. The dentist, so Spade dictated, had been ushered into his office by Effie and entreats him to get someone\u2019s \u201cbridge\u201d. The dentist leaves. Spade contemplates \u201cHm-m-m * * * Beware the Hidden Tooth\u201d. In comes Hope L\u00e1veme, a character along the line of Brigid O\u2019Shaughnessy, and she is, or claims to be, a sister of the dentist. Hope explains the brother\u2019s obsession about a dental bridge. She wants to find him. Spade goes to a hotel, gets information from a house detective, and finds the brother, badly beaten; the two walk on the street \u2014 the dentist collapses. Spade takes him into a newsreel theater. The show excites him \u2014 it's about white elephants and particularly Oriental in character. Spade and the dentist go back to Spade\u2019s room. There L\u00e1veme recites a story of a tooth having been extracted from the jaw of a sacred body long since the occupant of an Oriental tomb. The tooth was taken by international rogues and installed by the dentist in the bridgework of an innocent refugee. The rogues are now attempting to locate the refugee and regain the priceless tooth.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-8\">Hope calls Spade on the telephone for help, and he goes, but is attacked by a boy, brother of the gun-boy in The Maltese Falcon. They scuffle and Spade is felled by a gun butt. He comes to in the presence of the imperturbable Gut-man and strange happenings ensue. Spade finally gets the tooth in the ashes of the cremated body of the refugee, Herman Julius. $20,000.00 is paid upon delivery of the package containing the ashes. The tooth, by reason of a religious significance, is worth untold wealth to Gutman if he can produce it. A murder is committed; Hope and Sam had been more than friends. A Russian was mixed up in the plot. When Gutman saw that he had been duped through the delivery to him of the cremation residue, he took it as philosophically as when the bird in The Maltese Falcon turned out to be spurious. It develops that $20,000.00 had been put up for Sam\u2019s bail, and Sam puts up the same money as bail for Hope who gets into and out of jail. In some not very clear manner it all ends with no money gained by Spade, but Hope telephones her love after leaving jail, and Effie is not sure that the whole affair will net her a new ribbon for her typewriter.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
