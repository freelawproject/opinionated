See Rawls v. United States, 10 Cir., 162 F.2d 798; and Rawls v. United States, 10 Cir., 166 F.2d 532. The sentences were imposed upon pleas of guilty to an information containing two counts charging violations of Section 588b, Title 12 U.S.C.A., 50 Stat. 749.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">In this motion to vacate, appellant complains of denial of due process of law in that he was sentenced on the second count of the information without having entered a plea to such count. A transcript of the record at the time of sentence introduced at the hearing on this motion to vacate showed that the appellant and his co-defendant appeared in open court, and after refusing aid of counsel, expressly consented to be charged and prosecuted by information. Appellant stated to the court that he had read the information, and upon being asked if he desired time in which to plead, answered that he was ready. When asked how he pleaded, he stated, \u201cI plead guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">When the trial court sentenced appellant to ten years on the first count and five years on the second count \u201cto run consecutively\u201d, appellant inquired: \u201cCould you make that run concurrently?\u201d The court answered, \u201cI could\u201d. The court then stated in effect that he would sentence the appellant\u2019s younger co-defendant to ten years on each count to run concurrently, but that \u201cI wouldn\u2019t feel justified in letting yours run concurrently\u201d. Whereupon, the appellant stated, \u201cthe boy [co-defendant] has been overseas and I would like to see him get off lighter, he is entitled to it, thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-12\">It is thus unmistakably plain that the appellant intelligently pleaded guilty to both counts to the indictment and the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
