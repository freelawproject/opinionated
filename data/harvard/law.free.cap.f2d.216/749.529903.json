Upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>basis of his opinion, findings and conelusions, we are of opinion that the judgment of the District Court should be affirmed, and that no worthwhile contribution would be made by this court by attempting to re-write in our own words the excellent opinion of the District Judge, who gave most conscientious study to the problems presented and has stated accurate conclusions,</p>\n<p id=\"A6I\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
