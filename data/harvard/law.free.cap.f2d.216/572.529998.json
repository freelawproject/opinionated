The proceeding is a typical one under authority of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, 61 Stat. 136, Title 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 151 et seq., and the board\u2019s \u201cDecision and Order\u201d is reported in 103 N.L.R.B. # 101, inclusive of authorities and applicable sections of the Act. The board found that respondent resisted unionization of its plant: by using its supervisional personnel to influence the employees to vote against unionization by various threats and inducements; by discriminating against certain employees for their pro-union activities; by wage and insurance benefits; by the discharge of employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">Respondent claims that it did no more in opposition to the unionization of the plant than it had the right to do under \u00a7 8(c) of the Act, which guarantees to the employer the right to fairly state and argue its views.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-11\">There is substantial evidence to support the Board in its findings on these subjects, notwithstanding substantial evidence to the contrary. We do not find clear error.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-12\">Respondent claims that the charging union is \u201cRegion No. 6\u201d and that such union has not complied with \u00a7 9(f) and (h), (the non-communist oath requirement).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-13\">The proceedings were laid and conducted under the complaint of the \u201cInternational Union, United Automobile, Aircraft and Agricultural Implement Workers of America, CIO (UAW-CIO), Region 6.\u201d It is conceded that the International Union, United Automobile, Aircraft and Agricultural Implement Workers of America, CIO, has complied with the non-communist oath; \u201cRegion 6\u201d separately has not.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-14\">Subsequently to the original Decision and Order of the board, the board amended the proceeding including the Decision and Order by deleting the expression \u201cRegion 6\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-15\">The evidence showed the expression \u201cRegion 6\u201d means the geographical division of the International Union, United Automobile, Aircraft and Agricultural Implement Workers of America, CIO (UAW-CIO), and is not itself a union.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-16\">The Decision and Order under the original order was, and the supplemental or amended Decision and Order is valid. The petition is granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
