His punishment of imprisonment for a period of three years, was imposed after a bench trial and conviction for violating 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2553(a), 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 174, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">His motion to vacate and set aside that sentence was denied on the day it was filed, January 7, 1954, without a hearing by the same district judge before whom Lawrence was originally prosecuted. Because that trial judge denied Lawrence\u2019s motion for relief under \u00a7 2255, without making supporting findings of fact or conclusions of law, defendant now claims error in this appeal. But as we read \u00a7 2255, it provides for findings of fact and conclusions of law, \u201cunless the motion and the files and records of the case conclusively show that the petitioner is entitled to no relief * * * <em>\" </em>Klein v. United States, 7 Cir., 1953, 204 F.2d 513; United States v. Nickerson, 7 Cir., 1954, 211 F.2d 909. After examining defendant\u2019s post-conviction motion and the record of proceedings, we are satisfied that the lower court acted within the ambit of its power described in \u00a7 2255. After all, it was the district judge who conducted the trial on the merits, adjudicated the issues, and sentenced the defendant, whose order of denial we are assuming to review. Indeed, \u00a7 2255, contemplates that the motion thereby authorized be presented to the court imposing a sentence complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-20\">This brings us to Lawrence\u2019s challenge, grounded on \u00a7 605, Communications Act of 1934,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to testimony about the contents of a telephone conversation, related from the witness stand by an agent of the Bureau of Narcotics. During his detention at the Post Office Building, government witness Spencer called his \u201csource of supply\u201d in compliance with the Treasury Enforcement Agents\u2019 request. By using an extension telephone, agent Mattera <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> overheard Spencer\u2019s conversation with a person whose voice Spencer<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> identified as that of Lawrence. But at the threshold, defendant\u2019s contention needs to be examined in its original setting. For it appears in the original transcript of proceedings that two lawyers represented Lawrence at his trial in January, 1953. One of these attorneys conducted examinations of the witnesses, the other presented various oral arguments on defendant\u2019s behalf. At the time of his arraignment in October, 1952, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>Lawrence appeared personally and by his' attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">No motion to suppress the evidence complained of by this defendant was made at any time. Parenthetically, we also not\u00e9 that defendant rests his contention solely on M\u00e1ttera\u2019s .parol evi-\u2019 dence, despite Spencer\u2019s testimony relating the substance of that same conversation. Spencer, one party to this conversation, knew' that Matter\u00e1 and other agents were listening to his communication. M\u00f3reover, identification of Lawrence\u2019s voic\u00e9 was the sole basis offered by defense counsel for his objec-' tions interposed to testimony of Spencer and Mattera about the' content of this telephone conversation. And from- that specific reason, defense counsel quickly receded. A canvass of - this record reveals no other objection to the evidence now complained of by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">While this is not an instance of the practice typified as \u201cwire tapping,\u201d we think it unnecessary to discuss whether there, was an \u201cinterception,\u201d by these government agents, within the meaning - and \"purview of \u00a7 605, supra. Cf. Rietmeister v, Reitmeister, 2 Cir., 1947, 162 F.2d 691, 694; United States v.Polakoff, 2 Cir., 1940; 112 F.2d 888, 134 A.L.R. 607. Nor are we overlooking the exclusionary rule, binding upon federal courts, enunciated in United States v. Coplon, 2 Cir., 1950, 185 F.2d 629, 636, 28 A.L.R.2d 1041; Fed.R.Crim.Proc. 26, 18 U.S.C.A. But we think, on the face and state of this record that there was no such denial or infringement of the constitutional rights of'this defendant as would render his original judgment vulnerable to attack under \u00a7 2255, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\"> By waiting until he reached this court to first question the legality of his arrest, defendant waived that point, if indeed, it was one. We also think his conviction can stand without, contravening the \u201c fairness, integrity, or public reputation, of judicial, proceedings\u2019\u201d, United States v. Jones, 7 Cir., 1953 204 F.2d 745, 749, or causing an injustice to this defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">We acknowledge the efforts of Aaron P. Brill, who was appointed by this court-to present the defendant\u2019s cause on review.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">The judgment of the District Court is' affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b619-10\">. 62 Stat. 967, as amended May 24, 1949, c. 139, \u00a7 114, 63 Stat. 105, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b619-12\">. 48 Stat. 1064, 47 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 .151 et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b619-13\">.
