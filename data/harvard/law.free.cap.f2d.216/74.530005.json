In this court the defendants likewise contend that they are immune from a suit of this kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-13\">The law supports this claim of immunity. It extends to and includes judges, prosecuting attorneys and members of a grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-14\">In Alzua v. Johnson, 231 U.S. 106, 34 S.Ct. 27, at page 29, 58 L.Ed. 142, involving a judge, at page 144 the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aty\">\u201c * * * we regard it as fundamental that the immunity of the defendant from this suit is the same as that of judges in the United States, which is established beyond dispute. Bradley v. Fisher, 13 Wall. 335, 20 L.Ed. 646; Randall v. Brigham, 7 Wall. 523, 19 L.Ed. 285.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-15\">The reason for this rule of immunity is set forth in Bradley v. Fisher, 13 Wall. 335, 20 L.Ed. 646, at page 649:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-16\">\u201cFor it is a general principle of the highest importance to the proper administration of justice that a judicial officer, in exercising the authority vested in him, shall be free to act upon his own convictions, without apprehension of personal consequence to himself. Liability to answer to everyone who might feel himself aggrieved by the action of the judge, would be inconsistent with the possession of this freedom, and would destroy that independence without which no judiciary can be either respectable or use<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>ful. * * * Nor can this exemption of the judges from civil liability be affected by the motives with which their judicial acts are performed. The purity of their motives cannot in this way be the subject of judicial inquiry. * * * If civil actions could be maintained in such cases against the judge, because the losing party should see fit to allege in his complaint that the acts of the judge were done with partiality, or maliciously, or corruptly, the protection essential to judicial independence would be entirely swept away. Few persons sufficiently irritated to institute an action against a judge for his judicial acts would hesitate to ascribe any character to the acts which would be essential to the maintenance of the action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">State's attorneys in Illinois\u2019 are judicial officers. Sec. 22, art. VI, Illinois Constitution of 1870, S.H.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">While the constitution of Illinois does not mention the grand jury directly, it does recognize its existence by providing for indictments by a grand jury, and authorizing its abolition. Sec. 8, art. II, Illinois constitution of 1870. Neither the constitution nor any act of the legislature of Illinois has ever attempted to define the grand jury. It \u00a1had' its origin in the common law and has existed for many hundred years. Its constitution, organization, jurisdiction and method of proceeding were all well known features of the common law before the organization of the state of Illinois and have been recognized and adopted in all of its constitutions and in legislation as it existed at the organization of the state. When it was so referred to, the common law grand jury became a part of the fundamental law of the state for the prosecution of crime, and no authority has ever existed in Illinois for the prosecution of felonies except upon the indictment of a grand jury. The power of the grand jury is not dependent upon the court but is original and complete, and its duty is to diligently inquire into all offenses which shall come to its knowledge, whether from the court, the state\u2019s attorney, its own members or from any source, and it may make presentments of its own knowledge without any instruction or authority from the court. The court cannot limit the scope of the investigation of the grand jury. People ex rel. Ferrill v. Graydon, 333 Ill. 429, 164 N.E. 832.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">In Laughlin v. Rosenman, 82 U.S.App.D.C. 164, 163 F.2d 838, involving a prosecuting attorney charged with conspiring with others to procure plaintiffs\u2019 indictment on false testimony, the court held that the rule of immunity from civil liability of a public officer applied to a charge of violation of the civil rights act and affirmed a judgment dismissing the complaint of the plaintiff upon the ground that it failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">In Lyons v. Baker, 5 Cir., 180 F.2d 893, which involved members of a grand jury, it was held that a complaint alleging that the grand jury made false and malicious charges against plaintiff in violation of his civil rights, was properly dismissed on motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">We hold that the state\u2019s attorney, the first assistant state's attorney and the foreman of the grand jury as a member thereof, named as defendants herein, were at the times complained of judicial officers of the state of Illinois, and, as such, were protected by the same rule of immunity which is applicable to judges.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">Francis v. Crafts, 1 Cir., 203 F.2d 809, in reiterating the immunity of judges from civil liability, distinguishes Picking v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 3 Cir., 151 F.2d 240, which is relied on by plaintiff in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-11\">To the same effect is Campo v. Niemeyer, 7 Cir., 182 F.2d 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-12\">While we can understand from the facts set forth in plaintiff\u2019s complaint her outraged feeling resulting from the charged acts of the defendants, the rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>enunciated in the foregoing cases is that, as a matter of public policy, such an injured person is without relief in a civil proceeding. Hence the judgment of the District Court is</p>\n<p id=\"Ac9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b123-17\">. 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1985.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
