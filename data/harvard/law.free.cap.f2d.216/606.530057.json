United States, 6 Cir., 165 F.2d 752, where the whole question is thoroughly canvassed and adequately and correctly dealt with, he urges upon us that the undisputed facts of record in connection with the hearing on the motion establish as matter of law that the search was unreasonable and forbidden, the order on the motion was error, and the judgment may not stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-18\">The United States, showing equal assiduity in searching and analyzing the-authorities and equal earnestness in insisting that the motion was correctly denied, urges upon us that the finding that the search was not unreasonable was correct, as matter of law, but, if not,, certainly as matter of fact, and the finding and order may not be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-19\">We do not find it necessary to determine, as we are urged to do, that the-denial of the motion was demanded as. matter of law because we are in no doubt that whether or not this is so, the finding that the search was not unreasonable certainly finds support in the evidence and that the district judge, to whose determination the fact question was properly submitted, Roberson v. United States, supra, had the right under the-evidence to find as he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-20\">Whatever might have been said of this case before the coming down of the-decision in United States v. Rabinowitz, 839 U.S. 56, 70 S.Ct. 430, 94 L.Ed. 653, and Brinegar v. United States, 338 U.S. 160, 69 S.Ct. 1302, 93 L.Ed. 1879, we think it clear that, under their teachings and the finding of the district judge, we are bound to hold; that the search was not unreasonable; that it was not error to deny the motion to suppress; and: that the judgment must, therefore, be-affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
