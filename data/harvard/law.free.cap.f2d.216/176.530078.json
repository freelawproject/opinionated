Its terms, first fixed by telephone and then by a written provisional binder signed by all the re-insurers provided for the rate of premiums to be paid to the reinsurers and contained a warranty provision for the towing as follows: \u201cWarranted Col. River Pilot in charge over Col. River Bar.\u201d On January 18, 1947, the barges were wrecked while being towed across the Columbia River Bar without a Columbia River pilot.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">The parties are now agreed that at the time of the wreck the breach of the pilot-age warranty freed the reinsurers from any liability for the value of the cargo lost on the Bar or for any of the above expenditures. It is apparent that the insurer was liable to the reinsurers for their premiums since their reinsurance covered the risks to the lumber while loading at the Portland quay, shown below in the text of the reinsurance agreement, say by a collision with another vessel while so loading or after loading while waiting for the pilot \u201cat\u201d the Portland quay, causing damage to or loss of the lumber. Hence, the satisfaction of the warranty cannot be considered a condition precedent to existence of the coinsurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">The reinsurers contend that the court erred in holding that by their conduct after the wreck they created in themselves a new liability for the expenditures in attempting to salvage the cargo and in the unsuccessful libel against the tug and barge. We agree with their contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">The agreement for reinsurance was orally made on Saturday, January 11, 1947,. and was later confirmed by what is called a \u201cprovisional binder,\u201d a. writing signed by the parties. This document was prepared by the insurer and circulated among the reinsurers for their acceptances on January 14, 1947. As prepared by the insurer, the provisional binder, a printed document, filled in by typewriting, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-10\">\u201cReinsurance is Wanted by Talbot, Bird &amp; Co., Inc. as Managers &amp;/or Agents</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-11\">For account of themselves; loss, if any, payable to said Company, as interest may appear. To be reported as Oregon Business. For, not to exceed, $\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 to take part of Approx. $100,000, \u2014 Under deck On Rough Lumber valued at \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Vessel Two Portland Tug &amp; Barge Co. Steel Barges in Tow Tug \u2018Teton\u2019 at and from Portland, Oregon To Hawaiian Islands Subject to the following conditions: FPAEC as Per Original Return for each 30 days (net) L/U \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Canc. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqx\">\u201cIncluding all interior, shore, quay, and other risks covered by the original Policy or Policies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOZ\">\u201cIn the event of any loss or damage before completion of loading, whether on shore, on craft, or on board the vessel, the liability hereunder shall be in the same measure as it would have been on completion of loading. * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-19\">The insurer\u2019s original policy in evidence shows it covered the risks at \u201cquay\u201d while loading.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-20\">At the insistence of the reinsurers, there was added, in longhand, following the phrase \u201cFPAEC as Per Original,\u201d the following warranty for a Columbia River Pilot to be in charge in crossing the Columbia River Bar:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-21\">\u201cTowing arrangements approved' by Surveyor Webb. Warranted Col. River Pilot in charge over Col. River Bar. Picked Crew.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-22\">This provisional binder did not show the amount of insurance in exact terms, this not being known at the time, but did show the rates the insurer was willing to pay. On the reverse side the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>reinsurers indicated the proportion of. the estimated risk of $100,000.00 each was willing to accept. Such a contract is called \u201creinsurance bound open for particulars.\u201d The evidence revealed that it is the custom of the marine insurance, industry to make such contracts when the exact amount of the risk is unknown. All terms other than the amount of risk and the premium .thereon are considered as binding upon the execution of the provisional binder.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">When the exact amount of the risk is ascertained, so-called \u201cfinal binders\u201d are executed. The testimony shows- that the \u201crisk,\u201d or the danger insured against, may not be changed by this final binder although minor variations are permitted in terms in order that the final binder may conform to the facts. Any provision of the provisional binder which is omitted from the final binder does not change the reinsurance contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">On Saturday, January 18, 1947, the barges were stranded on the Columbia River Bar with no Columbia River pilot in charge. A total loss resulted. The following Tuesday, final binders were sent to each of the reinsurers. These final binders showed the exact value of the cargo as $94,746.00, assigned each re-insurer\u2019s share thereof, and computed the premium in accordance with the rates set forth in the provisional binders. Following the words \u201cFPAEC as per Original,\u201d the following only was typed:' \u201cTowing Arrangements \u2022 approved by Surveyor Webb.\u201d Though the phrase \u201cWarranted Col. River Pilot-in charge over Col. River Bar. Picked Crew,\u201d which was inserted - in longhand in the provisional bind\u00e9r;'4s not restated in the final binder, it still governed as shown by the above testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">The reinsurers at first refused to execute' and return the final binders \u2022 and rejected a tender of premiums, maintaining that they were not liable on the reinsurance contract, apparently 'then believing that the insurance had never come into existence because of the war-, ranty. A series of conferences was held during which the insurer contended that the reinsurers were legally liable and even if not, they should as a matter of comity between insurers and reinsurers pay their share of the loss because the insurer (who was not protected by a bar pilot warranty) had been required to pay the entire loss. During this period, a settlement of $25,000.00 was offered by the reinsurers and rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">In November of 1947, a meeting of the reinsurers was held at which it was determined to pay the insurer for the cargo loss, to accept the premiums, and to execute the final binders. A suit had then been brought by the insurer against the tug and its owner for the recovery of the expenditures here sued for, which if successful would have reimbursed the reinsurers. It later proved to be unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">A letter was drafted at this.November meeting which accompanied the drafts or payment orders sent by each of the reinsurers to the insurer. These November letters, signed by each reinsurer, required the insurer to continue to press the suit against the -tug and owners. They read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-10\">\u201cTalbot, Bird &amp; Co., Inc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-11\">\u201c114 Sansome Street</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqo\">\u201cSan Francisco, California</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-13\">\u201cRe: Barges No. 1684 and No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-14\">1685 in tow tug \u2018Teton.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ArN\">\u201cGentlemen:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARM\">\u201cFor reasons\" that have ben explained to you during various meetings in connection with the above losses,; we hold the opinion that there is <em>no legal basis for assumption of liability </em>under your proposals for -reinsurance on the .lumber cargoes,-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AET\">\u201cHowever, and <em>without prejudice, </em>-we have-determined to advance the proportion of the amount you claim with respect to the physical loss, Which-according to your debit notes amounted to $81,212.44. It is understood that you,., as direct, underwriter, <em>will continue your action under subrogation </em>and keep us advised of all- important\u201edevelopments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>\u201cAs to the legal and other expenses, we shall consider them <em>when the case is finally concluded. </em>It is obvious to us that a substantial expense has been incurred to date and you may reach a point, taking into consideration offers of settlement, at which it would be advisable to analyze the economy of further continuance of litigation or preparation therefor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-5\">\u201cIn the maintenance of our position as outlined herein, we shall accept, <em>also without prejudice, </em>the payment of the premium which you have heretofore tendered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-6\">\u201cYours very truly,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">The language of the payment drafts varied, but each stated it was \u201cin full settlement\u201d of the \u201ctotal loss\u201d insured by the payor.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">The insurer contends that this payment transaction constitutes a waiver of the bar pilot warranty. In interpreting the letter, the court held that the words \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d meant that the reinsurers were not setting a precedent which would bind them in cases of future reinsurances and that the word \u201cadvance\u201d meant that the ultimate extent of the reinsurers\u2019 liability was not satisfied by the payment; the words \u201cin full settlement\u201d used in the payment drafts were held to mean only full settlement of the cargo loss and not to refer to the reinsurers\u2019 complete obligation to the insurer; and the acceptance of the premiums and the execution of the final binders were held to constitute new reinsurance agreements <em>retroactive </em>to January, 1947, without the bar pilot warranties.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">The case below was tried by a successor judge who did not hear the testimony. Where the evidence is largely documentary and the testimony, as if in depositions, is not heard by the trial judge, a court of appeals is free to draw its own inferences and is not bound by those drawn by the trial judge. Smyth v. Barneson, 9 Cir., 181 F.2d 143, 144 (documentary evidence); Pacific Portland Cement Co. v. Food Machinery &amp; Chemical Corp., 9 Cir., 178 F.2d 541, 548 (documentary evidence); Murphey v. United States, 9 Cir., 179 F.2d 743, 745 (depositions); United States v. El-O-Pathic Pharmacy, 9 Cir., 192 F.2d 62, 66 (testimony not heard by trial judge).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-12\">Since at the time the loss occurred, the reinsurers had no liability on their insurance and were entitled to their premiums, the consideration for such new reinsurances in November for the then known total loss of the lumber in the previous January plus the expenses of the attempted salvage and the pending litigation would have to be new premiums, which obviously would be premiums equal to the total loss and salvage and litigation expense. We can find no consideration at all for such new insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-13\">There is no merit in the contention that the phrase \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d applies to future contracts between the insurer and the reinsurers since it obviously could not affect them. We construe the phrase to apply to the voluntary payment of the value of the lost lumber for which the reinsurers hoped to be reimbursed by the pending suit by the insurer against the tug and owner \u2014 that is to say, the payments were \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d as to any further liability of the reinsurers. The word \u201cadvance\u201d is controlled by the words \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d and means that the voluntary payment for the lost lumber is not an admission of further liability. The words \u201cin full settlement\u201d mean such settlement of any liability upon the reinsurance agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-14\">The judgment on the complaint is reversed and judgment thereon ordered entered by the district court for the re-insurers.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-15\">The reinsurers also appealed: from a judgment for the insurer on their-cross-complaint which the parties are agreed presents different issues on the appeal from those of the appeal on the-complaint. These different issues were not presented to us in the briefs on appeal of the reinsurers. They explain in a footnote to one of their briefs that they-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>do not discuss these issues because it would be unnecessary if the decision on the complaint were affirmed. It was obvious that the decision on the complaint could be reversed, as it was. In effect, the reinsurers are asking us now to treat the appeal on the cross-complaint as if they had just taken it, on which they may now file their opening brief, which the insurer must answer, with a likely reply and an argument to this court, to which the insurer is entitled and which we deem advisable. We see no reason for such an imposition on the insurer and on this court. The judgment on the cross-complaint is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
