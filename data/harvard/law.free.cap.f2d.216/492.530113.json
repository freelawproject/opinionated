The general statement in his petition that he had full complied with the doctrine requiring the exhaustion of all state afforded corrective process is not a sufficient showing of exhaustion of state remedies. This is especially true when that averment is followed only by a recital of the presentation of a petition for writ of error coram nobis, an appeal from a denial thereof to the Supreme Court of Indiana, and denial of certiorari by the Supreme Court of the United States. The burden is upon petitioner in such a situation to affirmatively set forth in his petition for habeas corpus what remedies he pursued in the state court and a justification, if any exists, for his failure to pursue any other state court remedy. The burden is not upon the respondent to point out the state court remedies of which petitioner failed to avail himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-14\">Even where a relator in a habeas corpus proceeding claims that he was prevented from taking an appeal from his conviction, a mere general allegation that \u201c \u2018relief * * * has been applied for and denied\u2019 \u201d is not sufficient. United States ex rel. Marshall v. Snyder, 2 Cir., 160 F.2d 351, at page 353. To the same effect is Harris v. Swenson, 8 Cir., 199 F.2d 269, where the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-15\">\u201cFurthermore, it does not appear that appellant has exhausted his remedies in the state courts. Although there is a general allegation to that effect, the petition does not show what steps have been taken that would justify a federal court in interfering with state court action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZ4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>It is our duty to affirm the judgment of the District Court. However, our order in that respect will be without prejudice to petitioner\u2019s right, if any, to present in another proceeding a petition for assertion of any rights to which he believes himself entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">The judgment below is Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b541-16\">.
