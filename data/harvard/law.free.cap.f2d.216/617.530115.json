Michaels to have the district court make an order removing a criminal case pending against him in the \u201cLos Angeles Municipal Court, Division 27, of the City of Los Angeles, State of California,\u201d to the United States District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-25\">The district court denied the petition \u201con the ground that said petition is frivolous and is not within the purview of sections 1441<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and 1443 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of Title 28, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>U.S.Code.\u201d Michaels filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">The petition is not based upon any complaint filed in the district court and it is obvious that the sections of the United States Code relied upon have no application to the relief sought. Assuming that the matter was one in which the district court had jurisdiction to enter a judgment, which we think is highly doubtful, we find no clear error in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">At the oral argument of petitioner he presented five instruments and the court res\u00e9rved ruling. As they appear to have no legal relation to the appeal, filing of them is hereby denied. The instruments will be marked \u201cDenied filing\u201d and retained by the clerk until and unless Michaels requests their return. The instruments are entitled as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">(1) \u201cPetition for Removal\u201d. This petition appears to be an original petition addressed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">(2) \u201cMotion to Appeal Extra Judgments\u201d (Rec. Mar. 19, 1954, O\u2019Brien, Clerk) and \u201cMotion to Appeal Extra Judgments\u201d (Rec. Aug. 30, 1954, O\u2019Brien, Clerk). This instrument appears to request the judgment below to include or relate to other cases filed in the State court.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">(3) \u201cMotion for Writ of Certiorari\u201d. This motion appears to request this court to order removed to the clerk of the court \u201cto remain temporarily, for about 10 days\u201d the record and proceedings in the cases in the Municipal Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-11\">(4) \u201cMotion for Discovery\u201d (from City of Los Angeles police employee #3776). \u201cMotion for Discovery\u201d (from Judge Robert Clifton). This motion appears to request a named judge of the Municipal Court to answer in regard to discoveries allegedly made by Michaels.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-12\">(5) \u201cMotion for Finding of Fact\u201d. In this motion, Michaels requests us to order the judge of the district court to make a finding of \u201cspecific facts\u201d upon which he found the Michaels\u2019 petition frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-15\">Petition dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b665-14\">.
