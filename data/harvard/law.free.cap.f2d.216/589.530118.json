The only substantial issue relates to the applicability or effect of \u00a7 4164, Title 18 U.S.C.A., as amended June 29, 1951, hereafter quoted.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">Appellant was by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas sentenced to serve a term of 10 years for violation of the Federal Narcotics Act. He began service of the sentence May 6, 1942. He was conditionally released January 22, 1949. On or about March 18, 1951 he committed the crime of engaging in a conspiracy to violate the Narcotics Act. His maximum term under his original sentence expired May 6, 1952. On March 7, 1952 he was-indicted on the conspiracy charge. On May 2, 1952 \u2014 four days prior to the expiration date of the 10-year term \u2014 a warrant of retaking was issued by the Parole Board for violation of his conditional release.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-16\">Appellant pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge on November 26, 1952, and was sentenced to a term of three years, the sentence being made by the judge to run concurrently with the remainder of his prior 10-year sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The conspiracy sentence was later reduced to 18 months with a recommendation that the reduced sentence be considered by the Parole Board. This 18-month sentence less good behavior terminated February 6, 1954. On that date the Parole Board\u2019s warrant for retaking, earlier issued as aforesaid, was executed by taking appellant into custody, and he is now serving the unserved portion of the 10-year sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-17\">The relevant statutes are set out on. the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b639-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>We here note in passing the provisions of a general statute relied on to some extent in the government\u2019s brief, namely 1 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 109. In substance, this law states that the repeal of any statute shall not have the effect to release or extinguish any penalty, etc., under such statute unless the repealing act expressly so provides; and such statute shall be treated as remaining in force for the purpose of sustaining enforcement of such penalty, etc. For reasons presently to appear we think it unnecessary to consider the effect of this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">Appellant argues that the June 29, 1951 amendment of section 4164 applies, and he asserts that under this amendment his maximum term less 180 days expired on November 8, 1951. Since the Parole Board\u2019s warrant of retaking was issued subsequent to November 8, 1951, he says the warrant was void under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4205, quoted in footnote 1 supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">The position of the government on oral argument is that the June 29, 1951 amendment of section 4164 is in effect a minimum-term statute. Legislative history confirms such interpretation, see 1951 U. S. Congressional Code Service 1544-47. It appears that the purpose of Congress was to avoid the cost of returning conditional releasees to serve less than 180 days, and to reduce the burden on the Parole Board personnel by ending parole supervision of them 180 days before their sentences would normally expire. It was clearly not the intention to relieve such releasees from penalties attaching to violations of conditional releases occurring <em>before </em>the 180-day period begins. From this it follows that if a breach of parole occurs during the minimum sentence created by the statute (that is, the maximum term less 180 days) the conditionally released convict occupies a position analogous to that of an escaped prisoner. See Anderson v. Corall, 263 U.S. 193, 196, 44 S.Ct. 43, 68 L.Ed. 247; Zerbst v. Kidwell, 304 U.S. 359, 361, 58 S.Ct. 872, 82 L.Ed. 1399. The authority of the Parole Board to issue a warrant of retaking based on such an offense continues until the expiration of the maximum sentence. United States ex rel. Anderson v. Anderson, D.C., 8 F.Supp. 812. As this court observed in Klinkner v. Squier, 9 Cir., 144 F.2d 490, 491, \u201cit is not the issuance of a warrant charging parole violation that tolls the expiration of a minimum sentence, but the misbehavior of the parolee\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">The facts bring appellant within this rationale. He committed the offense which violated his conditional release on March 18, 1951, whereas his minimum term under the amended section 4164 did not expire until November 8, 1951. Since his maximum term did not expire until May 6, 1952, the warrant of retaking issued four days prior to that date was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b638-10\">. As to the lack of authority in the district court to provide that the unexpired portion of the 10-year sentence was to run concurrently with the sentence pronounced on the conspiracy charge, consult Zerbst v. Kidwell, 304 U.S. 359, 58 S.Ct. 872, 82 L.Ed. 1399; Tippitt v. Wood, 78 U.S.App.D.C. 332, 140 F.2d 689; Hammerer v. Huff, 71 App.D.C. 246, 110 F.2d 113; Tippitt v. Squier, 9 Cir., 145 F.2d 211.</p>\n<p id=\"Ar_\">Here the Parole Board, as was within its sole discretion, did not recognize the district court\u2019s attempt to require the 10-year sentence to be served concurrently with the conspiracy sentence. No question is raised now on this point, apparently because it was regarded as settled by the above decisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b638-13\">. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4205:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1Z\">\u201cA warrant for the retaking of any United States prisoner who has violated his parole, may be issued only by the Board of Parole or a member thereof and within the maximum term or terms for which he was sentenced.
