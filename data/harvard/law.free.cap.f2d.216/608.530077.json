Enforcement is resisted on the ground that the Board\u2019s findings and order are not sustained by substantial evidence on the whole record. The facts are sufficiently set forth in the Board\u2019s order and the report of the trial examiner and need not be repeated here.- We think that the findings and order are, sustained by substantial evidence on. the whole record except with respect to 'David Timmerman and in that respect we think that it is not so sustained. Timmerman was discharged as the result of an altercation with another employee. That the altercation may. have-arisen because of Tim-merman\u2019s advocacy pf the union does not sustain the position of the Board, since the employer was within its rights in 'forbidding union advocacy during working hours. Who was to' blame in the altercation is, likewise, beside the point, as the employer had the right to discharge Timmerman because of the altercation whether he was to blame or not, so long as this was the real ground of the discharge and not a mere pretext. The evidence gives no substantial support-to the finding that the discharge, which occurred several months after the other discharges found to be discriminatory, was on account of Timmerman\u2019s union membership, and we think that the conclusion to that effect must be condemned as speculative.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-21\">The findings and order of the Board will accordingly be modified by eliminat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>ing therefrom the findings with respect to Timmerman and the order for his reinstatement; and as so modified it will be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">Modified and enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
