The motion was treated as having been filed under: 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255. Appellant entered ,a plea of guilty to an indictment charging him with the unlawful possession of narcotics in violation of 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2553(a). Upon a plea of guilty, he was sentenced to serve a term of five years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-22\">The- motion alleges that the judgment and sentence is void because appellant was deprived of effective aid and assistance of counsel; that the attorney, George Haley, who appeared with the appellant at the time the plea of guilty was entered, was not admitted to prac*tice in the State and Federal Courts of Kansas; and that the attorney'induced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>him to enter a plea of guilty by trickery and fraud. The record does not disclose whether the attorney was appointed by the court or was of the appellant\u2019s own selection. The record does not contain a transcript of the proceedings at the time the plea was entered. The judgment and sentence recite that the defendant was represented \u201cby counsel George Haley for Myles Stevens\u201d. We do not mean to indicate that a prisoner is entitled to a hearing on a motion filed under Section 2255 in all cases where it is alleged that he received ineffective aid and assistance of counsel, but under the allegations of this motion we believe that the appellant should be entitled to show all the facts and circumstances concerning the representation which he had at the time he entered his plea of guilty. Wheatley v. United States, 10 Cir., 198 F.2d 325.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">The order denying the motion without a hearing is reversed, and the cause is remanded with instructions to grant a hearing on the motion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
