Code, \u00a7 11350), possession of amphetamines (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11377), and possession of a sawed-off shotgun (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12020).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-11\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b911-12\">On May 19, 1974, defendant was arrested at his place of residence for an offense unrelated to the charges from which he appeals. At the time of his arrest, Pam Blosser and Jackie Johnson resided with defendant. While defendant was confined in the county jail, a search warrant was issued, authorizing a search of his residence. The search was carried out by Sheriff Detectives O\u2019Neal, Robinson, Kelley and Magers and Parole Officer Dean. The officers knocked on the door of defendant\u2019s home; Pam Blosser (subsequently identified as defendant\u2019s girl friend) responded. The officers identified themselves, exhibited the search warrant, and were permitted to enter the house and conduct the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>In the defendant\u2019s bedroom, at that time shared with Pam, the officers found a large home-constructed water bed. A search of the bed frame disclosed hollowed-out compartments in which the officers found a loaded .12 gauge sawed-off shotgun, .72 grams of heroin, a loaded M-l banana clip, and 4.05 grams of pintobarb, a barbituate. The bed compartments also produced various items of narcotic paraphernalia and a container of methedrine, an amphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">Defendant, testifying in his own behalf, asserted that he did not place any of the contraband in the frame, nor did he authorize any other persons to do so. He stated that he did not have shotguns in his home at the time of his arrest although he used them for hunting. He also testified that shortly before his arrest, he observed a pill vial in Jackie Johnson\u2019s possession, similar to the one found in the bed-frame compartment, and that he had previously observed Jackie inject speed.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">On appeal, defendant contends that the trial court erred: (1) by improperly instructing the jury; and (2) in refusing to admit in evidence a transcript of testimony given by a witness in a former trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">Jury Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b912-7\">In undertaking a review of the instructions given and refused, we first examine the nature of the crimes charged. Defendant was charged with possession of narcotics and a sawed-off shotgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-8\">The elements of possession are well established and were succinctly set forth in <em>People </em>v. <em>Valerio </em>(1970) 13 Cal.App.3d 912 [92 Cal.Rptr. 82], The court at page 921 stated: \u201cIt is, of course, well established that to convict an accused of possession of marijuana it must be proved that he had knowledge of its presence, that he had knowledge of its character and that he had either actual or constructive possession of a tisable quantity thereof. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Francis, </em>71 Cal.2d 66, 71-72 [75 Cal.Rptr. 199, 450 P.2d 591]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Groom, supra, </em>60 Cal.2d 694, 696 [36 Cal.Rptr. 327, 388 P.2d 359]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Redrick, supra, </em>55 Cal.2d 282, 285 [10 Cal.Rptr. 823, 359 P.2d 255].) It is necessaiy to a finding of either actual or constructive possesion that the accused had the right to exercise dominion and control over the contraband or at least that he had the right to exercise dominion and control over the place where it was found. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Francis, supra; People </em>v. <em>Groom, supra.) </em>Conviction is not precluded, however, if the defendant\u2019s right to exercise dominion and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1003\">*1003</page-number>control over the place where the contraband was located is shared with another. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Francis, supra, </em>at p. 71; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>191 Cal.App.2d 296, 302 [12 Cal.Rptr. 748].)\u201d (See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Showers </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 639, 643-644 [68 Cal.Rptr. 459, 440 P.2d 939]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Coleman </em>(1972) 28 Cal.App.3d 36, 45 [104 Cal.Rptr. 363]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Robarge </em>(1957) 151 Cal.App.2d 660, 668 [312 P.2d 70].)  The fact of possession may be established by circumstantial evidence and any reasonable inferences drawn therefrom,  It is also well settled that exclusive possession or control is not necessary. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Estrada </em>(1965) 234 Cal.App.2d 136, 155 [44 Cal.Rptr. 165, 11 A.L.R.3d 1307].)</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">Although Pam and two others had keys to defendant\u2019s house, the premises were nonetheless in his possession and control on the day of his arrest. Only Pam shared defendant\u2019s bedroom. There is no direct evidence that the others having access to the house had knowledge of the secret storage area.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">The defendant admitted constructing the water bed frame with the concealed compartments within which the contraband was found; he admitted using shotguns for hunting purposes and having in his possession live shotgun shells. From these facts, inferences of knowledge and possession of the contraband may be drawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">On the elements of the charges, the court submitted to the jury CALJIC Nos. 12.00<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and 12.35.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b914-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1004\">*1004</page-number>In addition to those instructions, the defendant requested and the court gave the following instruction: \u201cThe fact that the defendant is unable to produce evidence that the restricted dangerous drugs belonged to someone else is not evidence that the drugs belonged to him.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Antista </em>(1954) 129 Cal.App.2d 47 [276 P.2d 177].)</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">Defendant submitted the following instruction which was refused: \u201cEvidence is insufficient to support a finding of possession if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-5\">\u201c1. There is no evidence to show the presence of the contraband prior to the defendant\u2019s leaving his residence; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-6\">\u201c2. There was a user, or users, of the narcotics in the residence at the time it was found; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-7\">\u201c3. There is no other fact or circumstance of an incriminating nature.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b914-8\">This refusal is asserted by defendant as reversible error. We disagree.  The rejected instruction may best be described as argumentative. It embodies recitals of fact drawn from the evidence in such a manner as to constitute argument to the jury in the guise of a statement of law. Such an instruction is entirely improper. (See Witkin, Cal. Criminal Procedure (1963) Trial, \u00a7 477, p. 484.)</p>\n<p id=\"b914-9\">Instructions on eveiy aspect of the case must be given, and should be clear, concise and simple in order to avoid misleading the jury or in any way overemphasizing either party\u2019s theory. <em>(Guerra </em>v. <em>Handlery Hotels, Inc. </em>(1959) 53 Cal.2d 266 [1 Cal.Rptr. 330, 347 P.2d 674]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rhodes </em>(1971) 21 Cal.App.3d 10 [98 Cal.Rptr. 249].)</p>\n<p id=\"b914-10\">The trial court properly instructed the jury on the question of possession (fns. 1 and 2, <em>ante, </em>pp. 1003-1004) and knowledge of the presence of the contraband. The instruction requested and refused was properly rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1005\">*1005</page-number>Former Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">Defendant contends the trial court\u2019s ruling barring use of testimony given by Jackie Johnson in a prior criminal proceeding was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">\\</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Fisk, </em>a prior and unrelated case conducted in a different county, Jackie Johnson had been granted immunity and testified for the prosecution as a percipient witness to the murder of her husband. In an attempt to impeach her credibility by attacking her ability to perceive the events surrounding the killing, the defense in the Fisk case elicited<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> from her on cross-examination the fact that on the evening of the killing, she was under the influence of narcotics, having earlier injected speed; that she was a narcotics addict and had possession of\u2019 narcotics and the needed paraphernalia for its use. Defendant Rice sought to introduce this testimony in the, present proceeding, contending it was relevant on the question of his knowledge, possession and control of the discovered items.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">Former testimony given by a witness may be utilized in a later trial as an exception to the hearsay rule,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and since the adoption of the Evidence Code on January 1, 1967, such testimony has been admissible in criminal cases. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Nieto </em>(1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 231, 235-236 [73 Cal.Rptr. 844].) The first requisite to the use of the former testimony, that the witness must be unavailable for trial, was not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">However, one of two other criteria must be satisfied before such former testimony may be utilized.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-10\">Evidence Code section 1291, subdivision (a)(1), requires that the former testimony be offered against a person who offered it <em>in his own behalf. </em>Johnson testified at the request of the District Attorney of Yolo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1006\">*1006</page-number>County as a witness to a murder, after first receiving a grant of immunity from criminal prosecution. Her testimony was offered by the People as a percipient witness to the killing. The trial in which her testimony was given did not involve the question of defendant Rice\u2019s possession of heroin, amphetamines, or a sawed-off shotgun. The testimony sought to be used by the defendant herein was elicited on cross-examination by defendant in the Yolo County proceeding; it questioned the witness\u2019 ability to perceive. The People in the Yolo County trial did not offer that testimony in their behalf.  We therefore have no difficulty in concluding that such former testimony offered in this proceeding was not \u201coffered against a person who offered it in evidence in. his own behalf.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">Alternatively, section 1291, subdivision (a)(2), requires that the party against whom the former testimony, is offered have been a party to the prior proceeding with the opportunity to cross-examine the declarant with an interest and motive similar to that which he has in the present case. Such requirement is designed to make certain that the cross-examination in the first trial may serve as well in the second. <em>(Werner </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1944) 24 Cal.2d 611 [150 P.2d 892].)</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">Quite apart from the lack of any opportunity to cross-examine the witness, the \u201cPeople\u201d as a party to the Yolo County proceeding did not have the opportunity to examine the unavailable witness with the same interest and motive as the \u201c.People\u201d in the instant Sacramento County proceeding. The interest of the \u201cPeople\u201d in the instant proceeding is to establish the elements of possession of heroin, amphetamines, and a sawed-off shotgun. The People in the <em>Fisk </em>trial sought to establish that the crime of murder, had been committed by the defendant Fisk; since Johnson\u2019s testimony assisted in satisfying the People\u2019s burden, it would have been counterproductive to the People\u2019s interest to impeach her credibility by showing her association with illicit drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">Finally, defendant contends the former testimony should be admissible as an admission against interest.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b917-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1007\">*1007</page-number>Although Johnson was unavailable as a witness, her former testimony does not qualify as a declaration against interest. It was elicited under a grant of immunity and could not have subjected her to criminal liability. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rodriquez </em>(1969) 274 Cal.App.2d 770 [79 Cal.Rptr. 240].)</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">Puglia, P.
