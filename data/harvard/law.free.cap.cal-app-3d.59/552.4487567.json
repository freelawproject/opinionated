J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXQo\">Petitioner Juanrico Henreid seeks a writ of mandate requiring respondent court to grant his petition for a rehearing as to his status as a conservatee under the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act (hereinafter the \u201cAct,\u201d or the \u201cLPS Act\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-11\">In a petition filed pursuant to the Act, it was alleged that petitioner was \u201cgravely disabled\u201d within its meaning. (\u00a7\u00a7 5008, subd. (h), 5350.) At a jury trial thereafter conducted \u00fapon that issue (\u00a7 5350, subd. (d)), the jury reached a unanimous verdict that he was \u201cgravely disabled\u201d as alleged. On the day the verdict was returned, respondent court made an order appointing real party in interest as the conservator of petitioner\u2019s person and estate. (\u00a7 5350.) Real party placed petitioner in a state hospital pursuant to section 5358.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-12\">Two months after the conservatorship was established by the order mentioned, petitioner filed his petition for a rehearing as to his status as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>a conservatee. His claimed right to a rehearing at that time was based upon section 5364, which provides: \u201cAt any time, but not more than once each six months, the conservatee may petition the superior court for a rehearing as to his status as a conservatee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">Real party opposed the petition by motion. After hearing arguments on the motion, respondent court made an order in which it stated in pertinent part: \u201cThe petition for rehearing is based upon an erroneous interpretation of Welfare and Institutions Code section 5364. Section 5364 requires that six months must elapse from a trial or hearing establishing a conservatorship before a conservatee may petition for rehearing. On the sole grounds of statutory interpretation, [\u00b6] It Is Ordered that the motion be and hereby is granted and the petition for rehearing is denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">In the present proceeding, which petitioner thereupon commenced in this court, the sole question is whether respondent court\u2019s interpretation of section 5364 is correct. Petitioner challenges it upon the stated grounds that the express language of the statute must be read as requiring the lapse of a six-month interval <em>between successive petitions for rehearing </em>in the course of the conservatorship, but not as a bar to an <em>initial </em>petition for rehearing filed within its first six months. This construction rests upon the premises that the legislative intent which underlies a statute must be ascertained from its language, which leaves no room for interpretation if it is clear and unambiguous <em>(Caminetti </em>v. <em>Pac. Mutual L. Ins. Co. </em>(1943) 22 Cal.2d 344, 353-354 [139 P.2d 908]; <em>Leffel </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1976) 54 Cal.App.3d 569, 572 [126 Cal.Rptr. 773]); and that the courts may not usurp the legislative function by rewriting statutory language upon the basis of an ambiguity which is judicially invented where none exists. <em>(Rumetsch </em>v. <em>Davie </em>(1920) 47 Cal.App. 512, 515 [190 P. 1075].)</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Real party argues that the language of section 5364 is ambiguous, that petitioner\u2019s strictly literal construction of it is untenable in light of the consequences it portends (discussed <em>infra), </em>and that respondent court\u2019s interpretation is valid because the courts must look to the full context of a statute and, \u201cwhere uncertainty exists,\u201d must permit the consequences of a particular interpretation to override a strictly literal construction where this is necessary to effectuate the statutory purpose. (See, e.g. [cited by real, party], <em>Ivens </em>v. <em>Simon </em>(1963) 212 Cal.App.2d 177, 181-182 [27 Cal.Rptr. 801].)</p>\n<p id=\"b541-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>It is true that a reading of the express language of section 5364 may support the literal construction urged by petitioner. Support for that construction also appears, in principle, in provisions of the LPS Act which state its purposes in terms of the rights and liberties of persons whom it affects. (\u00a7 5001, subds. (a), (e).)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">As the parties agree, however, section 5364 clearly requires the lapse of six months between a conservatee\u2019s filing of <em>successive petitions for a rehearing </em>of his status. Its provision to this effect expresses the Legislature\u2019s intent to place a limitation upon the frequency with which a \u201cgravely disabled\u201d conservatee may relitigate his status during the course of his conservatorship. It also reflects a legislative determination that the prerequisite of a six-month interval effects an appropriate limitation in point of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Another stated purpose of the LPS Act is \u201c[t]o provide individualized treatment, supervision, and placement services\u201d to \u201cgravely disabled\u201d conservatees. (\u00a7 5001, subd. (e).) In light of this purpose, the six-month limitation is reasonable in its legislative intent and timing alike: the purpose would be frustrated if the status of a conservator charged with carrying it out is not established with sufficient finality to permit him the time, or the clear authority, to do so. (See <em>ibid, </em>and \u00a7\u00a7 5358, 5359.) His status manifestly lacks such finality if a conservatee may challenge it one day after it is established in the first instance. The reasonable six-month limitation accordingly makes no sense if it does not apply before an initial petition for a rehearing, by the conservatee, as well as afterward. Respondent court\u2019s interpretation of section 5364 is thus the only one which sensibly effectuates the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>Other provisions of the LPS Act support the court\u2019s interpretation of section 5364. The Act expressly provides that <em>any </em>conservatorship established for a \u201cgravely disabled\u201d person \u201cshall automatically terminate one year after the appointment of the conservator,\u201d and that \u201c[a]ny facility in which a conservatee is placed must release the conservatee at his request\u201d when termination occurs (\u00a7 5361), unless the conservator petitions for reappointment within the year and is reappointed in fact. (\u00a7\u00a7 5361, 5362.) The appointing court bears the responsibility of initiating proceedings designed to trigger the reappointment process, to insure that it will not be neglected, and to inform the conservatee of his rights if it is\u2014or is not\u2014pursued by the conservator. (\u00a7 5362.)</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">These provisions guarantee automatic termination of the conservator-ship, or judicial review of the conservatee\u2019s disability, at least once each year. As we have seen, section 5364 permits him to obtain such judicial review, upon his interim petition for a \u201crehearing,\u201d at least once <em>during </em>any year. He is thus reasonably protected against \u201cinappropriate, indefinite, and involuntary commitment,\u201d and his \u201cindividual rights\u201d are protected, \u201cthrough judicial review\u201d at reasonable intervals, even under respondent court\u2019s interpretation of section 5364. That interpretation accordingly comports with the provisions of the Act which require the protections mentioned. (\u00a7 5001, subds. (a), (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">The Act also provides that, with some stated exceptions, \u201c[t]he procedure for establishing, administering and terminating conservator-ship\u201d of \u201cgravely disabled\u201d persons \u201cshall be the same as that provided in Division 5 (commencing with Section 1701) of the Probate Code.\u201d (\u00a7 5350.) By this reference, it gives a disaffected conservatee the right to appeal from an order appointing his conservator. (Prob. Code, \u00a7 2101.) The Legislature\u2019s grant of this right is not consistent with its permitting him (as petitioner\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 5364 would have it) the overlapping right to commence de novo litigation of the same issues on the day after the order has been entered. In this respect and generally, petitioner\u2019s interpretation conflicts with conventional concepts of the finality of judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">We turn to the consequences which may follow from petitioner\u2019s interpretation. The LPS Act expressly provides that a proposed conservatee is entitled to a jury trial, of the issue whether he is \u201cgravely disabled\u201d in fact, when a petition for conservatorship is initially filed. (\u00a7 5350, subd. (d).) It similarly provides that he is entitled to a jury trial, of the same issue, if and when his conservator petitions for reappointment at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>the end of the first year, or of successive, years, of the conservatorship. (\u00a7 5362, subds. (a) and (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">Section 5364 does not expressly grant a conservatee the right to a jury trial of the issue upon his interim \u201cpetition ... for a rehearing as to his status\u201d filed pursuant to that section. The LPS Act refers to a \u201ccourt hearing,\u201d and to a \u201cjury trial,\u201d in such manner as to indicate\u2014if somewhat vaguely\u2014that the one is materially distinguishable from the other. (See \u00a7 5362, subd. (a); Cal. Conservatorships (Cont. Ed. Bar 1976 Supp.) \u00a7 8.43, pp. 116-117.) For both reasons, a conservatee\u2019s right to a jury trial upon his interim petition for rehearing is uncertain; one author views the right on that occasion as \u201cnot clear,\u201d but expresses his \u201copinion\u201d that it exists. (Cal. Conservatorships, <em>op. cit., </em>\u00a7 8.56, pp. 128-129.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">If the right to a jury trial exists upon an interim petition for rehearing filed pursuant to section 5364, petitioner\u2019s interpretation of the time-interval element of the section would mean that a conservatee is entitled to a jury trial, of the same issue, not less than four times during each year (or so) of his conservatorship.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In the absence of any language in the Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>expressly permitting it, the prospect of virtually uninterrupted litigation of one issue, throughout the course of conservatorship, is in conflict with the legislative mandate that the Act is to be construed so as \u201c[t]o provide individualized treatment, supervision, and placement services\u201d to the conservatee (\u00a7 5001, subd. (e)) and \u201cto prevent duplication of services and unnecessary expenditures\u201d in the pursuit of its objectives. <em>(Id., </em>subd. (f).)</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">In light of all the considerations mentioned, we must conclude that respondent court\u2019s interpretation of section 5364 is correct. This result does not necessarily turn upon the narrow question whether the language of the statute is plain or ambiguous.  While it is generally true that ambiguity in a statute is a condition precedent to its interpretation, the \u201cliteral meaning\u201d of its words \u201cmay be disregarded to avoid absurd results or to give effect to manifest purposes that, in light of the statute\u2019s legislative history, appear from its provisions considered as a whole.\u201d <em>(Silver </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1966) 63 Cal.2d 841, 845-846 [48 Cal.Rptr. 609, 409 P.2d 689] and cases cited; <em>Leffel </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>54 Cal.App.3d 569 at p. 572.)</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">A principal factor in support of petitioner\u2019s opposing interpretation is the concern of the Legislature, and of any court, with the rights and liberties of a conservatee who is confined under a commitment made pursuant to the LPS Act. (See \u00a7 5358.) We have seen that the six-month limitation imposed by respondent court\u2019s interpretation of section 5364, upon the conservatee\u2019s right to petition for an interim rehearing of his status as provided in that section, is both reasonable and consistent with the stated purposes of the Act in this regard. (See \u00a7 5350, subds. (a), (d).) If unreasonable consequences should ensue from it, he is entitled to seek habeas corpus relief at any time. (See Note, <em>supra, </em>7 Loyola L.A. L.Rev. 93 at pp. 120-124; <em>In re Gonzales </em>(1971) 6 Cal.3d 346, 351-352 [99 Cal.Rptr. 17, 491 P.2d 809].)</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">The alternative writ of mandate is discharged.

Conservatorships, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 8.56, p. 128 [italics added].) Another authority supports respondent court\u2019s and real party\u2019s interpretation to the contrary: \u201cDuring the entire course of the conservatorship, the patient has the right to judicial review of his or her status <em>(although no more often than once every six months) </em>[citing \u00a7 5364 by footnote] with automatic judicial review being required once per year [citing \u00a7 5361 by footnote].\u2019\u2019 (Note, <em>Civil Commitment Of The Mentally Ill In California: The Lanterman-Petris-Short Act </em>(1974) 7 Loyola L.A. L.Rev. 93, 102 [italics added; footnotes omitted except as indicated].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b543-7\"> This possibility may be illustrated by the following hypothetical timetable: A petition for the appointment of a conservator for John Doe, alleging that he is a \u201cgravely disabled\" person, is filed in early January of a given year. Doe is entitled to a jury trial of the issue alleged, upon his demand, within 30 days. (\u00a7 5350, subd. (d); \u00a7 5365.) A trial proceeds, a verdict that he is \u201cgravely disabled\u201d is returned, and a conservator is appointed accordingly, in February. Doe files a petition for rehearing forthwith, the process is repeated, and a verdict is returned and an appropriate order entered, in March. He files a second petition for rehearing six months later (which \u00a7 5364 clearly permits), the process is repeated once again, and a similar verdict and order are entered in October. The \"automatic\" termination procedure commences no later than December (\u00a7 5361), Doe demands a jury trial (to which \u00a7\u00a7 5350, subd. (d) and 5365 entitle him within 30 days), and a verdict of his continuing disability is returned (and an order reappointing the conservator is entered) in January. In the case of a conservatee who remains a \u201cgravely disabled person,\" and subject to some variations, the annual cycle of four jury trials could continue indefinitely.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b544-9\"> Retired judge of the superior court sitting under assignment by the Chairman of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
