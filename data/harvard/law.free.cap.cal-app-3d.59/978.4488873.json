J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYUJ\">This appeal represents but one more unsuccessful effort to evade the clear statutory provisions which make workers\u2019 compensation procedures the sole remedy of an employee against his employer in industrial injury cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-11\">Both plaintiffs were employed by defendant International Manufacturing Company, whose president, Jacuzzi, is joined as a defendant. Each complaint alleges that plaintiff, acting in the course and scope of his employment, was injured while operating a machine used by International in its manufacture of automobile wheels. Each claimed and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>recovered compensation through the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board. Each alleges that the machine was. defectively designed and manufactured by International, Jacuzzi, and a third party, defendant Harmsworth, who is not a party to this appeal. It is not disputed that International\u2019s part in the design and manufacture was solely for the purpose of its own use in its own manufacturing process, and that it never set up a separate unit for that purpose, nor sold any such machine. Summary judgment was granted to defendants International and Jacuzzi. Plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">It is undisputed that the \u201cconditions of compensation\u201d (Lab. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3600, 3601) concurred at the time of the employees\u2019 injuries insofar as International\u2019s wheel manufacturing business is concerned. In such a case, liability for workers\u2019 compensation exists \u201cin lieu of any other liability whatsoever to any person\u201d (\u00a7 3600), and \u201cthe right to recover such compensation . . . is . . . the exclusive remedy for injury or death of an employee against the employer or against any other employee of the employer acting within the scope of his employment,\u201d with exceptions not applicable here (\u00a7 3601).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">Appellants, however, argue that International acted in a \u201cdual capacity\u201d and that as designer-manufacturer of the device it is separately liable <em>(Duprey </em>v. <em>Shane, </em>39 Cal.2d 781 [249 P.2d 8]). That case, however, is readily distinguishable. Ms. Duprey, a nurse employed by Dr. Shane, a chiropractor, was injured in the course of her employment. Dr. Shane, individually and through another chiropractor in his employ, thereafter undertook to treat her for that injury. The treatment was negligent, and she was allowed to recover for those distinct injuries in a malpractice action. In undertaking to treat the injured nurse, Dr. Shane assumed a role distinct in both time and nature from that of employer. Attempts to extend the rule of <em>Duprey </em>have been repeatedly rejected (e.g., <em>Hazelwerdt </em>v. <em>Industrial Indem. Exchange, </em>157 Cal.App.2d 759 [321 P.2d 831]; <em>Deauville </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>188 Cal.App.2d 535 [10 Cal.Rptr. 511]; <em>Dixon </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>53 Cal.App.3d 499 [125 Cal.Rptr. 872]; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>State Compensation Ins. Fund, </em>50 Cal.App.3d 116, 120-121 [123 Cal.Rptr. 812]).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">In another approach, appellants point to the provision of section 3600 that liability for compensation shall exist \u201cwithout regard to negligence,\u201d and to condition (c) of the conditions of employment (\u00a7 3600) providing for recovery \u201cwhere the injury is proximately caused by the employment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>either with or without negligence.\u201d They argue that these emphases on \u201cnegligence\u201d show that the compensation act is intended only to supersede actions against the employer for negligence. Their action, they insist, is not based upon negligence, but on the strict liability of their employer for faulty design and manufacture of equipment which caused the injuries. This narrow and inverted view completely overlooks the express provision that liability for compensation shall be \u201cin lieu of any other liability whatsoever\u201d by the employer (\u00a7 3600) and that workers\u2019 compensation shall be \u201cthe exclusive remedy for injury or death of an employee against the employer\u201d or a fellow employee (\u00a7 3601). We note, too, that the Constitution (art. XX, \u00a7 21) authorizing the compensation act describes liability \u201cirrespective of the fault of any party.\u201d Appellants attempt to limit the application of this constitutional provision by quoting out of context a decision dealing with a different subject. <em>(Mathews </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeals Board, </em>6 Cal.3d 719, 728 [100 Cal.Rptr. 301, 493 P.2d 1165].) But that decision holds only that the compensation statute may deal with intentional infliction of injury. Moreover, the argument overlooks its corollary. If the injury here were not within the \u201cconditions of compensation,\u201d workers in comparable situations would be deprived of the beneficial features of the compensation act.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-4\">We note, also, that products liability rules do not apply in the circumstances here shown. International created the machine exclusively for its own use in its own plant and premises. It did not sell the machine or in any way place it in the stream of commerce. Rather, it was but an occasional or casual manufacturer, and thus not subject to strict liability (see Rest.2d Torts, \u00a7 402-A, com. f; 4 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law, pp. 3126-3127). Its design and construction of this machine was but auxiliary to its principal manufacturing operation. As such, it does not subject International to products liability to its employees <em>(Williams </em>v. <em>State Compensation Ins. Fund, </em>50 Cal.App.3d 116, 120-121 [123 Cal.Rptr. 812]). The rule sought by appellants would logically extend to every repair, replacement, or slight modification by an employer of a production machine purchased by him, including mere placement of such a machine in relation to other equipment. Such an extension of the narrow rule of <em>Duprey </em>is unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">Thus, neither prong of appellants\u2019 argument is supportable. Products liability is not applicable to the employer under the facts here shown. Even if such liability existed, its separate assertion is barred by appellants\u2019 resort to and recovery under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>There is no merit in appellants\u2019 argument that there is an inconsistency in granting summary judgment as to respondents and denying it as to Harmsworth, who allegedly participated in design and manufacture of the machine. Harmsworth has not appealed, and appellants are not aggrieved by the denial as to him. It is true that joint tortfeasors are both liable. The liability of the employer, however, is solely under the compensation act and that of Harmsworth is not. Hence, the employer cannot be joined in this action (see <em>Gilford </em>v. <em>State Compensation Ins. Fund, </em>41 Cal.App.3d 828 [116 Cal.Rptr. 615]). No issue as to employer\u2019s recoupment of compensation payments <em>(Witt </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>57 Cal.2d 57 [17 Cal.Rptr. 369, 366 P.2d 641]) can be affected by the judgment here.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">Scott, J., and Emerson, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">A petition for a rehearing was denied August 11, 1976, and appellants\u2019 petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied September 8, 1976.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b892-8\"> Retired judge of the superior court sitting under assignment by the Chairman of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
