Allred, Attorney General of Texas, hereinafter called Respondent, to compel his approval of certain bonds of such city in the sum of $22,500.00 designated as \u201ccity OF DAYTON SEWER SYSTEM REVENUE BONDS.\u201d All fact questions are admitted; only law questions being involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">It appears from this record that on January 4, 1934, the City Council of the City of Dayton, Texas, passed an ordinance authorizing the borrowing by such city of the sum of $22,-500.00 to be used for the purpose of constructing a complete new sanitary sewer system in and for the city. In order to bororw the above sum the ordinance provides for the issuance of thirty bonds, numbered consecutively from one to thirty, both inclusive, in the denomination of $750.00 each, bearing four per cent interest, payable semi-annually, and the principal maturing in numerical order, one bond each year beginning February 1, 1935, and ending February 1, 1964.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">In order to secure the payment of the above bonds with interest, the ordinance provides that the holder thereof shall have a mortgage and an encumbrance on such sewer system when completed, together with the franchise, and income thereof, and everything pertaining thereto, acquired or to be acquired. In addition to the security just mentioned, the ordinance also pledges or mortgages the sum of $83.33 per month out of the net revenues of the City of Dayton\u2019s water works system for the 360 months during which the.bonds run.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">As we understand this record the City of Dayton is a municipal corporation, duly organized under the laws of the State of Texas, with a population of less than 160,000. It now owns its own water works plant, and no lien has ever been placed thereon, or on any of its revenues. The city does not own a sewer system. The money borrowed from these bonds will not be used to purchase a system already built, but to defray the cost of building an entirely new sewer system.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">Also we understand from this record that none of the propositions involved in the ordinance under consideration have been submitted to a vote of the qualified voters of the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-11\">When the bonds provided by the above ordinance were presented to the Attorney General, together with the record per-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>taming thereto, he declined to approve the same, and gave his reasons for such refusal, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b96-3\">\u201c(a) That the proposed bonds constitute a debt of the City of Dayton within the provisions of Sections 5 and 7 of Article 11 of the Constitution of Texas, and that under the Statute attempting to authorize such bonds, no provision has been or can be made for the levy of a tax to pay them, as required by said Sections 5 and 7 of Article 11 of the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">\u201c(b) That the pertinent Statute, as originally enacted in 1911, and each and every amendment thereto, is without force and effect, because it is an attempt on the part of the Legislature to do indirectly that which the Constitution declares can not be done, i.e., to create a debt on the faith and credit of a city or town without first making provision to pay such debt by the levy of a direct ad valorem tax on all taxable property therein; hence, said Article 1111 et seq., as amended by said Chapter 122, Acts of 1933, are violative of the provisions of Sections 5 and 7 of Article 11 of the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">\u201c(c) That under Article 1112, as amended, and if a valid enactment, a City cannot make any such loan as here attempted without an election; that the proposed bonds would aggregate the sum of Twenty Two Thousand Five Hundred ($22,500.00) Dollars, and are to be issued for the purpose of \u2018construction of a complete new sanitary sewer system in and for said city/ and, if issued, payment thereof will be secured by a first mortgage on the entire sewer system of the City; whereas, the Statute (Article 1112, as amended) expressly provides that no such system shall be encumbered for more than Five Thousand ($5,000.00) Dollars, \u2019except for purchase money, or to refund any existing indebtedness lawfully created/ until authorized by a majority vote of the qualified voters of the city or town, which election shall be held and notice thereof given as is provided in the case of the issuance of municipal bonds by such cities or towns. Therefore, as the bonds are not being issued for the purpose of acquiring an existing plant or system, or to refund an existing indebtedness lawfully created, an election authorizing their issuance is required by the pertinent statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">\u201c(d) The Indenture or mortgage, executed to secure payment of the proposed bonds, contains the following stipulations, to-wit:</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">\u201cAlso, the net revenues of the present water works system owned, controlled and operated by said City, to the amount of THIRTY THOUSAND dollars ($30,000.00), or so much thereof which, together with the net income and revenues of the sani- . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>tary sewer system, will be sufficient to promptly pay both principal of and interest on said bonds, when and as the same shall become due, and which said sum of thirty THOUSAND dollars ($30,000.00), or so much thereof as shall be necessary to supplement the net income and revenues of the sewer system, for the purpose stated, has been appropriated by ordinance of the City Council of said City adopted on the - day of December, 1933, authorizing the issuance of the aforesaid bonds, and the amounts so appropriated shall be paid into the \u201cspecial sewer system revenue bond fund?\u201d in three hundred sixty (360) monthly installments, and beginning the 30th day of January, 1934, the sum of eighty-three dollars and thirty-three cents ($83.33), or so much thereof as shall be necessary to supplement the net income and revenues of the sewer system, for the purpose stated, shall be deposited in said bond fund, and such amounts as shall be necessary for said purpose shall be deposited in said Fund on or before the First Day of each month for and during said period of three hundred sixty (360) months, and a lien is hereby created on said net revenues of the said waterworks system for said purpose; provided, however, that no lien or mortgage shall attach to any part of said waterworks system, or its revenues other than a sufficient amount of the net revenues which, together with the net revenues of the sewer system, will be sufficient each month to meet the semi-annual interest and principal payments on said bonds; and it is expressly agreed and understood that whenever the monthly net income and revenues of the sewer system shall be sufficient to pay in full the amount needed in such month for interest and sinking fund on said bonds, it shall not be necessary to transfer any money from the waterworks system in and for that particular month.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">\u201cThe bond ordinance contains a provision similar in scope and purpose. Therefore, it is the opinion of the Attorney General that the governing body of this city is without power and authority to pledge, mortgage or encumber any part of the income and revenue of one public utility system for the use and benefit of another- public utility system; hence, the attempted pledge of a part of the income and revenue of the water system to pay, or to aid in payment of, the principal and interest of the proposed sewer system bonds is not permitted by the Statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">\u201c(e) That the pertinent Statute is without force and effect because it attempts to authorize cities and towns to mortgage and encumber their light, water, sewer and other utility sys<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>terns; whereas, it is expressly declared in Section 9, of Article 11 of the Constitution of Texas, that\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b98-3\">\u201c \u2018The property of counties, cities and towns, owned and held only for public purposes, such as public buildings and the sites therefor. Fire engines and the furniture thereof, and all property used, or intended for extinguishing fires, public grounds and all other property devoted exclusively to the use and benefit of the public shall be exempt from forced sale and from taxation, provided, nothing herein shall prevent the enforcement of the vendors lien, the mechanics or builders lien, or other liens now existing.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">The indenture or mortgage executed by the governing body of the city of Dayton makes provision for sale of the properties of the sewer system in event of default in payment of principal and interest of the proposed bonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">\u201c(f) That if it were legal or permissible for the governing body of a city to pledge the net income and revenue of one utility system for the use and benefit of another utility system, owned and operated by said city or town, the attempt here to pledge and encumber the net income and revenue of the water \u2022system throughout a period of thirty years, and in the maximum sum of Thirty Thousand Dollars ($30,000.00), was and is in violation of said Article 1112, as amended, in that, it attempts to mortgage and encumber the water system in excess of Five Thousand ($5,000.00) without first submitting the proposition or question to a vote of the qualified voters of such city.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">\u201c(g) That if it were legal or permissible for the governing body of this City to issue the proposed bonds without first obtaining authority therefor from the qualified electors, at an election held for the purpose, the proceedings of such governing body attempting to authorize such bonds still do not conform to the requirements of the statute, because Section 11, of Chapter 163, Acts 1931, (the Bond and Warrant Law) requires notice of intention of a governing body to pass an ordinance for the issuance of public utility revenue bonds of a city or town; and as no notice of intention to pass the ordinance authorizing the $22,500.00 City of Dayton sewer revenue bonds was ever issued and given, the qualified voters were denied the right to petition for a referendum election on the proposition to issue said bonds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">We shall now proceed to decide and determine the various law questions raised by Respondent, but before doing so we deem it expedient to here quote the several statutes under which Relators purport to set in issuing these bonds. Such statutes are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>Art. 1111: \u201cAll cities and towns including Horne Rule Cities operating under this title shall have power to build and purchase, to mortgage and encumber their light systems, water systems, sewer systems, or sanitary disposal equipment and appliances, or natural gas systems, parks and/or swimming pools, either, or all, and the franchise and income thereof and everything pertaining thereto acquired or to be acquired and to evidence the obligation therefor by the issuance of bonds, notes or warrants, and to secure the payment of funds to purchase same ; or to purchase additional water powers, riparian rights, or to build, improve, enlarge, extend or repair such systems, or any one of them, including the purchase of equipment and appliances for the sanitary disposal of excreta and offal, and as additional security therefor, by the terms of such encumbrance, may grant to the purchaser under sale or foreclosure thereunder, a franchise to operate the systems and properties so purchased for a term of not over twenty (20) years after purchase, subject to all laws regulating same then in force. No such obligation of any such systems shall ever be a debt of such city or town, but solely a charge upon the properties of the system so encumbered, and shall never be reckoned in determining the power of any such city or town to issue any bonds for any purpose authorized by law.

Such vote in either case shall be ascertained at an election, which election shall be held and notice thereof given as is provided in the case of the issuance of municipal bonds by such cities and towns.

The rates charged for services furnished by any such system shall be equal and uniform, and no free service shall be allowed except for city public schools or buildings and institutions operated by such city or town. There shall be charged and collected for such services a sufficient rate to pay all operating, maintenance, depreciation, replacement, betterment and interest charged, and for interest and sinking fund sufficient to pay any bonds issued to purchase, construct or improve any such systems or any outstanding indebtedness against same.

(Sec. 5, Art. 11, adopted election November 5, 1912; proclamation December 30, 1912.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-3\">Sec. 7. \u201cAll counties and cities bordering on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico are hereby authorized upon a vote of two-thirds of the taxpayers therein (to be ascertained as may be provided by law) to levy and collect such tax for construction of sea walls, breakwaters, or sanitary purposes as may be authorized by law, and may create a debt for such works and issue bonds in evidence thereof. But no debt for any purpose shall ever be incurred in any manner by any city or county unless provision is made at the time of creating the same, for levying and collecting a sufficient tax to pay the interest thereon and provide at least two per cent as a sinking fund; and the condemnation of the right of way for the erection of such works shall be fully provided for.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">The contention that these bonds violate the above constitutional provisions is based on the theory that a debt against the City running for a number of years is created with no tax levy provided to pay the same. We think this objection should be overruled. These bonds are secured only by the proposed sewer system, and its franchise, and the fund to be derived from the revenues from such system, and the revenues of the water system. The ordinance and the proposed bonds expressly provide that such bonds shall never be a claim against the tax funds of the City. Also the statutes authorizing such bonds make the same express provision. In other words the holder of these bonds merely has a claim against the sewer system, its franchise, and the revenues of such system, and the water sys<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>tem. He can never have any claim against tax funds. It is settled that such an obligation does not some within the term debt as used in the above quoted constitutional provision. City of Fort Worth v. Bobbitt, 121 Texas, 14, 36 S. W. (2d) 473; Id., 41 S. W. (2d) 228; City of Laredo v. Frishmuth (Civ. App.), 196 S. W., 190; McNeal v. City of Waco, 89 Texas, 83, 33 S. W., 322; Sowell v. Griffith (Com. App.), 294 S. W., 521. At this point we again refer to the fact that the statutes under which these bonds are proposed to be issued completely guard against them ever becoming obligations against the tax funds of the City. Article 1114, Vernon\u2019s Annotated R. C. S., 1933 Supplement, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">By appropriate objections Respondent contends that this proposed bond issue is void because the City is without power to incure the obligations proposed against its utility systems without first being authorized to do so by a majority vote of its qualified voters. This contention is based on the provisions of Article 1112, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">A careful reading of Article 1111, supra, shows that it authorizes cities and towns to mortgage and encumber, among other things, their water works systems and sewer systems, and the franchise and income thereof to secure funds to purchase same, etc. This article grants the power, and says nothing about an election being required as a condition precedent to its exercise. If the powers granted by Article 1111 are limited in the respect under discussion the limitation must be found in Article 1112. The article granting the power specifically states that the power is given to mortgage and encumber the system itself, together with the franchise and the income. The article which limits this power specifically says that the system itself shall not be sold without a majority vote of the qualified voters. It is then further specifically provided that such system shall not be <em>encumbered </em>for more than $5,000.00, except for purchase money, etc., without such vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-18\">In the instant case the City of Dayton has no sewer system and expects to use the money derived from the sale of these bonds in the construction, acquisition and completion of such a system. It is our opinion that such a record justifies the conelusion that, in so far as the proposed sewer system here involved is concerned, the mortgage thereon is for purchase money within the meaning of Article 1112. While it is for more than $5,000.00, being for purchase money, it is not required by this statute that a vote be had.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-27\">We now come to consider the validity of that part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>ordinance and proposed bonds to be issued thereunder which attempt to mortgage or encumber the income of the water works plant already owned by the City of Dayton. As we understand this record there is no outstanding mortgage against the water works system or its franchise or income.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">It will be noted that Article 1112 in effect specifically prohibits the <em>encumbrance </em>of the municipal plants therein mentioned for more than $5,000.00, except for purchase money or to refund any existing indebtedness, etc., until such <em>encumbrance </em>is authorized by a majority vote of the qualified voters. It appears that this ordinance, and these proposed bonds directly create a lien or <em>encumbrance </em>on the income of the water works system for more than $5,000.00. If this amounts to an <em>encumbrance </em>of the system itself within the meaning of the above statute, it is certainly prohibited thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">As we understand their briefs and argument Relators contend that since the statutes granting the power and authority to mortgage include the plant itself, together with the franchise and income, and since the statute requiring a vote only mentions the system itself, and does not mention income, the requirement for a vote does not include income. We cannot so construe this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">As already shown the present ordinance, contract and bonds attempt directly to give a lien and deed of trust on the income of the City\u2019s water works plant for more than $5,000.00. If this amounts in law to an <em>encumbrance </em>on the plant itself, within the meaning of the prohibitory statutes cited, the ordinance and proposed bonds are illegal, and this mandamus should be refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary defines the word encumbrance when used as a law term as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">\u201cLaw. A burden or charge upon property; a claim or lien upon an estate, which may diminish its value; specif., any interest or right in land existing to the diminution of the value of the fee, but not preventing the passing of the fee by conveyance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">In 20 C. J., p. 1250, the word is thus defined:</p>\n<p id=\"b105-11\">\u201cIn a legal sense. The word has now a fixed and definite meaning, although it is riot one of the terms of the law, and no \u2022definition of it will be found in the older books. The word has been defined to be anything that impairs the use or transfer \u2022of property; anything which constitutes a burden on the title; a burden or charge upon property; every burden on an estate, or clog on the title, such as a term for years, or grant by copy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>of court roll; a burden on land, depreciative of its value, such as a lien, easement, or servitude, which, although adverse, to the interest of the landowner, does not conflict with his conveyance of the land in fee; a claim or lien upon property; a claim, lien, or liability, attached to property; a legal claim or lien upon an estate, which may diminish its value; a condition which may work a forfeiture of a estate; a legal claim on an estate for the discharge of which the estate is liable; an embarrassment of an estate or property so that it cannot de disposed of without being subject to it; an estate, interest, or right in lands, diminishing their value to the general owner; a liability resting upon an estate; a lien or charge upon land which binds it for the payment of a debt; any adverse right or privilege which curtails the full and exclusive enjoyment of the land; a paramount right in, or weight upon, land which may lessen its value; a right to an easement of any kind; a weight on the land, which must lessen the value of it. As applied to an estate in land, it may fairly include whatever charges, burdens, obstructs, or impairs its use, or prevents or impedes its transfer. Encumbrances may be created by contract, or may be acquired in pursuance of some statute. . They are of two kinds. (1) That which affects the title: (2) that which affects only the physical condition of the property. A mortgage or other lien is a fair illustration of the former; a public road or a right of way of the latter. Where encumbrances of the former class exist, a convenant referred to under all the authorities, is broken the instant it is made, and it is of no importance that the grantee had notice of them when he took the title. Such encumbrances are usually of a temporary character and capable of removal. Where, however, there is a servitude imposed upon the land which is visible to the eye, and which affects any title, but the physical condition of the property, a different rule prevails.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-3\">The above definitions have received the approval of the courts of last resort throughout this country. In support of this proposition we refer to the numerous annotations contained in 20 C. J. supra. Also we refer to the various definitions contained under the term <em>incumbrance, </em>in the several editions of Words and Phrases.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">It has been held that the term <em>encumbrance, </em>is more comprehensive than the term lien. It includes liens, and any other burden resting on the property itself, or on its title, which tends to lessen its value, or interfere with its free enjoyment. First Church of Christ, etc., v. Cox, 47 Ind. App., 536, 94 N. E., 1048.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>A mortgage on the income of a water works plant for thirty-years would not prevent the passing of the fee by conveyance, but it would certainly constitute a burden or charge on the property which would diminish its value, and interfere with its free enjoyment. Such a mortgage is therefore an encumbrance on the plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">From the above it is evident that we hold that the attempt on the part of the City to mortgage the income of its water works swstem for more than $5,000.00 is an encumbrance on the system, and the proposition not having been submitted to a vote, and the bonds not having been issued for purchase money thereof, or to refund an existing indebtedness lawfully \u25a0created thereon, is in violation of Article 1112.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Respondent contends that these bonds are void because the statutes under which they are attempted to be issued are in contravention of Section 9 of Article XI of our State Constitution in so far as such statutes attempt to authorize the giving of liens on public utilities. This constitutional provision reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">Sec. 9. \u201cThe property of counties, cities and towns, owned and held only for public purposes, such as public buildings and the sites therefor. Fire Engines and the furniture thereof, and all property used, o'r intended for extinguishing fires, public grounds and all other property devoted exclusively to the use and benefit of the public shall be exempt from forced sale and from taxation, provided, nothing herein shall prevent the enforcement of the vendors lien, the mechanics or builders lien, or other liens now existing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">The contract or deed of trust under consideration here contains appropriate provisions authorizing sale by trustee. The ordinance authorizes such provisions. The pertinent statute, Article 1117, supra, specifically provides for sales by trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">It is settled in this State that sales made by trustees under voluntary deeds of trust, or mortgages duly authorized by law, with express power of sale are not forced sales. Sampson &amp; Keene v. Williamson, 6 Texas 102; Roots v. Robertson, 93 Texas, 365, 55 S. W., 308; Jordan v. Peak, 38 Texas, 429; Weiner v. .Zweib, 105 Texas, 262, 141 S. W., 771. Under these authorities we overrule this objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">Respondent contends that the statutes under consideration do not contemplate the mortgaging or encumbering of one utility system, or its franchise or income, to secure funds to build, extend or improve another utility system. A careful reading of article 1111, supra, convinces us that it should not be given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>such a restricted or narrow construction. In this connection it will be noted that, after naming each of the systems authorized to be mortgaged and encumbered, with the franchise and income, the statute then uses the phrase, \u201ceither or all.\u201d Then follows language that clearly contemplates that one or all of the utility systems named in the statute can be mortgaged for the purpose named therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-3\">By his last objection Respondent contends that the bonds proposed to be issued under this ordinance are illegal because the city did not comply with the pertinent provisions of Chap. 163, Act 1931, (Bond and Warrant Law of 1931), by giving notice of intention to issue before the passage of such ordinance. We understand this contention is based on Section 11 of the Bond and Warrant Law of 1931. That statute reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">Sec. 11. \u201cNothing herein shall be so construed as to preclude any city or town in this State, whether organized under General or Special Law or operating under Special Charter,, from encumbering or mortgaging its light system, water system, sewer system or any other utility, either, both or all, and the franchise and the income thereof and everything pertaining thereto acquired or to be acquired, to secure the payment of funds to purchase same or to make or purchase extensions, additions, or improvements thereto, as contemplated in Articles 1111 to 1118, both inclusive, of the Revised Civil Statutes, of Texas, 1925, with amendments thereto, or by valid provisions, of the charter of such city or town, or by the provisions of Article 1175, Revised Civil Statutes of Texas, 1925, provided that in making such contracts or agreements or encumbrances and in issuing revenue bonds, warrants or other obligations to be paid out of the property and income from such system or systems, the governing body of such city or town shall comply with the provisions of this Act in regard to notice and competitive bids and the right to a referendum of such question.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">\u201cProvided, however, that no competitive bids shall be required in case the municipality proposes to acquire an existing utility plant, and in such cases the voters shall be entitled to-a referendum, only on the question of whether or not the utility shall be purchased, in the manner and under the conditions set forth in this Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">\u201cProvided, further, that notwithstanding any provisions of this Act, and notwithstanding any provision of its Special Charter, if such city or town is acting under authority of House Bill No. 981, passed by the Regular Session of the 42nd Legis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>lature, the requirements of this Act in reference to notice, competitive bids and the rights to referendum shall not apply until after June 1, 1932.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">It will be noted that the above statute stipulates <em>\u201cprovided that in making such contracts or a,greements or encumbrances and in issuing revenue bonds, warrants, or other obligations to be paid out of the property and the income from such system or systems, the governing body of such city shall comply with the provisions of this Act in regard to notice and competitive bids and the right to a referendum of such question. </em>Such language is plain and unambiguous and leaves no room for construction. Certainly the plain language of Section 11 makes it necessary to obey the provisions of Chapter 163 of the 1931 Act <em>\u201cin issuing revenue bonds\u201d </em>under <em>\u201carticles 1111 to 1118 both inclusive.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">In conclusion it will be noted that we have not discussed or construed Article 1118a, Vernon\u2019s 1933 Supplement. This is because, as we understand this record, the City of Dayton is claiming no rights thereunder in this proceeding, and further because, as we further understand this record, such statute has no application to this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">We recommend that the mandamus prayed for by Realtors be refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">The opinion of the Commission of Appeals is adopted, and the mandamus refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">C. M. Cureton, Chief Justice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
