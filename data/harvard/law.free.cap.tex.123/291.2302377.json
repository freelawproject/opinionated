Barnes, her deceased husband. Trial in the district court resulted in a verdict on which judgment was entered for Mrs. Barnes for the amount of the policy with six per cent interest from March 25, 1924, amounting in all to a judgment for $7007.50. On appeal by the Association this judgment was affirmed by the Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>Civil Appeals. 43 S. W. (2d), 135. The Association brings error.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">The Association issued to Jesse A. Barnes an accident insurance policy dated November 1st, 1918. The Association contended at the trial in the district court that this policy had been superseded by another dated August 20, 1923. This was the only issue of fact submitted to the jury. The jury found that no new policy was issued. We take it that this finding settles that issue, and will decide the case on the undisputed facts as applied to the 1918 policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">The circumstances surrounding the death of Jesse A. Barnes were as follows: On the morning Jesse A. Barnes died the express company delivered to his home a pine box about a foot long, and a foot wide; the box was addressed to Jesse A. Barnes, 537 North Broadway. There was a return address on one corner of the box; at the time the box came Jesse A. Barnes was away from home; he returned about noon the same day, and Mrs. Barnes told him to take the box to the back porch and open it. It was tightly nailed. Barnes picked up the box and started to the back porch with it in his hands or arms, and just as he was passing through a double door it exploded. Barnes was blown to pieces by the explosion, and thereby instantly killed. None of the box was left after the explosion, and the evidence does not disclose who sent it. The return address appearing on it was fictitious.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">From the above we conclude that the evidence shows beyond any reasonable doubt that the above mentioned box constituted some character of infernal machine or bomb; that it was sent to J. A. Barnes for the purpose, and with the intention of killing him, and that it did kill him.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">The pertinent parts of the policy here sued on read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-9\">\u201cI.

This paragraph plainly recites that it does not cover \u201cintentional injuries in-, flicted on the insured unless such injuries are inflicted for the sole purpose of burglary or robbery.\u201d No contention is made that Barnes\u2019 injuries were inflicted for burglary or robbery, and the evidence is legally conclusive that his death resulted from the explosion of some kind of an infernal machine or device sent to him by some unknown person for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">In connection with the above we note that the list of injuries, and their causes named in Paragraph \u201c6,\u201d supra, as not included in the insurance policy, is rather long, but as applied to the undisputed facts of this case Paragraph \u201c6\u201d can be simplified and read as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">\u201cThe Association shall not be liable to any person for any indemnity or benefit for injuries or disabilities resulting from injuries or for death * * * resulting from an accident to a member, * * * in case such disabilities or injuries, fatal or nonfatal, shall occur as the result wholly or partially, directly or . indirectly, of any of the following causes, conditions or acts, or while the insured member was under the influence of, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>affected by such cause, condition or act, to-wit: * * * Intentional injuries inflicted on the insured by others unless such injuries are inflicted for the sole purpose of burglary or robbery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-3\">When read as indicated it appears beyond any substantial doubt that the contract by its very terms excepts from its insurance, \u201cintentional injuries inflicted on the insured by others,\u201d and it further, as conclusively appears, that such exception applies to fatal as well as non-fatal injuries. National Life &amp; Ac. Ins. Co. v. DeLopez (Civ. App.), 207 S. W., 160; General Acc. F. &amp; L Assur. Corp. v. Stedman (Civ. App.), 153 S. W., 692; Continental Cas. Co. v. Morris (Civ. App.), 102 S. W., 773; Hutchcraft\u2019s Ex\u2019r. v. Travelers\u2019 Ins. Co., 87 Ky., 300, 8 S. W., 570.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">As we interpret the opinion of the Court of Civil Appeals it holds that it is substantially doubtful whether or not the exception under discussion includes fatal injuries. The Court of Civil Appeals then resolves this doubt against the insurer and holds that fatal injuries are not intended to be included. The case of American Accident Co. v. Carson, 99 Ky., 441, 36 S. W., 169, is cited as authority for this holding. In our opinion that case is not authority to hold that fatal injuries are not included within the terms of the exception involved in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">In the Carson case, supra, the Kentucky Court of Appeals had before it an accident insurance policy by the terms of which Stephen M. Carson was insured against bodily injuries, effected through external, violent and accidental means, \u2014 \u201cFirst, which ^wholly disabled him; second, such injuries as partially disabled him; third, such as resulted in the loss of an eye; fourth, loss of a hand or foot; and, lastly, loss of both hands or feet, etc., in which event the full principal sum of $5,000.00 was to be paid to the insured, if he survived, or, if he died, then to his father, A. Carson.\u201d The policy then contained the following exemption clause:</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">\u201c \u2018This insurance does not cover disappearances; nor suicide, while sane or insane; nor injuries, whether fatal or otherwise, of which there is no visible mark upon the body; nor accidental injuries or death resulting from or caused, directly or indirectly, wholly or in part, by hernia, fits, * * *; nor extend to or cover intentional injuries inflicted by the insured or any other person, or injury or death happening while the insured is insane, or under the influence of intoxicating drinks or narcotics,\u2019 etc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">The insured was intentionally shot, and instantly killed by another person while the policy was in force. The insurance company denied liability under the terms of the exception, \u201cnor extend to or cover intentional injuries inflicted by the insured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>of any other person.\u201d In passing on this question the court held that the injuries referred to in such exception included only non-fatal injuries. This holding was based on the fact that a number of the exceptions expressly included fatal injuries, while this particular one did not. This was held to indicate an intention not to include fatal injuries in the exceptions where they were not named. We think this holding was correct as applied to the policy under construction. In this connection it will be noted that the general exception clause in the Carson policy simply stated, \u201cThis insurance does not .cover,\u201d followed by a number of exceptions each complete within itself. No statement was made in the general exception clause to the effect that, this policy does not cover the following injuries fatal or non-fatal. A very different exception clause is presented by the contract in the case at bar. Here the contract, in express and no uncertain terms, in effect says that all injuries, \u201cfatal or non-fatal\u201d following \u201cto-wit:\u201d are excepted from its insurance. To hold that the mere fact that \u201cfatal\u201d is not repeated in the exception involved here, while it is repeated in some others following \u201cto-wit:\u201d evidences an intention to omit it here would be to absolutely nullify the general exception which says in effect that all injuries, \u201cfatal or non-fatal\u201d following \u201cto-wit:\u201d are excepted from the insurance. Certainly the contract should not be given a construction that would nullify one of its principal provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-3\">The Hutchcraft case, cited by us, is by the same court that rendered the opinion in the Carson case, supra. In the Hutch-craft case the accident policy contained an exception clause reading: \u201cAnd no claim shall be made under this ticket when the death or injury may have been caused by dueling, fighting, wrestling, lifting, or overexertion, or by suicide (felonious or otherwise, sane or insane), or by intentional injuries inflicted by the insured or any other person.\u201d The Court construed the word <em>\u201cdeath\u201d </em>contained in the general words of the exception clause to apply to \u201cintentional injuries inflicted by the insured or any other person.\u201d In the Carson case the general exception clause was not so worded as to except all following injuries fatal or non-fatal; but merely stated, \u201cThis insurance does not cover,\u201d followed by exceptions some of which expressly included fatal injuries and some did not. Of course in such a policy each particular exception was treated as complete within itself, and it was determined that the inclusion of death in some of the exceptions, and the omission thereof in others evidenced an intention not to include fatal injuries in the exceptions not naming them. As already shown the policy in the instant case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>comes under the rule of the Hutchcraft case, because it contains a general provision excepting all injuries following the words, <em>\u201cto-wit\u201cfatal or non-fatal,\u201d </em>from its insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-3\">In addition to the above we are directed by the Supreme Court to say that in deciding this case on what has been said by us it does not want to be understood as holding by implication or otherwise that this policy would cover Barnes\u2019 injuries absent paragraph \u201c6\u201d thereof. That question is simply not decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Because the insured met his death by intentional injuries inflicted on him by another, with no purpose of burglary or robbery, the judgments of the Court of Civil Appeals and district court are both reversed, and judgment here rendered for International Travelers Association.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Opinion adopted by the Supreme Court, May 2, 1934.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
