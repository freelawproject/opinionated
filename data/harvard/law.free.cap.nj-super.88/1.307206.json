J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"A2\">The infant plaintiff Michael, then <em>7y% </em>years old, was injured by a metal rod thrown by defendant Harvey Burch, Jr. (hereafter Harvey), then years old. Michael and his parents sued Harvey and his parents for the resulting damages. Their action was dismissed at the end of the case, and they appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-6\">One count of the complaint alleged, as against Harvey, that he \u201cdid negligently, carelessly and recklessly propel and throw the rod.\u201d Against Harvey\u2019s parents the complaint alleged that, having \u201cnotice and knowledge of his prior propensities\u201d to throw things and strike other children, they \u201cnegligently, carelessly and recklessly supervised and controlled\u201d Harvey, as a result of which ho threw the rod and injured Michael. The pretrial order stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b21-7\">\u201c* * * Plaintiffs contend that infant defendant, without any justifiable cause or reason, threw a sharp metal rod at the infant plaintiff, which struck him in the right eye. Plaintiffs allege negligence of the defendant in unjustifiably throwing the metal object and failing to take careful and proper precautions to avoid striking the infant plaintiff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b21-8\">As to Harvey\u2019s parents, the pretrial order repeated the allegations of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-9\">The trial court dismissed the complaint as to Harvey on the ground that plaintiffs failed to produce evidence sufficient to go to the jury to rebut the presumption that he did not have the capacity to recognize and abide by any standard of care, and therefore he could not be adjudged negligent. It dismissed the complaint as to the parents on the ground that there was insufficient proof of their negligence. We affirm as to the parents but reverse as to Harvey.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-10\">Michael testified that he, Bobby Muzyka (Bobby) and Harvey were playing a game called \u201cknights in armor\u201d on the lawn of Harvey\u2019s house.' He described the game as follows: \u201cWe make believe we have little swords, and we were lighting against each other * we play fight though, we didn\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>punch, or anything like that.\u201d He said he didn\u2019t remember whether they had any sticks or \u201canything like a sword\u201d but he answered \u201cno\u201d to defendant\u2019s question, on cross-examination, whether \u201cthrowing something towards your feet\u201d was part of the game.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-4\">Bobby went home, but Michael and Harvey continued the game. Then Harvey went into the garage of his home, picked up the metal rod, came to the front steps and, after saying to Michael \u201cYou asked for it,\u201d he threw the rod toward Michael, who was then standing \u201cin the middle of the lawn.\u201d Michael testified that he and Harvey had no argument; that when Harvey went into his house, Michael considered the game as \u201cstill continuing\u201d; throwing a rod was not part of the game, and he did not know why Harvey threw it. He said Harvey had never thrown anything at him before. While Michael was being taken for medical attention, Harvey said to him, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b22-5\">Harvey\u2019s mother, called as a witness by plaintiff, testified that Harvey had previously been involved in incidents \u201cinvolving throwing of objects, stones,\u201d and that she had spoken to him on several occasions about it. When asked what she had said to him, she answered: \u201cLike I have always told him, he shouldn\u2019t throw things and -that little boys shouldn\u2019t do that, that although they might hit him, he should not throw back.\u201d When asked whether Harvey understood these instructions she answered, \u201cI imagine he did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b22-6\">Mrs. Muzyka, Bobby\u2019s mother, testified that she lived \u201cthree doors away and across the street\u201d from the Burches and had seen Harvey \u201cjust about every day\u201d for about two years before the accident. Harvey played with the Muzyka children. She said she considered Harvey \u201ca bright boy\u201d and \u201cabove average.\u201d However, she said Harvey was \u201calways playing with rocks\u201d and there had been many occasions, before the accident, when she had taken rocks and sticks away from Harvey. She had seen Harvey throw rocks at children many times, but she herself had never seen Harvey hit anyone with a rock. She testified: \u201cI told him this particular time T <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>don\u2019t want you playing with the children because somebody is going to get hurt. You really shouldn\u2019t play with rocks, you can get hurt, too.\u2019 So his mother came down to see why the children weren\u2019t playing with Harvey. I told her. She was very sympathetic, she was very nice to me and she told me she was punishing Harvey, and she talked to Harvey, she spanked him, brought him home and put him to bed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">Mrs. Muzyka told of an episode when Harvey bloodied \"the Lyle boy\u201d with a thrown rock; of another when he hit her son with a rope; and of still another when Harvey scratched a three-year-old\u2019s face with a branch, for which Harvey said he was sorry, but excused himself by saying \u201che just wouldn\u2019t get out of my way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">Mrs. Muzyka testified that on one occasion Harvey took her son Kevin\u2019s tricycle. She told Kevin (younger than Harvey) to go back for the tricycle while she watched. She described what happened. \u201cSo he went up and asked for his bicycle and Harvey hit him with his fist and knocked him down on the lawn. Harvey said to him Tf you come on my property I\u2019m going to knock you on your \u2014 rear,\u2019 but he didn\u2019t say rear.\u201d She said that on occasion she bad seen other children throwing rocks, or with sticks in their hands, but Harvey was the onfy one \u201cI had trouble with.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b23-7\">Another neighbor, Mrs. Eossett, testified that her son Gary was hit in the eye with a stick. After Harvey admitted that he did it, his grandfather spanked him. On another occasion Gary came home crying, with welts on his back. He accused Harvey; Mrs. Eossett told Mrs. Burch, and the latter punished Harvey.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-8\">The testimony established that Harvey was an only child. Both his parents worked and he was left in charge of his aged grandparents, who lived with the Burches.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-9\"> There may be circumstances in which a parent is responsible for the tort of his son. <em>Mazzilli v. Selger, </em>13 <em>N. J. </em>296 (1953); <em>Restatement, Torts, </em>\u00a7 316 (1934); Harper and Kime, \u201cThe Duty To Control the Conduct of Another,\u201d 43 <em>Yale L. J. </em>886, 893 (1934). However, there was no evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>of any such circumstances in the case at bar. There was no evidence whatever to implicate the father or even to show that he knew of Harvey\u2019s propensities. As to the mother, what was she to do? She spoke to Harvey, warned him and punished him, as did his grandfather. Harvey could not be kept away from rocks, sticks or other objects, or from other children, unless he was locked up or sent away. His condition was not such that it demanded such a drastic remedy, or constant supervision. Therefore, the case against the parents was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-4\">However, these very involvements in episodes of throwing things and striking other children; the instructions, warnings, pleadings and punishments which he received, and his attitudes and reactions in connection with the episodes, including not only his expressions of belligerence but those of apology, were enough in our judgment to take to the jury the issue of Harvey\u2019s capability to be culpably negligent with reference to the happening in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">In <em>Bush v. New Jersey &amp; New York Transit Co., Inc., </em>30 <em>N. J. </em>345 (1959) the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-6\">\u201c* * * we adopt the view that a child of less than seven years of age is rebuttably presumed to be incapable of negligence and hence the issue may not be submitted to the jury in the absence of evidence of training and experience from which the jury could infer that the child was capable of understanding and avoiding the danger of injury involved in the circumstances of the case.\u201d (at <em>p. </em>358)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b24-7\">The court also said that the test to be applied was whether \u201cthe particular child has the capacity to * <em>* </em>* act unreasonably under the circumstances, in light of the age, training, judgment and other relevant factors which apply to the particular child.\u201d (at <em>p. </em>354)</p>\n<p id=\"b24-8\">Professor Harry Shulman has set forth what such \u201cother relevant factors\u201d may be, in \u201cThe Standard of Care Required of Children,\u201d 37 <em>Yale L. J. </em>618 (1928), in which he says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-9\">\u201cIn one case or another, the courts have named, in diverse combinations the following qualities which are to be individualized: age, ability, alertness, appreciation, capability, capacity, comprehension, dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>cernment, discretion, development, education, experience, intelligence, judgment, knowledge, maturity, reason, sox, understanding. Age is included in all the combinations. Usually the combination consists of three qualities; and the combination, \u2014 age, intelligence and experience is the most frequent one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-5\">If a child is unusually intelligent, or experienced, or well informed for one of his age, he is held to the exercise of greater caution than the ordinary child with the intelligence, experience, and knowledge common to that age. The quality of his conduct must be commensurate with his superiority. Many of the cases found really go no further than that (though their language is general to the effect that the qualities of intelligence, experience and knowledge are always to be individualized in the case of children). An increase in the requirements on the ground of superiority does not, however, negative the existence of a minimum standard to which children must conform. Nor is the principle peculiar to cases of infants. If an adult has greater knowledge or experience than an ordinary person in his position would have, he is required to exercise that greater knowledge and experience. Instances of superiority are not important in determining a minimum standard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-6\">Deficiencies of a particular individual are, however, of primary importance. On the whole, adults cannot defend imputations of negligence on the ground that in mental capacity, experience or knowledge they fall below the standard of the reasonable man. In the case of infants, on the contrary, deficiencies in mental capacity, experience or knowledge are to be considered in determining whether or not their conduct is negligent.\u201d (at <em>pp. </em>620-621)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b25-7\">Although <em>Bush </em>involved the contributory negligence of a four-year-old, we shall assume for the purposes of this opinion that the principles therein stated apply to cases such as the one at bar in which the primary negligence of a child is involved. However, it should be noted that Professor Shulman pointed out in the article mentioned above:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-8\">\u201cThe standard of conduct to which an infant is to be held when his own liability is in question may properly be quite different from that to which he is to be held when he seeks to recover from an admittedly negligent defendant. It is apparent that different considerations may be involved in these several types of cases. There is a strong policy in favor of protecting children from losses attributable to their immaturity. It would be quite plausible, therefore, for a court to be more lenient toward children whose injuries are attributable, not only to their immaturity, but also to conceded tortious conduct on the part of the defendant, than toward children who are the sole responsible causes of injury to others. Yet the cases do not enter into niceties.\u201d (at <em>p. </em>619)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b26-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>Furthermore, it has been suggested that where, as here, the infant is the defendant and is insured, no allowance should be made for his age. <em>Prosser, Torts </em>(3d <em>ed. </em>1964), \u00a7 32, <em>p. </em>153; Fleming James, Jr., \u201cAccident Liability Reconsidered: The Impact of Liability Insurance,\u201d <em>57 Yale L. J. </em>549, 554 (1948). However, as we have said, we shall approach the problem before us without regard to insurance and with the assumption that the principles enunciated in <em>Bush </em>apply to Harvey\u2019s liability in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-4\">But the application of those principles to given facts must vary as the facts vary. One great difference between the contributory and primary negligence cases is that the former usually involve the child\u2019s comprehension of the acts or neglect of people about him, while those in which he is charged with primary negligence involve what he himself has done. It follows that usually a child needs less maturity, training and judgment to foresee the consequences of his own acts than to comprehend and avoid the danger created in whole or in part by the acts or neglect of others. <em>Cf. Rolfe v. Olson, </em>87 <em>N. J. Super. </em>242 <em>(App. Div. </em>1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">It is not denied that Harvey threw the rod and that it struck Michael. According to the pretrial order, his defense was that \u201cthe two boys were playing; that part of a surrey bounced off the ground and struck the infant plaintiff.\u201d Defendants\u2019 cross-examination indicated that, had Harvey taken the stand, he would have testified that the use of the rod was a permissible part of the game and that he had aimed it at Michael\u2019s feet. Generally, a participant in a game assumes the dangers inherent in it, but not dangers improperly introduced into it, or of risks resulting from negligence. See Annotation, 173 <em>A. L. R. </em>890 (1948). Plaintiffs contended that Harvey had no right to use a metal rod in the game; even if he did, he had no right to throw it; and if he did have the right to throw it at his feet, he did it negligently.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">Is there anything in the framework of these issues which justified the dismissal? We think not. In <em>Bush, supra, </em>the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>\u201cBut if the trial judge feels that reasonable men can disagree on the question of incapacity, even though he himself would decide for or against incapacity * * * he must allow the jury to decide * * *. The jury, if it finds that the particular child at the time of the accident had the capacity to be negligent, must then decide whether the particular child was negligent.\u201d (30 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>p. </em>354)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">Wo think the jury could have found that every normal 5%-year-old child knows that an object thrown in the direction of another may strike him and cause hurt and that he must take care to avoid it. As Prosser says, \u201cthere is a sufficient basis of community experience, on the part of those who have been children or dealt with them, to permit the jury to apply [the] special standard.\u201d <em>Prosser, Tor </em>Is, supra, at <em>p. </em>157. In any event, the jury could have found that this was known to Harvey, a bright boy, by reason of his attitudes, utterances and experiences above set forth, and the lectures, warnings and punishments he had received not only from his mother and grandfather, but from neighbors as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">The judgment in favor of Harvey is reversed. The judgment in favor of Ms parents is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
