We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-9\">Hoffman contends the district court erred by imposing a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice under USSG section 3C1.1. USSG section 3C1.1 provides for a two-level increase in a defendant\u2019s offense level when the defendant has \u201cwillfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice during the course of the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense\u201d and the obstructive conduct relates to the instant offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-10\">Hoffman concedes in his brief to this court that he should have reported his two trust accounts containing in excess of $300,000. He also does not dispute the district court\u2019s finding that he misrepresented to the United States Probation Office (\u201cUSPO\u201d) his payment history as to a settlement agreement with two of his victims. Furthermore, although he contends he omitted other resources because they were \u201ccorporate\u201d resources that he did not think required disclosure, he used these \u201ccorporate\u201d resources to pay for personal expenditures during the reporting period.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-14\">In its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, the district court correctly found that Hoffman\u2019s failures to disclose \u201cimpeded the USPO\u2019s ability to fully and accurately assess the defendant\u2019s financial resources by failing to provide a complete and accurate listing of all assets owned by him or under his control.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b857-15\">Nor do we discern any error in the court\u2019s finding that Hoffman\u2019s numerous failures to disclose were willful and constituted a breach of the plea agreement. Moreover, because Hoffman\u2019s misrepresentations and failures to disclose were material to the computation of his monthly restitution payments and the possibility of a fine, the court did not err in imposing a two-level increase pursuant to USSG section 3C1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-16\">Hoffman also contests $150,000 of the $807,180 restitution order as to two \u201crelevant conduct\u201d victims (Charles Hinesley and Mark Rofeh), arguing that there was no factual basis for the order as to these victims. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-17\">Under the Victim and Witness Protection Act (\u201cVWPA\u201d), a court, upon consideration of a victims\u2019 loss and the financial resources, earning ability, and needs of the defendant and his dependents, may order restitution for violations of Title 18. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(a) (1995).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201c[A] victim of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>offense that involves as an element a scheme, a conspiracy, or a pattern of criminal activity means any person directly harmed by the defendant\u2019s criminal conduct in the course of the scheme, conspiracy, or pattern.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3663(a)(2). Hoffman\u2019s wire fraud conviction included <em>\u201ca </em>scheme\u201d as an element. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1343 (1995 <em>&amp; </em>2002). The Presentence Report and its addenda (collectively, \u201cthe PSR\u201d), which included information supplied by the Assistant United States Attorney (\u201cAUSA\u201d) and' the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\u201cFBI\u201d), indicated that Hinesley and Rofeh were defrauded in the same manner as the other wire fraud victims and were victims of the defendant\u2019s misconduct. The district court did not abuse its discretion in considering this evidence. <em>See United States v. Marin-Cuevas, </em>147 F.3d 889, 895 (9th Cir. 1998) (\u201cA district court judge\u2019s determination that a particular item of evidence is sufficiently reliable is reviewed for abuse of discretion.\u201d). Nor did the district court clearly err in finding that Hinesly and Rofeh, as victims of Hoffman\u2019s scheme, were entitled to restitution for their losses. <em>See id. </em>(A \u201creviewing court should affirm the district court\u2019s factual determination unless the district court clearly erred.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">Finally, Hoffman contends that the restitution order is excessive because it improperly fails to give full effect to two settlement agreements he made with his victims. The applicable statute reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-5\">Any amount paid to a victim under an order of restitution shall be set off against any amount later recovered as compensatory damages by the victim in-(A) any Federal civil proceeding; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-9\">(B) any State civil proceeding, to the extent provided by the law of the State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqm\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663(e)(2) (1995).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b858-10\">Hoffman\u2019s proposed interpretation of this statute is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Cloud, </em>872 F.2d 846 (9th Cir.1989). In <em>Cloud, </em>we held that because there is no independently enforceable right to restitution, a victim cannot \u201cwaive\u201d such a right by settling with a defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 854. Thus, the <em>Cloud </em>court affirmed a restitution order of $7.5 million, notwithstanding the petitioner\u2019s settlement agreement with a victim for $1.5 million. <em>Id. </em>at 853-54. Hoffman\u2019s victims did not receive \u201cdouble recovery.\u201d The settlements with his victims for less than the full amount of their losses did not prevent the district court from ordering restitution that would fully compensate them.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 854 <em>&amp; </em>n. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-11\">The judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b857-11\"> This disposition, is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b857-12\">. The statute was amended by the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-132, \u00a7\u00a7 201-211, 110 Stat. 1214, 1227-41 (amending 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663 et seq., effective April 24, 1996). Given the dates of Hoffman's offenses, we apply the former version to avoid violating the Ex Post Facto Clause. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number><em>See United States v. Baggett, </em>125 F.3d 1319, 1322 (9th Cir. 1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b858-7\">. The amended statute sets forth substantially similar language at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(j)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b858-8\">. Although there was a $1000 error in the district court\u2019s calculation of the amount owed to victims Don Brown and Rick Roney, the error has been forfeited because Hoffman did not raise that claim of error in the district court or in this appeal. Moreover, the error is <em>de minimis </em>given the factual findings supporting the total amount of loss, the restitution order, and Hoffman's substantial concealment of assets in his attempt to obstruct justice.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
