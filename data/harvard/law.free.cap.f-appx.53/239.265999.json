We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm substantially on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Pearson v. City of Morganton, </em>No. CA-01-285-1-02-MU (W.D.N.C. June 11, 2002).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b273-10\"> We note that we lack jurisdiction over Pearson\u2019s claims relating to the issuance of a nontestimonial identification order (\"NIO\u201d) under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. <em>See Dist. of Columbia Court of Appeals v.
