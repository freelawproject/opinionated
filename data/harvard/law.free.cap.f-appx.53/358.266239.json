The case has been referred to this panel pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l). Rules of the Sixth Circuit. We unanimously agree that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Ward filed suit in Michigan state court, claiming that prison personnel violated his constitutional rights by reclassifying him without conducting a reclassification hearing. The defendants removed the action to federal court and sought summary judgment. The magistrate judge recommended that the district court grant the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Over Ward\u2019s objections, the district court adopted the findings and conclusions of the magistrate judge and dismissed the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">In his timely appeal. Ward essentially reasserts the claims he raised in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">As an initial matter, Ward\u2019s motions for a transcript and transmission of the record are DENIED. Because no hearing was conducted, there is no transcript. The certified record has already been transferred to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">Because the district court did not address Ward\u2019s claims in the light of <em>Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995), we pause to note that Ward\u2019s due process claims are merit-less because he has not shown that his reclassification resulted in an \u201catypical and significant hardship\u201d in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life. <em>Id. </em>at 486, 115 S.Ct. 2293; <em>see also Rimmer-Bey v. Brown, </em>62 F.3d 789, 790-91 (6th Cir.1995) (concluding that administrative segregation without a reclassification hearing did not impose an atypical hardship, under <em>Sandin).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">In all other respects, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment for the reasons stated and adopted by that court. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
