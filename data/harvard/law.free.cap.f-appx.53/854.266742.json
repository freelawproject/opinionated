The district court denied Alonzo\u2019s petition, adopting the magistrate\u2019s report without addressing Alonzo\u2019s claim that the limitations period should be equitably tolled because prison guards beat him and destroyed his eyeglasses, rendering him unable to read or write for nearly two years. We granted a certificate of appealability on the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-6\">If Petitioner\u2019s allegations are true that he was unable to read or write for almost two years because his eyeglasses were broken when he was beaten by \u201cadseg staff\u2019 and the prison took almost two years to replace his glasses, is equitable tolling warranted for the time that Petitioner\u2019s eyeglasses were not replaced by the prison?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and hold that the answer to this question is yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-8\">Equitable tolling applies when: 1) extraordinary circumstances beyond the plaintiffs control make it impossible to file a claim on time; or when 2) the plaintiff is prevented from asserting the claim by wrongful conduct on the part of the defendant. <em>See Alvarez-Machain v. United States, </em>107 F.3d 696, 701 (9th Cir.1996). Where \u201cadseg staff\u201d beat a prisoner, break his glasses, render him unable to read and write, and fail for two years to provide him with replacement glasses, this is both an extraordinary circumstance beyond appellant\u2019s control that makes it impossible to file his claim on time and gross misconduct by the state that prevents appellant from asserting his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-11\">The government argues that we should affirm the district court because appellant\u2019s claim regarding his eyeglasses was raised in a traverse and a traverse is not a proper pleading in which to raise additional grounds for relief. Our rule, however, is that \u201ca district court has discretion, but is not required, to consider evidence presented for the first time in a party\u2019s objection to a magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation.\u201d <em>United States v. Howell, </em>231 F.3d 615, 621 (9th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 831, 122 S.Ct. 76, 151 L.Ed.2d 40 (2001). Further, \u201cin making a decision on whether to consider newly offered evidence, the district court <em>must actually exercise its discretion, </em>rather than summarily accepting or denying the motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 622 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-12\">Here, it is impossible to tell whether the District Court declined to exercise its discretion or summarily accepted the findings of the magistrate judge. As in <em>Brown v. Roe, </em>279 F.3d 742 (9th Cir.2002), \u201cthere is nothing in the record that shows the district court actually exercised its discretion in refusing to consider [appellant\u2019s] newly-raised claim.... [T]he district court\u2019s order in this case is very brief, stating without elaboration that it conducted a <em>de novo </em>review of the magistrate\u2019s findings and recommendations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 745 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-13\">The District Court\u2019s order in the instant case is reversed and remanded to give the court an opportunity to consider appellant\u2019s equitable tolling claim based on the allegation that prison guards beat him, destroyed his glasses and failed to replace them for two years. <em>See id. </em>The District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>Court is free to make whatever factual findings it deems necessary. Further, if the District Court chooses not to entertain appellant\u2019s newly raised claim, it should explain its decision to refuse to consider appellant\u2019s evidence on procedural grounds. <em>See Howell, </em>231 F.3d at 623; see <em>also Lott v. Mueller, </em>304 F.3d 918, 925 (9th Cir.2002); <em>Whalem/Hunt v. Early, </em>233 F.3d 1146, 1148 (9th Cir.2000) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b889-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
