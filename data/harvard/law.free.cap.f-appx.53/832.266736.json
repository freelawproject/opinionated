At trial, Mr. Almendarez\u2019s motion to suppress the firearm was denied. On appeal, we conclude that the police had reasonable suspicion to detain Mr. Almendarez. Further, the district court\u2019s finding that the pat-down search the police subsequently performed on him was constitutional is not clearly erroneous. Mr. Almendarez\u2019s motion to suppress was therefore properly denied. As the parties are familiar with the facts, we discuss only those necessary to our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">1. Appellant argues that there was no reasonable suspicion to stop him, relying upon <em>Florida v. J.L., </em>529 U.S. 266, 120 S.Ct. 1375, 146 L.Ed.2d 254 (2000). \u201cCourts will uphold an investigatory stop based on a tip or other secondary information only when the information possesses <em>sufficient indicia of reliability that are independently corroborated by the police. </em>\u201d <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>211 F.3d 1186, 1190 (9th Cir.2000) (citing <em>J.L.) </em>(emphasis added). Here, the close spatial and temporal relationship between Mr. Almendarez\u2019s detention, his participation in an argument broken up by the very same police officers who arrested him, and the threats he made during the argument are sufficient independent corroboration of the anonymous tip with respect both to identity and to reasonable suspicion of criminal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">The tip in this case was quite detailed. It contained descriptions of clothing type and walking ability that matched the appellant\u2019s. The tip also accurately predicted Mr. Almendarez\u2019s location. Moreover, the dispatch included a specific description of what Mr. Almendarez had allegedly done with his weapon, a level of precision unlikely to be employed by hoaxers.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">The officers corroborated the tip with independent \u201cobservations of their own,\u201d <em>cf. J.L. </em>529 U.S. at 270, that began before the tip was communicated to them. The officers participated in quelling a dispute that involved Mr. Almendarez making threats. Immediately after dispersing the quarreling parties, the officers received a dispatch describing almost perfectly a man they had just seen. In this context, the anonymous tip served to crystallize already present concerns of the officers that criminal conduct may be afoot, and therefore possessed \u201csufficient indicia of reliability ... independently corroborated by the police.\u201d <em>Thomas, </em>211 F.3d at 1190. We therefore conclude that there was reasonable suspicion for the police officers to stop Mr. Almendarez.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-9\">2. Mr. Almendarez argues in addition that the officer who searched him failed to follow the legally-mandated procedure for frisking a detainee.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-10\">If a <em>Terry </em>detention is justified by reasonable suspicion, the police, barring exceptional circumstances, may undertake a limited search of the outer clothing for weapons. <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 24, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). The pat-down\u2019s purpose is to allow officers to conduct investigations without fear of violence, <em>Adams v. Williams, </em>407 U.S. 143, 146, 92 S.Ct. 1921, 32 L.Ed.2d 612 (1972); a search going beyond a <em>Terry </em>pat-down can be over-intrusive and therefore violative of the Fourth Amendment. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Miles, </em>247 F.3d 1009, 1015 (9th Cir.2001) (holding that officer exceeded the scope of a <em>Terry </em>pat-down when he chose to \u201cshake or manipulate [a] tiny box on the pretext that he was still looking for a weapon\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-11\">Mr. Almendarez maintains that even if there was reasonable suspicion to stop him, the search for weapons was more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>intrusive than permitted in a <em>Terry </em>stop. Although Mr. Aimendarez testified that he was not patted down and that the officer \u201cjust came from back, and went straight to my front pocket, and grabbed,\u201d his testimony was rejected by the district court. The court found, instead, that there was a pat-down search of Mr. Almendarez\u2019s outer clothing and that the officer found the gun pursuant to this search. There was evidence supporting this conclusion, namely the two officers\u2019 declarations to the effect that an \u201couter clothing pat\u201d was done, and the searching officer\u2019s precise recollection of the procedure he used, which conformed to the description of a pat-down search. The district court\u2019s finding was therefore not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b866-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
