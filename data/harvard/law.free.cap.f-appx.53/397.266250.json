We conclude Schetzer\u2019s equal protection challenge is unavailing. <em>See Regan v. Taxation With Representation, </em>461 U.S. 540, 547-48, 103 S.Ct. 1997, 76 L.Ed.2d 129 (1983) (statutory classifications are valid if they bear rational relation to legitimate governmental purpose, unless statute interferes with fundamental right or employs suspect classification; burden is particularly high to overcome presumption of constitutionality of tax statute). Sehetzer\u2019s remaining arguments are either raised for the first time on appeal, are frivolous, or are not material to the issue of his tax liabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b432-10\">. The Honorable James S. Halpern, United States Tax Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
