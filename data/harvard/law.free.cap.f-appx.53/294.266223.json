An appeal may not be taken from the final order in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B) (2000). When, as here, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>district court dismisses a \u00a7 2255 motion solely on procedural grounds, a certificate of appealability will not issue unless the movant can demonstrate both \u201c(1) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right\u2019 and (2) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 684 (4th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000)). We have reviewed the record and conclude for the reasons stated by the district court that Parker has not made the requisite showing. <em>See United States v. Parker, </em>Nos. CR-99-70054; CA-02-907-7 (W.D.Va. Sept. 11, 2002). Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
