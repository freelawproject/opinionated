R.App. P. 84(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-9\">Andrew Juan Anthony, the <em>pro se </em>petitioner in this case, seeks a certif\u00edcate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) so he can appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A) (providing that no appeal may be taken from the denial of a \u00a7 2254 petition unless the petitioner first obtains a COA). The district court concluded that Anthony\u2019s petition was untimely under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 and dismissed it with prejudice. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1) (\u201cA 1-year period of limitation shall apply to an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to a judgment of a State court.\u201d). Anthony is not entitled to a COA unless he can make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2253(c)(2). Anthony can make this showing by demonstrating that the issues raised are debatable among jurists, a court could resolve the issues differently, or that the questions presented deserve further proceedings. <em>See Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 483-84, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-13\">This court has read Anthony\u2019s request for a COA and accompanying brief and has conducted a <em>de novo </em>review of the district court\u2019s order and the entire record on appeal. That <em>de novo </em>review clearly demonstrates the district court\u2019s dismissal of Anthony\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition as untimely is not deserving of further proceedings or subject to a different resolution on appeal. Accordingly, this court denies Anthony\u2019s request for a COA for substantially those reasons set forth in the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation dated January 11, 2002 and the district court\u2019s order dated June 7, 2002, and dismisses this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b903-10\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
