Poore was sentenced to a 108 month term of imprisonment. On appeal, Poore argues the district court abused its discretion in denying the motion for a downward departure because the court erroneously determined it lacked the authority to grant the motion. Poore asserts that her extraordinary assistance in the prosecution of co-defendants took her case out of the heartland of cases anticipated under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5K2.0 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-11\">In a unique case, the district court may grant a motion for a downward departure; however, it is under no obligation to do so. Here, the record clearly demonstrates that the court was cognizant that it did possess the authority to grant the Government\u2019s motion for a downward departure but, in its discretion, denied it. The court stated that it had the authority to depart, but found that Poore\u2019s cooperation was adequately rewarded with a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. The court further found that this case was not outside the heartland of the guidelines and a downward departure would \u201cviolate the spirit of the guidelines\u201d and \u201cundermine\u201d them. Because the court clearly recognized its authority to depart, and chose not to do so, its decision is not renewable on appeal. <em>United States v. Brock, </em>108 F.3d 31, 33 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-13\">Accordingly, we dismiss Poore\u2019s appeal. We dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-14\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
