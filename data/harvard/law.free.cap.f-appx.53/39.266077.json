We review the district court\u2019s summary judgment ruling de novo, including its qualified immunity ruling, applying the same standards as that court. <em>Simms v. Okla. ex rel. Dep\u2019t of Mental Health &amp; Substance Abuse Servs., </em>165 F.3d 1321, 1326 (10th Cir.1999); <em>Pallottino v. City of Rio </em>Rancho, 31 F.3d 1023, 1026 (10th Cir.1994) (qualified immunity). After review of the parties\u2019 briefs and their accompanying appendices,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we conclude that the district court\u2019s ruling was correct. Accordingly, for substantially the same reasons set forth in the court\u2019s Order dated October 16, 2001, the judgment of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b73-24\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b74-7\">. After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to grant the parties' request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b74-19\">. Our review of appellants' contentions on appeal was unaided by counsel's failure to 1) provide any citations to the record in support of the Statement of Facts, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(7); 2) provide reference to the record in support of the legal arguments made, <em>see United States v. Rodriguez-Aguirre, </em>108 F.3d 1228, 1237 n. 8 (10th Cir.1997); 3) include sufficient portions of the record to support the arguments made, <em>see Scott v. Hern, </em>216 F.3d 897, 912 (10th Cir.2000); and 4) identify where each issue argued on appeal was raised and ruled on below, <em>see </em>10th Cir. R. 28.2(C)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
