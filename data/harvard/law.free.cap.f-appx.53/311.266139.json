We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion accepting the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Funderburk v. Vreeland, </em>No. CA-01-154-1 (M.D.N.C. June 5, 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">We deny Funderburk\u2019s motions for summons, for the request of production of documents, for equal protection, for the appointment of counsel, \u201cto bring ARA into its jurisdiction as allowed by law or grant diversity jurisdiction or amend service to ARA,\u201d to grant joinder without delay, to grant trial by jury, for compensatory relief in excess of $150,000, for mental anguish relief in excess of $150,000, for monetary relief in excess of $150,000, for exemplary relief in excess of $100,000, for breach of contract relief in excess of $500,000, for parties to offer fair and just settlement, for \u201cany other relief such as punitive the Court deem[s] just,\u201d and all other pending motions. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
