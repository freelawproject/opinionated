The court has determined that the issues presented occasion no need for an opinion. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. 36; D.C.Cir. Rule 36(b). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the judgment of the district court be affirmed. The district court correctly determined that appellant\u2019s claim was frivolous. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l). The United States District Court for the District of Columbia lacks subject matter jurisdiction to review appellant\u2019s challenge to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit\u2019s rejection of appellant\u2019s attempt to appeal from a decision by the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York. <em>See Marin v. Suter, </em>956 F.2d 339, 340 (D.C.Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
