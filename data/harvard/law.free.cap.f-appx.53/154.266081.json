Petitioner principally challenges the legality of his sentence as imposed. Such claims are more properly raised in petitions filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See Chambers v. United States, </em>106 F.3d 472, 474 (2d Cir.1997) (\u201cA petitioner seeking to challenge the legality of the <em>imposition </em>of a sentence by a court may therefore make a claim pursuant to Section 2255.... A challenge to the <em>execution </em>of a sentence, however, is properly filed pursuant to Section 2241.\u201d) (quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">Section 2255 provides an exception for petitioners who demonstrate that the remedy available under Section 2255 would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Triggering this \u201csavings clause\u201d requires a showing that \u201cfailure to allow for collateral review would raise serious constitutional questions,\u201d <em>Triestman v. United States, </em>124 F.3d 361, 377 (2d Cir.1997), such as if a petitioner has a credible claim of \u201cactual innocence,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 363.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">Here, Petitioner makes no such claims of actual innocence in his petition. To the extent that he relies upon <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) to trigger the \u201csavings clause,\u201d his claim is barred by <em>Forbes v. United States, </em>262 F.3d 143, 145-46 (2d Cir.2001) (per curiam) <em>(\u2018Apprendi </em>is not a new rule of constitutional law which has been made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">We note that Petitioner deliberately sought relief under Section 2241 and expressly declined to re-cast his petition under Section 2255. We, likewise, decline to construe the petition as one not intended or pursued by Petitioner. Lacking an identifiable remedy available to Petitioner under Section 2241, the petition must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-11\">For the reasons stated above, we AFFIRM the dismissal of Petitioner\u2019s Section 2241 petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
