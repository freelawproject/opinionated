He was sentenced to 120 months imprisonment for the carjacking offense and a successive term of eighty-four months imprisonment for the \u00a7 924(c) conviction. Moore appeals his sentence, arguing that the government\u2019s decision not to make a sentence recommendation after it filed a motion for a substantial assistance departure, <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5K1.1, p.s. (2001), violated his substantive due process rights. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-11\">Moore\u2019s plea agreement did not obligate the government to make a substantial assistance motion if he provided substantial assistance; it did not mention the possibility of a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The district court was initially inclined to depart upward pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4A1.3, p.s. (2001), but decided against an upward departure after the government moved for a substantial assistance departure. The government attorney explained that Moore assisted the government by exonerating a person who had been mistakenly identified as the carjacker. However, because Moore had an extensive criminal history and because the instant offense was a carjacking committed against a woman with five children in her car, the government attorney requested only a sentence at the low end of the guideline range. The district court decided to sentence Moore to the minimum sentence under the guidelines, a term of 120 months imprisonment, and the required consecutive eighty-four-month term of imprisonment. The court did not depart upward.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-14\">When the defendant\u2019s plea agreement does not obligate the government to move for a substantial assistance departure in the event the defendant provides substantial assistance, the district court may review the government\u2019s refusal to move for a departure, but may only grant a remedy if the government\u2019s refusal was based on an unconstitutional motive, such as race or religion, or is not rationally related to a legitimate government end. <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-15\">Moore acknowledges that the government did not breach the plea agreement, but contends that, in refusing to recommend a sentence below the guideline range because of his extensive criminal history, the government essentially negated the substantial assistance motion and argued against a departure based on an impermis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>sible factor. We take the latter argument to mean that, in his view, the government\u2019s conduct was not rationally related to a legitimate government end. However, we are not persuaded that a defendant may contest the adequacy of a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion based on <em>Wade.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">Because Moore was not entitled to a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion under the terms of his plea agreement, he was not entitled to an \u201cadequate\u201d \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. Moreover, the prosecutor\u2019s conduct was rationally related to two legitimate government ends: (1) rewarding Moore for his assistance and (2) ensuring a suitable punishment for the crime. The government attorney explained the extent of Moore\u2019s cooperation, for which she felt he should be rewarded, but also expressed her concern that a sentence below the guideline range would not adequately punish the offense. By filing the \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, the government opened the door for a downward departure if the district court, in its discretion, determined that a departure was warranted. The government\u2019s failure to recommend a sentence below the guideline range did not prevent the district court from departing. In this case, although the district court did not depart downward, the government\u2019s filing of the \u00a7 5K1.1 motion persuaded the court not to depart upward as it was previously inclined to do. Consequently, Moore has not shown that error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">We therefore affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b727-12\"> In the agreement, Moore waived his right to appeal his sentence except for claims of ineffective assistance of counsel or prosecutorial misconduct. The government has declined to assert the waiver because Moore\u2019s argument here may be construed as a claim of prosecutorial misconduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
