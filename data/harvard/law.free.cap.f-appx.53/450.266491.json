We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">We reject Quiros-Acosta\u2019s contention that the upward adjustment under \u00a7 3B1.4 requires a minor\u2019s active participation in a federal crime. <em>United States v. CastroHernandez, </em>258 F.3d 1057, 1060 (9th Cir. 2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 1167, 122 S.Ct. 1185, 152 L.Ed.2d 126 (2002) (holding that \u201c[i]t is sufficient that the defendant took affirmative steps to involve a minor in a manner that furthered or was intended to further the commission of the offense.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Quiros-Acosta admitted that he affirmatively acted to involve his three minor children in the offense to make it easier for him to get across the border, hoping that doing so would decrease his chances of being stopped by customs agents. While \u201cmere presence\u201d of a minor is insufficient to support the application of \u00a7 3B1.4, <em>United States v. Jimenez, </em>300 F.3d 1166, 1170 (9th Cir.2002), Quiros-Acosta\u2019s \u201caffirmative steps\u201d to involve his minor children in the commission of the offense brings him within \u00a7 3B1.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">We reject Quiros-Acosta\u2019s invitation to call for an en banc hearing on this case because there is no intra-circuit conflict and he has failed to demonstrate that <em>Castro-Hemandez </em>was wrongly decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b484-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
