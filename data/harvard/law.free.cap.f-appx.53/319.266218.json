This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-22\">In 1992, a jury convicted Martinez-Estrada of possession with intent to distrib<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>ute marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a) and 846. The United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida sentenced Martinez-Estrada to 204 months in prison, based upon a finding that he was responsible for 26,000 pounds of marijuana. The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction and sentence in 1995. Martinez-Estrada filed an unsuccessful motion to vacate his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 in 1997. He filed his \u00a7 2241 petition in 2001, claiming that his sentence was invalid under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). The district court denied the petition, holding that Martinez-Estrada had not shown that his remedy under \u00a7 2255 was inadequate or ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">In his timely appeal, Martinez-Estrada reasserts his district court claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">This court reviews de novo a district court\u2019s judgment dismissing a habeas corpus petition. <em>Charles v. Chandler, </em>180 F.3d 753, 755 (6th Cir.1999). Upon review, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision for the reasons stated by the district court. A federal prisoner may challenge his conviction and the imposition of a sentence under \u00a7 2241, instead of \u00a7 2255, only if he is able to establish that his remedy under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (last clause in fifth paragraph); <em>Charles, </em>180 F.3d at 755-56. The prisoner has the burden of proving that his remedy under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective. <em>Charles, </em>180 F.3d at 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Martinez-Estrada did not carry his burden. He claimed that his sentence was invalid under <em>Apprendi </em>because neither the indictment nor the jury instructions specified the amount of marijuana he possessed and his sentence exceeded the statutory maximum for his crime. In <em>Apprendi, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201c[ojther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348. Although this is a new rule of constitutional law, the rule has not been made retroactive to cases on collateral review. <em>See In re Clemmons, </em>259 F.3d 489, 491 (6th Cir.2001) (\u00a7 2244). \u201c[A] new rule is not \u2018made retroactive to cases on collateral review\u2019 unless the Supreme Court holds it to be retroactive.\u201d <em>Tyler v. Cain, </em>533 U.S. 656, 663, 121 S.Ct. 2478, 150 L.Ed.2d 632 (2001). Because the Supreme Court has not made the <em>Apprendi </em>rule retroactive, Martinez-Estrada\u2019s claims do not fit within the exception to \u00a7 2255 and cannot be brought under \u00a7 2241.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s order. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
