An appeal may not be taken from the final order in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability -will not issue for claims addressed by a district court on the merits absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-20\">In this case, the district court dismissed Belcher\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion on the ground that it was untimely filed. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Our review of the record in this case reveals that Belcher\u2019s judgment of conviction became final on September 18, 2000, the date the Supreme Court denied certiorari relative to his direct appeal. Belcher signed his \u00a7 2255 motion on January 2, 2001, which is the date this court considers to be the filing date. <em>See Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988). The motion was actually filed on January 12, 2001. Because Belcher\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion was filed within one year after the date his conviction became final, the district court erred in dismissing the motion as untimely, and further erred in denying Belcher\u2019s Rule 59(e) motion for reconsideration in which he raised the timeliness issue. Accordingly, we grant a certificate of appealability, vacate the district court\u2019s dismissal of Belcher\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion, vacate the district court\u2019s denial of Belcher\u2019s Rule 59(e) motion for reconsideration, and remand the case to the district court for consideration of Belcher\u2019s \u00a7 2255 claims on the merits. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-21\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
