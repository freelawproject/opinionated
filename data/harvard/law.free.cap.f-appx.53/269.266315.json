Johnson was convicted following a jury trial in the Western District Court of North Carolina and sentenced to ninety-seven months of imprisonment on count one and sixty months imprisonment on count two, to be served consecutively, followed by a three-year term of supervised release. On appeal, Johnson contends that there was insufficient evidence to find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt on either count. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-26\">We must uphold Johnson\u2019s conviction on appeal if any rational trier of fact, when viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979); <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc). Johnson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>argues there was insufficient evidence that a conspiracy existed at the time of his arrest and that his drug conspiracy conviction should, therefore, be reversed. Johnson further argues that since there was insufficient evidence of a drug trafficking crime, his conviction for possessing a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime should also be reversed. We have reviewed the record and conclude that there was sufficient evidence to find that a conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine existed beginning in the fall of 1999 up until the time of Johnson\u2019s arrest. Furthermore, a .22 caliber Colt handgun was found in Johnson\u2019s possession at the time of his arrest, when he also had a distribution quantity of cocaine in his possession. This evidence is sufficient to support his convictions. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
