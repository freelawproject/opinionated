The initial decision became final on May 1, 2002, when the Board denied Dr. Martinez\u2019s petition for review. We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b150-19\">This court must affirm decisions of the Board unless they are \u201c(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rale, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c) (2000). Dr. Martinez bears the burden of proving his entitlement to the retirement benefits he seeks by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See True v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>926 F.2d 1151, 1153 (Fed.Cir.1991) (citing <em>Cheeseman v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>791 F.2d 138, 141 (Fed.Cir.1986)). As such, Dr. Martinez must prove both that he meets the definition of an \u201cemployee\u201d set forth in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2105(a) and that he satisfies certain service m\u00ednimums under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8333. <em>See Dupo v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>69 F.3d 1125, 1128 (Fed.Cir.1995). Section 2105(a) defines an \u201cemployee\u201d as one: (1) appointed by a federal officer acting in his or her official capacity; (2) engaged in the performance of a federal function under authority of law or an executive act; and (3) subject to the supervi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>sion of a federal employee while engaged in the duties of his or her position. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2105(a) (2000). An individual must satisfy all three elements of section 2105(a) to be considered a federal employee, and the requirements for these elements are strictly construed. <em>Watts v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>814 F.2d 1576, 1579 (Fed.Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Dr. Martinez argues that the OPM should increase his CSRA retirement annuity on the basis of his employment as an elementary school teacher in the U.S. Virgin Islands from January 3, 1967, to October 3, 1999. Before the Board, however, Dr. Martinez failed to make any claim or submit any evidence that he qualified as a federal employee under section 2105(a) during this period. Instead, he argued that the OPM should credit the time he was employed as a teacher for CSRA retirement purposes on the ground the government of the U.S. Virgin Islands allegedly grants service credit to its employees who have former federal service. As the Board correctly concluded, nothing in law, rule, or regulation authorizes the OPM to credit non-federal government service for retirement purposes. Because the Board\u2019s decision was therefore not arbitrary or capricious, was supported by substantial evidence, and was issued in accordance with applicable provisions of the law, we affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
