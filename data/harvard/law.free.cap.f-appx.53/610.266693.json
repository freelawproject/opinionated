The district court had ordered an upward departure from the Sentencing Guidelines and assessed restitution for losses which Saxton challenged.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-22\">We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-24\">Because we write solely for the benefit of the parties, we recount the facts and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>procedural history of the case only as they are relevant to the following discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">In 1979, Sue Ellen was elected Prothonotary and Clerk of Courts for Mifflin County, Pennsylvania, an office she held until August 2000. An investigation revealed that throughout her twenty-year career, she embezzled funds collected in the normal course of business and converted these funds for the personal use of herself and her husband, Frederick Saxton.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On February 21, 2001, the Government filed an Information charging Sue Ellen and Frederick with one count for violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 (conspiracy) involving: the embezzlement of money from a program receiving federal funds, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 666(a)(1)(A); the transportation of stolen money in interstate commerce, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314 and the receipt of stolen money which has crossed a state or United States boundary, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2315. The Information charged that the conspiracy began in or around January 1993 and continued to at least April 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">On January 23, 2001, Sue Ellen pled \u201cguilty\u201d before the district court to the one count of conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. As part of the plea agreement, she agreed that the amount of the loss to all victims as a result of her conduct was more than $800,000, but less than $1,500,000 and she agreed to make full restitution as determined by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">The district court held a sentencing hearing on January 18, 2002. Among other things, it determined that the Sentencing Guidelines which provided for an offense level of 21 (which under Criminal Category I provides for a range of 37 to 46 months of incarceration) should be increased three levels to level 24 (which under Criminal Category I provides for a range of 51 to 63 months of incarceration). The district court found that this upward departure was warranted under (1) U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0 because the value used to calculate the sentence under the guidelines did not capture the aggregate harm of Sue Ellen\u2019s actions and under (2) U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.7 because her embezzlement of public funds over twenty years caused a significant disruption of a governmental function.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court also determined that the amount of restitution was to be calculated based on the period of time from 1980 to 2000-the period of Sue Ellen\u2019s entire tenure as a Prothonotary. The amount of restitution ordered by the district corut was $995,930.90.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-12\">Accordingly, the district court sentenced Sue Ellen to a 60-month term of incarceration, the statutory maximum under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, followed by three years supervised release, a $100 special assessment and restitution in the amount of $995,930.90 ($741,444.81 plus $254,486.09 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark>) to be paid by Sue Ellen, jointly and severally with her husband, Frederick. <em>See </em>note 2, <em>supra. </em>In ordering restitution in that amount the district court added to the $741,444.81 monies taken by Sue Ellen from 1993 to 2000 another $254,486.09 representing additional losses from January 1, 1980 to December 31,1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>Sue Ellen objected to the upward departure and the $995,930.90 restitution. At sentencing, the district court overruled both objections. In denying Sue Ellen\u2019s objection to the upward departure, the district court stated that the value used in calculating her sentence under the guideline failed to capture the extensive harm that she caused because the embezzlement of public funds over an approximate twenty-year period caused significant disruption of a governmental function. The district court also stated that the value used to calculate the guideline failed to capture the additional expenses that have been incurred, as well as the intangible harm from her conduct-the public\u2019s loss of trust in public officials. In denying Sue Ellen\u2019s objection to the restitution amount, the district court ruled that under the plea agreement she had agreed to satisfy in full the restitution ordered by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">We have jurisdiction to hear Sue Ellen Saxton\u2019s appeal of the application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0 pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review a district court\u2019s departure ruling for abuse of discretion. <em>Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 100, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 2047, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996). We review the district court\u2019s determination of the amount of restitution for clear error. <em>United States v. Akande, </em>200 F.3d 136 (3d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">Sue Ellen has two arguments on appeal. First, she claims that the district court erred in imposing a three level upward departure because the guideline offense level which provided for a 13 level increase for embezzlement for more than $800,000 but less than $1,500,000 fully accounted for the additional financial losses that the district court assessed. Second, she contends that the district court erred in holding her liable for an additional $254,486.09 of restitution to account for losses from January 1, 1980 through December 31, 1992 because those monies reflect losses for a period not charged in the Information and because her plea agreement to make \u201cfull restitution\u201d was ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-11\">The Sentencing Guideline Section 5K2.0 provides, in relevant part, that \u201cthe sentencing court may impose a sentence outside the range established by the applicable guidelines, if the court finds \u2018that there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines that should result in a sentence different from that described.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b646-12\">Sue Ellen argues that the district court erred in imposing a 3 level upward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0 because the guideline offense level applied in her case fully accounted for the additional financial losses of $254,486.09 during the period from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 1992. Saxton claims that because she was sentenced under Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(N) (2000),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which provides an offense level of 13 for losses of more than $800,000 but less than $1,500,000, the district court could not depart upward another 3 offense levels in as much as the $995,930.90 which the district court ordered for restitution was well within the thirteen offense level range. Saxton maintains that the guideline offense level under \u00a7 2B1.1 also fully accounts for the additional losses for auditing, increased insurance premiums and taxes referenced in the Presentence Report (\u201cPSR\u201d). She does not contest the upward departure pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>to \u00a7 5K2.7 (disruption of a government function). Saxton further claims that the government cannot meet its burden of showing that the district court\u2019s error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Saxton\u2019s argument is without merit. The Supreme Court has stated that the Sentencing Commission has not fully accounted for situations where the loss determined fails to fully capture the harmfulness of the conduct. <em>Koon, </em>518 U.S. at 94, 116 S.Ct. at 2045 (citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0). Indeed, the Commentary to Section 2B1.1, used to calculate the offense level here, explains that an upward departure may be appropriate \u201c[i]n cases where the loss determined ... does not fully capture the harmfulness of the conduct.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, Commentary, Application Note 14. Accordingly, in applying \u00a7 2B1.1, courts have made upward adjustments based upon intangible losses such as were experienced in Saxton\u2019s case. <em>See e.g., United States v. Robie, </em>166 F.3d 444, 455 (2d Cir.1999) (theft of commemorative stamps caused the \u201creal and intangible loss in the form of embarrassment and the appearance of incompetence inflicted on the Postal Service.... \u201d); <em>United States v. Nevels, </em>160 F.3d 226, 230-31 (5th Cir. 1998), <em>cert. denied, </em>525 U.S. 1185, 119 S.Ct. 1130, 143 L.Ed.2d 123 (1999) (value of funds stolen does not fully capture harmfulness of defendant\u2019s \u201cegregious\u201d conduct in stealing social security checks and using false identification to negotiate them).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">Similarly, in this case, the district court exercised its discretion and determined that an upward departure was warranted because the financial loss calculation based on Saxton\u2019s embezzlement failed to adequately reflect the intangible, non-monetary harm caused by her theft, namely, the loss of public confidence and trust in elected officials. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining Saxton\u2019s sentence based on an upward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-11\">The Mandatory Victims Restitution Act (\u201cMVRA\u201d) limits recovery to amounts \u201cdirectly caused by the conduct composing the offense of conviction,\u201d or \u201cthose amounts expressly agree[d] to\u201d pursuant to a plea agreement. <em>United States v. Akande, </em>200 F.3d at 139 n. 3 (3d Cir.1999) (citing <em>Silkowski, </em>32 F.3d 682, 689 (2d Cir.1994)). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. 3663A.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-12\">Sue Ellen presents two arguments on appeal. First, she argues that the district court erred in holding that she is hable for an additional $254,486.09, to account for losses from January 1, 1980 through December 31, 1992, for a total amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>$995,930.90, instead of for the period covered in the Information, January 1, 1993 through April 30, 2000, totaling $741,444.81. Saxton relies on our decision in <em>Akande, </em>200 F.3d 136, in support of her argument that a restitution order may not include losses caused by conduct that falls <em>outside </em>the temporal limits of the offense, as established by her guilty plea and the charging document, in this case, the Information. Moreover, Saxton claims that restitution for losses occurring during the charged time period constitutes full restitution. In support of this contention, she relies on <em>Silkowski, </em>32 F.3d 682, for the proposition that a promise in a plea agreement to make \u201cfull restitution\u201d did not permit restitution for losses outside the charged time period, where neither the express terms of the plea agreement nor defendant\u2019s admissions during the guilty plea colloquy obligated defendant to repay losses outside the temporal limits of the offense of conviction. <em>Silkowski, </em>32 F.3d at 689.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Saxton\u2019s position is without merit. We have noted that although the offense of conviction is \u201ctemporally defined by the period specified in the indictment or information,\u201d the parties may agree in the plea agreement to amounts beyond such limitations. <em>Akande, </em>200 F.3d at 139-40; <em>see also United States v. Mayer, </em>130 F.3d 338, 340 (8th Cir.1997) (noting that the loss stipulated in the plea agreement \u201cdelineates the outer limits\u201d of the defendant\u2019s restitution liability). Saxton\u2019s reliance on <em>Silkowski </em>is misplaced because in that case, the plea agreement contained no reference to the loss calculated in the PSR and relied upon by the district court in its restitution order. <em>Silkowski, </em>32 F.3d at 689. Saxton\u2019s case is different because there was a specific reference to the amount of loss calculated in the PSR and relied upon by the district court and indeed, she agreed to that specific amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">Second, she argues that the plea agreement was ambiguous in that her promise to make \u201cfull restitution\u201d could have meant restitution for only the time period charged in the Information, or instead it could have meant restitution for the charged period plus her pre-charge misconduct. She further contends that there was ambiguity in the plea agreement\u2019s statement that \u201cpursuant to the [MVRA] ... the Court is required in all instances to order full restitution to all victims for the losses those victims have suffered as a result of the defendant\u2019s conduct\u201d because there is nothing in the MVRA requiring restitution for pre-charge losses and also because it is unclear whether the \u201cconduct\u201d referred to is inclusive of the precharge conduct. We are not persuaded by Saxton\u2019s argument because there was no ambiguity-she explicitly agreed in her plea agreement to make full restitution in an amount between $800,000 and $1,500,000. Accordingly, the district court did not err in determining that Sue Ellen owed $995,930.90 in restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-10\">We will affirm the district court\u2019s judgment of sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b645-8\">. <em>United States v.
