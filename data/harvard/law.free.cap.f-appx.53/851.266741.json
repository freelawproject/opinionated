Smith appeals the denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas petition. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253 and \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-22\">Smith argues that his trial counsel\u2019s failure to request DNA testing on semen evidence from the gang rape for which he was convicted amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel. Preliminarily, we reject the government\u2019s contention that Smith procedurally defaulted this argument by failing to raise it at the state court proceedings. Both of Smith\u2019s state habeas petitions alleged that trial counsel was in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>effective because he failed to \u201crecognize the obvious exculpatory potential of semen evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">Smith\u2019s ineffective assistance claim fails if it does not satisfy either the deficient or prejudice prongs required by <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Smith has failed, at least, to show prejudice \u2014 that \u201cbut for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694. Even if test results revealed the semen did not match Smith\u2019s, such a finding would not have prevented a conviction under Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 264.1, because that provision also prohibits aiding and abetting the act of rape. Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 264.1 (\u201c[I]n any case in which the defendant, voluntarily acting in concert with another person, by force or violence and against the will of the victim, committed an act [of rape], either personally or by <em>aiding and abetting the other person, ... </em>the defendant shall suffer confinement ...\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>see also People v. Wheeler, </em>71 Cal.App.3d 902, 139 Cal.Rptr. 737, 740 (1977) (\u201c[Section 264.1] was designed to discourage gang sexual assaults ... \u201d). Although a negative result might have provided some minimal support to a defense that Smith was not present in the car at all, in light of the evidence at trial, there is no \u201creasonable probability\u201d that the outcome would have been different. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b885-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
