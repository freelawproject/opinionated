A certificate of appealability will not issue for claims dismissed by a district court solely on procedural grounds unless the movant can demonstrate both \u201c(1) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the [motion] states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right\u2019 and (2) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>its procedural ruling.\u2019\u201d <em>Rose v. Lee, 252 </em>F.3d 676, 684 (4th Cir.) (quoting <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000)), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 941, 122 S.Ct. 318, 151 L.Ed.2d 237 (2001). We have reviewed the record and conclude for the reasons stated by the district court that Shanton has not made the requisite showing. See <em>Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B); <em>Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b731-16\"> Shanton filed his notice of appeal more than sixty days after the district court entered its order on the docket, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1), and failed to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5), (6). We have jurisdiction to consider this appeal, however, because the district court's order was not entered on a separate judgment as required by Fed. R.Civ.P. 58. <em>See Hughes v. Halifax County Sch. Bd., </em>823 F.2d 832, 835 (4th Cir. 1987) (finding that five-page order did not satisfy separate judgment where order contained procedural history of case and district court's reasoning). Thus, the appeal period never began to run, and Shanton\u2019s appeal may not be dismissed as untimely. <em>See Quinn v. Haynes, </em>234 F.3d 837, 843 (4th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>532 U.S. 1024, 121 S.Ct. 1968, 149 L.Ed.2d 762 (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
