The district court denied Baramdyka\u2019s motion, finding that \u201c[t]he defendant has not shown any compelling reason to override the Court\u2019s added condition.\u201d Baramdyka, now represented by counsel, appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-25\">Baramdyka seeks not to use a name <em>other </em>than his true legal name, but rather to <em>change </em>his true legal name. Because the conditions of his supervised release did not prevent Baramdyka from changing his true legal name, the motion for a modification of those conditions was superfluous. The district court was thus correct to deny the motion, although it should have done so on the ground that the motion was unnecessary and that Baramdyka is not prohibited from changing his legal name by appropriate order of state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>Under the applicable order governing his supervised release, Baramdyka may change his true legal name by obtaining the requisite state court order, provided that keeps those responsible for overseeing his supervised release fully informed. He continues to be prohibited from using any name other than his true legal name. This decision does not affect any other condition of Baramdyka\u2019s supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">AFFIRMED ON OTHER GROUNDS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b495-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b495-27\">.
