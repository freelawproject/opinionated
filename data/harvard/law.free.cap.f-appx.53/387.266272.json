This Court has previously affirmed the summary dismissal of the habeas claims relating to these events, in its Order dated July 15, 2002. In that Order, this Court limited the issues in Petitioner\u2019s brief. Specifically, the Order directed Petitioner to address whether his ability to earn good conduct credits was affected by his demotion in status and whether his claims are cognizable under \u00a7 2254.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-22\">Petitioner\u2019s entire argument section discusses only the disciplinary reports which were summarily dismissed by the district court, which dismissal was affirmed by this Court. Therefore, Petitioner\u2019s claims are denied and the decision of the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
