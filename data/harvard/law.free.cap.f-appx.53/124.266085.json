Petitioner contests the Review Commission\u2019s affirmance of petitioner\u2019s citation for failing to provide adequate fall protection under 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.501(b)(1) (2002) and challenges the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of the same regulation. For substantially the same reasons explained by the Review Commission, we deny the petition for review. The Secretary\u2019s interpretation of her regulation was reasonable, <em>see Martin v. OSHRC, </em>499 U.S. 144, 150-51, 111 S.Ct. 1171, 113 L.Ed.2d 117 (1991), and the Review Commission\u2019s decision was not arbitrary or capricious, <em>see </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A) (2000); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number><em>A.E. Staley Mfg. Co. v. Sec\u2019y of Labor, </em>295 F.3d 1341,1345 (D.C.Cir.2002). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the petition for review of the order of the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
