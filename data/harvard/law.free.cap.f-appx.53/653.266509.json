Allen pled guilty to participating in three armed robberies of retail establishments.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He faced a minimum sentence of fifty-seven years, but the government filed a motion for downward departure at sentencing pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e), which the District Court granted. The District Court then imposed sentences below the guideline range and below the mandatory minimum terms stated in Section 924(c). Alen now argues that the District Court erred under the United States Sentencing Guidelines (hereinafter \u201cthe Guidelines\u201d) when it denied his motion for downward departure due to an extraordinary medical condition pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5H1.4.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because the record makes clear that the District Court was aware of its authority under the Guidelines to depart downward, but exercised its discretion not to do so, we will dismiss Allen\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">We find that this Court lacks jurisdiction to entertain Allen\u2019s appeal because the District Court properly exercised its discretion to deny Allen\u2019s motion for downward departure. Our jurisdiction to consider the appellant\u2019s argument that he is entitled to a downward departure based on an extraordinary medical condition depends on the basis for the District Court\u2019s ruling. <em>United States v. Stevens, </em>223 F.3d 239, 247 (3d Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Denardi </em>892 F.2d 269, 271-72 (3d Cir. 1989). Where the District Court\u2019s ruling is based on the Court\u2019s belief that a departure on the grounds proffered by the appellant is legally impermissible, we have jurisdiction \u201cto determine whether the district court\u2019s understanding of the law was correct.\u201d <em>Stevens, </em>223 F.3d at 247 <em>(citing United States v. Mummert, </em>34 F.3d 201, 205 (3d Cir.1994)). We lack jurisdiction to review a refusal to depart downward when the District Court, knowing it may do so, nonetheless determines that departure is not warranted. <em>Stevens, </em>223 F.3d at 247; <em>Denardi </em>892 F.2d at 272. \u201cIf the district court\u2019s stated reasons are ambiguous, so that the record does not reflect whether the court\u2019s denial is based on legal or discretionary grounds \u2014 then the proper remedy is to Vacate the sentence and remand for the district court to clarify the basis for its ruling.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stevens, </em>223 F.3d at 247 <em>(quoting Mummert, </em>34 F.3d at 205).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">We find that the District Court\u2019s comments constituted a proper exercise of discretion and were not sufficiently ambiguous as to require vacatur and remand. The District Court clearly recognized it had the authority to grant downward departures, having granted the government\u2019s motion for downward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e). The District Court then specifically referred to the downward departure available for \u201cPhysical Condition, Including Drug or Alcohol Dependence or Abuse.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5H1.4. In denying the motion for downward departure, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-8\">Your counsel has filed a motion for a further downward departure as a result of your medical condition, and while I agree that you do have a medical condition, it\u2019s not of an extraordinary nature, as set forth in the guidelines, in my view, and I believe, also, that the Bureau of Prisons will be able to deal effectively with that condition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">This language demonstrates that the District Court recognized that it had the legal authority to grant a further downward departure for an extraordinary medical condition pursuant to the guidelines, but determined that the appellant\u2019s condition was not sufficiently extraordinary to warrant such a departure. This was a proper exercise of discretion and is therefore unreviewable.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b687-17\">. Specifically, Allen pled guilty to conspiracy to interfere with commerce by robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951; interference with interstate commerce by robbery, in violation of the same statute; use of a firearm during a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(c)(1)(A); and brandishing' a firearm during a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii) and (2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b688-6\">. This section provides that \"[pjhysical condition or appearance, including physique, is not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a sentence should be outside the applicable guideline range.
