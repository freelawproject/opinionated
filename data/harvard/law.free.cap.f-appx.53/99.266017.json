MSPB, </em>MSPB Docket No. AT-0752-01-0708-1-1, 91 M.S.P.R. 668 (Apr. 3, 2002). We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b133-25\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b133-26\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-27\">Mr. Pugh was employed as a Materials Handler, WG-6907-05, at the Naval Aviation Depot in Pensacola, Florida. Effective September 30, 1995, he was removed from his position pursuant to a reduction in force. Five years and eight months later, on June 30, 2001, Mr. Pugh appealed his removal to the Board. On October 4, 2001, the administrative judge (\u201cAJ\u201d) to whom the case was assigned issued an initial decision dismissing the appeal as untimely. <em>Pugh v. Dep\u2019t of the Navy, </em>MSPB Docket No. AT-0752-01-0708-I-1 (Oct. 4, 2001). The AJ\u2019s initial decision became the final decision of the Board on April 3, 2002 when the Board denied Mr. Pugh\u2019s petition for review. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">\u201c[A]n appeal must be filed no later than 30 days after the effective date, if any, of the action being appealed, or 30 days after the date of receipt of the agency\u2019s decision, whichever is later.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.22(b). The time limit for an appeal to the Board of an agency action may be waived if the petitioner demonstrates, by a preponderance of the evidence, good cause for such waiver. <em>See Walls v. MSPB, </em>29 F.3d 1578, 1581 (Fed.Cir.1994) (citations omitted). \u201c[W]hether the regulatory time limit for an appeal should be waived based upon a showing of good cause is a matter committed to the Board\u2019s discretion and this court will not substitute its own judgment for that of the Board.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. MSPB, </em>966 F.2d 650, 653 (Fed.Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Our scope of review in an appeal from a decision of the Board is limited. Specifically, we must affirm the Board\u2019s decision unless we find it to be (1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c); <em>See Kewley v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>153 F.3d 1357, 1361 (Fed.Cir.1998). The decision of the Board in this case is none of these.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">On appeal, Mr. Pugh challenges the final decision of the Board on two grounds. First he argues that the agency failed to give him adequate notice of his right of appeal to the Board. Second, as far as the proceedings before the Board are concerned, he contends that he was not adequately informed of what he had to do in order to establish good cause for the late filing of his appeal and that he was denied a full and fair opportunity to litigate the timeliness issue. We address these points in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">Mr. Pugh contends that he was entitled to a waiver of the Board\u2019s filing deadline because the agency failed to give him proper notice concerning his right of appeal to the Board. The AJ, however, found that the agency\u2019s May 25, 1995 \u201cNotice of Separation by Reduction in Force\u201d letter expressly referenced an attached \u201cBenefits and Entitlement Package\u201d that detailed Mr. Pugh\u2019s right of appeal to the Board. In 1995, the requirements of a notice of appeal rights included notice of the time limit for appeal to the Board, a copy or access to a copy of the Board\u2019s regulations, and a copy of the Board\u2019s appeal form. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.21 (1995). Mr. Pugh has failed to provide any evidence demonstrating how the \u201cBenefits and Entitlement Package\u201d was insufficient in any of these respects. We therefore reject Mr. Pugh\u2019s first argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">Turning to Mr. Pugh\u2019s second argument, a petitioner before the Board must be informed of the existence of a timeliness issue and the requirements for demonstrating either timeliness or good cause for a waiver of the timeliness requirement. <em>Lacy v. Dep\u2019t of the Navy, </em>78 M.S.P.R. 434 (1998). This requirement can be satisfied by an agency\u2019s motion to dismiss if it is sufficiently explicit. <em>See Nichols v. Dep\u2019t of the Interior, </em>69 M.S.P.R. 386, 388-89 (1996). The agency\u2019s motion to dismiss stated in bold letters that Mr. Pugh\u2019s appeal was untimely. In addition, the agency\u2019s motion to dismiss informed Mr. Pugh (1) that \u201c[ajppellant bears the burden of establishing by preponderant evidence that his appeal is within the MSPB\u2019s jurisdiction and that it was timely filed or that good cause existed for the delay,\u201d; (2) that \u201c[t]he Board requires that when an appellant does not submit an appeal within the time set by statute, regu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>lation, or order of the judge, it will be dismissed as untimely unless good reason for the delay is shown,\u201d; and (3) that \u201c[i]n <em>Scott v. United States Postal Service, </em>80 M.S.P.R. 581, 583 (1999), the Board held that to establish good cause for an untimely filing, a party must show that he exercised due diligence or ordinary prudence under the circumstances of the case.\u201d The agency\u2019s motion to dismiss satisfied the notification requirements with respect to the issue of timeliness.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Finally, Mr. Pugh contends that he was not given a full and fair opportunity to litigate the timeliness issue and to demonstrate good cause for his delay. The agency\u2019s motion to dismiss was filed on August 24, 2001 and the AJ did not issue his initial decision until October 4, 2001. Mr. Pugh claims to have responded to the agency\u2019s motion to dismiss. However, the AJ, in his initial decision, stated that Mr. Pugh did not submit a response to the motion to dismiss. Thus, Mr. Pugh was put on notice that his response was not in the record. Under these circumstances, he could have submitted a copy of the response to the Board with appropriate evidence of mailing when he submitted his petition for review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The record indicates that Mr. Pugh was given a full and fair opportunity to litigate the timeliness issue in front of the Board but simply chose not to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the final decision of the Board is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b135-8\">. It was Mr. Pugh\u2019s burden to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that this pleading was actually mailed. <em>McDaniel v. United States Postal Serv., </em>43 M.S.P.R. 583, 587 (1990). If a petitioner carries the burden of demonstrating that a letter is properly addressed, stamped, and mailed, then the petitioner is entitled to a presumption of delivery and receipt. <em>Pfaff v. Def. Investigative Serv., </em>25 M.S.P.R. 633, 636 (1985). Mr. Pugh, however, failed to offer any evidence of mailing in his petition for review and therefore was not entitled to a presumption of delivery and receipt.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
