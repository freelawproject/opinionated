We exercise jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">In the first report and recommendation, the magistrate judge recommended dismissing Smith\u2019s claims against several defendants as legally frivolous because Smith failed to allege any personal participation by them or because the claims were barred by the statute of limitations. The magistrate judge recommended dismissing Smith\u2019s other claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted because Smith was merely challenging a Department of Corrections\u2019 policy concerning earned credits. Also, the magistrate judge recommended dismissing other claims collaterally attacking Smith\u2019s conviction. Further, the magistrate judge recommended dismissing all other claims, but one, because Smith failed to allege a plain and simple statement of his claims as required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 8. On June 1, 2001, adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation, the district court dismissed all claims, but one, as frivolous, for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or because Smith sought money damages against defendants who are immune from such relief. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B), 1915A.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-16\">In his one remaining claim, Smith alleged his due process rights were violated on September 27, 2000, when prison officials took his legal materials and personal property from his cell and poured white latex paint on some of his property. Smith further alleged this incident constituted an unconstitutional retaliation for his exercise of First Amendment rights, including his request to exceed Department of Corrections\u2019 policy concerning the amount of legal materials prisoners may keep in their cells. The magistrate judge ordered a special report, which showed that before filing his \u00a7 1983 complaint, Smith filed several administrative grievances. Smith, however, never completed the prescribed administrative process. Adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation, the district court, on March 20, 2002, dismissed this remaining claim for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Smith appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-18\">Smith makes various, primarily conspiracy, arguments concerning his 1981 criminal conviction for three counts of second-degree murder. The district court correctly dismissed these arguments as a collateral attack on the conviction and beyond the scope of a \u00a7 1983 action. <em>See Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 481-82, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>(1994). Further, we note this court affirmed the district court\u2019s denial of Smith\u2019s habeas corpus petition raising similar issues in <em>Smith v. Hargett, </em>No. 99-6130, 1999 WL 1113073 (10th Cir. Dec. 7, 1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>530 U.S. 1264, 120 S.Ct. 2724, 147 L.Ed.2d 988 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">Additional arguments concerning Smith\u2019s imprisonment are advanced as well. As to these, we affirm for substantially the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s order of June 1, 2001, tjhose claims addressed by the district court. Although we liberally construe Smith\u2019s pro se allegations, <em>see Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972); <em>Cummings v. Evans, </em>161 F.3d 610, 613 (10th Cir.1998), we do not consider the arguments Smith asserts on appeal that were not properly before the district court and therefore were not addressed in that court. To the extent Smith sought to amend his complaint to assert these claims, we conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying leave to amend or supplement the complaint. <em>See Foman v. Davis, </em>371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962). Smith\u2019s new claims were not relevant to the claims before that court and they should have been raised in the Eastern, not the Western, District of Oklahoma. Also, we reject Smith\u2019s argument that the district court abused its discretion in denying injunctive relief with regard to some of these claims. <em>See Signature Props. Int'l Ltd. P\u2019ship v. City of Edmond, </em>No. 00-6403, 2002 WL 31538647, at *8 (10th Cir. Nov.8, 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">As far as Smith\u2019s claim that the district court incorrectly decided that he had failed to exhaust administrative remedies with respect to the September 27, 2000, incident, \u201cwe review de novo the district court\u2019s finding of failure to exhaust administrative remedies.\u201d <em>Jernigan v. Stuchell, </em>304 F.3d 1030, 1032 (10th Cir.2002).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-6\">The Prison Litigation Reform Act (\u201cPLRA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a), requires that \u201cavailable\u201d administrative remedies be exhausted prior to filing an action with respect to prison conditions under \u00a7 1983. Even where the \u201cavailable\u201d remedies would appear to be futile at providing the kind of remedy sought, the prisoner must exhaust the administrative remedies available.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 1032 (citing <em>Booth v. Churner, </em>532 U.S. 731, 740, 121 S.Ct. 1819, 149 L.Ed.2d 958 (2001)). \u201cAn inmate who begins the grievance process but does not complete it is barred from pursuing a \u00a7 1983 claim under PLRA for failure to exhaust his administrative remedies.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">Although Smith asserts he exhausted his administrative remedies, the district court\u2019s record does not support his assertion. Neither his partial compliance with the grievance process nor the Oklahoma Department of Corrections\u2019 awareness of his grievances satisfy the exhaustion requirement. Also, his asserted exhaustion of remedies for another claim not before the federal courts at this time does not prove exhaustion of remedies for this claim. Accordingly, we conclude that Smith failed to exhaust his administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">Contrary to Smith\u2019s final arguments, we conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying his discovery requests concerning his criminal conviction or in granting defendants\u2019 request for a protective order from the discovery requests, <em>see Bldg. &amp; Constr. Dep\u2019t v. Rockwell Int\u2019l Corp., </em>7 F.3d 1487, 1496 (10th Cir.1993), in granting defendants\u2019 motion for enlargement of time to file a brief, see <em>Ellis v. Univ. of Kan. Med. Ctr., </em>163 F.3d 1186, 1193 (10th Cir.1998), or in failing to recuse, see <em>Nichols v. Alley, </em>71 F.3d 347, 350 (10th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>After having reviewed the district court\u2019s file and Smith\u2019s many filings with this court, we AFFIRM the judgment of the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma for substantially the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s orders of March 20, 2002, and June 1, 2001. Smith\u2019s motion for leave to proceed on appeal without prepayment of costs or fees is GRANTED, but he must make partial payments as specified in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915 until the entire filing fee is paid. His emergency en banc motion for a preliminary injunction, ex parte motion for a contempt order, emergency en banc motion for contempt against defendants\u2019 attorney, motion for default against defendants and motion to strike defendants\u2019 brief, \u201cMotion\u201d-/\u201cAffidavit In Support,\u201d and combined motion for default, motion for contempt order and motion to vacate protective order are DENIED as moot. The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b49-10\"> The case is unanimously ordered submitted without oral argument pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
