Office of Personnel Management, </em>470 U.S. 768, 105 S.Ct. 1620, 84 L.Ed.2d 674 (1985). No other basis of jurisdiction having been established, the appeal is <em>dismissed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b575-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b575-11\">Mr. Terrano began his employment with the United States Postal Service on August 16, 1971. Conflict developed following the arrival of a new postmaster, Ron Herrington. Mr. Terrano was absent from work from May to November 1997. During this period he began treatment with Dr. Abbey Strauss, a psychiatrist, who noted that Mr. Terrano stated that he was abused and harassed by Mr. Herrington, and that this caused a sense of betrayal and insult. After Mr. Herrington was replaced as postmaster by Mr. Sal Vacca, Mr. Terrano returned to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-15\">On October 23, 1998 Mr. Terrano was placed on administrative leave after a series of complaints concerning his conduct and service. On October 5, 1999 Mr. Vac-ca issued a notice of proposed removal for charges relating to improper conduct, but this notice was replaced January 4, 2000 with a letter of warning and an order to return to work, taking cognizance of his twenty-eight years of service. Mr. Terra-no did not return to work, claiming that the harassment he had endured caused him stress and anxiety, and on January 18, 2000 he filed an application for disability retirement. The application included Standard Form 3112A wherein he stated that a \u201cstress disorder, acute anxiety disorder, depression, and detrimental emotional problem,\u201d interfered with his duties, that he was \u201cunable to function in a postal environment,\u201d \u201cthink properly,\u201d or \u201cassimilate and relate to other employees,\u201d and that he would \u201cbreak down at the least incident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-16\">OPM denied the application for disability retirement on the grounds that \u201c[n]o connection [was] shown between [Mr. Terrano\u2019s] anxiety and depression and [his] service deficiencies,\u201d and that Mr. Terrano had not established that his medical condition was \u201cincompatible\u201d with performance of the duties of his position. The MSPB affirmed OPM\u2019s decision, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-17\">JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b575-18\">Judicial review in disability retirement determinations is restricted by statute and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>precedent. <em>See Anthony v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>58 F.3d 620, 625 (Fed.Cir.1995). 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8347(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-5\">The Office [of Personnel Management] shall determine questions of disability and dependency arising under this sub-chapter. Except to the extent provided under subsection (d) of this section, the decisions of the Office concerning these matters are final and conclusive and are not subject to review....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-6\"><em>As </em>established in <em>Lindahl v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>470 U.S. 768, 105 S.Ct. 1620, 84 L.Ed.2d 674 (1985), the Supreme Court held that \u201cMSPB decisions concerning retirement disability claims are reviewable in the first instance by the Federal Circuit pursuant to the jurisdictional grants in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(b)(1) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 799. The Court also interpreted 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8347 to preclude Federal Circuit review of the factual underpinnings of MSPB disability determinations under \u00a7 8347(c), allowing review to determine whether \u201cthere has been a substantial departure from important procedural rights, a misconstruction of the governing legislation, or some like error \u2018going to the heart of the administrative determination.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 791 (quoting <em>Scroggins v. United States, </em>184 Ct.Cl. 530, 397 F.2d 295, 297, <em>cert. denied </em>393 U.S. 952, 89 S.Ct. 376, 21 L.Ed.2d 363 (1968)).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">Mr. Terrano states that the MSPB erred 1) \u201cin determining that [he] failed to prove that [he] could not perform useful and efficient service in [his] position [as required under the Civil Service Retirement System in 5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 831.1202-03] with the USPS, Manager, Customer Services,\u201d 2) \u201cwhen it held that the issue in [his] case was \u2018a situational one,\u2019 \u201d and 3) \u201cin finding that it \u2018has consistently held that stress, anxiety, depression, and discomfort from work are not sufficient to show that an appellant is unable to perform the specific duties of his position.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-10\">Mr. Terrano refers to the multiple letters from his psychiatrist diagnosing him with \u201can adjustment disorder with mixed features,\u201d and states that the evidence established that he \u201ccould not perform useful or efficient service with the USPS.\u201d Mr. Terr\u00e1no asserts that the MSPB erroneously construed the law, citing the administrative judge\u2019s statement that \u201cthe Board has consistently held that stress, anxiety, depression, and discomfort at work are not sufficient to show that an appellant is unable to perform the specific duties of his position.\u201d <em>Terrano, </em>Docket No. AT831E010596-I-1 (Sept. 18, 2001) (Initial Decision at 6). However, the administrative judge also stated that occasional depression and \u201cvarying levels of anxiety [do] not require a finding that he was unable to perform his job duties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Mr. Terrano asserts that these constructions of law and the Board\u2019s general position with respect to stress-related disability are incorrect, and \u201c[go] to the heart of the administrative determination\u201d (quoting <em>Lindahl, </em>470 U.S. at 791).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-11\">OPM responds that Mr. Terrano is simply challenging the correctness of the Board\u2019s factual determination on the question of disability. We agree that Mr. Terrano\u2019s characterization of the Board\u2019s decision is inaccurate. The administrative judge referred to medical evidence and to testimony by both Mr. Terrano and his treating psychiatrist, Dr. Strauss, and made factual findings with respect to the evidence of disability. Our review of the merits of these findings is precluded by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8347 and <em>Lindahl. </em>The AJ\u2019s criterion, viewed in the context of Board decisions wherein the entirety of the record is reviewed to ascertain whether the employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>ee has been able to perform his duties, <em>see Klein v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>71 M.S.P.R. 366, 370-73 (1996), was not incorrect as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">The appeal is therefore <em>dismissed </em>for absence of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b575-12\">. <em>Terrano v.
