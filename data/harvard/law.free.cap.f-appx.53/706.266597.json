An appeal may not be taken from the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue for claims addressed by a district court on the merits absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). As to claims dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>missed by a district court solely on procedural grounds, a certif\u00edcate of appealability \u25a0will not issue unless the petitioner can demonstrate both \u201c(1) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right\u2019 and (2) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 684 (4th Cir.) (quoting <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000)), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 941, 122 S.Ct. 318, 151 L.Ed.2d 237 (2001). We have reviewed the record and conclude for the reasons stated by the district court that Jeffreys has not made the requisite showing. <em>See Jeffreys v. Haynes, </em>No. CA-01-612-5-HO (E.D.N.C. Aug. 21, 2002); <em>see also Davis v. Allsbrooks, </em>778 F.2d 168, 174-76 (4th Cir.1985) (holding that the <em>Waimonght v. Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 87, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977), bar of federal habeas review applies when a state court has found a procedural default regardless of whether the state court alternatively has discussed the merits). Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
