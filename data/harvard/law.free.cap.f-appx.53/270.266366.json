Brooks conspired to sell or use as collateral for a loan two fraudulent letters of guarantee with face values totaling $900,000,000. After calculating the sentencing enhancement based on the amount of intended loss, the district court departed downward one level, finding that the offense level overstated the seriousness of the crime. On appeal, Brooks contends that a downward departure is warranted for precisely the same reasons the district court granted the departure. This court lacks jurisdiction to review the extent of a downward departure in an appellant\u2019s favor unless the departure results in a sentence in violation of law or results from an incorrect application of the sentencing guidelines. <em>See United States v. Hill, </em>70 F.3d 321, 324 (4th Cir.1995); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) (2000). Neither exception applies here. Accordingly, we dismiss Brooks\u2019s appeal. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
