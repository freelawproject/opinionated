R.App. P. 34(a)(2). Accordingly, we deny Romano\u2019s motion for oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b459-22\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b459-23\">Perry Romano, a California state prisoner, appeals pro se the district court\u2019s judgment in favor of defendants in his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action alleging assault by correctional officers. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo summary judgment. <em>Wyatt v. Terhune, </em>305 F.3d 1033, 1042 (9th Cir.2002). We affirm in part, and vacate and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-24\">The district court properly dismissed the action for failure to exhaust because it was clear from the face of Romano\u2019s third amended complaint that he failed to exhaust the available prison administrative remedies. <em>See Wyatt, </em>305 F.3d at 1042.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-25\">The district court did not err by applying <em>Booth v. Churner, </em>532 U.S. 731, 733-34, 121 S.Ct. 1819, 149 L.Ed.2d 958 (2001), to Romano\u2019s case because the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of federal law is applied retroactively to all cases still open on direct review. <em>See </em>Jones Stevedoring Co. v. Director, Office of Workers Compensation Programs, 133 F.3d 683, 687-88 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-26\">Romano contends that defendants failed to properly process his inmate appeals, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>which precluded him from exhausting his administrative remedies. Because \u201cwe will not read futility or other exceptions into statutory exhaustion,\u201d we reject Romano\u2019s due process argument. See Booth, 532 U.S. at 741 n. 6, 121 S.Ct. 1819.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">However, we vacate the judgment to the extent it dismisses the action with prejudice, and remand to the district court to enter a dismissal without prejudice. <em>See Wyatt, </em>305 F.3d at 1045 (\u201cIf the district court concludes that the prisoner has not exhausted nonjudicial remedies, the proper remedy is dismissal of the claim without prejudice.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">AFFIRMED in part, VACATED in part, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b459-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
