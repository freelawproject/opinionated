At sentencing, Cisneros-Gallegos moved for downward departure, arguing that his criminal history score overrepresented his actual criminal history, and that his base offense level should not have been increased by 12 levels for a prior drug conviction. The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> denied the motions and sentenced Cisneros-Gallegos to 46 months imprisonment and 3 years supervised release. On appeal, counsel has moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising as possible issues the denial of the departure motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-20\">We do not review the denial of Cisneros-Gallegos\u2019s downward-departure motions. The district court explicitly acknowledged its authority to depart with regard to one motion, and there is no indication that the court believed it lacked authority to depart with respect to the other. <em>See United States v. Koons, </em>300 F.3d 985, 993-94 (8th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Lopez-Arce, </em>267 F.3d 775, 783-84 (8th Cir.2001). Further, we have reviewed the record under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), and we find no nonfrivolous issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-21\">Accordingly, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-22\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b836-18\">.
