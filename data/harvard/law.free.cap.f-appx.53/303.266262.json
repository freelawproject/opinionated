Waden pled guilty under a conditional plea agreement and was sentenced to 144 months in prison and five years of supervised release. On appeal, Waden argues the district court erred when it denied his motion to suppress evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-19\">We review the district court\u2019s factual findings underlying a motion to suppress for clear error, and the district court\u2019s legal determinations de novo. <em>See Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996); <em>United States v. Rusher, </em>966 F.2d 868, 873 (4th Cir.1992). When a suppression motion has been denied, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government. <em>See United States v. Seidman, </em>156 F.3d 542, 547 (4th Cir.1998). We have reviewed the district court\u2019s denial of Waden\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence seized from the search of his residence and find no error. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-20\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
