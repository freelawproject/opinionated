Cir. R. 27(f) and to dismiss Michael R. Salina\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Salina has not responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-24\">Salina filed a notice of appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. Finding no Board decision on the record, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims directed Salina to show cause why his appeal should not be dismissed for failure to appeal from a final Board decision. In response, Salina discussed the merits of his claims before the regional office. Because there was no final Board decision to review, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims dismissed Salina\u2019s appeal pursuant to 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7266(a). Salina appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-25\">Under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292, this court has limited jurisdiction over appeals from decisions of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. <em>See Forshey v. Principi, </em>284 F.3d 1335, 1338 (Fed.Cir.2002) (en banc). Salina\u2019s appeal does not satisfy any of the grounds for invoking this court\u2019s jurisdiction. In his informal brief, Salina neither states that the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims\u2019 decision involved the validity or interpretation of a statute or regulation, nor that the decision decided constitutional issues. Rather, Salina challenges the merits of a regional office decision and asks this court \u201cto give me what I deserve!,] a pension or disability and retroactive pay since 1973.\u201d Because Salina fails to make any claims concerning constitutional issues or the validity or interpretation of any statutes or regulations implicated by the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims\u2019 decision, Salma\u2019s appeal is not within this court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">(1) The Secretary\u2019s motion to waive the requirements of Fed.
