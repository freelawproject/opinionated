The panel has concluded that additional oral argument is unnecessary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b822-7\">Order</p>\n<p id=\"b822-8\">Robert Krilich has been sentenced three times following his criminal convictions for bank fraud and operating an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering. The convictions have been affirmed, but the first two sentences were vacated, see 159 F.3d 1020 (1998), and 257 F.3d 689 (2001); the third is affirmed by an order issued today. Krilich sought collateral review of the first sentence. That petition was denied by the district court, and we declined to issue a certificate of appealability. Now we have Krilich\u2019s collateral attack on his second sentence. What significance this could have is unclear, given that the second sentence was vacated more than a year ago. But the district court denied this petition on the merits, and Krilich seeks a certificate of appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-9\">The district court should not have entertained Krilich\u2019s request. It is his second collateral attack and therefore required this court\u2019s approval under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 \u00b6 8. Krilich did not seek permission to file, and the argument he presents-that the court violated the Constitution\u2019s Ex Post Facto Clause by considering, when imposing sentence, the loss inflicted by his offenses-does not meet the statutory criteria for a second or successive collateral attack. Krilich\u2019s lawyers may believe that \u00a7 2255 \u00b6 8 does not apply because he has been sentenced more than once. But we held in <em>Dahler v. United, States, </em>259 F.3d 763 (7th Cir.2001), that resentencing resets the counter for purposes of \u00a7 2255 \u00b6 8 only if the collateral attack concerns an issue that first arises at the resentencing. Krilich\u2019s argument, by contrast, has been in the case all along. His application for a certificate of appealability opens by saying that \u201c[t]his is the eighth time the petitioner has attempted to have his ex post facto constitutional claim addressed by a federal court.\u201d It was raised on Krilich\u2019s initial appeal to this court, and it <em>was </em>resolved then. We did not discuss it, but we considered all arguments presented, and a court of appeals is not obliged to discuss weak contentions. So this collateral attack is Krilich\u2019s second, which does not have (and could not receive) approval under \u00a7 2255 118.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-12\">The judgment of the district court is vacated, and the matter is remanded with instructions to dismiss for want of jurisdiction. See <em>Nunez v. United States, </em>96 F.3d 990 (7th Cir.1996).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
