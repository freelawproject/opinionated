It is</p>\n<p id=\"b156-19\">ORDERED that the petition for review be denied. The Commission reasonably determined, based on substantial evidence in the record, to affirm the citation issued by the Secretary of Labor to CBI for willful violation of 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.550(b)(2). 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 660(a); <em>S.G. Loewendick &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Reich, </em>70 F.3d 1291, 1294 (D.C.Cir.1995). CBI failed to establish the affirmative defense of unpreventable employee misconduct, <em>see Nat\u2019l Realty &amp; Constr. Co. v. OSHRC, </em>489 F.2d 1257, 1267 n. 38 (D.C.Cir.1973); <em>P. Gioioso &amp; Sons, Inc. v. OSHRC, </em>115 F.3d 100, 109 (1st Cir.1997), and substantial evidence supports the Commission\u2019s affirmance of the administrative law judge\u2019s conclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>that the violation was willful. <em>See Conie Constr., Inc. v. Reich, </em>73 F.3d 382, 384 (D.C.Cir.1995). Accordingly, we deny CBI\u2019s petition for review of the Commission\u2019s decision and order.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
