R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">This case is before the court on Tommie L. Johnson\u2019s <em>pro se </em>request for a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d). Until Johnson obtains a COA, he cannot appeal the district court\u2019s denial of the motion to vacate, set aside, or correct sentence he brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(b) (providing that a petitioner may not appeal the denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion unless he first obtains a COA).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">In 1999, Johnson was convicted of one count of possession with intent to distribute cocaine base. His conviction was affirmed by this court. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>No. 99-3225, 2000 WL 505250 (10th Cir. April 27, 2000) (unpublished disposition). Thereafter, Johnson filed the instant \u00a7 2255 motion with the United States District Court for the District of Kansas. In the motion, Johnson alleged that his conviction and sentence are contrary to <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). He also asserted that his counsel was ineffective for failing to raise the <em>Apprendi </em>issue. The district court denied Johnson\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion, concluding that <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review and that Johnson\u2019s ineffective assistance claim lacked merit because Johnson failed to make a credible showing that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-14\">Johnson did not raise an <em>Apprendi</em>type claim in his direct appeal and this court has held that <em>Apprendi </em>is not retroactively applicable to initial habeas petitions. <em>See United States v. Mora, </em>293 F.3d 1213, 1218 (10th Cir.2002). Consequently, Johnson\u2019s <em>Apprendi </em>claims are foreclosed by circuit precedent. Likewise, Johnson\u2019s argument that the failure to allege a drug quantity in the indictment deprived the trial court of jurisdiction is foreclosed by Supreme Court precedent. <em>See United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 1785, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-15\">Johnson also asserts that his counsel was ineffective for failing to raise the <em>Apprendi </em>issue either during his trial or on direct appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> To prevail on this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>issue, Johnson must demonstrate that his counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s deficient performance. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-92, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). At the time of Johnson\u2019s trial and his direct appeal, this court\u2019s jurisprudence was directly contrary to the holding in <em>Apprendi. See, e.g., United States v. Reyes, </em>40 F.3d 1148, 1151 (10th Cir.1994). <em>Apprendi </em>was decided after Johnson\u2019s conviction was affirmed on direct appeal. This court has previously held that counsel\u2019s failure to predict future developments in the law does not constitute constitutionally deficient performance. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez-Lerma, </em>71 F.3d 1537, 1541-42 (10th Cir.1995) (\u201cClairvoyance is not a required attribute of effective representation.\u201d). Accordingly, Johnson\u2019s ineffective assistance claims fail because he has not demonstrated that his counsel\u2019s performance was constitutionally deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Johnson is not entitled to a COA unless he can make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). Johnson can make that showing by demonstrating that: (1) the issues raised are debatable among jurists, (2) a court could resolve the issues differently, or (3) that the questions presented deserve further proceedings. <em>See Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 483-84, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). Based on our review of Johnson\u2019s request for a COA, his appellate brief, the district court\u2019s order, and the entire record before us, we conclude that the district court\u2019s disposition of Johnson\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion is not deserving of further proceedings, debatable among jurists of reason, or subject to different resolution on appeal. Accordingly, Johnson has failed to make the required substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right and is not entitled to a COA. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(b). This court denies Johnson\u2019s request for a COA and dismisses this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b78-11\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b78-12\">. Johnson's additional argument that his counsel\u2019s failure to file a petition for a writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court constitutes ineffective assistance was not presented to the district court. Consequently, we decline to address it. <em>See McDonald v. Kinder-Morgan, Inc., </em>287 F.3d 992, 999 (10th Cir.2002) (\"[Ajbsent extraordinary circumstances, [this court] will not consider arguments raised for the first time on appeal. This is true whether an appellant is attempting to raise a bald<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>faced new issue or a new theory that falls under the same general category as a previous argument.\" (quotations and citation omitted)). We note, additionally, that Johnson has provided no support for this argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
