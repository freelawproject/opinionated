(\u201cHalifax\u201d) brought legal claims of (1) breach of contract and (2) negligent misrepresentation, and equitable claims of (3) promissory estoppel and (4) equitable estoppel, against defendant MRV Communications, Inc. (\u201cMRV\u201d) for refusing to honor certain \u201cwarrants,\u201d or stock options, issued to Halifax under circumstances described more fully in the Opinion and Order below. <em>See Halifax Fund, L.P. v. MRV Communications, Inc., </em>00 Civ. 4878(HB), 2001 WL 1622261 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 18, 2001). Halifax tried its legal claims to a jury and its equitable claims to the Court. The jury rejected Halifax\u2019s breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation claims, and the Court, in accordance with the recommendations of an advisory jury verdict, rejected Halifax\u2019s promissory estoppel claim, but found in Halifax\u2019s favor on the equitable estoppel claim, awarding damages of $1,799,417. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b633-13\">Halifax appeals (1) the District Court\u2019s jury instructions regarding the breach of contract claim, (2) the District Court\u2019s rejection of the promissory estoppel claim, and (3) the District Court\u2019s under-estimation of damages with respect to the equitable estoppel claim. MRV appeals (1) the District Court\u2019s judgment for Halifax on the equitable estoppel claim and (2) the District Court\u2019s over-estimation of damages on that claim. We affirm the judgment of the District Court in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-14\">I. Breach of Contract</p>\n<p id=\"b633-15\">We turn first to Halifax\u2019s claim that the District Court gave an erroneous jury instruction to the jury regarding its breach of contract claim. This assertion is entirely without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-16\">Halifax states that it had requested that the Court give the following jury instruction as part of the breach of contract claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-17\">Although other ways of indicating assent are possible, such as orally agreeing to terms or otherwise acting in a manner indicating assent, <em>perhaps the most obvious way of indicating assent is by signing an agreement that has been reduced to writing.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-18\">Tr. 456 (emphasis indicating part of the instruction not given). Instead of that in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>struction, the Court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-4\">Mutual assent is often referred to \u201cas a meeting of the minds\u201d of the parties on all essential terms of the contract, although other ways of indicating assent are possible, such as orally agreeing to terms or otherwise acting in a manner indicating assent. Thus, Halifax must prove that MRV agreed that the expiration date of the warrants would be extended until June 6, 2000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Tr. 577-78. Halifax argues that the actual instructions given \u201cprevented the jury\u2019s consideration of the most obvious manner by which MRV could manifest its assent to be bound by the terms of the Share Warrants, i.e. by signing them.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Br. at 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">We find no error. Halifax suggests that because there was no instruction telling the jury that the \u201cmost obvious way of indicating assent\u201d is by signing a written agreement, the jury did not know that it could rely on a written agreement to find a binding contract. However, by stating that <em>\u201cother </em>ways of indicating assent are possible\u201d in interpreting a contract, the District Court strongly implied the primary way of indicating assent was through the written contract itself. Furthermore, the fact that a written contract is the most obvious way of evidencing assent is virtually a truism. The District Court\u2019s failure to spell out what amounts to a truism cannot be considered error.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">II. Promissory Estoppel</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">We have reviewed Halifax\u2019s second claim, challenging the District Court\u2019s rejection of its promissory estoppel claim. For substantially the reasons stated by the District Court, we agree that pursuant to New York law, and to the applicable principles of equity thereunder, plaintiffs promissory estoppel claim must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">III. Equitable Estoppel</p>\n<p id=\"b634-10\">MRV\u2019s appeal of the Court\u2019s judgment for Halifax on the equitable estoppel claim is also without merit. MRV challenges the District Court\u2019s finding that the elements of equitable estoppel were established in this case. Were we asked to make such a factual determination in the first instance, we would be faced with a difficult, fact-intensive undertaking. <em>See Halifax, </em>2001 WL 1622261, at *3 (\u201cEquitable estoppel is an equitable remedy, and its application turns upon a close examination of the facts and equities.\u201d). However, on appeal we must only decide whether the District Court\u2019s determination was an abuse of discretion. <em>Sharkey v. Lasmo, </em>214 F.3d 371, 374 (2d Cir.2000) (holding that a reviewing court reviews the District Court\u2019s grant of relief in equity for abuse of discretion). We find no abuse of discretion. The District Court considered all of the relevant evidence, and made factual findings that are reasonable on their face, particularly given the existence of an advisory jury verdict in which the jury reached the same conclusion as the District Court on the equitable estoppel issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-11\">IV. Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b634-12\">Finally, we turn to the District Court\u2019s calculation of damages and conclude that neither defendant\u2019s nor plaintiffs objections to the Court\u2019s calculations are meritorious. Neither party has established that its proposed calculation of damages would be any less speculative that the Court\u2019s award of $1,799,417 in damages to Halifax, and we reject Halifax\u2019s argument that all ambiguity in the determination of the appropriate \u201ccover period,\u201d and the ultimate calculation of damages, should be resolved in its favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-13\">sjs ij: \u00ed\u00a1\u00ed <em>% </em>i\u00a1;</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>We have reviewed all of the parties\u2019 arguments. For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED in all respects.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
