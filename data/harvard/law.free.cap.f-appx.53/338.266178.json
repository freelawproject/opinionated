Brown also moves for release pending appeal. The appeal has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-23\">Brown challenges the Bureau of Prisons\u2019 calculation of his good time credit. Brown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>argues that he should receive a credit of 15% of his 57 month sentence, or 259 days. The Bureau follows the language of the statute and grants 54 days of credit for each year actually served. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(b)(1). Therefore, the Bureau will credit Brown with 233 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The district court held that the Bureau\u2019s interpretation of the statute was reasonable. The court relied upon a published Ninth Circuit case and an unpublished Sixth Circuit case. <em>See Pacheco-Camacho v. Hood, </em>272 F.3d 1266, 1270-71 (9th Cir. 2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 122 S.Ct. 2313, 152 L.Ed.2d 1067 (2002); <em>Williams v. Lamanna, </em>No. 01-3198, 2001 WL 1136069, at *1, 20 Fed.Appx. 360 (6th Cir. Sept.19, 2001) (unpub. dec.).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">We conclude that the district court properly denied Brown\u2019s petition. <em>Pacheco-Camacho </em>and <em>Williams </em>are persuasive authority on this point. Brown refers to various Bureau regulations that utilize the 15% figure. But the language of the statute uses 54 days as the basis for credit, not the 15% figure. The Bureau\u2019s interpretation is reasonable in light of the statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">Accordingly, the motion for release pending appeal is denied, and the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed under Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
