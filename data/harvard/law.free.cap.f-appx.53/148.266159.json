Chudnovsky appeals from a final judgment of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Johnson, <em>J.) </em>dismissing his complaint as a matter of law and denying his request for additional discovery. In pertinent part, Chudnovsky alleged that his employer, Levit\u00f3n Manufacturing Company, and his supervisor, Al Pilapil, violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act by discriminating against him based on his national origin, and by retaliating against him after he filed a complaint with the New York State Department of Human Rights. Chudnovsky also challenges costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">1. We review the grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, see Young v. County of Fulton, </em>160 F.3d 899, 902 (2d Cir.1998), construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor, <em>see Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). Summary judgment is appropriate where \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). For the reasons stated ably in the magistrate judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation and the district court\u2019s Memorandum and Order, Mr. Chudnovsky failed to establish any genuine issues of material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">2. The court did not abuse its discretion in denying further discovery. <em>See Grady v. Affiliated Central, Inc., </em>130 F.3d 553, 561 (2d Cir.1997). Mr. Chudnovsky had ample opportunity to conduct discovery, and the defendants complied fully with the court\u2019s discovery rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-11\">3. The district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to review the clerk\u2019s allowance of costs. <em>See Whitfield v. Scully, </em>241 F.3d 264, 269 (2d Cir.2001). The Local Rules of the United States District Courts for the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York provide that \u201c[cjosts for depositions are ... taxable if they were used by the court in ruling on a motion for summary judgment.\u201d Local Civil Rule 54.1(c)(2). The defendants sought taxation of costs for deposition transcripts submitted to, and referenced by, the court on summary judgment. While \u201c[cjosts will not be taxed during the pendency of any appeal,\u201d Local Civil Rule 54.1(a), the defendants requested costs and the clerk granted them before Mr. Chudnovsky filed his notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-12\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
