This action was brought by appellant Nancy Mancuso on behalf of her son, Matthew Mancuso, under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1383(c)(3), seeking review of the Commissioner\u2019s denial of her claim for child\u2019s supplemental security income (SSI) under Title XVI of the Social Security Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-27\">Ms. Mancuso claims that her son has been afflicted with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (\u201cADHD\u201d) since April 1, 1995, and we agree that he surely has had his share of problems over the years. Her initial application for benefits was denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>both initially and upon reconsideration, and an administrative hearing was held. On March 30, 2000, the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) issued a determination that although Matthew suffered from ADHD and a bipolar disorder, his impairments were not of such severity that he was disabled and, thus, entitled to benefits. The Appeals Council found that there was no basis to review the ALJ\u2019s decision. Ms. Mancuso filed this action in the United States District Court with the parties thereafter filing cross-motions for summary judgment. The District Court granted the Commissioner\u2019s motion and denied Ms. Mancuso\u2019s motion. Ms. Mancuso timely appealed. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">Congress enacted the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (the \u201cAct\u201d) on August 22, 1996. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382(a)(3)(C). The Act amended the statutory standard such that children seeking SSI benefits due to a disability must demonstrate a medically determinable impairment \u201cwhich results in marked and severe functional limitations,\u201d and which meets the statutory duration requirement of 12 months. <em>Id. </em>The Social Security Administration published interim final rules to implement the childhood disability provisions of the 1996 Act on February 11,1997. <em>See </em>62 Fed. Reg. 6408; 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 416.902, .906, .924(a) (2000). These rules articulated a new three-step sequential evaluation process pursuant to which a qualifying claimant must demonstrate: (1) that he or she is not working; (2) that he or she has a \u201csevere\u201d impairment or combination of impairments; and (3) that his or her impairment or eombination of impairments is of \u201clisting-level\u201d severity, which essentially means that the impairment meets, medically equals, or functionally equals the severity of an impairment in the Listings of Impairments found in 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1, Regulations No. 4; 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.924 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">Functional equivalence is demonstrated where a child has two \u201cmarked\u201d limitations or one \u201cextreme\u201d limitation in a broad area of functioning, such as eognition/communication; motor; social; personal; and concentration, persistence and pace. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926a.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Applying the interim final rules, the ALJ found that Matthew did not have a medically determinable physical or mental impairment or combination of impairments which resulted in marked or extreme functional limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">The narrow issue before us, albeit presented in various ways, is whether this determination by the ALJ is supported by substantial evidence in the record of this ease. <em>Plummer v. Apfel, </em>186 F.3d 422, 427 (3d Cir.1999) (citing <em>Adorno v. Shalala, </em>40 F.3d 43, 46 (3d Cir.1994)). This is the same standard of review employed by the District Court. <em>Id.; </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). Substantial evidence must be \u201cmore than a mere scintilla\u201d and has been interpreted to mean \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate.\u201d <em>Plummer, </em>186 F.3d at 427 (internal quotations omitted). <em>See also Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-11\">Ms. Mancuso argues that because Matthew has marked limitations in two of the relevant areas of functioning, he has the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>functional equivalent of a listed impairment from Listing \u00a7 112.11. This argument is unavailing, essentially for the reasons set forth in the thorough and thoughtful opinion of the District Court; indeed, there is ample evidence in the record to support the ALJ\u2019s determination that because Matthew had no marked limitation in any designated area of functioning, he was not afflicted with the functional equivalent of a listed impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Matthew\u2019s cognitive capabilities were attested to by his teachers and doctors who, at bottom, concurred that whatever psychological and academic problems Matthew had, his cognitive capabilities were not limited. Furthermore, in the area of motor skills, the ALJ correctly found that while Matthew may have had a mild restriction, this was not sufficient to be deemed \u201cmarked.\u201d Record evidence, consisting of findings and observations by Doctors Sopher and Skloma, bears out this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">The ALJ also correctly found that while Matthew evinced \u201cdifficulties in social functioning ... [considered as a whole, the evidence indicates that the degree of impairment ... is less than marked.\u201d Indeed, Matthew\u2019s interpersonal relationships and interactions were characterized by his teachers and doctors as within the realm of normal and appropriate. The ALJ\u2019s finding that no marked limitation existed in the category of personal functioning was similarly supported. Dr. Sopher and the state agency physicians concurred that Matthew did not have a significant limitation in this area, and, as the District Court noted, Matthew, then sixteen years of age, \u201cdrove himself to the appointment with Dr. Sopher, arrived in a timely manner and presented with a neat physical appearance.\u201d Finally, with reference to the ALJ\u2019s determination that Matthew had no marked limitation in the area of concentration, persistence, and pace, the District Court concluded that while there was some conflicting evidence, \u201c[e]ven assuming ... that plaintiff has a marked degree of limitation in [this] area ..., a finding of disability would not be warranted ... because plaintiff must have a marked limitation of functioning in at least two areas of development before a finding of functional equivalency would be appropriate\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">In sum, based upon the evidence in the record, the ALJ correctly found that Matthew did not have an impairment or combination of impairments which met, medically equaled, or functionally equaled any impairment contained in the Listings. The ALJ\u2019s determination that Matthew is \u201cnot disabled\u201d and is thus not eligible for SSI benefits is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">For the aforementioned reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s order of February 19, 2002.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b258-7\">. On January 2, 2001, final children's regulations took effect which changed the areas to: 1) acquiring and using information; 2) attending and completing tasks; 3) interacting and relating with others; 4) moving about and manipulating objects, 5) caring for the self; and 6) health and physical well-being. <em>See </em>65 Fed.Reg. 54,747. These changes are not applicable here given that the ALJ\u2019s decision was rendered in early 2000.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
