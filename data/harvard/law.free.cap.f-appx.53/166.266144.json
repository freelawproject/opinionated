Sifton, <em>Judge, </em>convicting him of racketeering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1962(c) and 1963(a), and conspiracy to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846, 841(a)(1), and 841(b)(1)(B), and sentencing him principally to 97 months\u2019 imprisonment to be served concurrently with the undischarged portion of a sentence Sclafani was then serving (the \u201cprior sentence\u201d), to be followed by a four-year term of supervised release. On appeal, Sclafani contends principally (1) that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 is unconstitutional on its face under the principle announced in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), because it permits the judge to determine the quantity of narcotics on which the defendant\u2019s sentence will be based, rather than requiring that determination to be made by a jury; and (2) that in imposing sentence, the district court should have given him credit for time he had already served on the prior sentence. Finding no basis for reversal, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-22\">Sclafani\u2019s <em>Apprendi </em>challenge to the constitutionality of \u00a7 841 is foreclosed by this Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Outen, </em>286 F.3d 622 (2d Cir.2002). <em>See id. </em>at 634 (\u2018We join every other circuit to have ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>dressed this argument [that <em>Apprendi </em>renders \u00a7 841 unconstitutional on its face] in rejecting it.\u201d) In any event, no <em>Apprendi </em>violation could be found in the present case, because, <em>inter alia, </em>Sclafani, in his plea allocution, stipulated that the narcotics conspiracy offense to which he pleaded guilty involved an estimated 3.5 to 5 kilograms of cocaine, and the district court used that quantity to determine Sclafani\u2019s Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cGuidelines\u201d) offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Nor are we persuaded by Sclafani\u2019s contention that he is entitled to be resentenced on the ground that the district court applied the wrong section of the Guidelines\u2014 \u00a7 5G1.3(e), rather than \u00a7 5G1.3(b) \u2014 in refusing to give him credit for time already served on his prior sentence. Subsection (b) of \u00a7 5G1.3, to the extent pertinent to the present appeal, provides that the sentence imposed for the instant offense shall be concurrent with the \u201cundischarged\u201d portion of a prison term imposed for a prior offense that was \u201cfully taken into account in the determination of the offense level for the instant offense.\u201d Guidelines \u00a7 5G1.3(b). Further, if the court determines that the Bureau of Prisons will not give the defendant credit for time already served on a prior offense that was fully taken into account in determining the offense level for the instant offense, the court \u201cshould adjust the sentence for any period of imprisonment already served.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Application Note 2. The relevant portion of the policy statement set forth in subsection (c) of \u00a7 5G1.3 provides that, if subsection (b) is inapplicable, the sentence for the instant offense may be concurrent with the \u201cundischarged\u201d portion of the prior prison term, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 5G1.3(c); neither \u00a7 5G1.3(c) nor the Guidelines commentary provides that the court is allowed to give credit for time already served if, in the determination of the defendant\u2019s offense level for the instant offense, the prior offense was not fully taken into account.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">In the present case, the district court found that subsection (b) of \u00a7 5G1.3 was inapplicable because Sclafani\u2019s prior offense did not affect his offense level in the present case and thus was not fully taken into account, and we are not persuaded that this finding was error. However, we need not resolve the matter of which subsection was applicable because the district court, in discussing the sentence to be imposed and the amount of credit to be given, assumed that it had discretion even under subsection (c) to give Sclafani credit for time already served. The court made it plain, however, that, given the seriousness of Sclafani\u2019s present offenses and the fact that they were more serious than his prior offense, it believed that an appropriate sentence would not include credit for time Sclafani had already served. We find that the record sufficiently clearly reveals that the district court refused to exercise the discretion it believed it possessed under (c) to grant such credit and shows, therefore, that the court would have imposed the same sentence under (b) that it imposed under (c). Accordingly, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Sclafani were correct in his contention that he should have been sentenced under (b), the record indicates that his sentence would have been the same under that subsection, and hence there is no basis for reversal. <em>See generally United States v. McHugh, </em>122 F.3d 153, 158 (2d Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Arigbodi, </em>924 F.2d 462, 464 (2d Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">We have considered all of Sclafani\u2019s contentions on this appeal and have found in them no basis for reversal. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
