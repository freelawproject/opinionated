The BIA had jurisdiction pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.1. We have jurisdiction under \u00a7 106(a)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)(l), as amended by the transitional rules for judicial review under the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (Sept. 30, 1996). Because the BIA failed to make an explicit credibility finding, we vacate the decision and remand.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">When the BIA conducts a de novo review of the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the BIA\u2019s decision, rather than the IJ\u2019s, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Salazar-Paucar v. INS, </em>281 F.3d 1069, 1073 (9th Cir.), <em>as amended by </em>290 F.3d 964 (9th Cir.2002). Although the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s denial of relief, it explained its rationale with citations to the testimony and relied only in part on the IJ\u2019s reasoning. After examining the record, the BIA concluded that Petitioner had not established eligibility for asylum and withholding of deportation. We therefore review the decision of the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-13\">In support of his application for asylum, Saleh offered a written application and his own testimony. The BIA raised doubts about Saleh\u2019s credibility, but did not make an explicit finding as to whether it found his testimony to be credible. For example, the BIA \u201cconcurred] with the IJ\u2019s determination that the respondent\u2019s testimony was unclear and that he failed to present a coherent account of the basis of his fear.\u201d The BIA noted the IJ\u2019s observation that Saleh was a \u201creluctant witness, that answers were difficult to elicit, and that some of his testimony was inconsistent.\u201d The BIA also found unpersuasive Saleh\u2019s explanation for failing to bring copies of newspaper articles he purportedly authored to the hearing or to mention them in his asylum application. Despite these comments, however, the BIA never found Saleh\u2019s testimony to lack credibility; instead, it concluded that he had not met his burden of proof and persuasion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-14\">Adverse credibility findings must be explicit. <em>Shoafera v. INS, </em>228 F.3d 1070, 1074 n. 3 (9th Cir.2000) (\u201c[T]he law of this circuit does not permit implicit adverse credibility determinations.\u201d); <em>see also Aguilera-Cota v. INS, </em>914 F.2d 1375, 1383 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>(9th Cir.1990) (\u201c[IJ\u2019s] mere statement that a petitioner is \u2018not entirely credible\u2019 is not enough.\u201d). In <em>Hartooni v. INS, </em>21 F.3d 336, 342 (9th Cir.1994), the BIA raised doubts about the asylum applicant\u2019s truthfulness but failed to provide an adequate finding regarding credibility. We therefore remanded in that case so that the BIA could make an explicit credibility determination. <em>Id. </em>at 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Based on the foregoing, we vacate the decision of the BIA and remand for a specific finding regarding Petitioner\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; decision VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b506-9\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b506-10\">. Because the parties are familiar with the facts and prior proceedings in this case, we will not repeat them here, except to the extent necessary to explain our reasoning.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b506-16\">. Citing <em>Sidhu v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1085 (9th Cir.2000), the BIA stated that \u201c[w]hen an Immigration Judge either does not believe an alien or does not know what to believe, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>alien\u2019s failure to corroborate his testimony can be fatal to his asylum application.\u201d However, <em>Sidhu </em>indicates only that failure to provide easily available corroborating evidence can support a finding that testimony is not credible. It does not address a situation where the factfinder fails to make a credibility finding.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
