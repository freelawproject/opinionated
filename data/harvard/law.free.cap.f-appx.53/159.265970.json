The District Court held that because Conn. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 53a-167a(a), as interpreted by the Connecticut Supreme Court in <em>State v. Williams, </em>205 Conn. 456, 534 A.2d 230 (1987), clearly does not permit a criminal action for lying to a police officer, Officer Torreso did not have arguable probable cause to make the arrest. <em>Darbisi v. Town of Monroe, </em>No. 3:00CV1446 (RNC) (D.Conn. Jan. 14, 2002). In rejecting Torreso\u2019s claim to qualified immunity, the District Court also denied summary judgment on plaintiffs false arrest, malicious prosecution, and unlawful retaliation claims. <em>Id. </em>We affirm the judgment of the District Court with respect to qualified immunity substantially for the reasons stated in its opinion entered on January 14, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-14\">We have reviewed all of the defendant\u2019s arguments. For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
