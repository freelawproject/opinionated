R.App. P. 34(a)(2). Accordingly, Appellant\u2019s request for oral argument is denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b848-6\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">Juan Carlos Valle-Leanos appeals his conviction pursuant to a conditional guilty plea for aiding and abetting possession of methamphetamine with intent to distribute in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(2). Valle-Leanos contests the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to disclose the identities of confidential informants or hold an in camera review. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">The trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to order divulging of the confidential informants\u2019 identities to Valle-Leanos. <em>See United States v. Spires, </em>3 F.3d 1234, 1238 (9th Cir.1993). Valle-Leanos failed to adequately show that disclosure was \u201crelevant and helpful to the defense of an accused, or is essential to a fair determination of a cause.\u201d <em>Roviaro v. United States, </em>353 U.S. 53, 60-61, 77 S.Ct. 623, 628, 1 L.Ed.2d 639 (1957). Valle-Leanos\u2019 mere statement that the informants <em>could </em>provide information that would be helpful to his defense is insufficient. <em>See United States v. Sanchez, </em>908 F.2d 1443, 1451-52 (9th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-9\">Valle-Leanos has also failed to make the \u201cminimal threshold showing that disclosure would be relevant to at least one defense\u201d and is therefore not entitled to an in camera review. <em>See United States v. Henderson, </em>241 F.3d 638, 645 (9th Cir. 2000). Valle-Leanos has failed to sufficiently allege or even present a factual basis for his assertion that the informants could provide any information that is relevant to his two asserted defenses, entrapment and outrageous government conduct. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>231 F.3d 508, 516 (9th Cir.2000). Absent such a showing, he is not entitled to an in camera review. <em>United States v. Jaramillo-Suarez, </em>950 F.2d 1378, 1387 (9th Cir.1991); <em>cf. United States v. Sai Keung Wong, </em>886 F.2d 252, 256-57 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b848-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
