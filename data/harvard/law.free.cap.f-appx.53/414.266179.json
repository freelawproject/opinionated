We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, and we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b448-25\">Rivera-Orozco first contends that under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the existence and nature of a prior felony conviction used to enhance his sentence must be charged in the indictment and proved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>beyond a reasonable doubt. Rivera-Orozco also contends that because of the 1996 Congressional changes to \u00a7 1326, <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) does not apply to his case. These contentions are foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Arellano-Rivera, </em>244 F.3d 1119, 1127 (9th Cir.2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>535 U.S. 976, 122 S.Ct. 1450, 152 L.Ed.2d 392 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Rivera-Orozco next contends that his sentence was erroneously enhanced by \u00a7 1326(b)(2), because he admitted only that he was previously deported, not removed. Contrary to Rivera-Orozco\u2019s assertion, this contention is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Lopez-Gonzalez, </em>183 F.3d 933, 934-35 (9th Cir.1999) (concluding that there is no legally significant difference between deportation and removal for purposes of \u00a7 1326). Moreover, Rivera-Orozco\u2019s argument is belied by the record. Our review clearly shows that during the plea colloquy, Rivera-Orozco admitted that he was previously \u201cdeported or removed to Mexico.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b448-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b448-27\">. Although Rivera-Orozco has been deported to Mexico, this appeal is not moot because his sentence has not expired. <em>See United States v. Valdez-Gonzalez, </em>957 F.2d 643, 646-47 (9th Cir. 1992), <em>abrogated on other grounds by </em>U.S.S.G. Amendment 345.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
