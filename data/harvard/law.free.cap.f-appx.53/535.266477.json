McKAY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b569-21\">After examining the brief and the appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-22\">This is a pro se 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 military-prisoner appeal. Mr. Rogers was convicted by a general court-martial of rape, robbery, housebreaking, attempted rape, AWOL, assault, and burglary. He was sentenced to forty years\u2019 confinement and a dishonorable discharge. He was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>released on parole, but parole was revoked due to his violation of parole conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">In his \u00a7 2241 petition, Mr. Rogers challenges the Army Clemency and Parole Board\u2019s revocation of his parole and the denial of street-time credit. The district court denied the petition holding that the Board adhered to its regulations and applicable due process principles. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">After a thorough review of the brief and the record, and for substantially the same reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s well-reasoned May 16, 2002, Order, we hold that no relief is available to Mr. Rogers.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b569-7\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
