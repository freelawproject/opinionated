He appeals from the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the defendants on his claims of racial discrimination and retaliation made pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e et. seq. Taylor alleges discrimination on the basis of race and gender when Proctor <em>&amp; </em>Gamble placed him on a leave of absence and subsequently terminated his employment following his arrest for rape, attempted rape, reckless endangerment, unlawful imprisonment, assault, and unlawful sexual contact. Mr. Taylor\u2019s retaliation claim stems from the defendant\u2019s alleged reaction to Taylor filing a discrimination charge with the Delaware Department of Labor and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Our review of the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is plenary. <em>Huang v. BP Amoco Corp., </em>271 F.3d 560, 564 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">Inasmuch as the district court (Farnan, J.) has already set forth the factual and procedural history of this case, we find it unnecessary to repeat that history here. <em>See Taylor v. Procter &amp; Gamble, </em>184 F.Supp.2d 402 (D.Del.2002). Moreover, the district court, in its Memorandum Opinion and Order, has carefully and completely explained its reasons for denying Taylor the relief he seeks and granting summary judgment to the defendants. Given the district court\u2019s thoughtful analysis, no purpose will be served by this court undertaking a redundant discussion simply to reach the same result</p>\n<p id=\"b684-9\">Accordingly, we will affirm the decision of the district court substantially for the reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s Memorandum Opinion without further elaboration.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
