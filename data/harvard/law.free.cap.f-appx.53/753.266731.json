O\u2019Malley, United States District Judge for the Northern District of Ohio, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b787-23\">\n<em>ORDER</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b787-24\">Andrew McCoy, a federal prisoner, appeals the sentence of imprisonment imposed upon the revocation of his supervised release. The parties have expressly waived oral argument. Upon examination, this panel unanimouslly agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-25\">On April 30, 1996, McCoy was convicted of armed bank robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) &amp; (d) (a Class B felony), and sentenced to fifty-seven months of imprisonment and five years of supervised release. On December 30, 1999, McCoy completed his term of imprisonment and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>was placed on supervised release. On February 1, 2002, the United States Probation Department petitioned the district court to revoke McCoy\u2019s supervised release. On April 13, 2001, the district court modified the terms of McCoy\u2019s supervised release by ordering him to serve six months at a halfway house for drug treatment. Thereafter, the Probation Department filed a second petition, and a supplemental violation report, alleging a number of Grade C violations and seeking to have McCoy\u2019s supervised release revoked. The district court conducted a hearing, and McCoy admitted the Grade C violations. Although the policy statements from Chapter 7 of the Sentencing Guidelines recommended a range of six to twelve months, <em>see </em>USSG \u00a7 7B1.4, the district court sentenced McCoy to twenty-four months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">On appeal, McCoy does not challenge the district court\u2019s decision to revoke his supervised release; rather, he contends that the district court abused its discretion in sentencing him by failing to consider all the sentencing factors outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s sentence upon revocation of supervised release for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Washington, </em>147 F.3d 490, 491 (6th Cir.1998). This court will affirm a district court\u2019s sentence of imprisonment upon revocation of supervised release if it shows consideration of the relevant statutory factors and is not plainly unreasonable. <em>United States v. McClellan, </em>164 F.3d 308, 309 (6th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">Although the policy statements from Chapter 7 of the Sentencing Guidelines recommend a range of six to twelve months, <em>see </em>USSG \u00a7 7B1.4, the policy statements are merely advisory and do not bind the sentencing court. <em>Washington, </em>147 F.3d at 491. In the absence of mandatory guidelines, the district court\u2019s sentence must show consideration of any relevant statutory factors and may not be plainly unreasonable. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3583(e), 3553, <em>&amp; </em>3742(a)(4); <em>Washington, </em>147 F.3d at 491; <em>United States v. Webb, </em>30 F.3d 687, 689 (6th Cir.1994). The relevant factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 include: 1) the need to deter criminal conduct, to protect the public, and to provide the defendant with appropriate treatment; 2) the nature of the offense; 3) any guideline range for sentencing; 4) guideline policy statements; and 5) avoidance of unwarranted disparities. The sentencing court need not recite any \u201cmagic words\u201d explaining whether and how it considered the policy statements contained in the Sentencing Guidelines, or how it weighed the factors set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553. <em>McClellan, </em>164 F.3d at 310. All that is required is a general statement of the district court\u2019s reasons sufficient to permit an informed appellate review. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">Upon review, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion. The district court stated its reasons for imposing a twenty-four month term of imprisonment. Specifically, the court noted: 1) McCoy\u2019s drug addiction and inability\u2014 or unwillingness \u2014 to complete drug treatment programs; 2) McCoy\u2019s recidivism; 3) the need to protect the public from the kind of violence and harm that had arisen as a result of McCoy\u2019s behavior; and 4) the need to facilitate McCoy\u2019s participation in a prison-run drug rehabilitation program. Thus, McCoy\u2019s sentence of imprisonment was not plainly unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-9\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is hereby affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
