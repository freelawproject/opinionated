Siragusa, Judge) after a trial jury convicted Kelvin Jelks of being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), possessing a firearm that had been illegally altered, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5871, and possessing a firearm that was not registered to him in the National Firearm Registration and Transfer Record, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-20\">ON CONSIDERATION WHEREOF, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the judgment of the District Court be and it hereby is REMANDED.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-21\">On May 7, 1998, Kelvin Jelks (\u201cDefendant-Appellant\u201d) was convicted in the County Court of Monroe County, New York of felony possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree. Defendants Appellant was paroled August 7, 2000 and went to live with his daughter, Le\u2019Tasha Jelks.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>On October 4, 2000, Defendant-Appellant\u2019s parole officer, Cynthia Mooney, and two of her colleagues visited Le\u2019Tasha Jelks\u2019 apartment for the purpose of conducting a \u201croutine home visit.\u201d It is undisputed that, at the time of the visit, Mooney had no reason to believe that Defendant-Appellant had -violated the terms of his parole. Le\u2019Tasha Jelks answered the door and informed Mooney that her father was not home. Mooney advised Ms. Jelks that she and her colleagues had the right to search her father\u2019s \u201cresidence, property and person any time [they] felt that there was a need to do so.\u201d Mooney then asked whether the trio could search Defendant-Appellant\u2019s bedroom. Le\u2019Tasha Jelks verbally consented to the warrantless search. Upon searching Defendant-Appellant\u2019s bedroom, one of the parole officers observed a shotgun and two shells sitting on a shelf in an open closet. Le\u2019Tasha Jelks subsequently signed a form granting the parole officers permission to search Defendanh-Appellant\u2019s bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">The government charged Defendant-Appellant with being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), possessing a firearm that had been illegally altered, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5871, and possessing a firearm that was not registered to him in the National Firearm Registration and Transfer Record, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(d). Defendant-Appellant moved to suppress the shotgun and shells, arguing that the warrantless search was unlawful. The government opposed Defendant-Appellant\u2019s motion, arguing that the warrantless search was lawful because it was a parole search. In the alternative, the government argued that Le\u2019Tasha Jelks consented to the warrantless search of her father\u2019s bedroom. The district court held that the search was not a lawful parole search because Mooney did not have reasonable suspicion to believe that Defendant-Appellant was in violation of the terms of his parole. However, the court denied Defendant-Appellant\u2019s motion on the basis that Le\u2019Tasha Jelks voluntarily consented to the warrant-less search. The district court concluded that Mooney\u2019s explanation of her authority to search Defendant-Appellant\u2019s residence was not \u201cmisleading or coercive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">The jury convicted Defendant-Appellant on all counts. The district court sentenced him to terms of 120 months imprisonment on Counts One and Three, to run concurrently, and a term of 30 months imprisonment on Count Two, to run consecutively to the other terms. The district court also ordered that Defendant-Appellant\u2019s 150 month term of imprisonment run consecutively to his undischarged state term of imprisonment. Defendant-Appellant now appeals the district court\u2019s judgment, arguing that: 1) Le\u2019Tasha Jelks did not voluntarily consent to the search, because she consented only after Mooney misrepresented her authority to search DefendantAppellant\u2019s bedroom; 2) the district court failed to consider the relevant factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584 and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3 when it ordered Defendant-Appellant\u2019s federal sentence to run consecutively to his undischarged state term of imprisonment; and 3) the government presented insufficient evidence to establish that Defendant-Appellant knowingly possessed the firearm and ammunition.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">The district court held that \u201cthe consent to search given by Ms. Jelks was voluntarily given and not the product of duress or coercion.\u201d However, the factual basis for the district court\u2019s finding is unclear from the record, as the court did not discuss the totality of the circumstances warranting such a finding. Moreover, at the time of the district court\u2019s ruling, it did not have the benefit of the New York State Division of Parole, Policy and Procedures Manual, which governs parole officers\u2019 visits to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>homes of parolees. The manual is now part of the record, pursuant to this Court\u2019s remand order of July 30, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Accordingly, we remand this case to the district court for additional fact-finding and reconsideration of whether Le\u2019Tasha Jelks\u2019 consent was voluntary. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Mathurin, </em>148 F.3d 68 (2d Cir.1998) (per curiam) (remanding case to district court for additional fact-finding without vacating defendant-appellant\u2019s conviction). The district court should consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding Ms. Jelks\u2019 consent, taking into account whether Mooney\u2019s representation of her authority to search Defendant-Appellant\u2019s residence was incorrect or misleading and, if so, whether Ms. Jelks\u2019 consent was nonetheless voluntary. We express no view on this issue. We note that while Mooney told Ms. Jelks that parole officers could search a parolee\u2019s residence \u201cany time [they] felt that there was a need to do so,\u201d the parole manual requires that officers have \u201can articulable reason for conducting the search that is reasonably related to the circumstances of the particular case and rationally related to the officer\u2019s duty to supervise the releasee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">The district court should also consider the factors delineated in <em>Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 226, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973). In particular, the district court should consider Le\u2019Tasha Jelks\u2019 subjective understanding of the circumstances and of her ability to withhold consent, based upon considerations such as her age and education, as well as the fact that she had given birth four days prior to the search. Moreover, the district court should consider the objective circumstances surrounding the encounter, <em>viz., </em>the fact that three parole officers confronted Ms. Jelks in her home at night, and the parole officers\u2019 actions in obtaining Ms. Jelks\u2019 consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">Finally, the district court should consider the significance <em>vel non </em>of the parole manual. We note that whether the search could be justified as a parole search, as well as the district court\u2019s finding that Mooney had no reasonable suspicion to believe that Defendant-Appellant was in violation of the terms of his parole, are not on appeal. However, we do not foreclose the district court from reconsidering any issues it deems relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">We draw no conclusions concerning the nature of the search or the voluntariness of Le\u2019Tasha Jelks\u2019 consent. Simply, we order the district court to consider Ms. Jelks\u2019 consent in light of the totality of the circumstances and explain the basis for its ruling. However, the district court will likely need to reopen the suppression hearing and take additional testimony in order to comply with this Court\u2019s instructions. Should the district court again conclude that Ms. Jelks\u2019 consent was voluntary, the present appeal will be reinstated, without the need for a new notice of appeal, upon notice by either party to this Court by letter that the district court has so ruled. The record on appeal shall be supplemented with the record of the proceedings and rulings on remand and shall be referred to this panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">The matter is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with the foregoing. The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
