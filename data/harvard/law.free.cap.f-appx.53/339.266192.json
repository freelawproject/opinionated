This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-24\">The Commissioner of Internal Revenue issued a notice of deficiency for tax year 1993 in the amount of $8,922 and a penalty, under I.R.C. \u00a7 6662, in the amount of $1,784, after the Commissioner: 1) disallowed all of the deductions claimed on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>Schedule C because Triplett failed to establish \u201cthat any amount was paid for the designated purpose or that the expenditure, if paid, constitutes an ordinary and necessary business expense,\u201d <em>see </em>I.R.C. \u00a7 162(a); 2) disallowed the \u201ccarry forward loss\u201d credit because \u201cthere is no provision in the Internal Revenue Code for such a credit\u201d and because Triplett \u201cdid not sustain a net operating loss ... in any taxable year prior to 1993,\u201d <em>see </em>I.R.C. \u00a7 172(b); and 3) determined that the entire understatement of tax required to be shown on Triplett\u2019s 1993 return was due to negligence, <em>see </em>I.R.C. \u00a7 6662. Triplett filed a timely petition for a redetermination of those deficiencies in the tax court, and the government filed its answer. The parties entered into a stipulation of facts, and the case was assigned to a Special Trial Judge who conducted a trial. Subsequently, the Special Trial Judge entered findings of fact and an opinion which generally affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s determination of a deficiency. The tax court agreed with the Special Trial Judge\u2019s resolution of the matter and entered its decision upholding the Commissioner\u2019s determination. The court summarily denied Triplett\u2019s motion for reconsideration. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">The Commissioner\u2019s determination of a tax deficiency is presumptively correct, and the taxpayer has the burden of proving that the determination is erroneous or arbitrary. <em>See Welch v. Helvering, </em>290 U.S. 111, 115, 54 S.Ct. 8, 78 L.Ed. 212 (1933); <em>Kearns v. Comm\u2019r, </em>979 F.2d 1176, 1178 (6th Cir.1992). This court will not disturb the tax court\u2019s findings of fact unless clearly erroneous. <em>See Estate of Quirk v. Comm\u2019r, </em>928 F.2d 751, 759 (6th Cir.1991). The tax court\u2019s application of the law is reviewed de novo. <em>See Kearns, </em>979 F.2d at 1178.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">Upon consideration of the briefs and record in this appeal, we are of the opinion that the findings of fact of the tax court are supported by substantial evidence and are not clearly erroneous and that its conclusions of law are correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">Accordingly, the decision of the tax court is affirmed.
