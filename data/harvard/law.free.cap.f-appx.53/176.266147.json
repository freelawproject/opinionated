DeFrancisco, New York State Department of Audit &amp; Control, New York State Department of Civil Service, New York State Civil Service Commission, Commission President George C. Sinnott, Civil Service Employee Association, CSEA Local No. 661, and Karen Aveyard, alleging that they had racially discriminated against her by failing to promote her in violation of, <em>inter alia, </em>Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.2000e-2(a)(l), and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The relevant facts are set forth in the district court\u2019s opinion. <em>Rivas v. New York State Lottery, </em>No. 00-CV-0746, slip op. at 2-3 (N.D.N.Y. March 26, 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-17\">The district court (Frederick J. Scullin, Jr., Judge) granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and dismissed Rivas\u2019s complaint, finding that Rivas failed to state a prima facie case under Title VII and that the \u00a7 1983 cause of action failed against each of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-18\">On appeal, the plaintiff argues that she presented evidence of a Title VII violation sufficient to survive a motion for summary judgment. We conclude that Rivas failed to allege circumstances that could give rise to an inference of discrimination, and that she therefore failed to state a prima facie case under Title VII. <em>Howley v. Town of Stratford, </em>217 F.3d 141, 150 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>The plaintiff also reasserts her \u00a7 1983 cause of action, but offers us no basis for concluding that the district court erred in finding that the cause of action failed with respect to each of the defendants. The \u00a7 1983 cause of action failed against each of the defendants for the following reasons: The New York State Department of Civil Service, the New York State Civil Service Commission, the New York State Department of Audit &amp; Control, and the New York State Lottery were all protected under the doctrine of sovereign immunity. <em>Komlosi v. New York State Office of Mental Retardation &amp; Dev. Disabilities, </em>64 F.3d 810, 815 (2d Cir.1995). The CM Service Employee Association is not a \u201cperson\u201d as is required for suits brought pursuant to \u00a7 1983. <em>Fitzpatrick v. Wert, </em>432 F.Supp. 601, 602 (W.D.N.Y.1977) (citing <em>Monell v. Dept. of Social Servs., </em>532 F.2d 259, 262-63 (2d Cir.1976)). And Rivas never alleged that the individually named defendants were personally involved in any of the allegedly prohibited conduct, as is required to state a claim pursuant to \u00a7 1983. <em>Green v. Bauvi, </em>46 F.3d 189, 194 (2d Cir.1995). We therefore conclude that the district court\u2019s dismissal of the \u00a7 1983 cause of action was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
