On appeal, counsel has moved to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and has filed a brief arguing that the sentence exceeds what is reasonable for a first-time offender with a minor role in the offense, and that a condition of supervised release requiring Bustos-Hernandez to report to the United States Probation Office if he reenters the United States after being deported violates his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-18\">Bustos-Hernandez is foreclosed from challenging the length of his sentence, as he was sentenced within the Guidelines range to which he stipulated in his plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Nguyen, </em>46 F.3d 781, 783 (8th Cir.1995) (defendant who explicitly and voluntarily exposes himself to specific sentence may not challenge that punishment on appeal). We further find that the district court\u2019s imposition of the supervised-release condition, which Bustos-Hernandez did not challenge below, was not plain error. <em>See United States v. Sun Bear, </em>307 F.3d 747, 750 (8th Cir.2002) (argument not raised below is reviewed for plain error); <em>United States v. Montanye, </em>996 F.2d 190, 192 (8th Cir.1993) (to be \u201cplain,\u201d error must be \u201cclear under current law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-19\">Following our independent review, <em>see Penson v. Ohio, 488 </em>U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed. We also grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b429-21\">. The Honorable David S. Doty, United States District Judge for the District of Minnesota.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
