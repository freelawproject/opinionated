United States, </em>229 Ct.Cl. 67, 662 F.2d 747, 750 (1981). A review of the proceedings before the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania shows that Deluxe Delivery Service (\u201cDeluxe\u201d) initiated this action against the United States for violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\u201cRICO\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961, et seq. While Deluxe directed its appeal to this court, it appears that the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit is the appropriate appellate court, because this court\u2019s limited jurisdiction does not encompass RICO actions. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-15\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631, this \u201ccourt shall, if it is in the interest of justice, transfer such action or appeal to any other such court in which the action or appeal could have been brought....\u201d However, we do not find that a transfer in this case would be \u201cin the interest of justice.\u201d As the district court correctly held, the United States and its agencies enjoy sovereign immunity from RICO claims. <em>See e.g., McNeily v. United States, </em>6 F.3d 343, 350 (5th Cir.1993). Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
