Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). The subject of the dispute is a mobile magnetic resonance imaging (\u201cMRI\u201d) system, which was damaged due to cold weather after the defendant delivered it to the port of shipment in Antwerp. Applying German law under the contract\u2019s choice-of-law provision, the district court concluded that the contract\u2019s risk-of-loss provision precluded recovery by the plaintiffs. <em>St. Paul Guardian Ins. Co. v. Neuromed Med. Sys. &amp; Support, GmbH, </em>No. 00 Civ. 9344, 2002 WL 465312, at *3-*6, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5096, at *6-*17 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2002). The court also concluded that the contract\u2019s \u201cCIF\u201d term relieved the defendant of responsibility for damage that occurred after the MRI system passed the ship\u2019s rail at the port of shipment, <em>see id. </em>at *1, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5096, at *3, at which point the MRI was fully functional, according to the complaint, <em>see </em>Compl. 1132. For substantially the reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s opinion, we affirm the dismissal of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>The defendant cross-appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of its alternative ground for dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6): that the contract at issue required this dispute to be brought in the court of justice in Castrop-Rauxel, Germany. <em>See St. Paul Guardian Ins. Co. v. Neuromed Med. Sys. &amp; Support, GmbH, </em>No. 00 Civ. 9344, 2001 WL 1875768 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 5, 2001). The defendant agreed at oral argument, however, that we need reach its cross-appeal only if we reverse the district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint on the basis of the risk-of-loss provision. Since we agree with the district court on that issue, we need not and do not reach the arguments raised by the defendant in the cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
