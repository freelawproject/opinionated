We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a). We review a district court\u2019s factual determination whether a defendant has accepted responsibility for clear error. <em>United States v. Velasco-Medina, </em>305 F.3d 839, 853 (9th Cir.2002). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-13\">Garcia-Vara contends that the district court erred by denying his request for an offense level reduction for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. Because Garcia-Vara failed to clearly demonstrate acceptance of responsibility, the district court did not clearly err by denying the adjustment. See <em>id.; </em>cf. <em>United States v. Ochoa-Gaytan, </em>265 F.3d 837, 845 (9th Cir.2001) (finding that defendant gave a complete confession because he \u201cconfirmed his prior criminal record and admitted ... that he was in the United States illegally, that he had been deported previously, and that he had used a false name\u201d) (internal quotation and citation omitted). Because the relevant facts were undisputed, the district court was not required to explain its finding that GarciaVara failed to accept responsibility. <em>See United States v. Marquardt, </em>949 F.2d 283, 285 (9th Cir.1991) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-19\">Because there is no basis for vacating Garcia-Vara\u2019s original sentence, we deny his request for resentencing under the amended version of the guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b445-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
