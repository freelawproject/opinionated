Duncan now appeals contending that the district court erred in accepting his guilty plea and in refusing to grant a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-21\">We generally review the adequacy of a guilty plea de novo, but in the Rule 11 context, violations are evaluated for harmless error. <em>United States v. Goins, </em>51 F.3d 400, 402 (4th Cir.1995). Any variance from the Rule 11 requirements that does not affect the substantial rights of the defendant is disregarded. Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(h); <em>United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 117 (4th Cir.1991). The district court must ensure that the defendant is competent to enter the plea and that the plea is given knowingly and voluntarily. <em>Godinez v. Moran, </em>509 U.S. 389, 400, 113 S.Ct. 2680, 125 L.Ed.2d 321 (1993). We have reviewed the record and conclude that the district court did not err in accepting Duncan\u2019s guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-22\">Because Duncan failed to object at the sentencing hearing to the district court\u2019s decision to deny a reduction to the offense level for acceptance of responsibility, we review for plain error, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993), and find none.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-23\">Accordingly, we affirm Duncan\u2019s conviction and 151-month sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-24\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b714-18\"> To the extent Duncan raises an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, we decline to review it because the record does not conclusively establish that counsel was ineffective. <em>See United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
