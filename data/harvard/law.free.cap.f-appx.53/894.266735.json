Appellee Fitzgerald alleges that Appellant Police Officer used excessive force against him when she shot at his vehicle and wounded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>him while she was pursuing Appellee\u2019s truck. The district court determined that there were material issues of disputed fact regarding whether the circumstances warranted Appellant Officer\u2019s use of excessive force. Therefore, the district court denied Appellant Officer\u2019s motion for summary judgment based on qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">Orders denying qualified immunity before trial are appealable only to the extent that they resolve abstract issues of law and do not extend to issues of evidentiary sufficiency. <em>See Behrens v. Pelletier, </em>516 U.S. 299, 313, 116 S.Ct. 834, 133 L.Ed.2d 773 (1996); <em>Johnson v. Jones, </em>515 U.S. 304, 312-14, 115 S.Ct. 2151, 132 L.Ed.2d 238 (1995); <em>Armijo v. Wagon Mound Public Schools, </em>159 F.3d 1253, 1258 (10th Cir. 1998); <em>Foote v. Spiegel, </em>118 F.3d 1416, 1422 (10th Cir.1997). While this court is not deprived of jurisdiction solely because the district court determined that there are genuine issues of material fact, this court lacks jurisdiction \u201cif our review would require second-guessing [of] the district court\u2019s determination of evidence sufficiency.\u201d <em>Medina v. Cram, </em>252 F.3d 1124, 1130 (10th Cir.2001). Appellant Officer challenges only the district court\u2019s determination that Appellee Fitzgerald produced sufficient evidence pertaining to the circumstances surrounding her use of force to send the case to trial. Accordingly, this court lacks jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s denial of Appellant Officer\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the grounds of qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">We DISMISS for lack of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b928-8\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b929-8\">. Appellee's motion to substitute brief is granted.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
