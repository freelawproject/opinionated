(\u201cCarolina\u201d), finding that CSX Transportation, Inc. (\u201cCSX\u201d) failed to \u201ccommence\u201d the action by both timely filing and serving the complaint, as required under South Carolina law. We conclude, as did the district court, that Carolina neither waived its statute of limitations defense nor is estopped from asserting it. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-25\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-26\">On March 18, 1998, a CSX freight train derailed at a milepost located in Chester<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>field County, South Carolina. Carolina operates a business near the milepost, and a pond is located on Carolina\u2019s land. CSX alleges that the pond was \u201cheld by a dam constructed and maintained\u201d by Carolina and that the \u201cdam failed catastrophically which caused the water escaping the pond to flow onto the roadbed and railroad tracks immediately eroding them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Prior to the filing of the instant action, on July 27, 1999, CSX conductor Henry Webb, the driver of the derailed train, sued both CSX and Dr. Winston Godwin, the owner of Carolina. CSX then filed a cross-claim against Godwin for its property damage. Godwin had insurance coverage from both Auto Owners Insurance Company and State Farm Fire and Casualty Company. Carolina and CSX retained the attorneys who also represent them in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">The parties settled Webb\u2019s claim. In mediating CSX\u2019s cross-claim, a dispute arose between Auto Owners and State Farm regarding which insurance company had primary coverage. In December 2000, CSX reached a partial settlement -with State Farm and agreed to re-file the lawsuit against Carolina, rather than against Winston Godwin, and to pursue further recovery solely from Auto Owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">When the prior suit concluded in December 2000, Carolina\u2019s counsel \u201corally requested that CSX counsel not serve the new lawsuit on Winston Godwin (as president and owner of Carolina Feed Mills) but rather send the lawsuit directly\u201d to counsel. On January 11, 2001, Carolina counsel sent a letter to CSX counsel reiterating the request as to service of the complaint: \u201cI am waiting on service of the complaint against Carolina Feed Mills. I can accept service of the complaint; therefore, forward it to my attention.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">On March 12, 2001, CSX filed the complaint. The three-year statute of limitations expired on March 18, 2001. <em>See </em>S.C.Code Ann. \u00a7 15-3-530. On March 22, 2001, CSX counsel sent Carolina counsel a \u201cnotice of lawsuit and request for waiver of summons.\u201d Carolina counsel signed the waiver on April 9, 2001. The waiver was filed on April 26, 2001, and the complaint was deemed served on that day. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 4(d)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-10\">The waiver provided that Carolina \u201cagree[d] to save the cost of service of a summons and an additional copy of the Complaint\u201d by not requiring that it \u201cbe served with judicial process in the manner\u201d provided by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4. The waiver also provided that Carolina \u201cwill retain all defenses or objections to the lawsuit or to the jurisdiction or venue of the court except for objections based on a defect in the summons or in the service of the summons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-11\">On May 5, 2001, Carolina filed its answer and asserted a statute of limitations defense. It did not assert an insufficiency of service of process defense. The parties cross moved for summary judgment on the statute of limitations defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-13\">The district court granted summary judgment to Carolina, reasoning that South Carolina law governed when an action \u201ccommenced\u201d for purposes of the statute of limitations, and that CSX had timely filed but failed to timely serve its complaint within the three-year statute of limitations, which expired on March 18, 2001. <em>See </em>S.C.R. Civ. P. 3(a) (\u201cA civil action is commenced by filing and service of a summons and complaint.\u201d); S.C.Code Ann. \u00a7 15-3-20.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> CSX timely filed its com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>plaint on March 12, 2001, but the complaint was not deemed served until April 26, 2001 \u2014 over a month after the running of the statute of limitations. Rejecting CSX\u2019s reliance on <em>Unisun Insurance v. Hawkins, </em>342 S.C. 537, 537 S.E.2d 559 (2000), the district court also held that Carolina had not waived its statute of limitations defense by failing to assert insufficiency of service of process in its answer. The district court further held that Carolina was not estopped from claiming the statute of limitations because the parties never discussed the applicable statute of limitations and, although Carolina\u2019s counsel did agree to accept service, he did not agree to waive any statute of limitations defense.</p>\n<p id=\"AQL\">III:</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">We have reviewed the record, briefs, and applicable law and have considered the oral arguments of both parties, and we conclude that the district court was correct. Accordingly, we affirm on the basis of the district court\u2019s well-reasoned opinion. <em>See CSX Transport., Inc. v. Carolina Feed Mills, Inc., </em>No. 4:01-725-25BF (D.S.C. March 29, 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b711-8\">The South Carolina legislature amended this provision, effective May 24, 2002, to provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>that a \"civil action is commenced when the summons and complaint are filed with the clerk of court if actual service is accomplished within one hundred twenty days after filing.\u201d The parties agree that the amended provision does not apply to the instant action.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
