The court has determined that the issues presented occasion no need for an opinion. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. 36; D.C.Cir. Rule 36(b). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b160-19\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the judgment of the district court be affirmed. The district court correctly determined that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to review appellant\u2019s challenge to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit\u2019s rejection of appellant\u2019s attempt to appeal from a decision by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. <em>See Marin v. Suter, </em>956 F.2d 339, 340 (D.C.Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-20\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published.
