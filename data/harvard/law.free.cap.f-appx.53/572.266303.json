In order to prevail on this claim, petitioner must demonstrate that his counsel failed to meet \u201can objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), and that \u201cbut for [his] counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Thus, petitioner must show that any reasonable attorney would have made a motion to dismiss based upon the alleged STA violation, and that his counsel\u2019s failure to do so prejudiced him.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Here, petitioner cannot make this showing. The STA requires that a defendant be brought to trial within 70 days of his indictment, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(c)(1); a violation of this provision requires dismissal of the indictment, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3162(a)(2). Time may be excluded from the 70-day clock for certain enumerated reasons, or when it serves \u201cthe ends of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3161(h). In making a determination to exclude time under this latter provision, a district court must balance the \u201cends of justice served by the granting of such continuance\u201d and \u201cthe best interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.\u201d Id. \u00a7 3161(h)(8)(A). Factors relevant to this determination include whether the exclusion \u201cwould deny the defendant reasonable time to obtain counsel, would unreasonably deny the defendant or the Government continuity of counsel, or would deny counsel for the defendant or the attorney for the Government the reasonable time necessary for effective preparation, taking into account the exercise of due diligence.\u201d Id. \u00a7 3161(h)(8)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">In the 135 calendar days between petitioner\u2019s indictment and his guilty plea, the district court excluded two periods of time in the interests of justice. The first exclusion, for 43 days, was the result of a request by petitioner\u2019s attorney for more time to prepare pre-trial motions. Petitioner stipulated to a waiver of this time under the STA. In addition, while petitioner asserts that time for the preparation of pre-trial motions should not automatically be excluded from the STA clock, <em>see United States v. Jarrell, </em>147 F.3d 315, 317 (4th Cir.1998), the district court did not automatically exclude time to allow counsel to prepare pre-trial motions; instead, it based its determination on counsel\u2019s need to prepare a defense balanced against the fact that \u201c[t]hese people are in prison or in jail.\u201d This suffices under the STA. <em>United States v. Breen, </em>243 F.3d 591, 597 (2d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">The district court granted a second, 28-day exclusion of time because defendant requested new counsel, who needed time to familiarize himself with the case before mounting a defense. Appointment of new counsel is noted in the STA as a potential reason to exclude <em>time in the </em>interests of justice, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(h)(B)(iv), and here again the court noted, \u201cthe defendants are in ja\u00f1, so we should proceed expeditiously.\u201d While not explicit, the record thus makes clear that the district court weighed the proper factors in its determination. <em>Breen, </em>243 F.3d at 597(\u201c[F]ailure to utter the magic words \u2018ends-of-justice\u2019 at the time of ordering the continuance is not necessarily fatal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">As both exclusions were proper under the STA, a potential motion to dismiss based upon a STA violation would have failed; thus, defendant has not demonstrated that his counsel was unreasonable in failing to bring such a motion, or that defendant was prejudiced as a result of that failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>Petitioner\u2019s motion was therefore properly denied, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
