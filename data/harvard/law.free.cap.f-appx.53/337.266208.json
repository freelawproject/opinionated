The parties have waived oral argument, and the panel unanimously agrees that it is not needed in this case. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-20\">Maliszewski was convicted of conspiring to manufacture, distribute, and possess marijuana for intended distribution, a violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. He was sentenced to 110 months of imprisonment, and this sentence was affirmed on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-21\">In 1999, Maliszewski filed a \u00a7 2255 motion alleging: 1) that the jury selection plan was improper; 2) that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel; 3) that he was subjected to prosecutorial misconduct; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>4) that he could not pay his f\u00edne; and 5) that the court had miscalculated the amount of marijuana that was attributed to him. His last claim arguably involves the holding in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that \u201c[ojther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d The district court dismissed Maliszewski\u2019s case on July 12, 2000, and it is from this judgment that he now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">MahszewsM was granted a certificate of appealability on the following issues: 1) whether the holding in <em>Apprendi </em>is retroactively applicable in initial collateral proceedings; and 2) whether the retroactive application of <em>Apprendi </em>would affect his sentence. He has moved for the appointment of an independent party to file an amicus brief on these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">We need not reach the second issue, as our court has now issued a published decision which holds that <em>Apprendi </em>is not retroactively applicable to cases on initial collateral review. <em>See Goode v. United States, </em>305 F.3d 378, 382 (6th Cir.2002). The published decision in <em>Goode </em>is binding here. <em>See United States v. Roper, </em>266 F.3d 526, 530 (6th Cir.2001). Hence, Maliszewski\u2019s claims are unavailing because the holding in <em>Apprendi </em>is simply not applicable to his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Accordingly, all pending motions are denied and the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
