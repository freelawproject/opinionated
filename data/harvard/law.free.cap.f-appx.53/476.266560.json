We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253 and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">During jury selection in Daniels\u2019s state court trial for transportation of a controlled substance, the State exercised a peremptory challenge to excuse an African-American juror, Juror M. Daniels\u2019s counsel then moved for a mistrial under <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986), and <em>People v. Wheeler, </em>22 Cal.3d 258, 148 Cal.Rptr. 890, 583 P.2d 748 (1978). Following considerable colloquy, the trial judge denied Daniels\u2019s motion on the ground that <em>Batson </em>and <em>Wheeler </em>require a pattern of systematic exclusion and a pattern requires the use of more than one peremptory challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">The California Court of Appeal found the trial court had erred as a matter of law by ruling that a defendant cannot make a <em>prima facie </em>case based on only one peremptory challenge. <em>People v. Montiel, </em>5 Cal.4th 877, 21 Cal.Rptr.2d 705, 855 P.2d 1277 (1993). It nevertheless affirmed the trial court, holding first that a <em>prima facie </em>ease under <em>Wheeler </em>requires defendant to \u201cshow a strong likelihood that the persons being challenged are being challenged because of their group association.\u201d It then determined, after an independent review of the record on voir dire, that Daniels had failed to make a <em>prima facie </em>case because \u201covert religiousness\u201d was a ground fact-specific to Juror M, distinct from race or religious affiliation and, hence, an acceptable ground on which the prosecutor might reasonably have challenged Juror M.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">In <em>Wade v. Terhune, </em>202 F.3d 1190 (9th Cir.2000), we held that California courts following the \u201cstrong likelihood\u201d language of <em>Wheeler </em>are not applying the correct legal standard for a <em>prima facie </em>case under <em>Batson. Wade, </em>202 F.3d at 1197.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> By applying the \u201cstrong likelihood\u201d standard of <em>Wheeler, </em>the Court of Appeal impermissibly required Daniels to meet a more stringent burden than the \u201cinference\u201d of racial discrimination standard under <em>Bat-son. </em>Its decision thus involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). Where a state court applies the incorrect legal standard, we do not defer to its determination that a defendant has failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of bias. Our review of the <em>Batson </em>claim is therefore <em>de novo. Wade, </em>202 F.3d at 1195, 1197.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">The Court of Appeal reasoned that overt or hyper-religiousness could translate into the juror being unwilling to sit in judgment of another person. The record, which shows that Juror M had previously sat on a jury that convicted a defendant of murder, refutes this rationale. Moreover, Juror M testified on voir dire that he would have no trouble evaluating the credibility of law enforcement officers and applying the presumption of innocence, that he was regularly employed by a bank, and that the extent of his religious activity was teaching bible school on Wednesday nights, for which he prepared lesson plans. Furthermore Juror M\u2019s religious characteristics were comparable to Juror L\u2019s, who worked in a church bookstore, was not an African-American, but was not challenged. The <em>Batson prima facie </em>case requirement \u201cis not onerous.\u201d <em>Wade, </em>202 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>F.3d at 1197. We think this evidence was sufficient to raise a reasonable inference that Juror M was struck on account of his race and that the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision was thus based on an unreasonable determination of the facts. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"A1q\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b511-8\">.
