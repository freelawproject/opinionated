On appeal, Estrada-Hernandez contends the district court abused its discretion by permitting a witness to testify as to a statement made by Estrada-Hernandez threatening a witness. Estrada-Hernandez claims the statement was not relevant and it was unfairly prejudicial. Estrada-Hernandez also contends a prior felony drug conviction used to increase the statutory minimum sentence under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) should have been in the indictment and proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-24\">A district court has broad discretion in ruling on the relevance and admissibility of evidence, which will not be reversed absent an abuse of that discretion. <em>United States v. Bostian, </em>59 F.3d 474, 480 (4th Cir.1995). Evidence is relevant and may be admitted if it tends \u201cto make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>nation of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 401. Evidence that is not relevant is not admissible. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Evid. 402. Evidence that a defendant made threats against a witness is relevant of consciousness of guilt. <em>United States v. Van Metre, </em>150 F.3d 339, 352 (4th Cir. 1998). We find the court did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion in limine and permitting testimony about a statement made by Estrada-Hernandez.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">We further find the prior felony drug conviction used to increase the statutory minimum sentence under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) did not need to be in the indictment or proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 226-27, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998); <em>United States v. Sterling, </em>283 F.3d 216, 219-20 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 122 S.Ct. 2606, 153 L.Ed.2d 792 (2002).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b324-10\"> Estrada-Hernandez\u2019 challenges to the drug quantity used to arrive at his offense level and the prior misdemeanor conviction used to arrive at his criminal history category are moot because regardless of the resolution of those issues, Estrada-Hernandez would be subjected to the statutory minimum sentence of twenty years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
