On appeal, the Foundation argues that the district court erred in concluding that it lacked jurisdiction because the Foundation was not the original source of the informa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>tion upon which its claim was based. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">We review the district court\u2019s Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1) dismissal for lack of jurisdiction <em>de novo. See United States ex rel Dhawan &amp; Gowie v. N.Y. Med. College, </em>252 F.3d 118, 120 (2d Cir.2001) <em>(per curiam). </em>\u201cUnder the False Claims Act, a private party may maintain a <em>qui tarn </em>action based on publicly disclosed allegations of fraud or fraudulent transactions only if the party qualifies as \u2018an original source of th[is] information.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(e)(4)(A)) (alteration in original). The Foundation acknowledges that the research it relies upon has been previously published and is thus \u201cpublicly disclosed\u201d information. It argues however that it has synthesized this publicly disclosed research into original \u201cmeta analyses.\u201d We reject this claim because the Foundation\u2019s disclosure statement merely compil\u00e9s previously published research; thus it is not the \u201coriginal source\u201d of any of the information upon which it relies. The district court, therefore, lacked jurisdiction over the Foundation\u2019s complaint under the False Claims Act, <em>see </em>31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(e)(4)(A), and properly dismissed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
