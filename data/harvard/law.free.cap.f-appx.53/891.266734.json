Post appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal with prejudice of his civil action against the Supreme Court of Colorado and various other Colorado state offices and officials. For the reasons stated below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-14\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b926-15\">Mr. Post is a disbarred Colorado lawyer. In his amended complaint in the federal district court, he alleged that his disbarment by the Colorado Supreme Court was conducted in an unauthorized and illegal manner constituting theft of his license to practice law in violation of (1) his due process rights, (2) the Colorado Organized Crime Control Act, Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 18-17-104, and (3) the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961 (\u201cRICO\u201d). The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss for (1) lack of subject matter jurisdiction, (2) qualified immunity, (3) Eleventh Amendment immunity, (4) and failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-16\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b926-17\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction de novo.\u201d <em>Aguilera v. Kirkpatrick, </em>241 F.3d 1286, 1292 (10th Cir.2001). A district court \u201clacking jurisdiction cannot render judgment but must dismiss [when] it becomes apparent that jurisdiction is lacking.\u201d <em>Tuck v. United Services Auto. Ass\u2019n, </em>859 F.2d 842, 844 (10th Cir.1988) (internal citations and quotations omitted). Therefore, if the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Mr. Post\u2019s claims, we need go no further.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-18\">The district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the merits of Mr. Post\u2019s disbarment. <em>See Phelps v. Kansas Sup. Ct., </em>662 F.2d 649, 651 (10th Cir.1981) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>(\u201cThe lower federal courts do not have subject matter jurisdiction to review state disbarment proceedings.\u201d). Further, we agree with the district court that because granting any of Mr. Post\u2019s desired relief would require the district court to determine the validity of the disbarment order, this case is therefore \u201cnot within the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d Vol. rec. I, doc. 21, at 2, (Dist. Ct. Order, dated Apr. 2, 2002). <em>See Doe v. Pringle, </em>550 F.2d 596, 599 (10th Cir.1976) (\u201cWe concur in the district court\u2019s finding that it is without subject matter jurisdiction to review a final order of the Colorado Supreme Court denying a particular application for admission to the Colorado Bar. This rule applies even though, as here, the challenge is anchored to alleged deprivations of federally protected due process and equal protection rights.\u201d). Because we hold that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Mr. Post\u2019s claims, we will not evaluate the merits of his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal of Mr. Post\u2019s action.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b926-19\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3. After examining the appellant\u2019s brief and the appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal, <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
