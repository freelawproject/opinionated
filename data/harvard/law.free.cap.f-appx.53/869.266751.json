R.App. P. 34(f). The case is, therefore, ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-17\">Donald Broomfield seeks a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate his conviction and sentence. In order for this court to grant a certificate of appealability, a petitioner must make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). In addressing the requirements for obtaining a certificate of appeal-ability under \u00a7 2253(c), the Supreme Court stated that a defendant must show a substantial denial of a constitutional right by demonstrating that \u201creasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-18\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"ANN\">Mr. Broomfield was convicted on November 18, 1998 of possessing with intent to distribute a mixture containing cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Mr. Broomfield was sentenced to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment and five years\u2019 supervised release, and his conviction was upheld on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Broomfield, </em>201 F.3d 1270 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 830, 121 S.Ct. 82, 148 L.Ed.2d 44 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-19\">Mr. Broomfield filed a pro se motion with the district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 to \u201cvacate, set aside, or correct\u201d his sentence, arguing that (1) he received ineffective assistance of counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>because trial counsel failed to inform him of the \u201csafety valve\u201d provision of the sentencing guidelines, <em>see </em>USSG \u00a7 5C1.2, (2) he qualified for a two-point reduction in offense level pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(6), and (3) the district court erred when it applied 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841, pursuant to <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). The district court appointed counsel and held an evidentiary hearing on the ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The district court concluded that none of Mr. Broomfield\u2019s claims was meritorious and denied Mr. Broomfield a certificate of appealability. On appeal, Mr. Broomfield raises only the ineffective assistance claim and the constitutional challenge to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">Counsel for defendant has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), indicating his belief that the record contains no meritorious issues for appeal. Defense counsel has also filed a motion requesting leave to withdraw as counsel, stating his belief that the issues raised on appeal are frivolous. As required, copies of counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief and motion to withdraw were provided to defendant. <em>See id. </em>at 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396. Pursuant to our duty under <em>Anders, </em>we have conducted an independent review of Mr. Broomfield\u2019s conviction and sentence. We agree with counsel\u2019s conscientious review of the record and with his conclusion that the appeal is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">As to Mr. Broomfield\u2019s ineffective assistance claim, Mr. Broomfield claims that his attorney failed to inform him of the safety valve provisions in USSG \u00a7 5C1.2. Mr. Broomfield\u2019s trial counsel testified at the evidentiary hearing that he had sent Mr. Broomfield a letter that set out the provisions of \u00a7 5C1.2\u2019s safety valve provisions. Mr. Broomfield testified however, either that he did not recall reading the paragraph that explained the safety valve provisions or that the copy of the letter that he received contained no such paragraph. Further hearing testimony also indicated that Mr. Broomfield was aware that his co-defendant had cooperated with the government and had received sentencing concessions in exchange for that cooperation, pursuant to \u00a7 5C1.2. The court found that the defendant had been informed about \u201cthe general operation of the safety valve provision.\u201d Rec. doc. 146, at 6 (Dist. Ct. Order, filed Apr. 4, 2002). We agree that Mr. Broomfield\u2019s ineffective assistance claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-9\">In his second argument on appeal, Mr. Broomfield asserts that, in the wake of <em>Apprendi, </em>the district court lacked authority to impose a sentence under \u00a7 841. This argument, however, as Mr. Broom-field\u2019s appellate counsel acknowledges, is foreclosed by our holding in <em>United States v. Cernobyl, </em>255 F.3d 1215, 1219 (10th Cir.2001) (joining other circuits in \u201cholding that \u00a7 841 remains constitutionally enforceable\u201d and noting that <em>\u201cApprendi </em>in no way conflicts with the explicit terms of the [\u00a7 841]\u201d). We agree that Mr. Broomfield\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of \u00a7 841 is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-10\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b905-11\">Because Mr. Broomfield has made no substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right, we DENY his application for a certificate of appealability and DISMISS the appeal. We GRANT counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b904-13\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
