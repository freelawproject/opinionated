Montle appeals from the district court\u2019s (Pollack, <em>J.) </em>entry of judgment, following a bench trial, in favor of the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), on civil claims the SEC brought pursuant to \u00a7 10(b) of the Securities Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-5; \u00a7 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77q(a); \u00a7\u00a7 13(b)(5) &amp; (b)(2) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78m(b)(5) <em>&amp; </em>(b)(2), and Rule 13b2-l thereunder, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.13b2-1; \u00a7 13(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78m(a), and Rules 12b-20, 13a-l, and 13a-13, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 240.13a-l, 240.13a-13, and 240.12b-20 thereunder; and \u00a7 20(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78t(a). The district court\u2019s judgment (1) enjoined Montle from violating the securities laws at issue; (2) ordered him to disgorge $187,459.25 in gains plus another $177,633 in prejudgment interest; (3) entered a civil fine of $50,000; and (4) barred Montle for a period of five years from serving in designated capacities through which he might commit similar securities law violations. Montle challenges the district court\u2019s finding of liability on each count, and the remedy it chose.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b179-12\">The SEC\u2019s claims pertain to three business ventures that Montle pursued, using publicly traded corporations, in 1992-1993. One was the marketing of an HIV-testing product, the next was the purchase and financing of a Colorado casino, and the third was the acquisition, through a \u201cshell\u201d corporation, of a partnership formed to salvage relies from the sunken vessel, the Titanic.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-13\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b179-14\">\u201cIn reviewing a district court\u2019s decision in a bench trial, we review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law <em>de novo. </em>Mixed questions of law and fact are likewise reviewed <em>de novo.\u201d White v. White Rose Food, </em>237 F.3d 174, 178 (2d Cir.2001) (citation omitted). We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s order of equitable relief. <em>See, e.g., Davis v. New York City Hous. Auth., </em>278 F.3d 64, 79 (2d Cir.2002) (permanent injunction); <em>SEC v. Wang, </em>944 F.2d 80, 85 (2d Cir.1991) (disgorgement); <em>SEC v. First Jersey Sec., Inc., </em>101 F.3d 1450, 1476 (2d Cir.1996) (prejudgment interest); <em>SEC v. Posner, </em>16 F.3d 520, 521 (2d Cir.1994) (officer or director bar).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-15\">Having carefully studied the voluminous record and the applicable law, we conclude that the court below handled this case in a typically capable fashion. We find no clear error of fact or mistake of law, and the relief ordered lay well within the permissible range of discretion. Having considered all of the defendant\u2019s arguments, we affirm the decision of the district court, substantially for the reasons that it gave.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
