Plaintiffs-appellants also appeal the district court\u2019s March 11, 2002 denial of their motion to amend judgment to allow that court to continue to enforce certain reporting provisions of the consent decree which had governed the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s interpretation of a consent decree. <em>See Equal Employment Opportunity Comm\u2019n v. New York Times Co., </em>196 F.3d 72, 78 (2d Cir.1999). Upon review, we find that the district court correctly determined that the consent decree unambiguously expired by its own terms on May 1, 2000. Accordingly, the district court lacked jurisdiction to enforce it. <em>See Equal Employment Opportunity Comm\u2019n v. Local 40, Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Bridge, Structural and Ornamental Iron Workers, </em>76 F.3d 76, 80-81 (2d Cir. 1996) (recognizing that when a consent decree expires by its own terms and no party moves for an extension, the decree may not continue to be enforced).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to amend judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 59 for abuse of discretion. <em>See Baker v. Dorfman, </em>239 F.3d 415, 427 (2d Cir.2000). We find that when the consent decree expired on May 1, 2000, the district court lost jurisdiction over the parties. Given that the consent decree itself explicitly provided that termination would mean the end of court supervision and dismissal of the action, to continue to engage in supervision after termination would, be contrary to the bargained-for agreement of the parties. This court frowns upon district courts\u2019 deviations from the plain terms of a consent decree for this reason. <em>See Local 40, </em>76 F.3d at 81; <em>Berger v. Heckler, </em>771 F.2d 1556, 1568 (2d Cir.1985). Accordingly, denial of the motion to amend was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
