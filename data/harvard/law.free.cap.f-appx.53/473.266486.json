Because we find that the officer did not have reasonable suspicion to justify the initial stop, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-21\">The district court\u2019s finding that the officer had reasonable suspicion to justify the stop was clearly erroneous. The objective facts of the record establish that no officer could have had a reasonable suspicion that Calderon-Flores had violated a traffic law. This court has carefully reviewed the videotape of the events preceding the stop. The pass and lane change into the slow lane was made on a clear day with light traffic. Calderon-Flores never exceeded the speed limit, and the pick-up truck he passed never slowed when Calderon-Flores changed lanes. We therefore conclude that the traffic stop violated the Fourth Amendment. <em>United States v. Mariscal, </em>285 F.3d 1127, 1133 (9th Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-22\">The district court erred in denying Calderon-Flores\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence obtained as a result of the traffic stop. We therefore REVERSE and REMAND.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b507-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
