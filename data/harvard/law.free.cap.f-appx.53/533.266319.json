R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-21\">Pro se appellant Lee David Humphrey was convicted of two counts of second-degree sexual assault of his daughter, and his conviction was affirmed by the Wyoming Supreme Court. <em>See Humphrey v. State, </em>962 P.2d 866 (Wyo.1998). He petitioned the district court for habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 and was denied relief. He now seeks a certificate of appealability (COA) from this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-22\">Mr. Humphrey petitioned the federal district court for habeas relief on the following grounds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-23\">(1) erroneous admission of prior bad act evidence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-24\">(2) erroneous admission of expert testimony;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-25\">(3) erroneous admission of prejudicial testimony by William D. Hansen;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-26\">(4) erroneous admission of prejudicial testimony by Marilyn Davis Newman;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-27\">(5) erroneous admission of prejudicial hearsay testimony;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-28\">(6) erroneous admission of prior consistent out-of-court statements; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-29\">(7) denial of a fair trial through ineffective assistance of counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-30\">In his application for COA, Mr. Humphrey appears to confine himself to the issue of whether the federal district court violated his due process rights in delaying decision of his habeas petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>We grant COA only where there is a substantial showing of denial of a constitutional right. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). In other words, the petitioner must demonstrate that jurists of reason could debate whether the petition should have been resolved in a different manner. <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Having reviewed the arguments and materials submitted by Mr. Humphrey and the district court\u2019s decision, we conclude that Mr. Humphrey has failed to meet this standard. Accordingly, the application for COA is DENIED and the appeal is DISMISSED for substantially the reasons stated by the district court. Mr. Humphrey\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis is GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b567-19\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b567-32\">. Mr. Humphrey makes passing reference to <em>Brady </em>violations by the district court, but there is no argument or authority in support of this contention.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
