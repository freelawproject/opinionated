Trager, <em>District </em>Judge) dismissing his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A. Newton brought suit against his own defense attorneys, an Assistant United States Attorney, an United States District Judge and a Magistrate Judge, a parole officer, and a special agent from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. In his complaint, Newton claimed that defendants violated his constitutional rights by causing his arrest, detention, and prosecution. The district court screened the complaint pursuant to \u00a7 1915A, recognized that the action pleaded derived from <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Narcotics Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1991), and <em>sua sponte </em>dismissed it as frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">This Court reviews <em>sua sponte </em>dismissals, ordered pursuant to \u00a7 1915A, <em>de novo. See Marvin v. Goord, </em>255 F.3d 40, 42 (2d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">We find that the complaint was properly dismissed as frivolous. An action is frivolous as a matter of law when (1) \u201cthe \u2018factual contentions are clearly baseless,\u2019 such as when allegations are the product of delusion or fantasy,\u201d or (2) when \u201cthe claim is \u2018based on an indisputably merit-less legal theory,\u2019 \u201d such as when \u201ca dis-positive defense clearly exists on the face of the complaint.\u201d <em>Livingston v. Adirondack Beverage Co., </em>141 F.3d 434, 437 (2d Cir.1998) (quoting <em>Nance v. Kelly, </em>912 F.2d 605, 606 (2d Cir.1990) (per curiam)).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">All of Newton\u2019s claims are barred by dispositive defenses. Newton\u2019s claims against the district judge, the magistrate judge, and the Assistant United States Attorney are all barred by absolute immunity, since the allegedly improper acts of these defendants were performed within the scope of their judicial or prosecutorial employment. <em>See, e.g., Mireles v. Waco, </em>502 U.S. 9, 11-13, 112 S.Ct. 286, 116 L.Ed.2d 9 (1991) (judicial immunity); <em>Imbler v. Pachtman, </em>424 U.S. 409, 430, 96 S.Ct. 984, 47 L.Ed.2d 128 (1976) (prosecutorial immunity). Furthermore, the district court correctly dismissed the claims against Newton\u2019s former court-appointed attorneys, since they are not deemed to be state or federal employees. <em>See Rodriguez v. Weprin, </em>116 F.3d 62, 65-66 (2d Cir. 1997). In addition, Newton\u2019s claims against the parole officer and the special agent, whose only connection to the action stems from Newton\u2019s arrest, were also properly dismissed because he failed to allege that the federal charge against him was terminated in his favor. <em>See Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 489, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). The district court therefore did not err by dismissing this action as frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court dismissing the action is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
