Avery filed a complaint alleging race discrimination in violation of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1691 (2000), and related state law claims. The case was tried before a jury and the district court entered judgment as a matter of law in favor of the Defendant as to all counts. Avery appeals. We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s statements from the bench. The court properly found that Avery failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination and that, in any event, the Defendant presented legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for the denial of credit. Accordingly, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-20\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
