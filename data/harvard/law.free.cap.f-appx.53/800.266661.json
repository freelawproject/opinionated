The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> departed downward from the Guidelines range and sentenced him to the statutory minimum of 120 months of imprisonment and 5 years of supervised release. On appeal, counsel has moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), noting that some of Lewis\u2019s codefendants received lower sentences than he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-22\">Lewis is foreclosed from challenging the length of his sentence, as he specifically requested a sentence of 120 months. <em>See United States v. Nguyen, </em>46 F.3d 781, 783 (8th Cir.1995) (defendant who explicitly and voluntarily exposes himself to specific sentence may not challenge that punishment on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-23\">Following our independent review, <em>see Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed. We also grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b834-19\">. The Honorable Scott O. Wright, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
