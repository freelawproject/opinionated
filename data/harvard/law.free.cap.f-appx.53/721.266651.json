This court may exercise jurisdiction only over final orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (2000), and certain interlocutory and collateral orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292 (2000); Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b); <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). The order Acevedo seeks to appeal is neither a final order nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>an appealable interlocutory or collateral order. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
