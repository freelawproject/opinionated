In their briefs filed by counsel pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), Rice and Ferguson each challenge the district court\u2019s decision to sentence them at the low end of the relevant guidelines range. Ferguson\u2019s brief also challenges the adequacy of the district court\u2019s colloquy pursuant to Fed. R.Crim.P. 11.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">First, our review of the record indicates that both Rice and Ferguson were sentenced at the low end of a properly calculated guidelines range. Such challenges to a court\u2019s exercise of discretion in setting a sentence within a properly calculated sentencing range are not reviewable on appeal. <em>United States v. Porter, </em>909 F.2d 789, 794 (4th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">Second, our review of Ferguson\u2019s Rule 11 colloquy indicates that the district court properly ascertained that Ferguson was competent to enter a plea, reviewed the nature of the charges against her, the rights she would forego by pleading guilty, and her potential sentence. Because the court\u2019s colloquy with Ferguson indicates her plea was knowingly and voluntarily entered, we find no error. <em>See United States v. Puckett, </em>61 F.3d 1092, 1099 (4th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm both Rice\u2019s and Ferguson\u2019s convictions and sentences. The court requires that counsel inform their clients, in writing, of their right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but- counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b729-19\"> Rice and Ferguson filed pro se supplemental briefs raising additional issues. However, we find Rice's contention that the Bureau of Prisons improperly extended his sentence by seven months inappropriate, as the additional seven months Rice identifies are attributable to a separate sentence imposed for his violation of his supervised release. Nor do we find merit in Ferguson\u2019s challenge to the adequacy of her indictment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
