We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">The parties to this case are familiar with its facts and procedural history, and we will not repeat them here. When reviewing a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, we accept the district court\u2019s factual findings unless clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. </em>Price, 265 F.3d 1097, 1104 (10th Cir.2001). We review de novo the legal question of whether the officers conducting the searches complied with the Fourth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>We review the trial court\u2019s rulings on the admission of evidence, including expert testimony, for an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. </em>Velarde, 214 F.3d 1204, 1208 (10th Cir. 2000) (expert testimony); <em>United States v. Simpson, </em>152 F.3d 1241, 1248 (10th Cir. 1998) (evidence generally). We review de novo a claim that the Government failed to disclose exculpatory evidence. <em>United States v. Molina, </em>75 F.3d 600, 602 (10th Cir.1996). We review for an abuse of discretion Mann\u2019s claim the district court sentenced him to a disparately harsh sentence. <em>United States v. Allen, </em>24 F.3d 1180, 1188 (10th Cir.1994). After reviewing the record and the briefs, and hearing oral argument, we find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b562-7\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
