For the reasons discussed below, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-15\">Mpamugo first argues that the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) failed to charge him with an offense in violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d). This claim is based on his erroneous belief that the current version of INA \u00a7 241(a)(1)(B) is codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a)(1)(B) (2000), a section which does not relate to a ground of deportation. At the time that deportation proceedings were initiated against Mpamugo, however, INA \u00a7 241(a)(1)(B) was codified at \u00a7 1251(a)(1)(B) and provided that \u201c[a]ny alien who entered the United States without inspection or at any time or place other than as designated by the Attorney General or is in the United States in violation of this chapter or any other law of the United States is deportable.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a)(1)(B) (1994); <em>see also Onyeme v. INS, </em>146 F.3d 227, 228 n. 2 (4th Cir.1998) (noting recodification of INA \u00a7 241(a)(1)(B)). We therefore find that Mpamugo was properly charged pursuant to INA \u00a7 241(a)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-16\">Next, Mpamugo raises several claims relating to the INS\u2019s failure to rule on his wife\u2019s pending immediate relative petition. We lack jurisdiction to address these claims. Pursuant to INA \u00a7 106(a), as codified in early 1996 at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a) (1994), the courts of appeals have exclusive jurisdiction over \u201call final orders of deportation\u201d made pursuant to deportation hearings. The Supreme Court has held that \u201cthe judicial review provisions of \u00a7 106(a) embrace only those determinations made during a [deportation] proceeding.\u201d <em>Cheng Fan Kwok v. INS, </em>392 U.S. 206, 216, 88 S.Ct. 1970, 20 L.Ed.2d 1037 (1968). Because the INS\u2019s adjudication of the immediate relative petition is separate and distinct from Mpamugo\u2019s deportation proceedings, we cannot reach the merits of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>these claims. <em>See Hassan v. INS, </em>110 F.3d 490, 494 (7th Cir.1997); <em>Olivar v. INS, </em>967 F.2d 1381, 1383 n. 1 (9th Cir. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">Accordingly, we deny Mpamugo\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
