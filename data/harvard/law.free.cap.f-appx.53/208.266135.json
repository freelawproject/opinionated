All three co-defendants pled guilty. Sanchez\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), identifying but finding wholly meritless possible challenges to Sanchez\u2019s guilty plea and the District Court\u2019s refusal to downward depart on Sanchez\u2019s sentence for minor role, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 (2002), and the \u201csafety valve,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2553(f) (2002). Sanchez has filed an informal brief appealing his sentence under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), claiming that the District Court imposed a penalty beyond the prescribed statutory maximum and arguing that he was given ineffective assistance of counsel because his counsel did not raise the <em>Apprendi </em>issue at sentencing or on appeal. Because Sanchez\u2019s counsel faithfully met the requirements of <em>Anders, </em>and we find upon independent review that this appeal lacks merit, we will grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">In September 2000, Special Agent Hilary Hodge of the United States Customs Service observed a boat departing St. Thomas, Virgin Islands with two people on board, later identified as Sanchez and Miguel Angel Montero-Baez. Sanchez appeared to be directing Montero-Baez where to go and also aided Montero-Baez in restarting the vessel after the engine stalled. Law enforcement agents aboard a U.S. Customs aircraft later saw Sanchez, Montero-Baez, and Julio Moncado-Polomo in the boat throwing bales of cocaine overboard. At the time of his arrest, Sanchez had several telephone numbers in his possession that matched those in Moncado-Polomo\u2019s possession. Sanchez was indicted for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and possession with intent to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine. He pled guilty to the conspiracy charge, and was sentenced to 210 months imprisonment, a term of five years supervised release, and ordered to pay a $100 special assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">The District Court of the Virgin Islands had jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231 (2002). We exercise jurisdiction over the District Court\u2019s final order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (2002). We review the District Court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error, <em>United States v. Isazar-Zapata, </em>148 F.3d 236, 238 (3d Cir.1998), and exercise plenary review over its rulings on matters of law. <em>United States v. Queensborough, </em>227 F.3d 149, 156 (3d Cir.2000). Finally, we review Sanchez\u2019s counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief for a conscientious examination of possible appealable issues, and conduct an independent review to determine whether there are any issues of merit. <em>Anders, </em>386 U.S. at 744.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-11\">We conclude that Sanchez\u2019s counsel did conscientiously examine the record, including in her brief four conceivably appealable issues. All are without merit. First, she argues that Sanchez might move to withdraw his guilty plea under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(e), which allows for withdrawal for \u201cany fair and just reason.\u201d We look to three factors in evaluating such a motion to withdraw: \u201c(1) whether the defendant asserts his innocence; (2) whether the government would be prejudiced by his withdrawal; and (3) the strength of the defendant\u2019s reason to withdraw the plea.\u201d <em>United States v. Huff, </em>873 F.2d 709, 712 (3d Cir.1989). Sanchez has never asserted his innocence, therefore this argument is wholly meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>Second, Sanchez\u2019s counsel argues that Sanchez might challenge his guilty plea on the grounds that the government breached the agreement. The government has an obligation to strictly adhere to the terms of a plea bargain. <em>Queensborough, </em>227 F.3d at 156. Here, the government agreed to recommend a reduction of two levels for acceptance of responsibility and an additional reduction of one level for \u201cextraordinary acceptance of responsibility.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 3E1.1(a) and (b). The government did so. The government retained the right to allocute at sentencing, and specifically refused Sanchez\u2019s request that it provide recommendations regarding downward departures for minor role or under the safety valve. The government\u2019s opposition to these latter downward departure requests therefore did not breach the plea agreement. <em>Queensborough, </em>227 F.3d at 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">Third, Sanchez\u2019s counsel poses a possible challenge to the District Court\u2019s failure to depart downward for Sanchez\u2019s minimal or minor role in the offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. In determining whether a defendant was a minimal or minor participant in the crime, a district court must consider the defendant\u2019s relative culpability as compared with the other participants. <em>Isaza-Zapata, </em>148 F.3d at 242. The District Court correctly identified this legal requirement, and did not clearly err in finding that Sanchez\u2019s role was \u201cequal to that of the other individual he went out with,\u201d namely, Montero-Baez. The District Court relied on the testimony of Special Agent Hodge, who testified that Sanchez directed the vessel upon pursuit by law enforcement agents, assisted in restarting the vessel after it stalled, and had numerous telephone numbers in his possession that matched those in the possession of Montero-Baez. In light of this uncontroverted testimony, the District Court\u2019s finding that Sanchez was not a minor participant is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Finally, Sanchez\u2019s counsel identifies a possible challenge to the District Court\u2019s failure to depart downward under the safety valve provision, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2553(f), which enables a sentencing judge to depart downward if he or she finds that the defendant meets five criteria. The District Court found that Sanchez did not meet prong (5), requiring a defendant to truthfully provide to the government all information and evidence the defendant has concerning the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or plan. \u00a7 2553(f)(5). The Court heard the testimony of Special Agent Hodge, who stated that Sanchez had not been truthful because he lied about his arrival in St. Thomas, refused to identify the phone numbers found in his pockets, and incorrectly identified a co-conspirator. The Court thus relied on specific information regarding Sanchez\u2019s untruthfulness. In light of Agent Hodge\u2019s uncontroverted testimony, the District Court\u2019s finding that Sanchez had not been fully forthcoming with the government is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">By conscientiously examining the record and identifying conceivably appealable issues, Sanchez\u2019s counsel met the requirements under <em>Anders. </em>We will therefore grant her motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">In an informal brief, Sanchez himself raises two issues: 1) that his sentence was imposed in violation of <em>Apprendi, </em>and 2) that his counsel was ineffective because she failed to raise the <em>Apprendi </em>issue. Neither of these claims has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">Under <em>Apprendi, </em>a sentencing judge may not determine facts that increase the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum. 530 U.S. at 476. However, nothing in <em>Apprendi </em>restricts a judge\u2019s ability to exercise his or her discretion in imposing a sentence within the range prescribed by statute. <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>481. Sanchez argues that the sentencing judge determined the amount of cocaine attributable to him and then used this fact to arrive at a sentence. This is true. However, in doing so, the judge arrived at a sentence well within the prescribed statutory range.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Sanchez\u2019s <em>Apprendi </em>challenge therefore has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Because his <em>Apprendi </em>argument is meritless, Sanchez\u2019s claim that his counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to raise an <em>Apprendi </em>issue must also fail. Sanchez\u2019s counsel\u2019s failure to raise <em>Apprendi </em>is apparent from the record, therefore we may review Sanchez\u2019s ineffective assistance claim on direct appeal. <em>United States v. Headley, </em>923 F.2d 1079, 1083 (3d Cir.1991). To prove ineffectiveness of counsel, Sanchez must establish his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and that this deficiency prejudiced the defense. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). As discussed above counsel\u2019s failure to raise <em>Apprendi </em>was completely reasonable and did not in any way affect the Court\u2019s sentencing decision. We therefore find that Sanchez\u2019s ineffective assistance claim lacks all merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we will grant Sanchez\u2019s counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b245-8\">. Sanchez\u2019s sentence of 210 months is well within the guideline range for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine, which carries a statutory maximum of life imprisonment. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (2002). Sanchez makes the unsupported assertion that he actually pled guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute \u201c50 grams or more\u201d of cocaine, and that the District Court violated <em>Apprendi </em>by finding that he had conspired to possess \"almost 500 kilograms\u201d of cocaine. However, the indictment clearly states that he was charged with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute \"more than <em>five kilograms </em>of cocaine.\u201d The drug amount, type, and statutory maximum of life imprisonment were all confirmed several times during the plea hearing. Furthermore, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Sanchez had pled guilty to possession of 50 grams or more of cocaine, his 210 month sentence is still below the statutory maximum of 20 years imprisonment. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
