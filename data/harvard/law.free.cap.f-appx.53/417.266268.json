We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. Reviewing de novo, see <em>Miles v. Prunty, </em>187 F.3d 1104, 1105 (9th Cir.1999), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>Neel contends that his conviction is unconstitutional because it was based solely on the victim\u2019s, subsequently recanted, trial testimony. The state court in this case found that the victim\u2019s recantation was not credible because it occurred after she was reunited with family members, who were witnesses for petitioner at trial, and because there was physical evidence and additional witness testimony corroborating the victim\u2019s testimony at trial. Because petitioner has not shown that the state court\u2019s determination was incorrect, we conclude that the district court properly denied habeas relief on this claim. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1) (stating that a state court\u2019s determination of a factual issue is presumed correct on habeas review, and a petitioner \u201cshall have the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear an convincing evidence.\u201d); <em>see also Marshall v. Lonberger, </em>459 U.S. 422, 434, 103 S.Ct. 843, 851, 74 L.Ed.2d 646 (1983) (\u201c28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) gives federal habeas courts no license to redetermine credibility of witnesses whose demeanor has been observed by the state trial court, but not by them.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">Neel also contends that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to properly litigate his Cal. Evid.Code \u00a7 782 motion for the admission of evidence to attack the victim\u2019s credibility. Because counsel\u2019s motion and argument in support of the \u00a7 782 motion were not outside the wide range of reasonable assistance, the district court properly determined that counsel\u2019s performance was not deficient. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984) (deciding that a petitioner demonstrates his counsel was ineffective by establishing that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and that the deficient performance prejudiced his defense).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-11\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b451-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b452-5\">.
