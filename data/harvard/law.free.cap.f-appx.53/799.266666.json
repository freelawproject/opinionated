We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-22\">Viewed in the light most favorable to Snow, the record reveals the following facts. In 1990, Snow contracted with the New Subiaco Abbey to cut timber and thin its nearby pine forest. In 1997, Ahne, who is Snow\u2019s brother-in-law and an employee of the Arkansas Forestry Commission, advised the Abbey that Snow was \u201ccheating\u201d the Abbey, and furthermore, that no further timber needed to be cut. The Abbey subsequently cancelled its contract with Snow, and one week later, employed another worker to cut timber from its forest.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-23\">Snow brought this civil rights action against Ahne and his supervisor, Shannon, alleging a violation of substantive due process as a result of the \u201cintentional interference with contract.\u201d The district court found that Snow sought only to vindicate his state claim for tortious interference with contract, and he could not avail himself of federal constitutional principles to accomplish this. <em>Regents of the Univ. of Mich. v. Ewing, </em>474 U.S. 214, 229, 106 S.Ct. 507, 88 L.Ed.2d 523 (1985) (Powell, J., concurring) (substantive due process rights created only by the Constitution); <em>Meis v. Gunter, </em>906 F.2d 364, 369 (8th Cir.1990) (violation of state law, without more, does not create substantive due process right). Based upon this finding, the district court granted the motion for summary judgment, and dismissed the pendant state law claims without prejudice. We agree with this result.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir.
