Appellant argued that the district court should have read his complaint more liberally and questioned the district court\u2019s conclusions as to <em>res judicata.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-17\">The lower court appears to have dismissed plaintiff-appellant\u2019s claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8 (\u201cRule 8\u201d). Rule 8 requires that a complaint contain a \u201cshort and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2). Under the liberal pleading standards of Rule 8, \u201ca plaintiff must disclose sufficient information to permit the defendant \u2018to have a fair understanding of what the plaintiff is complaining about and to know whether there is a legal basis for recovery.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kittay v. Kornstein, </em>230 F.3d 531, 541 (2d Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Ricciuti v. New York City Transit Auth., </em>941 F.2d 119, 123 (2d Cir.1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-18\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s dismissal under Rule 8 for abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>In general, when a district court dismisses a complaint under Rule 8, the plaintiff should be given leave to amend. <em>See Salahuddin v. Cuomo, </em>861 F.2d 40, 42 (2d Cir.1988). However, dismissal without leave to amend is proper in \u201cextraordinary circumstances, such as where leave to amend has previously been given and the successive pleadings remain prolix and unintelligible\u201d. <em>Id. </em>Lee was afforded several opportunities in prior cases to amend his complaint to comply with Rule 8. Given its prior familiarity with the case, we cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>conclude that the district court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
