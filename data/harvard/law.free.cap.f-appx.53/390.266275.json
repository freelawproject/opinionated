Specifically, Crenshaw contends the district court <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> abused its discretion when it included a condition of supervised release that prohibits Crenshaw from associating with members of the Rolling 60\u2019s Crips gang or any other gang. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>270 F.3d 632, 633 (8th Cir. 2001) (standard of review). Although Crenshaw had yet to be tried for a gang-related murder of a four-year-old girl when he was sentenced for the drug violation in this case, Crenshaw was later convicted of murder in aid of racketeering activity, a federal crime which carries a mandatory minimum sentence of life imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1959(a)(1) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-16\">Although the parties dispute whether Crenshaw\u2019s appeal is moot, we believe Crenshaw\u2019s claim is premature. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Thomas, </em>198 F.3d 1063, 1065 (8th Cir.1999). If Crenshaw\u2019s murder conviction is affirmed on appeal and he serves the life sentence required by law, he will never be subject to the condition of supervised release he challenges in this appeal. On the other hand, if Crenshaw\u2019s conviction is reversed or his life sentence is commuted, Crenshaw can challenge the terms of his supervised release before that release begins. <em>Id.; </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(2) (2000) (The court \u201cmay modify, reduce, or enlarge the conditions of supervised release, at any time prior to the expiration or termination of the term of supervised release\u201d); Fed. R.Crim. Proc. 32.1(c) (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-20\">We thus decline to consider the challenged condition of supervised release and affirm Crenshaw\u2019s sentence. The government\u2019s motion to supplement the record on appeal is granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b424-17\"> The Honorable James M. Rosenbaum, United States District Judge for the District of Minnesota.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
