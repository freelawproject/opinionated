The sole question on appeal is whether the district court adduced a sufficient factual basis for the firearms plea, pursuant to Rule 11(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">\u201cRule 11(f) requires the court to assure itself simply that the conduct to which the defendant admits is in fact an offense under the statutory provision under which he is pleading guilty.\u201d <em>United States v. Maher, </em>108 F.3d 1513, 1524 (2d Cir.1997). \u201cRequiring this examination of the relation between the law and the acts the defendant admits having committed is designed to \u2018protect a defendant who is in the position of pleading voluntarily with an understanding of the nature of the charge but without realizing that his conduct does not actually fall within the charge.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. (quoting McCarthy v. United States, </em>394 U.S. 459, 467, 89 S.Ct. 1166, 22 L.Ed.2d 418 (1969)). To obtain a conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c), it is sufficient for the government to establish that the defendant knowingly (a) possessed a firearm (b) in furtherance of a drug crime. <em>See United States v. Finley, </em>245 F.3d 199, 203 (2d Cir.2001). The \u201cin furtherance\u201d condition \u201cmay be satisfied by a showing of some nexus between the firearm and the drug selling operation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Having reviewed the defendant\u2019s testimony at sentencing, we have no doubt that it reveals both knowing possession and the requisite nexus. The defendant\u2019s conduct falls within the charge to which he pled guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">We have considered all of the appellant\u2019s ' arguments and have found them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
