On appeal, Andershonis argues that the district court should not have granted summary judgment because (1) Local 38\u2019s complaint was not filed within one year of the arbitration award; (2) Local 38 did not have an agreement with Andershonis; (3) Local 38 failed to file timely grievances; and (4) Local 38 failed to sue the proper defendant. We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b184-22\">Andershonis\u2019s first argument fails because the present lawsuit is to collect on two 1998 default judgments from the Southern District of New York that confirmed the two arbitration awards for Local 38; it is not a suit to confirm the arbitration awards themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-23\">Andershonis\u2019s second and third arguments fail because Andershonis lost his right to contest the arbitration award on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>the basis of either the existence of an agreement or the timeliness of the filing of grievances when he failed to challenge the award within the 90-day statute of limitations period borrowed from New York State law. <em>See Local 802, Assoc. Musicians of Greater N.Y. v. Parker Meridien Hotel, </em>145 F.3d 85, 88 (2d Cir.1998) (holding that under \u00a7 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act the appropriate statute of limitations in New York is the 90-day period of N.Y. C.P.L.R. 7511(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Finally, Andershonis appears to renew his argument before the district court that there is a material issue of fact regarding whether Total Kitchen Services, Inc. and Total Kitchen Services are a single employer. We disagree. First, Andershonis does not claim that he was not on notice of any of the actions. Second, we agree with the district court that, in this circumstance, Andershonis cannot escape his debt to Local 38 simply because Local 38 added \u201cInc.\u201d to the name Total Kitchen Services in its pleadings before the arbitration panel and in its first action in district court to confirm the arbitration award. <em>See Datskow v. Teledyne, Inc. Continental Prods. Div., </em>899 F.2d 1298, 1301-02 (2d Cir.1990) (holding that plaintiffs\u2019 complaint sufficiently alerted defendant that it was being sued, even though complaint identified defendant as \u201cTeledyne Inc.\u201d rather than \u201cTeledyne Industries, Inc.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
