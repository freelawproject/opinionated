OPM determined that Caseja had never served in a position that was subject to the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and denied his application for a retirement annuity. Caseja appealed to the Board. In the initial decision, the administrative judge sustained OPM\u2019s decision, determining that Caseja was not entitled to a CSRS annuity because his service was pursuant to an excepted indefinite appointment. After the initial decision became the final decision of the Board, Caseja petitioned this court for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Caseja argues in his response that his case differs from <em>R\u00f3sete </em>because his employment was \u201cconverted\u201d into covered service by the 1956 CSRA. Caseja further asserts that Executive Order 10,180 does not apply to foreign nationals employed in their home country. We conclude that these and Caseja\u2019s remaining arguments fall within the holdings of <em>R\u00f3sete </em>and <em>Casilang.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Summary disposition \u201cis appropriate, <em>inter alia, </em>when the position of one party is so clearly correct as a matter of law that no substantial question regarding the outcome of the appeal exists.\u201d <em>Joshua v. United States, </em>17 F.3d 378, 380 (Fed.Cir. 1994) . The Board correctly concluded that Caseja\u2019s service was in a nonpermanent, indefinite appointment that was specifically excluded from coverage under the Civil Service Retirement Act. <em>See </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7 831.201(a)(13); <em>Rosete v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>48 F.3d 514 (Fed.Cir. 1995) ; <em>Casilang v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>248 F.3d 1381, 1383 (Fed. Cir.2001). The Board also noted that CSRS retirement deductions were never withheld from Caseja\u2019s salary and that all of the SF-50s documenting Caseja\u2019s service specified either that he was not covered by a retirement plan or that he was covered by a plan other than the CSRS. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8334(a); <em>Rosete v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>48 F.3d at 519-520. Because we agree with the Board that Caseja was not entitled to CSRS benefits and no substantial question is presented in this petition for review, summary disposition is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-10\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b586-11\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b586-12\">(1) The Board\u2019s decision is summarily affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-13\">(2) Caseja\u2019s motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-14\">(3) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
