(\u201cUNC\u201d) and UNC Pacific Airmotive Corporation (\u201cUNC-PAC\u201d) (collectively \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) appeal the district court\u2019s grant of judgment on the pleadings in favor of Century Indemnity Company, the Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company, the Travelers Indemnity Company, the Travelers Casualty and Surety Company, Allstate Insurance Company, and North-brook Insurance (collectively \u201cInsurers\u201d).

City of Irvine, </em>143 F.3d 1196, 1200 (9th Cir.1998). A judgment on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>pleadings is properly granted when, taking all the allegations in the pleadings as true, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">This diversity case is governed by California law. Under California law, insurance policies do not cover damages that occur to companies that are acquired by an insured after the policy has expired. <em>Armstrong World Indus., Inc., v, Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>45 Cal.App.4th 1, 52 Cal. Rptr.2d 690 (Cal.Ct.App.1996); <em>Cooper Cos., Inc. v. Transcontinental Ins. Co., </em>31 Cal.App.4th 1094, 37 Cal.Rptr.2d 508 (Cal. Ct.App.1995). Here, all of the Insurers\u2019 polices expired prior to UNC\u2019s acquisition of UNC-PAC. UNC\u2019s liability for UNC-PAC\u2019s actions and property are derived solely as a result of its acquisition of the latter. Accordingly, coverage was properly denied under the Insurers\u2019 policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b846-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
