We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Reviewing de novo, <em>see United States v. Walgren, </em>885 F.2d 1417, 1420 (9th Cir.1989), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">Zavalidroga contends that the district court erred in denying his writ for coram nobis as time-barred under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, because he has never attacked his conviction pursuant to a \u00a7 2255 motion in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">In this case, Zavalidroga raises the same claims he previously raised in a time-barred writ of mandamus while he was in federal custody.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because Zavalidroga may not now circumvent \u00a7 2255\u2019s statute of limitations by filing a writ of coram nobis, the district court properly denied the instant writ. <em>Matus-Leva v. United States, </em>287 F.3d 758, 761 (9th Cir.) (stating that a \u201cpetitioner may not resort to <em>coram nobis </em>merely because he has failed to meet the AEDPA\u2019s gatekeeping requirements.\u201d), cer<em>t. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 123 S.Ct. 544, 154 L.Ed.2d 431 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">To the extent Zavalidroga alleges that he did not file a timely petition because he relied on his appellate counsel\u2019s promise to file a \u00a7 2255 motion on his behalf, this claim fails. <em>See Pennsylvania v. Finley, </em>481 U.S. 551, 555, 107 S.Ct. 1990, 95 L.Ed.2d 539 (1987) (recognizing that a prisoner does not have a constitutional right to counsel on collateral review); see also <em>Wainwright v. Torna, </em>455 U.S. 586, 587-588, 102 S.Ct. 1300, 71 L.Ed.2d 475 (1982) (per curiam) (deciding that a prisoner could not be deprived of effective assistance of counsel during a proceeding where there is no constitutional right to counsel).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b446-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b446-23\">. <em>United States v.
