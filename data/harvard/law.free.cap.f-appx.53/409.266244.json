We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-18\">Rose\u2019s contention that the evidence was insufficient to establish his identity lacks merit because reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, <em>see Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979), we conclude that a reasonable fact finder could have found him to be the perpetrator. Despite some discrepancy over Rose\u2019s appearance, several witnesses identified Rose as being responsible for the oil discharge, and as being in charge of the ship. <em>See United States v. Garza, </em>980 F.2d 546, 552 (9th Cir.1992) (applying assumption that the fact-finder resolved credibility and evidentiary conflicts in a maimer that supports the verdict).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-22\">We decline to reach on direct appeal Rose\u2019s contention that trial counsel was ineffective. <em>See United States v. Robinson, </em>967 F.2d 287, 290 (9th Cir.1992) (stating that ineffective assistance of counsel is more properly raised on collateral attack under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 unless the record is sufficient or there is an obvious denial of adequate representation).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b443-33\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
