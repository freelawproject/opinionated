We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">(1) The Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) found that Petitioner had been present in the United States since 1991 only and, accordingly, that she lacked the ten years of continuous physical presence necessary to qualify for cancellation of removal. The IJ also concluded that Petitioner\u2019s child, who is her sole qualifying relative, would not suffer \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(D) if forced to move to Mexico. There is ample record evidence to support both of these findings. The BIA noted these findings and expressly agreed with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">(2) \u201cA fundamental and long-standing principle of judicial restraint requires that courts avoid reaching constitutional questions in advance of the necessity of deciding them.\u201d <em>Lying v. Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Assoc., </em>485 U.S. 439, 445, 108 S.Ct. 1319, 99 L.Ed.2d 534 (1988). In accordance with that principle, we decline to address Petitioner\u2019s contention that the \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d standard of \u00a7 1229b is unconstitutionally vague. Both ten years of continuous physical presence and exceptional and extremely unusual hardship are required to warrant cancellation of removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(1). We would thus be required to deny the petition for review even if the challenged standard in \u00a7 1229b violated the Due Process Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-17\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b478-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
