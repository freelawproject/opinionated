The petition was denied on the ground that it was not filed within the one-year limitations period specified in \u00a7 2244(b)(1)(A). On appeal, Bond contends that the limitations period should have been equitably tolled for a period of 281 days because his attorney allegedly told him that the filing of a Freedom of Information Law request would toll the one-year period, and because his attorney allegedly had control of his case files.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-19\">On the issues reached by the district court, we find no error. However, the district court\u2019s opinion did not consider the equitable tolling issue, likely because it was raised in a footnote. As Bond was acting <em>pro se, </em>we read his pleadings liberally, and conclude that the issue, though easily missed, was sufficiently raised. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>order to allow the district court to determine the issue in the first instance, we remand. We intimate no view on the merits, if any.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
