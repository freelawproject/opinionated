We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">A. <em>Rule 401 Objection</em></p>\n<p id=\"b882-8\">Because the parties are familiar with the facts, we do not recite them here. Breslin\u2019s testimony was relevant because it made it less probable that Leon-Gil was on his way to work the morning he crossed the Mexico-United States border driving a vehicle that did not contain a lunch or work tools.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Leon-Gil told the border officials that he was on his way to work, giving himself an alternate purpose for crossing the border, other than for drug trafficking. He also testified that he would not have driven the car over the border if he would have known that the vehicle contained drugs. This placed directly at issue whether Leon-Gil was aware there were drugs in the vehicle he was driving and hence in fact on his way to work. Breslin\u2019s testimony had a tendency to prove that Leon-Gil was not on his way to work, inferentially saying that Leon-Gil was intentionally trafficking drugs. Thus, his testimony is relevant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b882-17\">B. <em>Rule 403 Objection</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ab4\">The probative value of Breslin\u2019s testimony was not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He testified to his direct observations that field workers usually carry a lunch or work tools and that the vehicle Leon-Gil was driving contained no similar items. This evidence could be helpful to the jury because jurors may not understand the usual customs and practices of field workers. The evidence is probative because it tends to disprove Leon-Gil\u2019s testimony that he was going to work.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The fact that Leon-Gil was harmed by Breslin\u2019s testimony is not sufficient to show that he was unfairly prejudiced, and Leon-Gil points to no other prejudice.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b882-18\">Breslin\u2019s testimony was not equivalent to drug courier profile testimony that we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>have disallowed as substantive evidence of guilty. A drug courier profile is \u201ca somewhat informal compilation of characteristics believed to be typical of persons unlawfully carrying narcotics.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201c[D]rug courier profiles are inherently prejudicial because of the potential they have for including innocent citizens as profiled drug couriers ... every defendant has a right to be tried based on the evidence, ... not on the techniques utilized by law enforcement officials in investigating criminal activity\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">In contrast, Breslin\u2019s testimony neither imputed criminal motives to otherwise innocent activity, nor did it constitute his opinion of what a criminal looks like. It merely recounted his own experience of the tools and necessities commonly carried by field workers passing into the United States, It was clear from the opening statements that Leon-Gil\u2019s defense would be that he was an innocent field worker unaware of the drugs in his vehicle. Under these circumstances, the Government was entitled to introduce evidence to counter this theory. Therefore, the probative value of Breslin\u2019s testimony outweighed any potential for unfair prejudice. Accordingly, Breslin\u2019s testimony was admissible under Rule 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-13\">C. <em>Breslin Not an Expert Witness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b883-14\">Breslin was a proper lay witness, not an expert witness.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> More specifically, Breslin was a percipient fact witness because he testified to his own common observations.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> He observed, firsthand, that Leon-Gil\u2019s vehicle did not have any lunches or work tools in it.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Additionally, his observations of other field workers\u2019 vehicles was also based on firsthand knowledge. Breslin\u2019s testimony required no \u201cscientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge\u201d that required the Government to qualify Breslin as an expert.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accordingly, Breslin was not an expert witness. Because Breslin provided proper Rule 701 lay opinion testimony, the district court did not commit error, much less plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b882-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b882-11\">.
