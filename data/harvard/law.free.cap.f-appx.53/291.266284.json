Richardson, whom this court has previously found to be disqualified from proceeding in forma pauperis, renews on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>appeal his contention that he should be excused from paying the full filing fee because his complaint alleged \u201can imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g). The district court found Richardson\u2019s complaint did not state such a danger, however, and we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Reviewing Richardson\u2019s complaint, only his allegation that prison officials denied him medication for his elevated cholesterol levels could possibly satisfy the imminent danger exception to \u00a7 1915(g). Although \u00a7 1915(g) should not be read to interfere with inmates\u2019 ability \u201cto complain about \u2018unsafe, life-threatening condition[s] in their prison\u2019 without waiting for something to happen to them,\u201d <em>Gibbs v. Cross, </em>160 F.3d 962, 966 (3d Cir.1998) (quoting <em>Helling v. McKinney, </em>509 U.S. 25, 34, 113 S.Ct. 2475, 125 L.Ed.2d 22 (1993)), Richardson failed to demonstrate his elevated cholesterol levels were necessarily dangerous or that medication was a medical necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the dismissal of Richardson\u2019s complaint without prejudice because he failed to pay the full filing fee or demonstrate an imminent danger of serious physical injury. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
