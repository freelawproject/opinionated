In this appeal, he argues that the district court erred by finding that he engaged in more than minimal planning, and, therefore, applying a two point offense level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(4)(A).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-21\">Application Note 1(f) to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1 sets forth the applicable definition of \u201cmore than minimal planning.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, Application Note 1. It reads, in pertinent part: \u201c \u2018More than minimal planning\u2019 means more planning than is typical for commission of the offense in a simple form.... \u2018More than minimal planning\u2019 is deemed present in any case involving repeated acts over a period of time, unless it is clear that each instance was purely opportune.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-22\">Overton asserts that he did not have the mental capacity to engage in more than minimal planning because he was suffering from untreated Bipolar Disorder and methamphetamine addiction. He cites the report of Dr. John P. Berberich, his evaluating psychologist, in support of his claim. However, although Dr. Berberich observes, generally, that such conditions can undermine an individual\u2019s judgment and reasoning ability, he ultimately concludes that Overton was able to plan crimes and carry them out. Moreover, items discovered during searches of Overton\u2019s resi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>dence<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> reflect a level of planning that was more than minimal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b496-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b496-25\">. The district court applied the November 2000 edition of the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b497-19\">. Law enforcement officers discovered stolen mail, checks, and personal information bearing names other than Overton's, as well as a computer. They suspected that Overton was engaging in forgery and counterfeiting, and that Overton was using the computer to store fraudulent information to facilitate the commission of financial crimes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b497-20\">. Overton also contends that, even though he was found to be in possession of stolen mail and arrested on two occasions in less than a year, the district court should have found that \"each instance was purely opportune.\u201d Since we conclude the record demonstrates that Overton was capable of, and did, engage in more than minimal planning, we need not address this claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
