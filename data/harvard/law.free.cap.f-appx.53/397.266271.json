The district court sentenced Noriega-Sanchez to 120 months imprisonment, the statutory minimum, and 5 years supervised release. His counsel has moved to withdraw and has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising for reversal that Noriega-Sanchez\u2019s sentence is too severe. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-15\">Initially, we note that Noriega-Sanchez stipulated to a drug quantity that triggered the imposition of the statutory minimum sentence. <em>See United States v. Nguyen, </em>46 F.3d 781, 783 (8th Cir.1995) (defendant who explicitly and voluntarily exposes himself to specific sentence may not challenge that punishment on appeal). In any event, Noriega-Sanchez\u2019s severity argument fails, because mandatory minimum penalties for drug offenses do not violate the Eighth Amendment. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>988 F.2d 859 (8th Cir.1993) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-16\">Having found no nonfrivolous issues following our independent review of the record in accordance with <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. We further deny Noriega-Sanchez\u2019s motion for appointment of new counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-17\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b431-32\">. The Honorable Richard G. Kopf, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the District of Nebraska.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
