Defendant raised this argument in his opposition to the PSR. <em>See </em>Letter from Ephraim Savitt, Counsel for Joel Schwartz, to Andrew M. Jingeleski, United States Probation Officer 4 (October 3, 2000); J.A. 77-83. However, Schwartz withdrew all objections raised in the October 3, 2000 letter to Probation Officer Jingeleski, after the government reconsidered its support for downward adjustments based on acceptance of responsibility and the safety valve. Here, the defendant\u2019s withdrawal of objections constitutes waiver of the issue on appeal. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Caba, </em>955 F.2d 182, 187 (2d Cir. 1992) (holding defendant\u2019s failure to raise objections to the quantity of heroin in the presentence report before or during the sentencing proceedings, constituted a waiver of the issue on appeal). The District Court\u2019s holding on defendant\u2019s base offense level is supported by the record and conforms to the sentencing requirements for the 180,000 tablets of Ecstasy for which defendant was responsible pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(a)(3). <em>Id. </em>at Application Note 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-10\">Schwartz was granted two points of credit for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a). The District Court concluded that Schwartz was not entitled to a third point for early acceptance of responsibility for his post-arrest cooperation pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b), because (1) he did not provide the assistance that agents requested and was not truthful about his criminal history; and (2) defendant delayed entering his plea until the eve of trial. <em>See United States v. Cox, </em>299 F.3d 143, 148 (2d Cir. 2002) (holding that \u201c[t]he sentencing court\u2019s evaluation of defendant\u2019s aecep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>tance is entitled to great deference, and we will review factual findings for clear error.\u201d) The District Court\u2019s decision is amply supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Substantially for the reasons stated by the District Court, we hereby AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b212-6\">. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) provides that \u201cit shall be unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally ... to ... distribute ... or possess with intent to ... distribute, ... a controlled substance.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 states in relevant part that \u201d[a]ny person who attempts or conspires to commit any offense defined in this subchapter shall be subject to the same penalties as those prescribed for the offense, the commission of which was the object of the attempt or conspiracy.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b212-7\">.
