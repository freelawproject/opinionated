On appeal, counsel has moved to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and has filed a brief arguing that Smith should not have received a 2-level dangerous-weapon enhancement because it was clearly improbable that the weapon Smith possessed was connected with the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-17\">We find that the 2-level enhancement was not erroneous, as it is undisputed that Smith possessed a loaded handgun during the drug transaction underlying his offense. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment. (n.3) (adjustment should be applied if weapon was present unless clearly improbable it was connected with offense); <em>United States v. Cave, </em>293 F.3d 1077, 1079 (8th Cir.2002) (district court\u2019s factual determinations leading to enhancement are reviewed for clear error and legal conclusions are reviewed de novo); <em>United States v. Fladten, </em>230 F.3d 1083, 1086 (8th Cir. 2000) (per curiam) (government need not show defendant used or even touched weapon to show connection; court\u2019s finding that defendant transported gun to house, along with drugs and drug paraphernalia, supported 2-level enhancement).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-21\">Following our independent review, <em>see Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed. We also grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-22\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b832-18\">. The Honorable Fernando J.
