Maree-Bey, a federal prisoner, appeals the district court\u2019s order dismissing without prejudice his petition filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (2000). We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>See MareeBey v. Nash, </em>No. CA-02-2584-CCB (D. Md. filed Sept. 10, 2002 <em>&amp; </em>entered Sept. 11, 2002). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b275-17\"> Maree-Bey suggests in his informal brief to this court that he is unable to complete administrative exhaustion of his claim because he has been paroled from custody. However, the applicable regulations apply \"to former inmates for issues that arose during their confinement.\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 542.10(b) (2002). Therefore, Maree-Bey must complete the exhaustion process before pursuing his claim in federal court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
