The district court sentenced Blankenship to thirty-seven months\u2019 imprisonment, and she noted a timely appeal. On appeal, Blankenship\u2019s attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but asserting that the district court erred in denying Blankenship a reduction in her offense level for being a minimal or minor participant as defined by <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3B1.2 (2000). Blankenship was informed of her right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has not filed a brief. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-11\">We review a district court\u2019s determination regarding the defendant\u2019s role in an offense for clear error. <em>United States v. Daughtrey, </em>874 F.2d 213, 218 (4th Cir. 1989). A defendant may play a minor role if she is less culpable than most other participants but has more than a minimal role. USSG \u00a7 3B1.2 comment, (n.3). However, the court should not only compare the defendant\u2019s culpability to that of the other participants, but also measure it against the elements of the offense of conviction. <em>United States v. Reavis, </em>48 F.3d 763, 769 (4th Cir.1995). \u201cThe critical inquiry is not ... whether the defendant has done fewer \u2018bad acts\u2019 than her codefendants, but whether the defendant\u2019s conduct is material or essential to committing the offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Palinkas, </em>938 F.2d 456, 460 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-13\">Here, the district court found that Blankenship played an active part in obtaining and selling the prescription drugs. That finding is amply supported by the record. Therefore, we conclude the district court did not commit clear error in refusing to find Blankenship was a minor or minimal participant in the offense. Accordingly, we affirm Blankenship\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-14\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have independently reviewed the entire record and all pertinent documents. We have considered all possible issues presented by this record and conclude that there are no non-frivolous grounds for this appeal. Pursuant to the plan adopted by the Fourth Circuit Judicial Council in implementation of the Criminal Justice Act of 1964, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A (2000), this court requires that counsel inform her client, in writing, of her right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If requested by the client to do so, counsel should prepare a timely petition for writ of certiorari, unless counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous. In that case, counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
