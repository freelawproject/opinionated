We review the district court\u2019s decision to revoke bail for clear error. <em>See U.S. v. Chimurenga, </em>760 F.2d 400, 405 (2d Cir. 1985). Although there is some disagreement about the sentencing exposure defendant faces following his acquittal on two counts at trial, even if defendant\u2019s calculations are correct, the amount of incarceration defendant faces is not insubstantial, thus providing support to the district court\u2019s conclusion that defendant had not shown that he was not a risk of flight following his conviction. Further, there was evidence before the district court demonstrating defendant\u2019s continued engagement in fraudulent activities following a conviction in 1991 for wire fraud, his reincarceration for violation of the terms of his supervised release, and even after he was arrested and released on bail for the current charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-21\">Accordingly, there is ample support for the district court\u2019s determination that Bunn had not shown by clear and convincing evidence that he was not a risk of flight or a danger to the community, despite his claim that his medical condition reduces the risk of flight and the danger <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>he poses. The motion to vacate the district court\u2019s bail order is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
