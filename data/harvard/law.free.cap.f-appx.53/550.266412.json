Estupito moves for leave to proceed in forma pauperis. The Office of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>Personnel Management (OPM) moves for summary affirmance of the decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board. Estupito opposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Estupito was employed by the United States Department of the Navy in the Philippines from 1945 to 1987. OPM determined that Estupito had never served in a position that was subject to the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and denied his application for a retirement annuity. Estupito appealed to the Board. In the initial decision, the administrative judge sustained OPM\u2019s decision, determining that Estupito was not entitled to a CSRS annuity because his service was pursuant to an excepted indefinite appointment. After the initial decision became the final decision of the Board, Estupito petitioned this court for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Summary disposition \u201cis appropriate, <em>inter alia, </em>when the position of one party is so clearly correct as a matter of law that no substantial question regarding the outcome of the appeal exists.\u201d <em>Joshua v. United States, </em>17 F.3d 378, 380 (Fed.Cir. 1994) . The Board correctly concluded that Estupito\u2019s service was in a nonpermanent, indefinite appointment that was specifically excluded from coverage under the Civil Service Retirement Act. <em>See </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7 831.201(a)(13); <em>Rosete v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>48 F.3d 514 (Fed.Cir. 1995) ; <em>Casilang v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>248 F.3d 1381, 1383 (Fed. Cir.2001). The Board also noted that CSRS retirement deductions were never withheld from Estupito\u2019s salary and that all of the SF-50s documenting Estupito\u2019s service specified either that he was not covered by a retirement plan or that he was covered by a plan other than the CSRS. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8334(a); <em>Rosete v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>48 F.3d at 519-520. Because we agree with the Board that Estupito was not entitled to CSRS benefits and no substantial question is presented in this petition for review, summary disposition is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b585-11\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b585-12\">(1) Estupito\u2019s motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-13\">(2) OPM\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-14\">(3) Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
