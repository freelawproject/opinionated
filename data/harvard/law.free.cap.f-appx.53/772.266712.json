Maier, Dr. Michael Gibson, and James Walker, in their official capacities, appeal the district court\u2019s denial of their motion to dismiss based on state sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-18\">In <em>Popovich v. Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, </em>276 F.3d 808 (6th Cir. 2002) (en banc), this Court held that state sovereign immunity bars Title II claims against state entities that are based on equal protection discrimination principles. <em>See also Trustees of University of Alabama v. Garrett, </em>531 U.S. 356, 121 S.Ct. 955, 148 L.Ed.2d 866 (2001); <em>Robinson v. University of Akron School of Law, </em>307 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>F.3d 409 (6th Cir.2002); <em>Carten v. Kent State Univ., </em>282 F.3d 391 (6th Cir.2002). Because Parr\u2019s claim is based on such equal protection principles, we REVERSE the district court\u2019s denial of the Appellants\u2019 motion to dismiss and REMAND this case to the district court with instructions to dismiss the claims against Appellants Donald Curry, J. Maier, Dr. Michael Gibson, and James Walker in their official capacities for lack of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b807-7\">. MTSU appealed the denial of summary judgment based on sovereign immunity separately. This Court has reversed and remanded that case as well, in an unpublished opinion. Pa<em>rr v.
