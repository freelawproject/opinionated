R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b473-22\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-23\">George DeUrioste, a California state prisoner, appeals pro se the dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition as untimely. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We review de novo, <em>see Miles v. Prunty, </em>187 F.3d 1104, 1105, (9th Cir. 1999), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-24\">DeUrioste contends that his statute of limitations for filing a federal habeas petition began to run later than April 24, 1996. We reject his contention, and conclude that nothing in the record supports that there was a state impediment that precluded him from filing a timely petition. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2244(d)(1)(B). Further, we reject Petitioner\u2019s contention that, pursuant to \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D), he is entitled to statutory tolling for due diligence in pursuing his research and petitions. <em>See Hasan v. Galaza, </em>254 F.3d 1150, 1154 n. 3 (9th Cir. 2001) (stating that the statute of limitations begins to run when petitioner knows the important facts, not when their legal significance is recognized).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-25\">DeUrioste also contends that he is entitled to equitable tolling for his diligence in the investigation and preparation of his petitions. However, Petitioner has failed to demonstrate extraordinary circumstances beyond his control which prevent<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>ed him from filing a timely petition, <em>see Frye v. Hickman, </em>273 F.3d 1144, 1146 (9th Cir.2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 122 S.Ct. 1913, 152 L.Ed.2d 823 (2002), and equitable tolling is not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Assuming that actual innocence would permit this court to review an untimely petition, DeUrioste has not demonstrated that it was more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have found him guilty. <em>Cf. Gandarela v. Johnson, </em>286 F.3d 1080, 1086 (9th Cir.2002). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s dismissal is AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"ARd\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b474-25\">. We decline to address the issues which fall outside the scope of the certificate of appealability. <em>See Hiivala v. Wood, </em>195 F.3d 1098, 1103 (9th Cir.1999) (per curiam).
