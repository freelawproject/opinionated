He appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his request for a two-level minor role adjustment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-27\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b499-28\">Rangel argues that he is entitled to a minor role adjustment because he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>merely an \u201cunsophisticated middleman\u201d who arranged for the sale of the drugs and who would have received only small compensation for his services. The district court denied the adjustment because Ran-gel \u201cplayed an integral and important role in the sale.\u201d We review for clear error. <em>See United States v. Rosales-Rodriguez, </em>289 F.3d 1106, 1112 (9th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 123 S.Ct. 643, 154 L.Ed.2d 545 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">We conclude there was no error. The district judge carefully explained that while she accepted Rangel\u2019s claims that he lacked sophistication and expected little profit from the transaction, she nevertheless found that his involvement was simply too significant to merit the reduction. The court correctly noted that Rangel initiated contact with the confidential information, engaged in negotiations and final arrangements, was present at the deal, and told the informant that he could obtain additional drugs. These factors support the denial of Rangel\u2019s request for a minor role adjustment. <em>See United States v. Molina, </em>934 F.2d 1440, 1452 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b499-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
