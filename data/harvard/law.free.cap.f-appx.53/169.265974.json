Batts, <em>Judge), </em>which imposed on him 108 months\u2019 imprisonment, five years\u2019 supervised release, and a special assessment of $100, after Cespedes pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute five or more kilograms of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. On appeal, Cespedes contends that the district court erred by denying his motion for a \u201cminor role\u201d adjustment pursuant to \u00a7 3B1.2(b) of the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-20\">A district court\u2019s finding that a defendant was not a minor participant in the offense will not be disturbed on appeal unless clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. Castano, </em>234 F.3d 111, 113 (2d Cir.2000). The defendant bears the burden of establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he was entitled to a minor role adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b204-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>Cespedes grounds his argument on one sentence in the Pre-Sentence Investigation Report, in which he is characterized as a \u201cworker\u201d for the cocaine distribution organization. Defendant-Appellant\u2019s Br. at 6. Yet in the same paragraph, the Report states that Cespedes \u201csold and distributed cocaine and heroin ... [and] collected proceeds of narcotics transactions for the organization.\u201d Pre-Sentence Investigation Report at \u00b6 28. Cespedes did not object to the Report\u2019s findings at the sentencing proceedings, and he has not challenged the Report\u2019s findings on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">Cespedes argues that \u201cother members of the conspiracy were more culpable than Mr. Cespedes.\u201d Defendant-Appellant\u2019s Br. at 7. But as Cespedes acknowledges, <em>id. </em>at 6, a defendant may not receive a minor role adjustment solely because he played a lesser role than his co-conspirators; \u201cto be eligible for a reduction, the defendant\u2019s conduct must [also] be \u2018minor\u2019 ... as compared to the average participant in such a crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Yu, </em>285 F.3d 192, 200 (2d Cir.2002) (quoting <em>United States v. Rahman, </em>189 F.3d 88, 159 (2d Cir.1999)). Because Cespedes sold and distributed narcotics, and collected proceeds from narcotics transactions, the district court found that Cespedes was not a \u201cminor\u201d participant as compared to the average conspirator convicted under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. This finding was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
