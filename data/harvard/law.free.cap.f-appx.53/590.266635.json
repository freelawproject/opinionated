The United States District Court of the Western District of New York (David G. Larimer, <em>Chief Judge) </em>sentenced appellant to a term of imprisonment of 63 months, a supervised release term of 3 years, a f\u00edne of $500, and a special assessment of $100. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-19\">Appellant argues that the district court abused its discretion by admitting evidence pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence (\u201cRule\u201d) 404(b) of appellant\u2019s drug trafficking activities as relevant to appellant\u2019s motive to possess a firearm. This was a proper purpose under Rule 404(b). The district court also properly considered whether the probative value of the evidence outweighed its potential for prejudice. We hold that the district court properly applied the necessary analysis required under Rule 404(b) and <em>Huddleston v. United States, </em>485 U.S. 681, 691-92, 108 S.Ct. 1496, 99 L.Ed.2d 771 (1988), and did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence of appellant\u2019s drug trafficking activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-20\">Appellant further argues that the district court erred by finding that defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>possessed the firearm \u201cin connection with\u201d his commission of a drug offense and, accordingly, awarding him a four point enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5). Reviewing the district court\u2019s findings for clear error, <em>see United States v. Dodge, </em>61 F.3d 142, 146 (2d Cir.1995), we find no error in the district court\u2019s finding. Trial testimony that appellant\u2019s drug trafficking occurred simultaneously with possession of a firearm supports the district court\u2019s ruling. Therefore, we affirm the four point enhancement entered pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
