Ugarte-Salas challenged the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 decision to affirm the denial of discretionary \u00a7 212(c) relief and deny the motion to remand. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-9\">We find there is no merit to UgarteSalas\u2019 argument that the Immigration Judge was without jurisdiction to rule on the merits of his application for \u00a7 212(c) relief. He has not shown that the proceedings improperly denied his application for \u00a7 212(c) relief. In addition, we affirm the district court\u2019s finding that it was without jurisdiction to review the merits of the discretionary denial of 212(c) relief. See <em>Bowrin v. I.N.S., </em>194 F.3d 483, 490 (4th Cir.1999) (\u201cOnly questions of pure law will be considered on \u00a7 2241 habeas review. Review of factual or discretionary issues is prohibited.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b730-10\">We affirm the district court\u2019s order. We grant Ugarte-Salas\u2019 motion to supplement the appendix. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
