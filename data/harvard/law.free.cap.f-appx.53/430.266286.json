Garza appeals pro se the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in his employment discrimination action against the City of Tulare (\u201cthe City\u201d) arising from his rejection for a promotion to a supervisory position. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Wallis v. J.R. Simplot Co., </em>26 F.3d 885, 888 (9th Cir.1994), and may affirm on any ground supported by the record, <em>Steckman v. Hart Brewing, Inc., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>143 F.3d 1293, 1295 (9th Cir.1998). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">The district court correctly granted the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Garza\u2019s claim , of age discrimination in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 621-634, because Garza did not establish a prima facie case of disparate treatment. <em>See Wallis, </em>26 F.3d at 891 (setting forth elements of prima facie case); <em>cf. Lindahl v. Air France, </em>930 F.2d 1434, 1438 (9th Cir.1991) (concluding prima facie case established in failure to promote case where selected candidate was under age 40).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">The district court also properly granted summary judgment on Garza\u2019s state law claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing because the terms of Garza\u2019s employment are governed by statute, not contract. <em>See Kemmerer v. County of Fresno, </em>200 Cal.App.3d 1426, 246 Cal.Rptr. 609, 612-13 (Cal.Ct.App. 1988). Similarly, Garza\u2019s claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress is barred by the exclusive remedies provided under California\u2019s worker\u2019s compensation statute. <em>See </em>Cal. Lab.Code \u00a7 3602(a); <em>Cole v. Fair Oaks Fire Protection Dist., </em>43 Cal.3d 148, 233 Cal.Rptr. 308, 315, 729 P.2d 743 (Cal.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">Finally, we reject Garza\u2019s contentions that he did not understand the rules of procedure and was unable to present his side of the case because he did not have an attorney. <em>See Jacobsen v. Filler, </em>790 F.2d 1362, 1364-67 (9th Cir.1986) (rejecting pro se litigant\u2019s argument that district court had a duty to advise him of measures he should take to oppose defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion). We also deny Garza\u2019s request for appointment of counsel on appeal because he has not demonstrated any exceptional circumstances. <em>See Terrell v. Brewer, </em>935 F.2d 1015, 1017 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b464-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
