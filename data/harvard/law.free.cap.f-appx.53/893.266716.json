R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-23\">Plaintiff Darren Eugene Perkins appeals from the district court\u2019s order dismissing his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 civil rights complaint.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Perkins\u2019 complaint alleges that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>the defendants denied him equal protection and due process, applied an <em>ex post facto </em>law to him, and subjected him to slavery in violation of the Thirteenth Amendment. These claims are based on Perkins\u2019 alleged entitlement to compensation for classes and programs in which he participated while in administrative segregation. In a well-reasoned order, the district court addressed Perkins\u2019 claims and found them to be without merit. It therefore dismissed Perkins\u2019 complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). We review the district court\u2019s dismissal de novo. <em>Perkins v. Kan. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>165 F.3d 803, 806 (10th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">Upon de novo review, after carefully considering the record, Perkins\u2019 brief and other materials, and the applicable law, we have determined that the district court\u2019s dismissal pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) was entirely appropriate. We therefore AFFIRM the judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Kansas, for substantially the same reasons stated in its order of May 7, 2002. We note that our affirmance of the district court\u2019s \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) dismissal means that Perkins now has three strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Jennings v. Natrona County Detention Center Med. Facility, </em>175 F.3d 775, 780 (10th Cir.1999). Perkins\u2019 \u201cMotion to Show Cause\u201d is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b927-8\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b927-24\">. This matter returns to us after a previous remand. In Perkins' prior appeal, we reversed the district court's dismissal of his complaint under the \"three strikes\u201d provision of the in forma pauperis statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), and remanded for further proceedings. <em>See Perkins v. Nelson, </em>No. 01-3111, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>2001 WL 1438537, 22 Fed.Appx. 963 (10th Cir. Nov.15, 2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
