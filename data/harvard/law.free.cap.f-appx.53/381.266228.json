WOOD, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b416-9\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">In 1996 James Gibson pleaded guilty to five counts of distribution of cocaine base, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), and on each count the district court sentenced him to concurrent terms of 80 months\u2019 imprisonment and three years\u2019 supervised release. Gibson finished his prison time and began serving his term of supervised release on January 14, 2002. Six days later he was arrested in Fairview Heights, Illinois for criminal damage to property, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/21-l(a), and for battery, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/12-3(a), after he got into a fight with his ex-girlfriend\u2019s new boyfriend and damaged their car. Following his arrest, Gibson\u2019s probation officer filed a petition recommending that the district court revoke Gibson\u2019s supervised release. Eventually his appointed counsel moved to dismiss the revocation petition because the state charges had been dismissed for want of prosecution. The district court, however, denied the motion and revoked Gibson\u2019s supervised release, sentencing him to 12 months\u2019 incarceration and a new term of 24 months\u2019 supervised release. Gibson filed a notice of appeal, but his appointed counsel now seeks to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), because she is unable to find a nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Pursuant to Circuit Rule 51(b), Gibson was invited to respond to his counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, but he failed to do so. Because counsel\u2019s brief is facially adequate, we limit our review of the record to those potential issues identified in it. <em>See United States v. Tabb, </em>125 F.3d 583, 584 (7th Cir.1997). We agree with counsel that an appeal on the potential issues would be frivolous and therefore grant the motion to withdraw and dismiss Gibson\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-12\">First, counsel considers whether Gibson might argue that the district court erred in determining that Gibson violated the terms of his supervised release, a decision we would review only for an abuse of discretion, <em>see United States v. Dillard, </em>910 F.2d 461, 464 (7th Cir.1990). We would review the court\u2019s factual findings only for clear error. <em>United States v. Branch, </em>195 F.3d 928, 933 (7th Cir.1999). A district court may revoke supervised release if it finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant violated the terms of his release. <em>United States v. Goad, </em>44 F.3d 580, 585 (7th Cir.1995). The district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>heard testimony from Gibson\u2019s ex-girlfriend and the arresting officers that Gibson had been the aggressor in the fight and that he had been hitting the couple\u2019s car. The court credited that testimony, a determination that we afford exceptional deference and would overturn only for clear error, see <em>United States v. White, </em>240 F.3d 656, 661 (7th Cir.2001). The court then found by a preponderance of the evidence that Gibson\u2019s acts constituted the crimes of battery, see 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/12-3(a), and criminal damage to property, see 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/21-l(a), and thus violated the condition of his supervised release that he not commit other federal, state, or local crimes, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(c). We agree with counsel that an appeal on this ground would be frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Counsel next considers whether Gibson could claim error in the district court\u2019s refusal to dismiss the revocation petition after the state charges were dropped for want of prosecution. But a conviction is not required to establish grounds for revocation, <em>United States v. Fleming, </em>9 F.3d 1253, 1254 (7th Cir.1993), so again we agree with counsel that an appeal on this issue would be frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Counsel also considers whether Gibson could contest the new prison term imposed after revocation, a decision that we disturb only if it is plainly unreasonable. <em>United States v. Huusko, </em>275 F.3d 600, 602 (7th Cir.2001). In this case the court concluded that Gibson\u2019s conduct constituted a Grade C violation of his supervised release, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.1(a)(3), and that he had a criminal history category of VI, thus correctly setting his guideline range between 8-14 months, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4. The court considered the factors outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1) and set Gibson\u2019s new prison term at 12 months. As Gibson\u2019s sentence is within the applicable range, we agree with counsel that an appeal on this ground would be frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">Finally, counsel considers whether Gibson <em>might </em>assert that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel at the revocation proceedings. During his original prosecution Gibson moved to discharge his appointed counsel, claiming that she had a conflict of interest because, in his opinion, she assumed he was guilty. Counsel responded that she perceived no actual conflict of interest; although her office had represented a government informant who provided information about Gibson, her office sought to withdraw from the other case when the conflict became evident. Ultimately Gibson retained private counsel, so the conflict question was never definitively resolved. Later, when his original attorney was appointed to represent him for the revocation proceeding, Gibson did not object. Counsel correctly notes that in order to prevail on an ineffective assistance claim based on a conflict of interest, Gibson would need to show that his attorney suffered from an actual conflict of interest that adversely affected the adequacy of her representation. <em>Mickens v. Taylor, </em>535 U.S. 162, 122 S.Ct. 1237, 1245, 152 L.Ed.2d 291 (2002). Counsel on appeal, who works in a different office from Gibson\u2019s trial attorney, points out that it would be frivolous to assert an ineffective assistance claim on this record because it contains no evidence that Gibson\u2019s appointed counsel provided inadequate representation during the revocation proceedings. And if there is evidence outside of the record to support the argument, it would need to be raised in a collateral attack in which the record could be developed, not on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Pergler, </em>233 F.3d 1005, 1009 (7th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
