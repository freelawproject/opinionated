R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">Defendant Norman Preciado-Quinonez was convicted on several cocaine trafficking charges and sentenced to a total of 360 months\u2019 imprisonment in 1992. His conviction and sentences were affirmed on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Preciado, </em>No. 92-6371, 1993 WL 430336 (10th Cir. Oct. 26, 1993), <em>cert. denied, </em>510 U.S. 1137, 114 S.Ct. 1117, 127 L.Ed.2d 427 (1994). Over five years later, he filed a \u201cMotion to Dismiss Indictment,\u201d arguing that his indictment had not alleged the full quantity of cocaine later attributed to him, that he had not received the prior notice required by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 for drug-recidivist enhancement, and that his counsel had been constitutionally ineffective for failing to pursue these issues. The district court construed this pleading as a motion to vacate, set aside or correct sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, and denied it as time-barred by the one-year limitations provision included in the statute. <em>See United States v. Simmonds, </em>111 F.3d 737, 746 (10th Cir.1997) (pursuant to paragraph six of \u00a7 2255, federal \u201cprisoners whose convictions became final on or before April 24, 1996, must file their \u00a7 2255 motions before April 24, 1997\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Defendant requests a certificate of appealability (COA) to secure review of the district court\u2019s denial of his motion. He notes, in particular, that his objection regarding the indictment\u2019s specification of drug quantities has since been bolstered by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). For the reasons that follow, we deny defendant\u2019s request for a COA and, accordingly, dismiss the appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c) (\u201cappeal may not be taken\u201d without COA).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-11\">In <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000), the Supreme Court held that \u201cwhen the district court denies a habeas petition on procedural grounds without reaching the prisoner\u2019s underlying constitutional claim,\u201d to obtain a COA the prisoner must show \u201cthat jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and ... whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 484. Because we dispose of defendant\u2019s COA application on the basis of the latter, procedural issue, we need not reach the merits of the substantive claims stated in defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-12\">We have repeatedly held that a motion to dismiss an indictment, pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(2), must be filed before final judgment; after that time a pleading challenging the adequacy of an indictment is properly deemed a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Nelson, </em>No. 02-3056, 2002 WL 31243873, at *2, 48 Fed.Appx. 308 (10th Cir. Oct. 7, 2002) (unpub.); <em>United States v. Sather, </em>No. 01-7083, 2002 WL 1045986, at *1 41 Fed.Appx. 336 (10th Cir. May 24, 2002) (unpub.); <em>United States v. Stewart, </em>No. 01-5045, 2001 WL 913783, at *2,18 Fed.Appx. 684 (10th Cir. Aug. 14, 2001) (unpub.); <em>cf. Marteney v. United States, </em>216 F.2d 760, 761-62 (10th Cir.1954) (\u201csee[ing] no impropriety in the [district] court\u2019s treatment of the pleadings [seeking arrest of judgment on the ground that the indictment failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>charge a federal offense] as motions to vacate under Section 2255\u201d). Accordingly, the district court correctly held defendant\u2019s motion was subject to the one-year limitation period in \u00a7 2255, despite its nominal designation as a motion to dismiss the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">The remaining question is whether any of defendant\u2019s claims fall within one of \u00a7 2255\u2019s favorable accrual provisions, which delay commencement of the limitation period beyond the final judgment date. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2255 par. six, subsecs. (2)-(4). As neither government impediments to filing nor newly discovered facts are involved, the only alternate accrual date we are concerned with is \u201cthe date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court, <em>if </em>that right has been <em>newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.\u201d Id., </em>subsec. (3) (emphasis added). One of defendant\u2019s claims implicates this provision-his objection to the discrepancy between the drug quantities in the indictment and those supporting his sentence involves the right recently recognized in <em>Apprendi. </em>However, the requisite retroactivity of that right was clearly rejected in <em>United States v. Mora, </em>293 F.3d 1213, 1219 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 123 S.Ct. 388, 154 L.Ed.2d 315 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">Finally, \u201cthis case does not present extraordinary circumstances such that defendant should receive the benefit of equitable tolling.\u201d <em>United States v. Willis, </em>202 F.3d 1279, 1281 n. 3 (10th Cir.2000). In particular, the ineffectiveness claim, time-barred itself, could not in any event be advanced as a ground for equitable tolling of the <em>Apprendi </em>claim, because \u201can ineffective assistance argument premised on counsel\u2019s failure to anticipate <em>Apprendi </em>would be untenable.\u201d <em>Valenzuela v. United States, </em>261 F.3d 694, 700 (7th Cir.2001) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">The appeal is DISMISSED. Defendant\u2019s motion for leave to proceed on appeal without prepayment of costs or fees is granted, and his motion regarding the status of his appeal is denied as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b40-14\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
