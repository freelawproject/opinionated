Sabo, a South Dakota resident, appeals the district court\u2019s adverse grant of summary judgment in this diversity-based insurance coverage case. While Sabo was insured by Geico General Insurance Company (Geico), the car she was driving was involved in an accident that injured her husband, a passenger in the car. Sabo\u2019s husband sued her in state court for injuries related to the accident. Geico filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court, arguing it did not have a duty to defend or indemnify Sabo in the underlying lawsuit because Sabo\u2019s policy did not cover bodily injury to a relative residing in her household. We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>See Equipment Mfrs. Inst. v. Janklow, </em>300 F.3d 842, 849 (8th Cir.2002) (standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">Geico\u2019s duties to indemnify and defend Sabo are independent and severable duties. <em>See Stoebner v. South Dakota Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., </em>598 N.W.2d 557, 559 (S.D.1999). On appeal, Sabo argues her policy does not excuse Geico from its duties to indemnify her or to defend her against her husband\u2019s claims. The relevant portion of the policy, Section I, explains Geico\u2019s liability and creates the duties to defend and indemnify:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aei\">EXCLUSIONS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-9\">When Section I Does Not Apply</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMb\">We will not defend any suit for damage if one or more of the exclusions listed below applies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-10\">1. <em>Bodily injury </em>to any <em>insured </em>or any <em>relative </em>of an <em>insured </em>residing in [her] household is not covered in excess of the minimum coverages required by the Financial Responsibility Law of the State of South Dakota.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-13\">(Emphasis in original). South Dakota\u2019s Financial Responsibility Law sets the minimum coverage amount for \u201cbodily injury ... or death of one person in any one accident\u201d at $25,000. S.D.C.L. \u00a7 32-35-70 (2002). This statute also states a \u201cpolicy <em>may </em>exclude or limit coverage ... for a relative residing in the named insured\u2019s household.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). We conclude this statute permits but does not require Geico to exclude Sabo\u2019s husband <em>from </em>coverage under Sabo\u2019s policy. <em>See Douville v. Christensen, </em>641 N.W.2d 651, 654 (S.D.2002) (interpreting statutory provisions according to their plain meaning and effect); <em>see also Employers Mut. Cas. Co., Inc. v. State Auto Ins., </em>623 N.W.2d 462, 465 (S.D.2001) (discussing legislative intent to allow exclusion of family members from insurance policies under S.D.C.L. \u00a7 32-35-70). The extent to which Sabo\u2019s husband is covered under her policy thus depends on the language of that policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-14\">As written, Sabo\u2019s policy limits bodily injury coverage for Sabo and relatives living in her household to the minimum coverage amounts set by South Dakota law. Because the policy does not completely exclude Sabo\u2019s relatives from coverage, Geico must indemnify Sabo for her husband\u2019s accident-related injuries up to $25,000. Additionally, because Geico must indemnify Sabo, the enumerated exception to Geico\u2019s duty to defend is not triggered and Geico must defend Sabo against her husband\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-15\">For the reasons stated above, we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
