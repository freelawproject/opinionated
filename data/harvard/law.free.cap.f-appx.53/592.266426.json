Khezrie appeals from the district court\u2019s March 26, 2002 grant of summary judgment against Khezrie\u2019s reformation claim and in favor of Greenberg\u2019s counterclaim for rents due with an award of $579,200, plus $95,760 in accumulated interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">Summary judgment should be granted only if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). We review a \u201cdistrict court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d <em>VKK Corp. v. Nat\u2019l Football League, </em>244 F.3d 114, 118 (2d Cir. 2001). Nevertheless, review of summary judgment \u201cnecessarily implicates the substantive evidentiary standard of proof that would apply at the trial on the merits.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 </em>U.S. 242, 252, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-11\">Khezrie seeks to have the lease reformed to incorporate an oral agreement allegedly entered into by the parties prior to signing the lease and in the absence of Khezrie\u2019s counsel. The alleged agreement provided that Khezrie would be released from personal liability if he assigned the lease to a corporation of which he owned one third. New York law allows contracts to be reformed in cases of mutual mistake or fraud. <em>See Chimart Assocs. v. Paul, </em>66 N.Y.2d 570, 498 N.Y.S.2d 344, 489 N.E.2d 231, 233 (N.Y.1986); <em>Brandwein v. Provident Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>3 N.Y.2d 491, 168 N.Y.S.2d 964, 146 N.E.2d 693, 695 (N.Y. 1957). To compensate for the danger of false oral contract claims where written contracts exist, however, New York law establishes a \u201c \u2018heavy presumption that a deliberately prepared and executed written instrument manifests the true intention <em>of the </em>parties,\u2019 and a correspondingly high order of evidence is required to overcome that presumption.\u201d <em>Chimart </em>Assocs., 498 N.Y.S.2d 344, 489 N.E.2d at 234 (citations omitted). To overcome this presumption against reformation, a party must offer \u201cclear, positive and convincing evidence.\u201d <em>Amend v. Hurley, </em>293 N.Y. 587, 59 N.E.2d 416, 419 (N.Y.1944). When the parties have clearly agreed on a provision in writing, a party\u2019s \u201cself-serving and conclusory testimony to the contrary that is unsupported by the evidence is insufficient to raise an issue of fact to defeat summary judgment.\u201d <em>U.S. Russia Inv. Fund v. Neal &amp; Co., Inc., </em>No. 97 Civ. 1788, 1998 WL 557606, at <em>*7 </em>(S.D.N.Y. Sept. 2, 1998) (citing <em>Kulak v. City of New York, </em>88 F.3d 63, 71 (2d Cir.1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-13\">Khezrie\u2019s evidence is neither clear nor convincing. First, in his answer to Green-berg\u2019s state-court petition, he did not suggest as a defense that there had been any mistake or fraud. Rather, he waited almost one year to move to amend his answer to include this defense. In fact, Khezrie first offered specific facts to support his allegation more than four years after litigation began. Second, the only other person corroborating his allegation is his son James, and again Khezrie offers this evidence dubiously late. Third, Khezrie has submitted contradictory affidavits. While Khezrie suggested in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>March 9, 1998 affidavit that his attorney Aaron Feinberg would testify about the oral agreement and the mutual mistake, Feinberg did not testify, and Feinberg\u2019s earlier affidavit omitted any mention of an oral agreement. Khezrie now states that his counsel was \u201cnot present at the signing\u201d of the lease. However, his earlier affidavit swore that the attorney who \u201crepresented [him] at the time the Lease was signed\u201d would testify about the oral agreement, and Feinberg stated in his affidavit that he \u201crepresented Joseph Khezrie in the execution of the lease.\u201d At the very least, these affidavits establish that Khezrie was highly counseled throughout the negotiations, undermining his fraud claim. <em>See Winmar Co. v. Teachers Ins. and Annuity Ass\u2019n of Am., </em>870 F.Supp. 524, 537-38 (S.D.N.Y.1994) (collecting cases). In sum, his evidence of an oral agreement is too weak to support either his claim of mutual mistake or fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">Khezrie also argues that Greenberg can pursue his claim for rents due only against the assignee GAI, and that the Civil Court\u2019s dismissal of Greenberg\u2019s claim against GAI constitutes a final judgment that bars Greenberg\u2019s claim in federal court. However, New York law permits a landlord to sue an assignor for rents due. \u201c[A]n assignment does not release the assignor of its obligations under the assigned contract, absent an express agreement to that effect or one that can be implied from facts other than the other contracting party\u2019s mere consent to the assignment.\u201d <em>Mandel v. Fischer, </em>205 A.D.2d 375, 613 N.Y.S.2d 381, 382 (App.Div.1994) (citation omitted); <em>see also 185 Madison Assocs. v. Ryan, </em>174 A.D.2d 461, 571 N.Y.S.2d 244, 245 (App.Div.1991); 74A N.Y.Jur.2d Landlord and Tenant \u00a7 767 (1999) (\u201c[T]he lessee\u2019s continued liability on his or her express covenant to pay rent is not affected by the fact that he or she assigned the leasehold with the express consent of the lessor, or that the lessor accepted the rent from the assignee.\u201d) (footnote omitted). Where a tenant assigns his lease, the landlord may \u201cat his election\u201d sue either the tenant-assignor or the assignee for rent due. <em>Ayen v. Schmidt, </em>80 Misc. 670, 141 N.Y.S. 938, 940 (App.Div.1913). The district court correctly granted summary judgment in favor of Greenberg on the claims and counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
