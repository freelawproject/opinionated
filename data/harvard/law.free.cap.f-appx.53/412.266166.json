We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">DeJarnette relied on 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(2) for his motion contending that his sentence was incorrectly calculated because four of his prior convictions should have been treated as two. The district court properly ruled that \u00a7 3742 does not provide authority for such a motion. The district court also properly rejected the motion as an untimely Rule 35(c) motion, <em>see United States v. Barragan-Mendoza, </em>174 F.3d 1024, 1030 (9th Cir.1999) (discussing seven-day time limit).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-11\">Moreover, we enforce DeJarnette\u2019s plea agreement\u2019s waiver of appeal and collateral attack, foreclosing each of his contentions. <em>See United States v. Aguilar-Muniz, </em>156 F.3d 974, 976 (9th Cir.1998). He received a sentence consistent with the Rule 11(e)(1)(C) agreement, and there is no evidence that the waiver of the right to appeal was not knowing or voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b447-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
