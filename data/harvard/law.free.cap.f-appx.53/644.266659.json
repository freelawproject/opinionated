He was sentenced to 210 months imprisonment, five years of supervised release, and a $1000 fine. Faulk appeals his conviction and sentence. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-23\">Faulk raises four arguments on appeal: 1) the prosecutor improperly cross-examined a defense witness about a pri- or conviction; 2) the prosecutor improperly advised the jury that the defendant was incarcerated; 3) 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) is an unconstitutional exercise of Congress\u2019s Commerce Clause powers; and 4) the District Court erroneously instructed the jury on the Commerce Clause element of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). We will discuss each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">A prosecutor may use evidence of a prior conviction to attack the credibility of a witness. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 609(a). Because of the potentially prejudicial effect of this information, however, the Government generally may not elicit the specific circumstances and details of the conviction. <em>See United States v. Swanson, </em>9 F.3d 1354, 1357 (8th Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Roenigk, </em>810 F.2d 809, 814-15 (8th Cir. 1987). Accordingly, permissible questioning typically is limited to the number of convictions, and the nature, time, and date of each. <em>See </em>McComick on Evidence \u00a7 42 at 167 (John W. Strong ed., 5th ed. 1999)</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Faulk argues that the prosecutor improperly elicited details of a defense witness\u2019s past conviction. During the Government\u2019s case-in-ehief, two Philadelphia police officers testified that on September 25, 1999, they responded to a radio call of drug sales at a particular intersection but, upon arrival, found no one there. The officers left, but came back a half-hour later and saw Faulk and another male. They pulled up to speak with Faulk, who began to walk away. One officer stepped out of the patrol car and called out to Faulk, who ran into a park. Both officers pursued Faulk on foot and saw him toss a handgun into a trash can as he ran past. The officers apprehended Faulk and found in his pocket a loaded magazine that fit the gun they retrieved from the trash can.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">In his defense at trial, Faulk called a friend, Mikhail Elam, to testify that he witnessed the officers\u2019 chase of the defendant and did not see Faulk throw anything. On direct examination, Faulk\u2019s counsel asked Elam if he had ever been convicted of any crime. Elam answered that he had \u2014 for possession of crack cocaine. On cross-examination, the prosecutor asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-8\">Q: You have a prior conviction, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-9\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-10\">Q: And, that\u2019s for dealing crack cocaine?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-11\">A: No, that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-12\">MR. YERMISH [Defense counsel]: Objection, Your Honor. It\u2019s not the testimony, it\u2019s for possession.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-13\">THE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-14\">MR. RESNICOFF [Prosecutor]: I stand corrected then.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-16\">Q: Let me ask you. What\u2019s your conviction for?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-17\">A: Possession.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-18\">Q: Possession of crack?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-19\">A: Not selling crack.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-20\">Q: Not selling it. How much crack did you have?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-21\">A: I think it was seven grams.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-22\">Q: Seven grams of crack?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-23\">A: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-24\">Q: Seven grams of crack?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-25\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-26\">Q: Okay. And, that was all for personal use?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-27\">A: I\u2019d rather not say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-28\">Q: I\u2019m sorry, but you\u2019re going to\u2014 you\u2019re compelled to say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-29\">MR. YERMISH: Your Honor,\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-30\">THE COURT: Objection sustained. You don\u2019t have to \u2014 why it is that you \u2014 anything you say could be used against you and you have a right to refuse to answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-32\">Q: Are you exercising your Fifth Amendment right not to testify right now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-33\">A: I\u2019m not sure what you said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-34\">THE COURT: Oh, come on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-35\">MR. YERMISH: Your Honor,\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-36\">THE COURT: Let\u2019s go to sidebar.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-37\">App. at 175-76. At sidebar, defense counsel argued that, under Federal Rule of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>Evidence 609(a), only the fact that the witness had been convicted was admissible. The prosecutor argued that if Elam\u2019s prior conviction was for possession of crack cocaine, and it was for personal use, this line of questioning was appropriate to determine the witness\u2019s ability to perceive the events of the night in question. The Court instructed that the prosecutor may ask Elam only if he was under the influence of drugs that evening. After questioning continued, the prosecutor inquired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-4\">Q: Okay. Was that the first time that\u2014 and the only time that you have been convicted of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-5\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-6\">Q: possessing drugs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-7\">A: Yes,\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-8\">Q: Was that the first time\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-9\">A: convicted of anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-10\">Q: you ever possessed crack cocaine?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Avc\">MR. YERMISH: Objection, Your Hon- or.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-11\">THE COURT: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-12\">Q: On the night in question, September 25, 1999, had you used crack cocaine?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AY9\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-13\">Q: You had never used it before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-14\">MR. YERMISH: Objection, Your Hon- or.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-15\">THE COURT: He didn\u2019t say that. On that night was the question. And, the question (sic) was he said no, he had not used it that night.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-16\">App. at 179. The prosecutor proceeded to a different subject, and did not refer to the witness\u2019s drug use in closing argument. Thus, the Government contends this is a simple evidentiary issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-18\">We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision to admit evidence under Rule 609(a). <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>302 F.3d 139, 152 (3d Cir.2002) (citing <em>United States v. Jacobs, </em>44 F.3d 1219, 1224-25 (3d Cir.1995)). Faulk, however, does not directly challenge the admissibility of Elam\u2019s prior conviction. Rather, he argues that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks while questioning Elam about his prior conviction constituted prejudicial misconduct. If so, our standard of review remains the same; we review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision not to grant a mistrial on the grounds that the prosecutor made improper remarks. <em>See United States v. Molina-Guevara, </em>96 F.3d 698, 703 (3d Cir.1996). And if error is found, we apply harmless error analysis. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b680-19\">Faulk cannot demonstrate that his trial was prejudiced by the prosecutor\u2019s questioning of Elam. The record does reflect that the prosecutor sought to inquire about more than the basic facts of Elam\u2019s prior conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Most difficult for Faulk is that his counsel objected four times to the prosecutor\u2019s questions, and each time the District Court ruled in the defendant\u2019s favor and limited the scope of the prosecutor\u2019s inquiry. The only arguably improper detail of Elam\u2019s conviction elicited by the prosecutor was the amount of crack cocaine he was convicted of possessing (seven grams). This isolated reference is not enough for us to find that the District Court abused its discretion in addressing the prosecutor\u2019s remarks, especially when all the defendant\u2019s objections were sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Faulk\u2019s next argument also involves the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination of Elam. More specifically, while questioning Elam the prosecutor disclosed to the jury that Faulk was incarcerated. This may, in certain circumstances, violate a defendant\u2019s due process right to a fair trial. For example, in <em>Estelle v. Williams, </em>425 U.S. 501, 512-13, 96 S.Ct. 1691, 48 L.Ed.2d 126 (1976), the Supreme Court held that a defendant\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment rights are violated if compelled to stand trial before a jury while dressed in identifiable prison clothes. <em>See also Gaito v. Brierley, </em>485 F.2d 86, 88-89 (3d Cir.1973). The Supreme Court emphasized that \u201cthe constant reminder\u201d to the jury over the course of a trial that the defendant is a prisoner may impair the presumption of innocence. <em>Estelle, </em>425 U.S. at 504.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Here, the prosecutor, while cross-examining Elam, made five references, in very short order, to Faulk\u2019s incarceration. The prosecutor asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-7\">Q: When\u2019s the last time you talked to the defendant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-8\">A: Last time I talked to him. I\u2019m not sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-9\">Q: You don\u2019t remember the last time you talked to him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-10\">A: I guess \u2014 I\u2019m not sure what the last time I talked to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-11\">Q: But, you\u2019ve talked to him while he\u2019s been incarcerated, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-12\">A: I\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-13\">Q: While he\u2019s been in prison?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-14\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-15\">Q: He\u2019s never called you from prison?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AA9\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-16\">Q: You\u2019ve never talked to him on the phone from prison?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-17\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-18\">Q: Did you ever visit him in prison?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-19\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-20\">App. at 180-81. Because Faulk\u2019s counsel did not object to these statements at trial, we review them for plain error.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-21\">Under that standard, \u201cbefore an appellate court can correct an error not raised at trial, there must be (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affect[s] substantial rights. If all three conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-22\"><em>United States v. Vazquez, </em>271 F.3d 93, 99 (3d Cir.2001) (en banc) (quoting <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 465-66, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-23\">The Government concedes that the prosecutor\u2019s references to Faulk\u2019s imprisonment were ill-advised, but counters that they were not plain error. We agree. As an initial matter, the Government offers a benign explanation for its actions. Faulk did not disclose Mikhail Elam as a witness before trial, and the Government had taped prison phone conversations between Faulk and a man named Mark Elam discussing his potential testimony about Faulk\u2019s flight and arrest. At trial, the prosecutor first asked Elam whether he used any other names. He replied that he was also known as Mickey, but not Mark. It was reasonable for the prosecutor to attempt to determine if Mikhail Elam was also the Mark Elam on the prison tape recordings, but the Government could and should have done so without mentioning that Faulk was incarcerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-24\">Ultimately, however, we find that the prosecutor\u2019s brief (albeit repeated) mention of Faulk\u2019s imprisonment in a single short series of questions did not serve as a \u201cconstant reminder\u201d to the jury of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>defendant\u2019s condition so as to impair the presumption of his innocence. Other courts have noted that \u201cthe mere utterance of the word [jail, prison, or arrest] does not, without regard to context or circumstances, constitute reversible error <em>per se. </em>\u201d <em>United States v. Villabona-Garnica, </em>63 F.3d 1051, 1058 (11th Cir.1995) (quoting <em>United States v. Barcenas, </em>498 F.2d 1110, 1113 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 1036, 95 S.Ct. 521, 42 L.Ed.2d 312 (1974)). The physical and testimonial evidence of Faulk\u2019s guilt was strong. The prosecutor\u2019s statements on this point were improper, but did not rise to the level of a plain error that seriously affected the fairness of Faulk\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Faulk\u2019s final two arguments implicate Congress\u2019s Commerce Clause powers. He contends that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) is unconstitutional because the conduct it proscribes, the purely intrastate possession of a firearm by a felon, does not have a substantial effect upon interstate commerce, and that the District Court\u2019s jury instruction on this element of the offense was erroneous. He also acknowledges that both challenges are foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Singletary, </em>268 F.3d 196 (3d Cir.2001), but he raises these issues to preserve the claims for review in the event of a subsequent change in the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">In conclusion, the prosecutor\u2019s questioning of Faulk\u2019s defense witness did not constitute reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b680-17\">. The Government argues on appeal that the District Court should not have limited its questioning of Elam's drug use to only whether the witness was under the influence of drugs the night of Faulk\u2019s arrest. We decline to address this issue as it is not necessary to resolve Faulk\u2019s appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
