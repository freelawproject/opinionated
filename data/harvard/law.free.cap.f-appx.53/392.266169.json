At sentencing, the district court <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> denied Ortega-Ibarra\u2019s motion for a downward departure based on cultural assimilation and sentenced him to 70 months imprisonment and three years supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-17\">On appeal, Ortega-Ibarra\u2019s counsel has filed a brief and moved to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Counsel contends the district court abused its discretion in denying the downward-departure motion. We conclude the ruling is unreviewable because the district court acknowledged it had discretion to depart. <em>See United States v. Correa, </em>167 F.3d 414, 417 (8th Cir.1999). On independent review of the record under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we affirm. We also grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b426-18\"> The Honorable Robert W.
