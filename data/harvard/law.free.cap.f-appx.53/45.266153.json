R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-16\">Claimant Marvin Jones appeals from an order of the district court affirming the Commissioner of the Social Security Administration denying disability benefits. Because we conclude that substantial evidence supports the Commissioner\u2019s decision, and because that decision was reached in accord with relevant legal standards, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-17\">Mr. Jones filed his application for disability insurance benefits in 1993, alleging inability to work due to pain in his back, legs and right shoulder, carpal tunnel syndrome in both hands, and vision and mental problems. That application was denied initially and on reconsideration. After a hearing in 1994, an administrative law judge (ALJ) found Mr. Jones was not entitled to benefits. In 1995, the Appeals Council granted a remand based on Mr. Jones\u2019s submission of new evidence of his disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-18\">Following a second administrative hearing in 1996, a new ALJ issued her decision denying disability benefits to Mr. Jones. In that decision, the ALJ found that Mr. Jones suffered from diabetes mellitus, degenerative disc disease, and dysthymia and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>aru\u00e1ety, secondary to a substance abuse disorder. The ALJ found that Mr. Jones\u2019s capacity to work was limited to light and medium jobs that require only limited use of judgment, occasional and superficial contact with others, and occasional stooping and crouching. The ALJ concluded that despite these limitations, Mr. Jones was capable of performing his past relevant work as an automobile assembly worker and as a cleaner. Thus, the ALJ found that Mr. Jones was not disabled at step four of the Commissioner\u2019s five-step process for determining disability. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(e). The burden of proving a prima facie case of disability at steps one through four is borne by the claimant. <em>See Williams v. Bowen, </em>844 F.2d 748, 751 (10th Cir.1988). The district court affirmed the denial of benefits, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">We review the Commissioner\u2019s decision to determine whether the relevant findings are supported by substantial evidence in light of the entire record, and to determine whether the Commissioner applied the correct legal standards. <em>Hargis v. Sullivan, </em>945 F.2d 1482, 1486 (10th Cir.1991). \u201cSubstantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cEvidence is insubstantial if it is overwhelmingly contradicted by other evidence.\u201d <em>O\u2019Dell v. Shalala, </em>44 F.3d 855, 858 (10th Cir. 1994). In the course of this review, we may \u201cneither reweigh the evidence nor substitute our judgment for that of the [Commissioner].\u201d <em>Casias v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>933 F.2d 799, 800 (10th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Although he has been represented by counsel at various times throughout this proceeding, Mr. Jones is appealing this matter <em>pro se. </em>Due to his <em>pro se </em>status, we have read Mr. Jones\u2019s brief on appeal with tolerance, affording Mr. Jones a great deal of leniency in articulating his arguments of error. Nevertheless, Mr. Jones\u2019s obvious dissatisfaction with the outcome of his administrative proceeding does not persuade us that the Commissioner erred in making her determination. With the benefit of counsel, Mr. Jones raised a number of claims before the district court, which were thoroughly reviewed and found meritless. Our repetition of the legal and factual analysis of that court at this time would be unproductive and superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">We note only that Mr. Jones\u2019s reliance on separate disability determinations by the Oklahoma Workers\u2019 Compensation Court and the Veteran\u2019s Administration as a basis for his social security claim is unhelpful to his appeal. Just as the former determinations did not preclude Mr. Jones from attempting to obtain disability benefits from the Commissioner, neither did they compel the Commissioner to automatically grant those benefits. Simply put, the workers\u2019 compensation and veterans administration proceedings are entirely different and separate .from a claim under the Social Security Act, with different parties, different evidentiary standards, and different bodies of law governing their outcomes. <em>Compare </em>Okla. Stat. tit. 85, \u00a7 22 (schedule of disability compensation under Oklahoma Workers\u2019 Compensation Act), <em>and </em>38 C.F.R. \u00a7 4 (Department of Veterans Affairs schedule for rating disabilities), <em>mth </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404, subpt. P (social security regulations for determining disability and blindness). While disability determinations by other agencies should be considered, <em>see Baca v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Services, 5 </em>F.3d 476, 480 (10th Cir.1993), they are not binding on the Commissioner, <em>see </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1504.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">We have carefully reviewed the appellate record and we agree with the district court that substantial evidence supports <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that although limited, Mr. Jones is not disabled within the meaning of the Social Security Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, for substantially the same reasons set forth in the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation dated September 28, 2001, and the district court\u2019s order dated February 1, 2002, the judgment of that court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b80-11\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b82-12\">. This court received the administrative record on appeal on May 31, 2002. We have reviewed appellee's supplemental appendix and note that it is a duplication of the record already on file. Therefore, appellee\u2019s motion , for leave to file a supplemental appendix is denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
