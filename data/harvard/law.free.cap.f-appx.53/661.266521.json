The District Court, after reviewing their original complaint, characterized it as \u201crambling\u201d and replete with \u201ctypographical and grammatical errors\u201d and expressed frustration with its inability cogently to articulate its apparent claims. The court then granted the defense\u2019s motions to dismiss many claims without prejudice pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) and to strike the remainder of the claims for failure to comply with Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a), which requires \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d Plaintiffs were invited to file an amended complaint in compliance with Rule 8(a). The amended complaint incorporated the entirety of the original complaint, included additional contentions highlighting some aspects of its allegations, and repeated claims that had already been dismissed. The District Court then dismissed the amended complaint for failing to comply with Rule 8(a) and with the terms of the court\u2019s prior order. Appellants now argue that the District Court erred in doing so. Our standard of review \u201c \u2018 \u201cis not whether we would have imposed a more lenient penalty had we been sitting in the trial judge\u2019s place, but whether the trial judge abused his discretion in imposing the penalty he did.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>In re Westinghouse Securities Litig., </em>90 F.3d 696, 702 (3d Cir.1996) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number><em>Westinghouse </em>actually mirrors closely the procedural schema of the instant case. In <em>Westinghouse </em>the District Court urged the plaintiffs to \u201creplead in conformity with the requirements of Rule 8,\u201d threatening a dismissal with prejudice if the plaintiffs failed to do so. 90 F.3d at 703. The plaintiffs declared their \u201cintention to stand on the [original] Complaint,\u201d eliciting the promised dismissal from the District Court. <em>Id. </em>We held: \u201cThe district court expressly warned plaintiffs that failure to replead the remaining claims in compliance with Rule 8 would result in the dismissal of those claims. The dismissal with prejudice that followed plaintiffs\u2019 decision not to amend was not an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 704.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">The same reasoning applies here given the plaintiffs\u2019 deliberate defiance of the District Court. The plaintiffs\u2019 carelessly drafted complaint further reinforces the propriety of the District Court\u2019s decision to dismiss. We have reviewed the amended complaint and the incorporated original and concur with the District Court\u2019s characterization of the documents. The amended complaint clearly lacks \u201cthe simplicity and brevity of statement which [Rule 8] contemplate^].\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 84.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
