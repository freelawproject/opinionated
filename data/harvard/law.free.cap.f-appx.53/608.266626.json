In 1998, the Government took the remaining years of the leasehold by eminent domain. At issue before the District Court was the duration of AT\u2019s leasehold interest in the property condemned by the Government. The District Court granted summary judgment, determining that AT\u2019s leasehold interest expired in 2004. We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">The 1953 lease granted a leasehold interest for seventy-five years, but qualified that interest by permitting the lessor to terminate the lease after fifty and one-half years. In 1984, the Government (through the Department of the Army) entered into Amendment No. 3 to the 1953 Lease with Tobyhanna Village, which extended the term of the Lease for an additional twenty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">The District Court rejected AT\u2019s argument that the 1984 Amendment eliminated the termination clause by the \u201cdoctrine of necessary implication,\u201d and held that the Government retained its right to terminate the lease in 2004. Based on this holding, the parties entered into a stipulation that just compensation for the leasehold (terminating in 2004) amounted to $195,000, and the District Court entered a judgment for AT in that amount.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-13\">Appellant argues that the 1984 Amendment to the lease modified the \u201cright-to-terminate\u201d provision in paragraph 17(b) of the 1953 lease. In particular, Appellant contends that the 1984 Amendment modified the 1953 lease by the \u201cdoctrine of necessary implication,\u201d and cites <em>Barco Urban Renewal Corp. v. Housing Authority of Atlantic City, </em>674 F.2d 1001 (3d Cir.1982). In <em>Barco, </em>however, the contract expressly provided plaintiff with the right of first refusal but failed to identify the period during which the right had to be exercised. The court therefore added a reasonable time period by \u201cnecessary implication.\u201d Here, the parties specifically agreed that the Government had the right to terminate the lease upon sixty days written notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-14\">In summary, AT\u2019s argument is merit-less. The language of \u00a7 17(b) is unambiguous and there is no showing that the retention of the \u201cright-to-terminate\u201d provision after the Amendment was the result of fraud, accident or mutual mistake. Therefore, \u00a7 17(b) on its face was unaffected by the Amendment and cannot be added to, or subtracted from, by parol evidence. Because none of defendant\u2019s theories allow \u00a7 17(b) to be added to, or subtracted from, by parol evidence, we affirm the trial court\u2019s determination that the government has the right to terminate the lease under \u00a7 17(b) as of 2004.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b643-11\">. We have jurisdiction because <em>Verzilli v. Flexon, </em>295 F.3d 421 (3d Cir.2002) does not apply. There was no issue of liability and the only contested issue was the value of the lease. The sole relevant issue in the parties\u2019 stipulation was the amount of damages and the other matters in the stipulation were surplusage. The judgment is thus final under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
