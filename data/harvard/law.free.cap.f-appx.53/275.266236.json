An appeal may not be taken from the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). When, as here, a district court dismisses a \u00a7 2241 petition solely on procedural grounds, a certificate of appealability will not issue unless the petitioner can demonstrate both \u201c(1) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right\u2019 and (2) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 684 (4th Cir.) (quoting <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000)), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 941, 122 S.Ct. 318, 151 L.Ed.2d 237 (2001). We have reviewed the record and conclude for the reasons stated by the district court that McCain has not made the requisite showing. <em>See McCain v. Garrity, </em>No. CA-02-435 (E.D.Va. July 16, 2002). Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. <em>la </em>addition, we grant McCain\u2019s counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-11\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b310-9\"> Because McCain was convicted in a District of Columbia court, he is required to obtain a certificate of appealability in order to proceed with this \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See Madley v.
