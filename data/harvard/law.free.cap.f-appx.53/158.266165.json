Koeltl, <em>Judge), </em>granting defendant-appellee the United States of America\u2019s motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. On appeal, Fier challenged the district court\u2019s ability to find facts in the context of a 12(b)(1) motion and asserted that contrary to the district court\u2019s finding, his disbursement to the Internal Revenue Service, which matched his tax liability to the penny, was a deposit, rather than a payment of that liability. He further asserted that the statute of limitations had not yet run prior to his filing his action.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-12\">When considering a motion pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), district courts may make findings of fact. <em>See Rent Stabilization Ass\u2019n v. Dinkins, </em>5 F.3d 591, 594 (2d Cir.1993). We review district court decisions \u201cto dismiss an action for want of subject matter jurisdiction on a Rule 12(b)(1) motion for clear error with respect to factual findings and de novo with respect to legal conclusions.\u201d <em>Virtual Countries, Inc. v. Republic of South Africa, </em>300 F.3d 230, 235 (2d Cir. 2002). We find no error here, clear or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-13\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED for substantially the same reasons stated by the district court; further, the government\u2019s motion to strike part of the joint appendix is denied as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
