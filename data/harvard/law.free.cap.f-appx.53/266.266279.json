We dismiss the appeal of the district court\u2019s denial of Green\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition for lack of jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>tion because Appellant\u2019s notice of appeal was not timely filed as to that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">The district court\u2019s order denying Green\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition was entered on the docket on April 10, 2001. Appellant\u2019s notice of appeal was filed on April 28, 2002. Because Appellant failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">Green\u2019s notice of appeal is timely, however, as to the district court\u2019s order denying his Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion to reconsider. We review the denial of a Rule 60(b) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>NOW v. Operation Rescue, </em>47 F.3d 667, 669 (4th Cir.1995). Because Green\u2019s motion stated no viable ground for relief under the rule, we find no abuse of discretion. Accordingly, we affirm the ruling of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART AND AFFIRMED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
