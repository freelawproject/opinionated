The district court sentenced Gutierrez-Pantoja to seventy months of imprisonment. The court applied a sixteen-level enhancement because Gutierrez-Pantoja had been previously deported after a conviction in California state court for a \u201cdrug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed exceeded 13 months.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A). Gutierrez-Pantoja argues that his prior conviction under California Health and Safety Code \u00a7 11351.5 is not a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A), and that the district court therefore erred by applying the sixteen-level enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-21\">We apply a two-step analysis when considering whether a prior conviction triggers a federal sentencing enhancement. First, we inquire whether the statutory definition of the prior conviction falls within the conduct described in the sentencing enhancement. <em>United States v. Corona-Sanchez, </em>291 F.3d 1201, 1203 (9th Cir. 2002) (en banc). If so, the enhancement is triggered. Second, if the statute of prior conviction prohibits conduct both within and without the federal sentencing enhancement, we go on to consider whether the enhancement is still applicable because \u201c \u2018documentation or judicially noticeable facts [] clearly establish that the conviction is a predicate conviction for enhancement purposes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1211 (quoting <em>United States v. Rivera-Sanchez, </em>247 F.3d 905, 908 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc)). Documents appropriate for consideration under this second step include \u201cthe charging doc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>uments [,] ... the plea agreement, the transcript of the plea proceeding, [and] the judgment.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Even if we accept Gutierrez-Pantoja\u2019s argument that \u00a7 11351.5 covers both conduct within (\u201cto possess\u201d) and without (\u201cto purchase\u201d) \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A), the judicially noticeable documents clearly establish that Gutierrez-Pantoja was convicted for the <em>possession </em>of cocaine base with intent to sell, not for the <em>purchase </em>of cocaine. The Felony Complaint filed on December 12, 1995, states that \u201cOn or about December 10,1995, in the County of Los Angeles, the crime of POSSESSION FOR SALE OF COCAINE BASE, in violation of HEALTH &amp; SAFETY CODE SECTION 11351.5, a Felony, was committed by CARLOS PANTOJA GUTTIEREZ.\u201d Also, the Abstract of Judgment filed on December 6, 1996, lists the crime of conviction as \u201cPOSS COCN BASE FOR SALE.\u201d That the Abstract of Judgment form provides limited space for describing the crime of conviction is not a basis for disregarding the description used. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>232 F.3d 728, 734 n. 5 (9th Cir .2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Gutierrez-Pantoja\u2019s conviction for \u201cPOSSESSION FOR SALE OF COCAINE BASE\u201d qualifies as a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d triggering the sixteen-level enhancement. The sentence imposed by the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b520-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
