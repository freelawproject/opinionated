This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">On April 9, 2001, following the issuance of a Notice of Right-to-Sue by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) on January 11, 2001, Fulakis filed this action against her former employer, Columbus Public Schools (\u201cCPS\u201d). As best as can be gleaned from the record, it appears that Fulakis was employed by CPS in a secretarial position from April 9, 1999, to December 17, 1999. In her complaint, Fulakis claims that she has been \u201cabused and neglected\u201d and that her \u201cfreedom of speech [has been] totally revoked.\u201d Fulakis claims that she is \u201cintent on resolving hate crimes pertaining to my well contained disability [sic].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Additional facts can be gleaned from Fulakis\u2019s memorandum in opposition to CPS\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings. In particular, Fulakis states that a review of her job performance, which apparently cast her in a negative light, was \u201cneglected and saved until an altercation with another employee provided the ending of my job.\u201d Fulakis further claims that she was \u201cabused by being told that I did not answer the phone.\u201d In addition, Fulakis states that she was made to attend meetings allegedly designed to \u201cabuse me by providing undue stress.\u201d Fulakis also claims that another secretary, who was allegedly absent from work more than Fulakis, was not required to provide supporting medical documentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">With respect to her alleged disability, Fulakis states that one Yvonne Jones \u201cdemanded that I prove my disability on paper with a doctor\u2019s letter stating that I am competent and what medications I am taking.\u201d Fulakis fails to specify the nature of her disability or whether any accommodations were sought. The defendant successfully moved the court for judgment on the pleadings on the grounds that: 1) Fulakis\u2019s claims of \u201cabuse and neglect\u201d are not cognizable; 2) the allegation that her freedom of speech was \u201crevoked,\u201d is wholly conclusory and; 3) she failed to establish a prima facie case for discrimination under the ADA. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">Fulakis has abandoned her appeal by failing to brief the germane issues: whether the district court erred in concluding that: 1) Fulakis\u2019s claims of \u201cabuse and neglect\u201d are not cognizable; 2) the allegation that her freedom of speech was \u201crevoked,\u201d is wholly conclusory and; 3) she failed to establish a prima facie case for discrimination under the ADA. <em>See Thaddeus-X v. Blatter, 175 </em>F.3d 378, 403 n. 18 (6th Cir.1999); <em>Enertech Elec., Inc. v. Mahoning County Comm\u2019rs, </em>85 F.3d 257, 259 (6th Cir.1996) (concerning waiver by failure to brief). Despite this court\u2019s strong preference that claims be adjudicated on their merits, <em>see Jourdan v. Jabe, </em>951 F.2d 108, 110 (6th Cir.1991), and the liberal construction the court accords the briefs of pro se litigants, <em>see Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), pro se parties must still brief the issues advanced \u201cwith some effort at developed argumentation.\u201d <em>United States v. Reed, </em>167 F.3d 984, 993 (6th Cir.1999) (internal quotations and citation omitted). Fulakis's brief ignores the reasons her suit was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">In any event, the district court properly granted judgment on the pleadings in favor of CPS. <em>See Meador v. Cabinet for Human Res., </em>902 F.2d 474, 475 (6th Cir. 1990). Fulakis fails to state any viable claim. Fulakis\u2019s claims of \u201cabuse and neglect\u201d are not cognizable. Further, while Fulakis claims that her freedom of speech was \u201crevoked,\u201d the allegation is wholly conclusory and fails to provide any detail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>that would allow the court to consider the viability of the claim. <em>See Morgan v. Church\u2019s Fried Chicken, </em>829 F.2d 10, 12 (6th Cir.1987). Finally, Fulakis fails to set forth any facts that would demonstrate that she satisfies the definition of \u201cdisabled\u201d for purposes of the ADA. <em>See Sullivan v. River Valley Sch. Dist., </em>197 F.3d 804, 810 (6th Cir.2000). Further, the pleadings are completely devoid of facts that would support a prima facie case for disability discrimination under the statute. <em>See Plant v. Morton Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>212 F.3d 929, 936 (6th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
