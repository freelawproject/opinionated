A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"ADS\">Plaintiffs brought an action in the Superior Court, Chancery Division, seeking (1) to restrain defendant Aiken, a former employee, from performing services for defendant Nopco (a competitor of plaintiffs) for a period of one year, under a provision of the employment contract between plaintiffs and Aiken; (2) to restrain Aiken \u201cfrom divulging any information to the defendant Nopco,\u201d under another provision of the employment contract as well as under Aiken\u2019s \u201cduty of loyalty\u201d to plaintiffs, and to restrain Nopco from receiving or using any such information; and (3) compensatory and punitive damages from Nopco for an alleged unlawful interference with plaintiffs\u2019 contractual relationship with Aiken, and an injunction restraining Nopco from continuing to employ Aiken for a period of one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Defendants moved for \u201csummary judgment dismissing the complaint.\u201d The trial court found that two provisions of the employment contract, one involving a restraint against Aiken\u2019s employment by a competitor for a period of one year, and the second involving a covenant not to reveal information concerning the products manufactured by plaintiffs, were \u201cso broad as to be unreasonable and therefore incapable of enforcement,\u201d and granted summary judgment in favor of both defendants. Plaintiffs then moved to amend their complaint \u201cto assert with more particularity a cause of action based on an implied duty not to disclose trade secrets.\u201d It was claimed by plaintiffs that a cause of action based upon common law principles was included in their original complaint, because the words \u201cand in breach of his duty of loyalty\u201d were mentioned in addition to the charge that Aiken was \u201cin violation of his contract.\u201d On rehearing the trial judge admitted that he had not considered these, words as stating a common law cause of action, but refused to change his determination in favor of defendants, and denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion to amend the complaint. He made it clear, however, that this ruling was not to be taken as involving prejudice to the right of plaintiffs to bring an action, based upon common law princi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>pies, for disclosure of trade secrets. Erom the denial of their motion to amend the complaint, and from the final judgment dismissing the complaint, plaintiffs now appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">Plaintiffs are related New York corporations, duly licensed to do business and having their principal offices in New Jersey. They are engaged in the manufacture and sale of polyester and polyether flexible foam cushioning and insulating materials. As already noted, defendant Nopco is a competitor in this field. Defendant Aiken was employed as a supervisor of the cutting and packaging phase of plaintiffs\u2019 operation from 1953 until April 1959, when he resigned following an injury to his hand at one of plaintiffs\u2019 plants. During this period Aiken was not under an employment contract. Later in 1959 Aiken returned to the employ of plaintiff Hudson Eoam Latex Products, Inc. on a temporary basis. In October of that year Aiken was offered a permanent position provided he signed an employment agreement, and he accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Section <em>I </em>of that employment contract provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-6\">\u201cThe Employee undertakes and agrees that he will not, for a period of one (1) year immediately following the cessation of his employment and severance of his connections with the Employer <em>(i. e.. </em>one year after his employment by the Employer in any capacity whatsoever shall have wholly terminated) enter the services or employ of any person, firm, partnership or corporation engaged in any business similar to that of the Employer, <em>i. e., </em>the manufacture, production and/or sale of polyester, polyether, and polyformal foams and elastomeric products and/or the components or ingredients essential to and/or suitable for the manufacture and production of said products <em>(i. e., </em>diisocyanates, the complementary polyfunctional components catalyst systems and foam regulating additives) nor will said Employee be any wise in any manner (directly or indirectly) associated with any such person, firm, partnership or corporation during such period of one (1) year.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">We are in agreement with the conclusion of the trial court that this provision is so unreasonably broad as to be unenforceable. Contracts which impose restraints upon the right of an employee to work for competitors after terminating employment with the promisee are not, of course, invalid <em>per se. A. Hollander &amp; Son, Inc. v. Imperial Fur Blending Corp., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number><em>2 N. J. </em>235, 248 (1949). See generally, Blake, \u201cEmployee Agreements Not To Compete,\u201d 73 <em>Harv. L. Rev. 625 </em>(1960). But the legitimate interests of an employer against having an individual, whose ofttime highly specialized training was gained at the time and expense of the employer, leave that employer and exercise his thusly acquired skill and perhaps good will for the benefit of a competitor is naturally subject to the competing interests of the employee\u2019s right to work and society\u2019s interest in free competition and trade. The balance is struck thusly: if the contractual prohibition is reasonably necessary for the protection of the employer\u2019s business and at the same time is neither unreasonably restrictive of the rights of the employee with regard to time period or territory, nor prejudicial to the public interest, it will be enforced. <em>A. Hollander </em>&amp; <em>Son, Inc. v. Imperial Fur Blending Corp., </em>supra, 2 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>p. </em>248. See also <em>Wyder v. Milhomme, </em>96 <em>N. J. L. </em>500, 503 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1921); <em>Trenton Potteries Co. v. </em>Oliphant, 58 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>507, 514-15 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1899); <em>Chas. S. Wood &amp; Co. v. </em>Kane, 42 <em>N. J. Super. </em>122, 124 <em>(App. Div. </em>1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">While the time limitation in the instant case\u2014one year\u2014 is no doubt not unreasonable as a matter of law, the lack of any limitation upon the area in which Aiken is forbidden to work during that period is manifestly oppressive, for if enforced it would effectively preclude for an entire year his taking a job in the only field in which he has any special training. Plaintiffs concede, as they must, that this area provision is troublesome; they contend, however, that it should not be held unreasonable as a matter of law. Since plaintiffs do not allege that they do business in every State in this Union and in every foreign country in the world, we are hard put to imagine any set of circumstances under which so broad a restriction in the field of the manufacture and sale of foam products could be deemed reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">Where the territory specified in a post-employment restraint is greater than that to which the business extends, the restriction is unenforceable. <em>Creter v. Creter, 52 N. J. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number><em>Super. </em>197, 201 <em>(App. Div. </em>1958); see also <em>Art Wire &amp; Stamping Co. v. Johnson, </em>7 <em>N. J. Super. </em>173, 179 <em>(App. Div. </em>1950). As stated by Professor Corbin, \u201cthe restriction is deemed excessive <em>ah initio </em>if its limit <em>in either space or time </em>is greater than is necessary for the employer\u2019s protection against \u2018unfair\u2019 competition.\u201d 6A <em>Corbin, Contracts </em>(1962), \u00a7 1394, <em>pp. </em>9A-5. (Emphasis added) The cases of <em>Artistic Porcelain Co. v. Boch, </em>76 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>533, 536\u201437 <em>(Ch. </em>1909), and <em>Voices, Inc. v. Metal Tone Mfg. Co., Inc., </em>119 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>324, 330 <em>(Ch. </em>1936), will not sustain plaintiffs\u2019 position. In the former case an agreement not to compete for five jiuars, without any limitation as to area, was upheld; in the latter, a similar agreement involving \u201cthe United States or its territories\u201d for a period of 18 years was held reasonable. Both involved, however, agreements by sellers of businesses, not employees. The substantial disparity in bargaining positions between a seller and a buyer, and an employee and an employer, is more than sufficient to warrant a heavier reliance on the terms of a contract in the former instance than in the latter. Furthermore, the <em>Creter </em>case, <em>supra, </em>has to a great extent supplanted the authority stated in those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">In <em>Creter </em>the parties (who were brothers) were partners in the business of manufacturing and selling burial vaults. Their partnership agreement included a provision that if either terminated his interest in the business he would not, directly or indirectly, carry on a similar business \u201cwithin the State of New Jersey for a period of five (5) years.\u201d It was held that this provision was unenforceable because the area provision was greater than necessary for the protection of the business, the partnership not having conducted business in all counties in the State. Since the restriction mentioned only the State of New Jersey without designating counties, the court refused to indulge in \u201cselective construction,\u201d <em>i. e., </em>extracting from an area restraint such portions as could be deemed necessary to the protection of the employer\u2019s business, and enforcing just those portions. See <em>Trenton Potteries Co. v. Oliphant, supra, </em>58 <em>N. J. Eq., </em>at <em>pp. </em>517-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>The court in <em>Greter </em>stated that the doctrine of selective construction was appropriate only where the language of the agreement was \u201csuch as to permit a reasonable denomination of more than one area.\u201d Our conclusion to invalidate the covenant quoted above follows <em>a multo fortiori </em>from the <em>Creter </em>opinion. Eirst, plaintiffs\u2019 bargaining position with Aiken was manifestly much stronger than that which may be presumed to have existed between the two brothers in <em>Greter. </em>Second, and more important, the area of restraint in the instant case is immeasurably greater than that in <em>Greter. </em>There being no mention of any area whatever in the restriction, we cannot undertake to prescribe the extent to which the provision in question might be recognized as binding. <em>Cf. </em>13 <em>Rutgers L. Rev. </em>393-96 (1958). The fact that plaintiffs \u201chave sold these foams in many parts of the world, including the continental United States, Canada, Central America, South America, South Africa, Puerto Rico, Hong Kong, Hawaii and Australia,\u201d and have \u201ca world wide patent position,\u201d cannot justify a flat prohibition against Aiken\u2019s working in this field <em>for anyone, anywhere, </em>for one year. Section <em>7 </em>of the employment contract between plaintiffs and Aiken is totally unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Plaintiffs claim that they are entitled to an injunction restraining Aiken from divulging \u201cany information\u201d to Nopco and restraining Nopco from \u201creceiving or using any such information.\u201d Section 2(c) of the employment contract provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-6\">\u201cThe Employee shall at all times (whether during his employment hereunder or thereafter), keep secret and shall not divulge to any other person, firm, partnership or corporation, and any information with respect to the products manufactured by tbe Employer or which the Employer may contemplate manufacturing, or may hereafter manufacture, or with respect to any machinery, equipment, processes, devices, methods, etc., now or hereafter used by the Employer or which it may now or hereafter be entitled to use, nor any other information of whatever kind or nature, obtained by him in the course of employment, nor shall said Employee make any use of such information except for and on behalf of tbe Employer. It is the intention of the parties hereto that this non-disclosure provision shall be given the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>broadest possible construction so as to prevent the Employee from making any disclosure whatever of any information or knowledge reaching him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">There can be no doubt that if construed literally this provision, too, would be totally unenforceable because of its unreasonably broad reach. See <em>Taylor Iron &amp; Steel Co. v. Nichols, </em>73 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>684, 687 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1908). Por under the terms of this agreement Aiken would not only be forbidden from divulging any information learned in the course of his employment for plaintiffs, whether such information be secret or not, but would also be precluded from using any of the know-how he had acquired during his employment for plaintiffs for any other employer. This would be tantamount to prohibiting Aiken from ever using in another job the experience gained in his ten years with plaintiffs. The question is whether this language can be construed so as to render the covenant reasonable with regard to the circumstances of the case. Such an interpretation is preferred over one which would nullify the covenant. <em>Chas. S. Wood &amp; Co. v. Kane, supra, </em>42 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>p. </em>128. We are urged to use this rule of construction so as to render the covenant enforceable, at least to the extent of the common-law duty of loyalty owed by an employee in the position of confidence to his employer. See <em>Sun Dial Corp. v. Rideout, </em>16 <em>N. J. </em>252, 259, affirming 29 <em>N. J. Super. </em>361 <em>(App. Div. </em>1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\"> Although as a general rule we favor that interpretation of contracts which will render the language enforceable, we do not think such an approach is appropriate in the present case. It must be remembered that restrictions such as those included in section 2(c) above often go unchallenged. Employees, believing themselves bound by the restrictions in their employ'ment contracts, no matter how broadly stated, may be intimidated by such language to the extent of forbearing gainful employment in positions which ostensibly fall within the covenant, perhaps thereby allowing their best talents to go unused. Employers should not be permitted to include the broadest possible restrictions in an employment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>contract, thus achieving the greatest possible amount of protection for themselves, to the unreasonable restriction of an employee\u2019s right to use his skills to the best advantage, and then be enabled to enforce so much and so many of the restrictions as can be found by a court to be reasonable under the circumstances. If such were the rule, it would afford employers an unconscionable advantage over their employees. See Blake, <em>supra, </em>73 <em>Harv. L. Rev., </em>at <em>pp. </em>683-4. This nondisclosure provision, even without the clause stating the intention to give it \u201cthe broadest possible construction so as to prevent the Employee from making any disclosure whatever of any information or knowledge reaching him,\u201d is overreaching. The restraints extend so far beyond what the employer can legitimately expect to be protected as to be patently unreasonable. Attempts by this court to distill from the broad generalities contained therein narrower and more meaningful restrictions would constitute no less than a rewriting of the provision. Section <em>2(c) </em>of the employment contract is totally unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Plaintiffs contend that in addition to his contractual obligations Aiken owes them a separate duty, based upon common law principles, not to disclose trade secrets. <em>Cf. Art Wire &amp; Stamping Co. v. Johnson, supra, </em>7 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>p. </em>178; with which compare <em>Sun Dial Corp. v. Rideout, supra, </em>16 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>p. </em>259. They argue that their proposed amendment to the complaint, setting forth a cause of action based upon a common law duty of loyalty, should have been allowed. Although leave to amend pleadings \u201cshall be freely given when justice so requires,\u201d <em>R. R. </em>4:15-1, such matters are normally left within the discretion of the trial court. Here the application for leave to amend was made after the trial judge had rendered his decision in favor of both defendants. Since the judgment against plaintiffs expressly reserves their right of action \u201cfor breach by Meyer C. Aiken of any non-contractual common law duty with respect to trade secrets,\u201d they have suffered no significant prejudice. This being so, we find no reason to interfere with the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>The final count of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint alleges Nopco\u2019s \u201cinterference with the contractual relationship between the plaintiffs and the defendant Meyer C. Aiken.\u201d The affidavits of all the parties indicate clearly that the conduct of Nopeo in dealing with Aiken was in no way tortious.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
