We granted a certificate of appealability with respect to the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-12\">(1) Whether the district court erred in denying Nguyen\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion based on a finding that the \u00a7 2255 motion was untimely?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-13\">(2) Whether the district court erred in denying Nguyen\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion based on a finding that the claims raised in the \u00a7 2255 motion were procedurally defaulted?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-14\">(3) Whether the district court erred, pursuant to <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925, 935-36 (11th Cir.1992) <em>(en banc), </em>by not addressing all of Nguyen\u2019s claims raised in his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-16\">(4)Whether the district court erred when it failed to provide a specific basis for appellate review under <em>Broadwater v. United States, </em>292 F.3d 1302, 1304-05 [1304] (11th Cir.2002)?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b902-17\">For the reasons stated below, we vacate the district court\u2019s order denying Nguyen\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-19\">In 1998, Nguyen was convicted following a jury trial of: (1) operating an interstate racketeering enterprise, in violation of the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(c) (Count 1); (2) conspiring to operate an interstate racketeering enterprise, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(d) (Count 2); and (3) Hobbs Act robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1951(a) and 2 (Count 28). The district court sentenced Nguyen to concurrent life sentences for Counts 1 and 2. We affirmed Nguyen\u2019s convictions on direct appeal, but vacated his sentences. <em>United States v. Nguyen, </em>255 F.3d 1335 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-20\">On remand, the district court resentenced Nguyen to a total term of 720 months\u2019 imprisonment. Nguyen appealed for a second time, and we affirmed his sentences on December 27, 2002. <em>United States v. Nguyen, </em>55 Fed.Appx. 900 (11th Cir.2002). On March 24, 2003, less than 90 days later, Nguyen filed a petition for a writ of <em>certiorari </em>with the United States Supreme Court. The Supreme Court denied Nguyen\u2019s petition for <em>certiorari </em>on May 5, 2003. <em>Nguyen v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 1022, 123 S.Ct. 1951, 155 L.Ed.2d 866 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-21\">Nguyen filed his <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 2255 motion on April 12, 2004. His motion raised a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>total of nine claims, some of which involved substantive issues and some of which were claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. Among other things, Nguyen asserted that his appellate counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to raise the substantive issues presented in his \u00a7 2255 motion on direct appeal. The government moved to dismiss Nguyen\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion, contending that the motion was untimely and that Nguyen\u2019s substantive claims were procedurally defaulted because he failed to raise them on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">The district court denied Nguyen\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion. First, the court concluded that all of Nguyen\u2019s claims were barred by the applicable one-year statute of limitations. Next, the court determined that Nguyen\u2019s substantive claims were procedurally barred because Nguyen had failed to raise those claims on direct appeal, and had not shown cause or prejudice to excuse the procedural default. The court did not elaborate further on the basis for its decision. Nguyen filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment, which the district court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">A district court\u2019s interpretation and application of a statute of limitations is a legal determination that we review <em>de novo. Washington v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 1299, 1300 (11th Cir.2001). The Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d) established a one-year statute of limitations for filing a \u00a7 2255 motion, which begins to run on the latest of four triggering dates, the one relevant to this appeal being \u201cthe date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f)(1). If a prisoner files a petition for a writ of <em>certiorari </em>with the Supreme Court following his direct appeal, his conviction becomes final when the Supreme Court either denies <em>certiorari </em>or issues a decision on the merits. <em>Washington, </em>243 F.3d at 1300-01. Otherwise, the conviction becomes final after the 90-day time period for filing a petition for <em>certiorari </em>expires. <em>Clay v. United States, </em>537 U.S. 522, 532, 123 S.Ct. 1072, 1079, 155 L.Ed.2d 88 (2003); <em>Kaufmann v. United States, </em>282 F.3d 1336, 1339 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-9\">In this case, Nguyen filed a timely petition for certiorari on March 24, 2003. The Supreme Court denied <em>certiorari </em>on May 5, 2003, so Nguyen\u2019s conviction became final on that date. <em>See Washington, </em>243 F.3d at 1300-01. Nguyen filed his \u00a7 2255 motion on April 12, 2004, before the one-year statute of limitations had run. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f). Therefore, the district court erred in concluding that Nguyen\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-11\">\u201cWhen reviewing the district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion, we review findings of fact for clear error and questions of law <em>de novo.\u201d Rhode v. United States, </em>583 F.3d 1289, 1290 (11th Cir.2009). A prisoner who fails to raise an issue on direct appeal is procedurally barred from raising that claim in a \u00a7 2255 motion, absent a showing of cause and prejudice or a fundamental miscarriage of justice. <em>United States v. Nyhuis, </em>211 F.3d 1340, 1344 (11th Cir.2000). A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel may satisfy the cause exception to a procedural bar, but only if the claim has merit. <em>Id. </em>An ineffective assistance claim has merit if \u201cthe arguments the defendant alleges his counsel failed to raise were significant enough to have affected the outcome of his appeal.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b903-12\">In ruling on a \u00a7 2255 motion, the district court must set forth enough analysis to provide a sufficient basis for appellate review. <em>Broadwater, </em>292 F.3d at 1303-04. In a simple case where it is plain from the record that the prisoner is not entitled to any relief, a mere summary denial may be adequate. <em>Id. </em>at 1303. Where, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>there may be some merit to the prisoner\u2019s claims if supported by the record, the district court must set forth findings of fact or conclusions of law explaining why it has rejected those claims. <em>Id. </em>at 1303-04.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">In this case, the district court observed that Nguyen \u201chas failed to establish cause and prejudice,\u201d but the court did not explain how it reached that conclusion. Although Nguyen did not raise his substantive claims on direct appeal, he asserted that he was unable to do so because his appellate counsel provided him with ineffective assistance. If Nguyen\u2019s ineffective assistance claim is meritorious, it would provide cause to excuse the procedural default. <em>See Nyhuis, </em>211 F.3d at 1344. Although Nguyen\u2019s ineffective assistance claim ultimately may be unsuccessful, it does not appear to be completely lacking in merit on its face. It is not clear from the district court\u2019s order whether the court considered Nguyen\u2019s claim that his appellate counsel was ineffective, and, if so, why it concluded that the claim was meritless. Because the record does not provide a sufficient basis to review the district court\u2019s determination that Nguyen had failed to show cause and prejudice, we must vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand for further findings. <em>See Broadwater, </em>292 F.3d at 1303-04.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">As noted above, in considering the district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion, we review questions of law <em>de novo. Rhode, </em>583 F.3d at 1290. In <em>Clisby, </em>we explained that district courts must resolve all claims for relief presented in a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, regardless of whether habeas relief is granted or denied. <em>Clisby, </em>960 F.2d at 935-36. When the district court fails to do so, we \u201cwill vacate the district court\u2019s judgment without prejudice and remand the case for consideration of all remaining claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 938. Although <em>Clisby </em>involved a state prisoner\u2019s application for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, its holding also is applicable to \u00a7 2255 motions filed by federal prisoners. <em>Rhode, </em>583 F.3d at 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">In this case, the district court concluded that all of Nguyen\u2019s claims were untimely, and that his substantive claims were procedurally barred. Because the district court resolved all of the claims raised by Nguyen, no <em>Clisby </em>violation occurred. <em>See Clisby, </em>960 F.2d at 935-36. Nevertheless, as described above, the district court erred in concluding that Nguyen\u2019s claims were untimely, and failed to explain its conclusion that his substantive claims were procedurally defaulted. Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand so that the district court may (1) address the merits of Nguyen\u2019s ineffective assistance claims, and (2) further explain its conclusion that Nguyen cannot show cause or prejudice to excuse the procedural default of his substantive claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
