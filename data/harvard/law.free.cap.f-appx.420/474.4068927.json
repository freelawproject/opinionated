For the first time on appeal, Corser argues that the district court erred in imposing his revocation sentence because the court improperly considered the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A). He asserts that the district court considered the sentencing factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) because it stated that the sentence met the objectives of \u00a7 3553(a). He contends that the district court was precluded from considering the \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors because 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e), the statute gov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>erning the revocation of supervised release, omits them from the list of factors a district court may weigh in making a revocation decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">While Corser objected to the sentence as being procedurally and substantively unreasonable, he did not object to the district court\u2019s alleged consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors in the district court. Because Corser did not raise this issue in the district court, we review the issue for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 259-60 (5th Cir.2009). To show plain error, Corser must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, we have the discretion to correct the error but will do so only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">We need not decide whether the district court erred by considering the \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors or whether the error was clear or obvious because Corser has not shown that the alleged error affected his substantial rights. Although the district court may have implied that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors by stating that the sentence met the objectives of \u00a7 3553(a), the district court did not explicitly rely on the \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors, and it did not mention any of the \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors in its explanation of the sentence. Instead, the only reasons given by the district court were Corser\u2019s continuing drug use, a fact related to the \u00a7 3553(a)(1) factors of the nature of the offense and the characteristics of the defendant that the district court was allowed to consider, and that Corser would receive credit for 302 days that he had already erroneously served. Nothing in the record indicates that the district court increased Corser\u2019s sentence because of the \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors of the seriousness of the offense, the need to promote respect for the law, and the need to administer just punishment for the offense. As Corser has not shown that the alleged error affected his revocation sentence sufficiently to undermine confidence in the outcome, he has not shown that the alleged error affected his substantial rights. <em>See Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d at 262-63. As Corser has not shown that the alleged error has affected his substantial rights, he has not shown that the district court committed plain error. <em>See Puckett, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1429.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b500-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
