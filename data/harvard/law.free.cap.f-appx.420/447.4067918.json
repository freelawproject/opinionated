He contends: the district court erred by departing upwardly from his advisory Sentencing Guidelines sentencing range of 18 to 24 months; and, his sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-17\">Athough, <em>post-Booker, </em>the Guidelines are advisory only, and a sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 50-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, its application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir. 2005). Our court first examines whether the district court committed any significant procedural error. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. (Sides does not contend his sentence is procedurally unreasonable.) We next \u201cconsider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard\u201d. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b473-22\">A district court\u2019s decision to depart from the advisory sentencing range, and the extent of that departure, is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>E.g., United States v. Newsom, </em>508 F.3d 731, 733-34 (5th Cir. 2007) (citation omitted). The district court concluded that Sides\u2019 criminal-history category substantially under-represented the seriousness of his criminal history, the likelihood that he would recidivate, and the need to protect the public. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(l) (\u201cIf reliable information indicates ... defendants\u2019s criminal history category substantially under-represents the seriousness of [his] criminal history or the likelihood that [he] will commit other crimes, an upward departure may be warranted.\u201d); <em>United States v. Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d 345, 347 (5th Cir.2006) (upward departure not abuse of discretion if district court\u2019s reasons for departing advance 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2) objectives and are justified by facts of the case); <em>United States v. Simkanin, </em>420 F.3d 397, 418 &amp; n. 24 (5th Cir.2005) (affirming up<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>ward departure based upon likelihood of recidivism). Two convictions and six arrests not resulting in convictions were unaccounted for by Sides\u2019 criminal-history category. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(2)(A) &amp; (E) (information that may be considered in forming basis for an upward departure includes \u201c[p]rior sentence(s) not used in computing the criminal history category\u201d and \u201c[p]rior similar adult criminal conduct not resulting in a criminal conviction\u201d). Given Sides\u2019 extensive criminal record, which includes other offenses designed to deprive rightful owners of their property, as well as violent assaults, the court did not abuse its discretion by departing upwardly.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">In regard to the substantive reasonableness of the sentence, the district court cited fact-specific reasons for imposing a non-Guidelines sentence, and its reasons for imposing an upward departure adequately reflected the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. <em>See United States v. Tzep-Mejia, </em>461 F.3d 522, 527 (5th Cir. 2006). Along that line, our court has previously upheld comparable, and even greater, departures than Sides\u2019. <em>See Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d at 346-48 (upholding 27-month upward departure based on defendant\u2019s extensive criminal history); <em>United States v. Lee, </em>358 F.3d 315, 328-29 (5th Cir.2004) (upholding 24-month upward departure in the light of defendant\u2019s 21 criminal-history points, prior lenient sentences received, and likelihood of recidivism); <em>United States v. McKenzie, </em>991 F.2d 203, 205 n. 7, 206 n. 8 (5th Cir.1993) (ruling 27-month departure, roughly twice Guidelines maximum, was reasonable in the light of defendant\u2019s serious criminal history).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b473-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
