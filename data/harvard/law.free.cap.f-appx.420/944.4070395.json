On appeal, Smith argues that the district court erred in denying him leave to appeal his convictions and sentences because his attorney, Christopher Patterson, repeatedly refused to file an appeal on his behalf. The government agrees that this case should be remanded to the district court because the limitations period applicable to Smith\u2019s habeas corpus petition might have been equitably tolled by Patterson\u2019s refusal to file an appeal. After careful review, we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-22\">We construe <em>pro se </em>filings liberally to afford review on any \u201clegally justifiable base.\u201d <em>Sanders v. United States, </em>113 F.3d 184, 187 (11th Cir.1997); <em>see United States v. Holt, </em>417 F.3d 1172, 1175 (11th Cir.2005) (construing liberally a <em>pro se </em>motion for a writ of <em>audita querela </em>as a motion to va<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>cate under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255). We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s determination that a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate is time-barred. <em>Drury v. United States, </em>507 F.3d 1295, 1296 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">We have explained that \u201c[i]t is well-settled that a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate is a separate and distinct remedy from habeas corpus proper\u201d and that \u201c[i]t is also clear that a \u00a7 2255 motion is the exclusive remedy for a federal prisoner to collaterally attack his conviction and sentence, except in the rare cases where it is inadequate to do so.\u201d <em>Antonelli v. Warden, U.S.P. Atlanta, </em>542 F.3d 1348, 1351 n. 1 (11th Cir.2008). Accordingly, \u201c[a] prisoner in custody pursuant to a federal court judgment may proceed under \u00a7 2241 only when he raises claims outside the scope of \u00a7 2255(a), that is, claims concerning execution of his sentence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">Furthermore, we have held that a district court should explain the reasoning behind its denial of \u00a7 2255 relief in order to \u201cprovide this [Cjourt with a sufficient basis for review.\u201d <em>Broadwater v. United States, </em>292 F.3d 1302, 1303 (11th Cir.2002) (holding that the district court\u2019s one-sentence denial of an individual\u2019s six ineffective assistance of counsel claims did not provide a sufficient basis for appellate review given the complexity of the claims, the voluminous record on appeal, and the fact that the movant\u2019s claims had arguable merit).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">The Antiterrrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996), imposes a one-year statute of limitations for filing a \u00a7 2255 motion, which begins to run following one of four enumerated events, including, \u201cthe date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final,\u201d and \u201cthe date on which the facts supporting the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f)(1), (4). However, if a petition is untimely filed, \u201ca petitioner is entitled to equitable tolling ... if he shows (1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way and prevented timely filing.\u201d <em>San </em>Martin <em>v. McNeil, </em>633 F.3d 1257, 1267 (11th Cir.2011) (quotation omitted). We have determined that serious attorney misconduct, including \u201cacts of gross negligence [and] acts of outright willful deceit,\u201d could constitute \u201cextraordinary circumstances,\u201d which would justify equitable tolling of a movant\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Downs v. McNeil, </em>520 F.3d 1311, 1323 (11th Cir.2008); <em>see also Holland v. Florida, </em>560 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2549, 2564, 177 L.Ed.2d 130 (2010) (holding that equitable tolling may be available in an \u201cextraordinary\u201d instance in which the conduct of a petitioner\u2019s attorney constitutes more than \u201cgarden variety\u201d or \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d). In <em>Downs, </em>we remanded the case to the district court for an evidentiary hearing because the district court had not made factual findings regarding Downs\u2019s allegations of attorney misconduct. 520 F.3d at 1325.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-10\">In this case, the district court erred in construing Smith\u2019s motion as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. We have clearly held that \u201c[a] prisoner in custody pursuant to a federal court judgment may proceed under \u00a7 2241 only when he raises claims outside the scope of \u00a7 2255(a), that is, claims concerning execution of his sentence.\u201d <em>Antonelli, </em>542 F.3d at 1351 n. 1. Smith\u2019s motion did not raise claims concerning the execution of his sentence and the district court should have construed Smith\u2019s motion as a motion to vacate, set aside or correct sentence filed under \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-11\">Further, Smith\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cnunc pro tunc,\u201d his reference to Fed. R.App.P. 4(b), and request for the district court to adhere to the spirit of the law in granting him relief evince Smith\u2019s desire to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>escape the limitations period applicable to his case. Liberally construing Smith\u2019s motion as a motion to vacate, and as pleading for equitable tolling of the limitations period in \u00a7 2255(f), we remand to the district court to make factual findings regarding Smith\u2019s allegations of attorney misconduct. \u201cIn the end\u201d it is impossible to say \u201cwhether extraordinary circumstances are present that entitle [the movant] to equitable tolling because the district court made no findings of fact with respect to whether counsel\u2019s behavior was as appalling as [the movant] alleges,\u201d and \u201c[ultimately, whether equitable tolling is warranted is a decision that must rest on facts.\u201d <em>Downs, </em>520 F.3d at 1323, 1325.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
