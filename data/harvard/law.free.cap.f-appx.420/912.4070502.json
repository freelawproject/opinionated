The district court found that Miller\u2019s motion was barred by the statute of limitations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">In considering a district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 41(g) motion to return property, we review the district court\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Howell, </em>425 F.3d 971, 973 (11th Cir.2005). We treat Rule 41(g) motions filed after the close of all criminal proceedings \u201cas a civil action in equity\u201d subject to the six-year statute of limitations under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401. <em>See id. </em>at 974; <em>see also United States v. Machado, </em>465 F.3d 1301, 1307 (11th Cir.2006), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007). That section provides that \u201cevery civil action commenced against the United States shall be barred unless the complaint is filed within six years after the right of action first accrues.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-7\">Miller filed the instant motion on October 13, 2009,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but his right of action accrued more than six years before that date. The district court entered a Preliminary Order of Forfeiture (\u201cPOF\u201d) on November 19, 2001, which incorporated the terms of the parties\u2019 agreement, by which Miller agreed to forfeit real property and funds in lieu of trying the forfeiture count before a jury. The district court later amended the POF on March 12, 2003, in light of the sale one of the parcels of real property Miller agreed to forfeit, and entered a Final Order of Forfeiture on July 2, 2003. Miller failed to file the instant motion within the six-year statute of limitations period, even assuming that the latest possible date of accrual, July 2, 2003, applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-12\">For these reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s decision denying Miller\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b939-8\">.Before the district court, Miller characterized his motion as one under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41(e), which applies to the issuance of warrants, not the return of property. However, we \"have an obligation to look behind the label of a motion filed by a <em>pro se </em>inmate and determine whether the motion is, in effect, cognizable under a different remedial ... framework.\u201d <em>United States v. Jordan, </em>915 F.2d 622, 624-25 (11th Cir.1990). Because Miller seeks a return of seized property, we treat Miller's motion as one under Rule 41(g).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b939-15\">. The district court also found that Miller\u2019s motion was barred by res judicata, but because we affirm the district court on an alternative basis, we need not review that finding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b939-16\">. \"Under the 'prison mailbox rule,' a <em>pro se </em>prisoner\u2019s court filing is deemed filed on the date it is delivered to prison authorities for mailing.\u201d <em>Williams v. McNeil, </em>557 F.3d 1287, 1290 n. 2 (11th Cir.2009). Absent evidence to the contrary, there is a presumption that a prisoner delivered his pleadings to prison officials on \"the day he signed it.\u201d <em>Washington v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 1299, 1301 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
