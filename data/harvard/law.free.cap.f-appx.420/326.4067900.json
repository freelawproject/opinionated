After reviewing medical records and a <em>Martinez </em>report submitted by the Texas Attorney General\u2019s Office, the district court dismissed for failure state a claim and as frivolous. <em>See Martinez v. Aaron, </em>570 F.2d 317 (10th Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-22\">McBride\u2019s appellate brief consists of two pages. His argument section had only one sentence: \u201cThis Court has a duty to insure that prisoners are properly cared for as the standards of constitutional magnitude dictates.\u201d McBride does not challenge the magistrate judge\u2019s lengthy reasons for concluding that he failed to allege an Eighth Amendment deliberate-indifference claim and that Dr. Murray and Warden Rupert were not liable as supervisors or that the retaliation claim against Dr. Wright was frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-23\">Where an appellant fails to identify any error in the district court\u2019s analysis, it is the same as if he had not appealed. <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas Cnty. Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Although <em>pro se </em>briefs are afforded liberal construction, <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), even <em>pro se </em>litigants must brief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>arguments to preserve them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). McBride has abandoned any challenge to the judgment. <em>See Brinkmann, </em>813 F.2d at 748.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Because the appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous, <em>see Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983), it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. This dismissal counts as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), as does the district court\u2019s dismissal. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). We caution McBride that if he accumulates three strikes, he will not be permitted to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b352-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
