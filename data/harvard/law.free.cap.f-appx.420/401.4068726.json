Dority contends: the conviction is invalid because, in the light of <em>District of Columbia v. Heller, </em>554 U.S. 570, 128 S.Ct. 2783, 171 L.Ed.2d 637 (2008) (finding District of Columbia\u2019s prohibition on in-home possession of handguns unconstitutional), the Second Amendment prohibits any infringement on the right to bear arms; he was convicted of a nonexistent offense; and his claim fits within the \u201csavings clause\u201d of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 because \u00a7 922(g) is facially unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>The court\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed for clear error; its legal conclusions, <em>de novo. Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 425 (5th Cir.2005). A \u00a7 2241 petition attacking custody resulting from a federally-imposed sentence may be entertained if petitioner establishes that \u00a7 2255\u2019s remedy is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention\u201d. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). Petitioner must show his claims: (1) are \u201cbased on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that [he] may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense\u201d; and (2) were \u201cforeclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim[s] should have been raised in [his] trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion\u201d. <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">The Supreme Court noted in <em>Heller: </em>the Second Amendment \u201cis not unlimited\u201d; and the Court expressly reaffirmed the \u201clongstanding prohibition[ ] on the possession of firearms by felons.... \u201d 554 U.S. at 626-27, 128 S.Ct. 2783. Prior to <em>Heller, </em>in <em>United States v. Harrington, </em>351 F.3d 632, 633-34 (5th Cir.2003), our court held that \u00a7 922(g), prohibiting the possession of firearms by convicted felons, does <em>not </em>violate the Second Amendment right to bear arms. In 2009, in the light of <em>Heller, </em>our court reaffirmed Harrington!s holding, stating: <em>\u201cHeller </em>provides no basis for reconsidering <em>Harrington\u201d. United States v. Anderson, </em>559 F.3d 348, 352 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2814, 174 L.Ed.2d 308 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b427-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
