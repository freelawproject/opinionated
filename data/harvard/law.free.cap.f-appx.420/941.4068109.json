Foley, III, a federal prisoner, appeals pro se the dismissal of his motion to vacate his sentence. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The district court ruled that Foley\u2019s motion was untimely and that Foley was not entitled to file an out-of-time direct appeal based on ineffective assistance of counsel. Because Foley\u2019s motion was untimely, we need not reach the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>Foley concedes that he filed his motion to vacate more than one year after his judgment of conviction became final on May 9, 2008, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2255(f)(1), but Foley contends that he is entitled to equitable tolling. Foley, a college graduate, alleges that a prison law clerk provided him the wrong form for filing a motion to vacate in April 2009, approximately one month before the limitations period for filing his motion had expired. Instead of filing a motion to vacate his sentence, Foley then filed in this Court an application for leave to file a successive motion, which we denied as unnecessary. On June 9, 2009, Foley filed a motion to vacate in the district court. Foley also argues that this Court should have transferred his application to the district court where it could have been construed as an original motion before the limitations period expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>a dismissal of a motion to vacate as untimely. <em>Outler v. United States, </em>485 F.3d 1273, 1278 (11th Cir.2007). We review any findings of fact for clear error. <em>Dorsey v. Chapman, </em>262 F.3d 1181, 1185 (11th Cir.2001). We will affirm findings of fact unless \u201c \u2018the record lacks substantial evidence\u2019 \u201d to support them. <em>Lightning v. Roadway Express, Inc., </em>60 F.3d 1551, 1558 (11th Cir.1995) (quoting <em>Thelma C. Raley, Inc. v. Kleppe, </em>867 F.2d 1326, 1328 (11th Cir.1989)). Equitable tolling of the limitations period for a motion to vacate is an \u201cextraordinary remedy\u201d that is to be applied sparingly, and the burden for establishing eligibility for equitable tolling falls squarely on the prisoner. <em>Outler, </em>485 F.3d at 1281. We have explained that equitable tolling \u201cis available only if a [prisoner] establishes <em>both </em>extraordinary circumstances and due diligence.\u201d <em>Diaz v. Sec\u2019y of Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>362 F.3d 698, 702 (11th Cir.2004). In <em>Holland v. Florida, </em>the Supreme Court recently explained that equitable tolling requires \u201creasonable diligence\u201d instead of \u201cmaximum feasible diligence.\u201d 560 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2549, 2565, 177 L.Ed.2d 130 (2010). \u201c[A] determination regarding a party\u2019s diligence is a finding of fact that \u2018will not be disturbed unless clearly erroneous.\u2019 \u201d <em>Drew v. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>297 F.3d 1278, 1283 (11th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Walters v. City of Atlanta, </em>803 F.2d 1135, 1145 (11th Cir.1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-9\">The district court did not clearly err in finding that Foley failed to exercise reasonable diligence, which means that Foley is not entitled to equitable tolling of the limitations period for his motion. The form that Foley used to file an application for a successive motion clearly explained that it was for prisoners who had previously filed a motion to vacate, and the record supports the finding by the district court that Foley\u2019s counsel had explained to him the process for seeking collateral relief following Foley\u2019s direct appeal. In addition, neither the rule, Fed. R.App. P. 22(a), nor the statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631, cited by Foley obliged this Court to transfer Foley\u2019s application for a successive motion to the district court for filing as an original motion. <em>Guenther v. Holt, </em>173 F.3d 1328 (11th Cir.1999). We affirm the dismissal of Foley\u2019s motion to vacate as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
