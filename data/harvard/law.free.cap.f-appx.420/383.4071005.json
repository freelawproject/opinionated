Andino-Ortega, </em>608 F.3d 305, 311 (5th Cir.2010). The Government contends, however, that we need not vacate Vasquez-Tovar\u2019s sentence because any error in calculating Vasquez-Tovar\u2019s alternative non-guidelines sentence is harmless. Specifically, the Government points to the district court\u2019s statements that \u201cthe [70-87-month] range is reasonable\u201d and that it would \u201centertain that range, even if the enhancement was eight levels or 12 levels\u201d or \u201cjust a straightforward level enhancement.\u201d Relying on this circuit\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Bonilla, </em>524 F.3d 647, 655-56 (5th Cir.2008), the Government argues that the district court\u2019s comments establish that VasquezTovar\u2019s sentence was not affected by the guidelines error. We reject the Government\u2019s argument for two reasons. First, this court has observed that an error is harmless under <em>Bonilla </em>only when \u201cthe district court: (1) contemplated the correct [g]uideline[s] range in its analysis and (2) stated that it would have imposed the same sentence even if that range applied.\u201d <em>United States v. Duhon, </em>541 F.3d 391, 396 (5th Cir.2008). Here, the record does not demonstrate that the district court considered the guidelines range that would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>applied to Vasquez-Tovar absent the 16-level enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">Second, although we recently recognized in <em>United States v. Ibarra-Luna </em>that an error can be harmless even if the district court did not consider the correct guidelines range in its analysis, such an error is harmless only if two requirements are met: (1) \u201cthe [Gjovernment must convincingly demonstrate that the district court would have imposed a sentence outside the correct [guidelines range for the same reasons it gave for imposing a sentence outside the miscalculated [guidelines range,\u201d and (2) the Government \u201cmust show that the ... sentence the district court imposed was not influenced in any way by the erroneous [guidelines calculation.\u201d <em>United States v. Ibarra-Luna, </em>628 F.3d 712, 718-19 (5th Cir.2010). While the Government has arguably satisfied <em>IbarraLuna\u2019s </em>first requirement, our analysis ends with the second requirement. As in <em>Ibarra-Luna, </em>the district court never explained how it selected 70 months of imprisonment, as opposed to some other length of time within the guidelines range that it considered. Additionally, the district court imposed a sentence at the bottom of the guidelines range that resulted from the 16-level enhancement, which suggests that the guidelines error did affect the sentence in some way.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Under the present circumstances, we cannot conclude that the district court was not influenced in any way by the guidelines range that it considered. We thus cannot say that the Government has met the burden of demonstrating that the district court \u201cwould have imposed the very same sentence if it had not made an erroneous calculation.\u201d <em>Ibarra-Luna, </em>628 F.3d at 719.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">For the aforementioned reasons, we VACATE Vasquez-Tovar\u2019s sentence and REMAND for resentencing consistent with this opinion. By failing to provide any legal citation or analysis in support of his request that a different district judge re-sentence him, Vasquez-Tovar has waived that issue. <em>See United States v. Torres-Aguilar, </em>352 F.3d 934, 936 n. 2 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b409-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
