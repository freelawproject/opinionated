Forney, </em>9 F.3d 1492, 1498 (11th Cir.1993). We review the denial of a motion for reconsideration for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Simms, </em>385 F.3d 1347, 1356 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-22\">We conclude that the district court denied correctly Fernandez-Leal\u2019s motion to compel because Fernandez-Leal showed no constitutionally impermissible motive. When the government does not file a substantial assistance motion, we \u201care precluded from intruding into prosecutorial discretion,\u201d except where there is \u201can allegation <em>and </em>a substantial showing that the prosecution refused to file a substantial assistance motion because of a constitutionally impermissible motivation, such as race or religion.\u201d <em>Forney, </em>9 F.3d at 1501-02 (emphasis in original).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In his motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>to compel, Fernandez-Leal alleged only that he provided substantial assistance to the government; and he repeats those allegations on appeal. But a defendant\u2019s claim that he \u201cmerely provided substantial assistance will not entitle a defendant to a remedy or even to discovery or an evidentiary hearing.\u201d <em>See Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 1843, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992) (explaining that the government has the power, but not the duty, to file a substantial assistance motion when the defendant has provided substantial assistance).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">On appeal, Fernandez-Leal repeats an allegation \u2014 which he made for the <em>first </em>time in his reconsideration motion \u2014 that the government discriminated against him based on his religious beliefs because the government compelled him to swear under oath before testifying in a grand jury proceeding.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court abused no discretion in denying reconsideration because Fernandez-Leal could have raised this argument in his original motion to compel. <em>See Wilchombe v. TeeVee Toons, Inc., </em>555 F.3d 949, 957 (11th Cir.2009) (explaining that a motion for reconsideration cannot be used to \u201craise argument or present evidence that could have been raised prior to the entry of judgment,\u201d and that this prohibition included new arguments \u201cpreviously available, but not pressed\u201d). And even still, FernandezLeal\u2019s contention that the government violated his First Amendment rights by compelling him to take an oath relates to whether he voluntarily testified at a grand jury hearing, not to the government\u2019s failure to file a Rule 35(b) motion on his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">Because Fernandez-Leal made no allegation and substantial showing of a constitutionally impermissible motive, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to compel the government to file a Rule 35(b) motion and the denial of reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b973-14\">. Fernandez-Leal had been convicted of a drug offense and sentenced to 97 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b973-15\">. Fernandez-Leal\u2019s plea agreement did not require the government to file a substantial assistance motion; instead, the terms of the agreement gave the government discretion to evaluate Fernandez-Leal\u2019s cooperation and to determine whether to seek a sentence reduction on his behalf.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b974-22\">. In his grand jury testimony, Fernandez-Leal identified his supplier of drugs.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
