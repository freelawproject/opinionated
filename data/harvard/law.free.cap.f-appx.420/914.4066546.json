On appeal, Lugo-Gutierrez argues that his sentence was procedurally and substantively unreasonable because the court failed to adequately explain its reasons for imposing an upward variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-24\">We review a final sentence for reasonableness, applying the deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Under the abuse-of-discretion standard, we will not reverse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>a district court so long as the district court\u2019s ruling \u201cdoes not constitute a clear error of judgment.\u201d <em>United States v. Frazier, 3</em>87 F.3d 1244, 1259 (11th Cir.2004) (quotations omitted). Whether a sentence is reasonable is guided by the factors outlined by Congress in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1188-89 (11th Cir.2008). The factors included in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b941-5\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b941-6\">(8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b941-7\"><em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)). The burden of establishing that a sentence is unreasonable lies with the party challenging the sentence. <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1189.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-8\">In determining whether a sentence is reasonable, we first must determine whether the sentence was proeedurally reasonable. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. Factors we must consider in determining procedural reasonableness include whether the district court properly calculated the guidelines range, improperly treated the Guidelines as mandatory, failed to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selected a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failed to adequately explain its chosen sentence. <em>Id. </em>After determining that the sentence is proeedurally reasonable, we then must consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence. <em>Id. </em>A sentence is substantively reasonable if, under the totality of the circumstances, it achieves the purposes of \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191. A sentence may be substantively unreasonable where a district court \u201cunjustifiably relied on any one \u00a7 3553(a) factor, failed to consider pertinent \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selected the sentence arbitrarily, or based the sentence on impermissible factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Sarras, </em>575 F.3d 1191, 1219 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-10\">When a district court decides that a variance is appropriate, \u201cit should explain why that variance is appropriate in a particular case with sufficient justifications.\u201d <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1238 (11th Cir.) (quotation omitted), cert. denied, - U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2847, 174 L.Ed.2d 566 (2009); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2) (providing that a sentencing court, when imposing a sentence outside the applicable guidelines range, must state in open court the reasons for its imposition of the chosen sentence and the specific reason for the variance). \u201cThe justifications must be compelling enough to support the degree of the variance and complete enough to allow meaningful appellate review.\u201d <em>Shaw, </em>560 F.3d at 1238 (quotations omitted). The district court need not, however, provide an extraordinary justification for a sentence outside the guidelines range. <em>Id. </em>Although we may consider the extent of the deviation, we must \u201cgive due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1322 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-12\">In determining a reasonable sentence, the district court may consider facts that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>already have been taken into account in calculating the defendant\u2019s guidelines range. <em>See id. </em>at 1323-24 (providing that a district court could consider a defendant\u2019s prior offenses in deciding to impose an upward variance, even though those offenses already were included in the defendant\u2019s criminal history score); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3661 (\u201cNo limitation shall be placed on the information concerning the background, character, and conduct of a person convicted of an offense which a court of the United States may receive and consider for the purpose of imposing an appropriate sentence.\u201d). In fashioning a reasonable sentence, a district court \u201cmay ... consider relevant facts concerning a defendant\u2019s background, character, and conduct.\u201d <em>United States v. Faust, </em>456 F.3d 1342, 1348 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">The district court followed the proper procedures in determining LugoGutierrez\u2019s sentence and adequately explained why it believed that a sentence within the guidelines range would not satisfy the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Thus, his sentence is procedurally reasonable. LugoGutierrez\u2019s 36-month sentence is also substantively reasonable because the sentencing court did not abuse its discretion in determining that an upward variance was necessary to serve- the purposes of \u00a7 3553(a). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s imposition of a 36-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">Lugo-Gutierrez\u2019s indictment and judgment erroneously state that he was deported for an aggravated felony, rather than a felony, although they correctly reference the penalty provision for deportation following a felony conviction, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1). The parties did not raise this issue on appeal, but we may remand with instructions to correct a clerical error in the judgment. <em>United States v. Massey, </em>443 F.3d 814, 822 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cFurthermore, it is fundamental error for a court to enter a judgment of conviction against a defendant who has not been charged, tried, or found guilty of the crime recited in the judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-7\">Because the written judgment incorrectly states that Lugo-Gutierrez was convicted for an aggravated felony, rather than a felony, we remand for correction of that clerical error.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-8\">Upon a thorough review of the entire record on appeal, and after consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm in part and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-9\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
