SMITH, Circuit Judge: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b378-21\">Kathryn Baumeister appeals a summary judgment in favor of AIG Global Investment Corp. (\u201cAIGGIC\u201d) on claims of sex <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>and pregnancy discrimination. Because a reasonable jury could not find that AIGGIC\u2019s proffered legitimate reason for laying her off was pretextual, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Baumeister began working at a company called American General in 1989 as a staff accountant. American International Group, Inc. (\u201cAIG\u201d), purchased American General in 2001 and transferred Baumeister to its High Yield Group within AIGGIC, where she worked as a portfolio analyst. The High Yield Group manages AIG investments, including the AIG general accounts, separate accounts (non-AIG affiliated accounts, such as pensions and the general accounts of other companies), mutual funds, collateralized bond obligations (\u201cCBO\u2019s\u201d), and credit default swaps (\u201cCDS\u2019s\u201d). There was only one other portfolio analyst in the group, Shawn Parry. Baumeister twice took pregnancy leave, once from September to November 2006 and again from July to October 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">In January 2009, AIGGIC informed Baumeister that she was being eliminated as part of a reduction-in-force (\u201cRIF\u201d) effective March 2009. The RIF was a response to AIG\u2019s September 2008 liquidity crisis caused by the deterioration of U.S. credit markets. To stabilize the company, AIG management developed a plan to sell many of its units, including parts of AIGGIC. To position itself for that sale, AIGGIC instituted a restructuring plan that included eliminating non-essential positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">Matt Meyer, the managing director and head of U.S. public fixed income for AIGGIC, asked Bryan Petermann<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to recommend one portfolio analyst and three credit analysts in the High Yield Group for the RIF. Petermann recommended laying off Baumeister, Ravi Klamath (male), Mike Lanier (male), and Joanna Moon (female). Petermann did not recommend the other portfolio analyst, Parry, for the RIF.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-12\">We review a summary judgment <em>de novo. Floyd v. Amite Cnty. Sch. Dist., </em>581 F.3d 244, 247 (5th Cir.2009). Summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Id. </em>at 247-48. In other words, it is appropriate if a reasonable jury could not return a verdict for the nonmovant. <em>Turner v. Baylor Richardson Med. Ctr., </em>476 F.3d 337, 343 (5th Cir.2007). We review the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant and resolve all reasonable doubts in the nonmovant\u2019s favor. <em>Boston Old Colony Ins. Co. v. Tiner Assocs., </em>288 F.3d 222, 227 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-13\">Baumeister claims that AIGGIC discharged her because of her sex and because she took pregnancy leave.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Title VII prohibits an employer from \u201cfail[ing] or refus[ing] to hire or ... discharging] any individual, or otherwise ... discriminating] against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s ... sex____\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l) (2006). The Family and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>Medical Leave Act entitles \u201can eligible employee ... to a total of 12 workweeks of leave during any 12-month period ... [bjecause of the birth of a son or daughter of the employee and in order to care for such son or daughter,\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2612(a)(1)(A), and, upon return from leave, entitles \u201cany eligible employee ... to be restored by the employer to the position of employment held by the employee when the leave was commeneed[] or ... to be restored to an equivalent position,\u201d \u00a7 2614. The Act also renders it \u201cunlawful for any employer to discharge or in any other manner discriminate against any individual for opposing any practice made unlawful by [the FMLA].\u201d \u00a7 2615.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">Where, as here, there is no direct evidence of discrimination, a plaintiff can rely on circumstantial evidence. <em>Rutherford v. Harris Cnty., </em>197 F.3d 173, 180 n. 4 (5th Cir.1999). Baumeister\u2019s title VII and FMLA claims are then both governed by the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>burden-shifting framework.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> First, the employee must demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination. <em>Id. </em>If he succeeds in doing so, the burden shifts to the employer to \u201carticulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the employee\u2019s rejection.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 253 (citation omitted). If the employer does so, then the employee must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the reasons were pretextual. <em>Id. </em>Because Baumeister\u2019s title VII and FMLA claims largely overlap, we discuss them together.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Because we decide in favor of AIGGIC, we assume <em>arguendo </em>that Baumeister has satisfied her <em>prima facie </em>case as to her title VII and FMLA claims. We therefore proceed to the second <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>step: whether AIGGIC has articulated a legitimate, non-diseriminatory reason for the termination. <em>See Burdine, </em>450 U.S. at 253, 101 S.Ct. 1089. AIGGIC has proffered a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating Baumeister: that she was terminated as part of a RIF because Petermann believed her primary job function was to support CBO\u2019s, a product the company was winding down, whereas Parry\u2019s primary responsibilities were supporting separate accounts and mutual funds, functions that were \u201cnot going away.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-11\">We therefore turn to step three: whether AIGGIC\u2019s reason was pretextual. Baumeister does not contest that AIG was winding down its CBO\u2019s. Indeed, she testified that AIG was not issuing new CBO\u2019s and that, although there were six left \u201cin some sort of active state\u201d at the time of her layoff, they were \u201cfading out.\u201d Rather, she contests Petermann\u2019s claim that CBO support was her primary job function and argues that his reason was pretextual because of the difference between her and Parry\u2019s qualifications. But even viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Baumeister, a reasonable jury could not find that she has proven pretext by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-12\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-13\">With respect to Baumeister\u2019s job function relative to Parry\u2019s, Baumeister testified that when she originally started on her job, she spent half her time helping the managers for the CBO\u2019s that AIG had issued and the other half analyzing CBO\u2019s that others had issued. By 2007, 70% of her work involved CBO\u2019s; in 2008, she said it was \u201c40 to 50 percent.\u201d Her 2008 per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>formance appraisal gives 40% weight to her \u201c[w]ork toward closing down 1-2 of the CBO transactions,\u201d 40% weight to \u201c[i]n~ creas[ing] knowledge\u201d of trading and analytics systems, portfolio guidelines and securities held, 15% to moving the group to a \u201cmore automated portfolio reporting system,\u201d and 5% to complying with her professional code of ethics. The appraisal lists work aiming at closing down the CBO\u2019s as her only \u201coperational\u201d business goal. Managing separate accounts or mutual funds is not listed as a goal. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">In addition, although Baumeister testified that her workload involved a \u201cbalance\u201d of CBO and portfolio management work, she considered herself \u201cpigeonholed into doing mostly CBO work.\u201d She also testified that she ended up doing more CBO work, and Parry did more portfolio management work. It appears that the extent to which she did portfolio management work and Parry did CBO work was that \u201c[i]f he had availability to work on a question that came up on the CBOs and I was working on something else, he did that. If something needed to be done on the portfolio management side and I had availability, then I did that.\u201d Therefore, Petermann\u2019s claim \u2014 that he included Baumeister in the RIF because, as between her and Parry, Petermann viewed her as the CBO specialist and Parry as the separate accounts and mutual funds specialist \u2014 is buttressed, rather than contradicted, by Baumeister\u2019s evidence. A reasonable jury could therefore not conclude by a preponderance of the evidence that Petermann\u2019s explanation is \u201cunworthy of credence.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">Baumeister argues that AIGGIC\u2019s proffered legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for laying her off is pretextual because of the difference between her qualifications and Parry\u2019s. We can infer pretext if the plaintiff was \u201cclearly better qualified than the employee[]\u201d who was not laid off.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But aside from the fact that Baumeister had more tenure in the High Yield Group (and with AIGGIC in general) than did Parry, there is no evidence in the record as to Parry\u2019s qualifications, making any comparison between him and Baumeister impossible. Baumeister asserts that Parry, unlike her, does not have an MBA or a CPA, but she does not point to any evidence in the record saying so; the parts of the record she points to say nothing of the sort. Indeed, her EEOC charge contradictorily asserted that Parry \u201crecently finished his MBA and is sitting for his Certified Public Accountant examination.\u201d Moreover, there is no evidence about where Parry or Baumeister obtained their MBA\u2019s, so there is no indication of the relative strengths of the training they received. Finally, there is no evidence about Parry\u2019s performance reviews; even with worse credentials, he may be a superior employee. A reasonable jury would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>not be able to find on this evidence that Baumeister was \u201cclearly\u201d better qualified than Parry.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">With respect to her pregnancy discrimination claim only, Baumeister argues that the temporal proximity between her return from pregnancy leave and her discharge demonstrates that AIG\u2019s laying her off as part of its RIF was pretext. Although temporal proximity between FMLA-protected leave and a subsequent termination may be sufficient evidence of pretext, courts \u201cuniformly hold that the temporal proximity must be \u2018very close.\u2019 \u201d <em>Clark Cnty. Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, </em>532 U.S. 268, 273, 121 S.Ct. 1508, 149 L.Ed.2d 509 (2001). A three-month period, standing alone, is insufficient. <em>See Richmond v. ONEOK, Inc., </em>120 F.3d 205, 209 (10th Cir.1997). The district court erroneously considered Baumeister\u2019s temporal-proximity evidence in isolation, rather than in conjunction with her other pretext evidence, but even considered in conjunction with the other evidence, it is insufficient for a reasonable jury to conclude that Petermann\u2019s legitimate reason for laying her off is \u201cunworthy of credence.\u201d <em>See Reeves, </em>530 U.S. at 143, 120 S.Ct. 2097.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">The summary judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b378-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
