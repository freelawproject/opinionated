After we affirmed his sentence on direct appeal, and his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion for collateral relief was denied, Arias filed a motion for a sentencing reduction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on a retroactive amendment to the Guidelines. Although the district court denied the motion, we vacated and remanded for re-sentencing because we determined that the amendment retroactively affected the guideline range governing a portion of Arias\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-22\">At re-sentencing, the district court recalculated Arias\u2019s guideline range for the affected portion of his sentence, but nonetheless exercised its discretion, denied the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, and re-imposed the same sentence. The court, however, failed to re-impose that sentence in a formal written judgment. On appeal, we upheld the court\u2019s sentence, but remanded with instructions to correct the clerical error by entering a formal written judgment. The district court complied with our mandate in 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-23\">Approximately seven years later, Arias filed the instant <em>pro se </em>\u201cmotion for appropriate relief,\u201d challenging the district court\u2019s authority to enter the amended judgment. The district court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>While we doubt that Arias\u2019s belated motion was timely, let alone cognizable at all, we nonetheless agree with the district court that Arias\u2019s motion was due to be denied because the amended judgment was entered pursuant to a mandate issued by this Court. As such, it is barred by the law of the case doctrine. <em>See United States v. Tamayo, </em>80 F.3d 1514, 1520 (11th Cir.1996). Arias\u2019s remaining arguments are not properly before us. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
