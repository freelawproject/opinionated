On appeal, Anderson contends that the district court violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights by sentencing him to an enhanced term of imprisonment as an armed career criminal based on prior convictions that were not alleged in the indictment. He asserts that <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005) prohibits a district court from making factual findings concerning the nature of a defendant\u2019s pi\u2019ior convictions. Anderson concedes, however, that his argument is foreclosed by precedent. For the reasons stated below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-9\">We review constitutional issues <em>de novo. United States v. Steed, </em>548 F.3d 961, 978 (11th Cir.2008). In <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>the Supreme Court explained that a prior conviction used to enhance a sentence is not an element of the offense, and, therefore, it need not be alleged in the indictment or found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>523 U.S. at 226-27, 118 S.Ct. at 1222. Although <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) and subsequent cases have cast doubt on the reasoning of <em>Almendarez-Toms, </em>we have explained that we will continue to follow <em>Almendarez-Toms </em>unless and until that case is expressly overruled by the Supreme Court. <em>See, e.g. United States v. Greer, </em>440 F.3d 1267, 1273-76 (11th Cir.2006); <em>Steed, </em>548 F.3d at 978-80; <em>United States v. Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>410 F.3d 1307, 1316 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-11\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Shepard </em>holds that, in determining whether a prior conviction is a predicate felony for purposes of the Armed Career Criminal Act, the district court may only consider the statute of conviction, charging documents, any plea agreement or jury instructions, or similar judicial records. <em>Shepard, </em>544 U.S. at 26, 125 S.Ct. at 1263. In <em>Giver, </em>we observed that <em>Shepard </em>did not bar district courts from determining whether a defendant\u2019s prior convictions are serious drug crimes or crimes of violence. <em>Greer, </em>440 F.3d at 1275. Instead, <em>Shepard </em>merely \u201crestricts the sources or evidence that a judge (instead of a jury) can consider in making that finding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the holding in <em>Shepard </em>did not affect the continuing validity of <em>AlmendarezToms.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b924-12\">In this case, the district court did not violate Anderson\u2019s constitutional rights by sentencing him as an armed career criminal. Because Anderson\u2019s prior convictions were not elements of his offense, they did not have to be charged in the indictment. <em>See Almendarez-Torres, </em>523 U.S. at 226-27, 118 S.Ct. at 1222. Anderson correctly concedes that <em>Almendarez-Toms </em>remains the law of this Circuit until that case is expressly overruled by the Supreme Court. <em>See Greer, </em>440 F.3d at 1273-76; <em>Steed, </em>548 F.3d at 978-80; <em>Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>410 F.3d at 1316 n. 3. Moreover, we have explained that <em>Shepard </em>does not prohibit a district court from making factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>findings about the nature of a defendant\u2019s prior convictions. <em>See Greer, </em>440 F.3d at 1275. Accordingly, after review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm Anderson\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
