The Board of Immigration Appeals agreed with the findings of the immigration judge that Araujo\u2019s testimony had not been credible and she had failed to present evidence to corroborate her testimony. We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-26\">The government argues that we lack jurisdiction to review Araujo\u2019s petition because she did not \u201cmeaningfully challenge\u201d the finding that she had failed to present evidence to corroborate her testimony, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>we disagree. Araujo argued before the Board that her testimony had been consistent and credible, there was no need for corroborating evidence, and she had presented sufficient corroborating evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">Substantial evidence supports the finding that Araujo was not credible, and the immigration judge provided specific and cogent reasons to support that finding. <em>Mohammed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>547 F.3d 1340, 1344-45 (11th Cir.2008). To obtain status as a refugee, an alien must provide \u201ctestimony [that] is credible, is persuasive, and refers to specific facts,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(ii), but Araujo\u2019s testimony was inconsistent and implausible. Araujo gave, for example, three different accounts about how she had learned who destroyed the windows in her living room: she told the Venezuelan police that she had seen \u201cmilitary men (2 men with military uniforms) with guns\u201d; she stated in her application that she had been \u201ctold by some witnesses that two men in military uniforms had fired several shots against [her] windows from the street\u201d; and she testified that a \u201cneighbor [had] told [her] the following day [that] he had seen ... two men ride in a van, and one of them fired shots.\u201d Araujo\u2019s accounts also differed from her brother\u2019s testimony that, a month after the incident, Araujo \u201cdidn\u2019t know\u201d who was the vandal. When asked to explain these inconsistencies, Araujo responded that the police report contained a \u201cmistranslation.\u201d Although Araujo argues that the inconsistencies in her testimony are \u201cnot ... material,\u201d they did not have to relate \u201cto the heart of [her] allegations of past persecution or fear of future persecution,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii), to support the adverse credibility determination. <em>See Xia v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>608 F.3d 1233, 1239-40 (11th Cir.2010). Araujo also argues that the Board erroneously dismissed her appeal based on a <em>\u201cper se </em>rule that [she] fail[ed] to address corroboration,\u201d but the Board \u201cagreed with [the] determination\u201d of the immigration judge that Araujo \u201cwas not credible owing to the lack of corroboration of her claims and an inconsistency in her submitted evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">Araujo\u2019s testimony was weak, which created a \u201cgreater ... need for corroborative evidence,\u201d <em>Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005), that Araujo failed to provide. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(ii). Although Araujo\u2019s parents allegedly witnessed the destruction of her windows, and her father allegedly repelled four women who attacked Araujo, and her father allegedly answered a telephone call in which a member of the Venezuelan military threatened her, Araujo failed to call either of her parents to testify. Araujo could have provided corroborating testimony from her parents because, in her words, her parents \u201cspen[t] more time here\u201d in the United States than in Venezuela. Araujo likewise could have called her son, who accompanied her to the removal hearing, to testify about the alleged attempted kidnapping of him at his school.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">\u201c[Administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B), and we may not reverse those findings unless \u201c \u2018the record compels a reversal,\u2019 \u201d <em>Mohammed, </em>547 F.3d at 1345 (quoting <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004)). <em>See Xia, </em>608 F.3d at 1239. Because Araujo\u2019s testimony was not credible and she failed to provide any evidence that corroborated her allegations of persecution, substantial evidence supports the findings that Araujo failed to prove that she suffered past persecution at the hands of, or had a well-founded fear of future persecution by, the Venezuelan government. Araujo \u201cfailed to establish eligibility for asylum, [and] likewise failed to establish eligibility for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>withholding of removal.\u201d <em>Shkambi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>584 F.3d 1041, 1052 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">Araujo\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
