California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Caro has filed a response. Our independent review of the record, counsel\u2019s brief, and Caro\u2019s response discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-23\">Caro identifies four appealable issues in his response to the <em>Anders </em>brief. We conclude that each is without merit. First, for the purpose of preserving the issue for possible Supreme Court review, he argues that the continuing validity of <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), is questionable in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). As Caro acknowledges, this argument is foreclosed by binding Circuit precedent and does not present a nonfrivolous issue for appeal. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-24\">Next, Caro argues that the district court should have applied amendment 742 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines, which eliminated recency points under \u00a7 4Al.l(e). However, amendment 742 took effect on November 1, 2010, and Caro was sentenced on June 22, 2010. The district court was required to apply the version of the Guidelines that was in effect on the date Caro was sentenced, <em>see </em>18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(4)(ii), and amendment 742 has not been made retroactively applicable, <em>see </em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 lB1.10(c) (2010). The district court did not err by including recency points in Caro\u2019s criminal-history score.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Third, Caro argues that the district court should have applied amendment 740 to the Guidelines, which authorizes a downward departure under \u00a7 2L1.2 on the basis of cultural assimilation. Amendment 740 also took effect on November 1, 2010, and it, too, is not retroactive. Plus, it applies only to defendants who \u201cformed cultural ties primarily with the United States from having resided continuously in the United States from childhood,\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. 8 (2010), and the PSR reflects that Caro did not come to the United States until he was eighteen years old. In addition, Caro\u2019s attorney pressed a cultural assimilation argument at the sentencing hearing (albeit without relying on amendment 740). The district court did not abuse its discretion by rejecting that argument: \u201cWhile cultural assimilation <em>may </em>be considered as a mitigating factor, there is no requirement that a sentencing court <em>must </em>accord it dispositive weight.\u201d <em>United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 807 (5th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Finally, Caro\u2019s response can be liberally construed to contend that his attorney rendered constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to ask the district court to apply amendments 740 and 742. But where, as here, the defendant did not raise his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim before the district court, we will decline to consider that claim on direct appeal, leaving it instead to be resolved in an \u00a7 2255 proceeding. <em>See Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 504-06, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003); <em>United States v. Gulley, </em>526 F.3d 809, 821 (5th Cir.2008) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">Therefore, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b423-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
