Griffis argues that the administrative law judge erred by using the term \u201cmoderate\u201d to describe Griffis\u2019s functional limitations and posed an incomplete hypothetical to the vocational expert. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-16\">We review the decision of the Commissioner \u201c \u2018with deference to the factual findings and close scrutiny of the legal conclusions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ingram v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>496 F.3d 1253, 1260 (11th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Cornelius v. Sullivan, </em>936 F.2d 1143, 1145 (11th Cir.1991)). We review <em>de novo </em>the legal conclusions of the Commissioner, and we treat its findings of fact as conclusive if supported by substantial evidence. <em>Id. </em>Substantial evidence consists of \u201c \u2018relevant evidence [that] a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Bloodsworth v. Heckler, </em>703 F.2d 1233, 1239 (11th Cir.1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-18\">The administrative law judge did not err by using the term \u201cmoderate\u201d to describe Griffis\u2019s limitations. Griffis argues that the term was \u201cnot sufficiently descriptive\u201d and might have been misunderstood by the vocational expert, but the record does not support Griffis\u2019s argument. The administrative law judge defined \u201cmoderate\u201d as \u201cable to function satisfactorily,\u201d and the vocational expert did not express any confusion or uncertainty about that definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-19\">The administrative law judge also presented a complete hypothetical to the vocational expert. Griffis argues that the administrative law judge failed to include in the hypothetical that the claimant had moderate limitations in completing a normal work schedule because of psychological symptoms, but the hypothetical encompassed that limitation and, in fact, presumed the claimant had a more severe limitation. The administrative law judge told the vocational expert that the claimant had a \u201cmarked limitation\u201d in \u201cresponding] appropriately to work pressures in the usual work setting\u201d and a moderate limitation in \u201cresponding] appropriately to changes in [the] routine work setting.\u201d Although the administrative law judge omitted from the hypothetical that Griffis was limited in her ability to work at a consistent pace without an unusual number and length of rest peri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>ods, that omission was, at most, harmless error. Because the administrative law judge found that Griffis had \u201cmoderate difficulties\u201d and could \u201cfunction satisfactorily\u201d at her pace, the omission of the limitation about her work pace and rest periods would not have changed the testimony of the vocational expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">The denial of Griffis\u2019s application for supplemental security income benefits is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
