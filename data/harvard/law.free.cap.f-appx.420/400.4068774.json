He reserved his right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress evidence discovered on his external computer hard drive during a warrant-less search at a border checkpoint.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-28\">Arguably, because this search occurred at a border checkpoint, McAuley\u2019s consent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>was not required to conduct the warrant-less search. <em>See United States v. Arnold, </em>538 F.3d 1003, 1008 (9th Cir.2008) (\u201c[R]easonable suspicion is not needed for customs officials to search a laptop or other personal electronic storage devices at the border\u201d.). In the light of the following, however, we need not decide whether the search was constitutionally permissible as a routine search under the border-search doctrine. <em>See United States v. Montoya de Hernandez, </em>473 U.S. 531, 538, 105 S.Ct. 3304, 87 L.Ed.2d 381 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">The district court\u2019s finding that McAuley consented to the search is reviewed for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Pickett, </em>598 F.3d 231, 233 (5th Cir.2010) (reviewing legal conclusions <em>de novo; </em>factual findings for clear error). McAuley, among others, testified at the hearing on his suppression motion. The factual findings underlying the district court\u2019s conclusion that McAuley voluntarily consented to the search were not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Mata, </em>517 F.3d 279, 291 (5th Cir.2008) (noting defendant did not withdraw verbal consent despite his refusal to sign consent form); <em>United States v. Garza, </em>118 F.3d 278, 283 (5th Cir.1997) (\u201cWe will not second guess the district court\u2019s factual findings as to the credibility of witnesses.\u201d); <em>United States v. Alfaro, </em>935 F.2d 64, 67 (5th Cir.1991) (finding defendant\u2019s conduct not unequivocal act or statement of withdrawal). Because McAuley waived his Fourth Amendment rights, the search was constitutionally permissible. <em>See Mata, </em>517 F.3d at 290.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b426-29\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
