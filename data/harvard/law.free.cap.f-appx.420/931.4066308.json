In 1992, Lira-Carillo filed with the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT protection, which were denied in 1998. The Department of Homeland Security then commenced removal proceedings against Lira-Carrillo by serving him with a Notice to Appear. Lira-Carrillo argued before the IJ that he had a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of his membership in a social group of well-known Peruvian athletes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The IJ denied his applications for asylum, withholding of removal and CAT relief, and the BIA affirmed. Lira-Carrillo did not appeal the BIA\u2019s final decision. Instead, he moved for reconsideration of the BIA\u2019s decision. The BIA denied Lira-Carrillo\u2019s motion for reconsideration and this appeal followed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b958-13\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider for an abuse of discretion. <em>Assa\u2019ad v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>1341 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cOur review is limited to determining whether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the matter of exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Montano Cisneros v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>514 F.3d 1224, 1226 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation omitted). A motion to reconsider \u201cshall specify the errors of law or fact in the previous order and shall be supported by pertinent authority.\u201d INA \u00a7 240(c)(6)(C), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e)(6)(C). \u201cHowever, a motion that merely republishes the reasons that had failed to convince the tribunal in the first place gives the tribunal no reason to change its mind.\u201d <em>Calle v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation and alteration omitted). \u201cTherefore, merely reiterating arguments previously presented to the BIA does not constitute specifying errors of fact or law as required for a successful motion to reconsider.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and ellipsis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">In his motion for reconsideration, Lira-Carrillo contended that the BIA erred in determining that he did not demonstrate past, or a well-founded future fear of persecution, and thus erred in denying his applications for asylum and withholding of removal. However, he failed to articulate any cognizable error of law or fact related to the BIA\u2019s finding. Instead, he simply reiterated the arguments he had raised initially before the BIA. We therefore find that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Lira-Carrillo\u2019s motion for reconsideration as it pertained to his application for asylum and withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">For the foregoing reasons, Lira-Carrillo\u2019s petition for review is dismissed in part, and denied in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-7\">DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b958-8\">. We dismiss the petition for review to the extent that it pertains to Lira-Carrillo\u2019s wife, Patricia Lira, because Lira-Carrillo failed exhaust before the BIA his wife's entitlement to relief. <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1251 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b958-9\">. Because Lira-Carrillo\u2019s removal proceedings commenced after April 1, 1997, the permanent rules of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\"IIRIRA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (1996), apply.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b958-10\">. In the statement attached to his asylum application, Lira-Carrillo asserted that he had achieved great success and become \"very well known\u201d in the late 1970s and the 1980s as a member of the Peruvian men\u2019s volleyball team and as an assistant coach for the women\u2019s national volleyball team.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b958-11\">. Lira-Carillo also appeals the denial of his motion to reconsider the BIA\u2019s decision that he is not eligible for a process referred to as \"repapering,\u201d whereby the Attorney General may, in his discretion, terminate exclusion or deportation proceedings and reinitiate the proceedings as removal proceedings, so that the alien may apply for cancellation of removal. <em>See </em>section 309(c)(3) of IIRIRA; <em>see also </em>section 203(a)(1) of the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act (\"NA-CARA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 105-100, \u00a7 203(a)(1), 111 Stat. 2160, 2196 (1997), amended by Pub.L. No. 105-139, 111 Stat. 2644 (1997). Lira-Carrillo, however, is already in removal proceedings, and was placed in removal proceedings after the effective date of IIRIRA. Accordingly, the BIA did not err in holding that he was ineligible for the \"repapering\u201d process. In addition, to the extent Lira-Carrillo challenges the INS\u2019s initial decision to institute removal rather than deportation proceedings, we lack jurisdiction to review that decision because it is committed to the discretion of the agency.
