Chong continued her studies in this country until 2003. Two years later, the Department of Homeland Security began removal proceedings against Chong after she failed to comply with her visa\u2019s conditions. Chong then filed an application for asylum and withholding of removal under both the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and the United Nations Convention Against Torture (CAT).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-20\">In her application and at a hearing on its merits, Chong claimed that while living in Malaysia she was once verbally harassed because of her Chinese ethnicity. She testified that she was also subjected to vulgar sexual remarks during the same incident. Chong further said that she feared persecution if she returned to Malaysia because she is a practicing Christian and a woman.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-21\">The immigration judge (IJ) denied Chong relief. The IJ ruled that Chong\u2019s asylum application was untimely and that she had established neither a reasonable probability of future persecution nor that it was more likely than not that she would be subjected to torture upon her return to Malaysia. Chong appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), which affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion. She now petitions this court for review of the IJ\u2019s decision denying her withholding-of-removal claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b886-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>First we must note that we cannot review Chong\u2019s withholding-of-removal claim under the INA. Although Chong\u2019s notice of appeal to the BIA indicated that she was appealing both the IJ\u2019s order denying withholding of removal under the INA and the CAT, her brief before the BIA only addressed her CAT claim. As such, the INA claim was not exhausted and we are without jurisdiction to review it. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">In evaluating Chong\u2019s remaining withholding-of-removal claim, we review the IJ\u2019s decision, which was adopted without elaboration by the BIA. <em>Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1350 (11th Cir.2009). We review the IJ\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo, </em>and will not disturb factual findings unless they are so unsubstantiated by the record that we are compelled to do so. <em>Id. </em>at 1350-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">To establish withholding of removal under the CAT, Chong must demonstrate that if she were to return to Malaysia it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that she would be tortured \u201cby or at the instigation of[,] or with the consent or acquiescence of[,] a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1208.16(c)(2), 1208.18(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">Chong argues that her testimony alone, which the IJ found credible, qualifies her for relief. Although in some instances a petitioner\u2019s testimony by itself will justify relief, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2), that is not always the case. Here, Chong did not testify that she had been tortured in the past. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(3). Nor did she testify that the verbal harassment she endured was perpetrated by government officials or at their behest. Even if it had been, mere harassment is not torture. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1208.18(a); <em>cf. Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir. 2005). And Chong never testified that she feared being tortured if she returned to Malaysia.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">The only evidence of torture Chong submitted was in two reports on human rights in Malaysia, one written by the State Department and the other by Amnesty International. The State Department report mostly detailed the abuse of immigrants in government custody, and the other instances it chronicled, although still serious, were isolated rather than pervasive. And Amnesty International\u2019s report only addressed the torture of suspected terrorists. Despite these isolated instances of torture, Chong presented no evidence of how the reports established that it was more likely than not that she would be tortured upon her return to Malaysia. Without such evidence we cannot say that IJ should have been compelled to grant Chong relief in the first place, so we may not grant her relief either.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-8\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b885-15\">. Chong concedes that we cannot review the IJ's asylum ruling because she did not appeal that decision to the BIA. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) (prohibiting review of unexhausted claims). Nor may we consider Chong\u2019s due-process claim because it was not raised before the BIA. <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1251 (11th Cir.2006). Accordingly, that part of her petition is dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
