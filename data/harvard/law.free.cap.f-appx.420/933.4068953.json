He argues, first, that the district court erred in applying a two-level enhancement to his base offense level, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(9)(C), for the use of sophisticated means. The government, which took the position at sentencing that the sophisticated-means enhancement was inapplicable, now contends that the district court did not err in imposing the enhancement. Additionally, Mendez argues on appeal that the district court failed to consider adequately the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-15\">Between October 13, 2003, and November 5, 2004, Research Center of Florida, Inc. (\u201cResearch Center\u201d) submitted Medicare claims for more than $21 million, on which Medicare actually paid $10,944,088. The majority of the claims were for treatment of HIV-positive patients with prescription drugs, but, in fact, little or none of the claimed treatment was provided to the patients. Mendez was Research Center\u2019s vice president and an unnamed co-conspirator (\u201cCC1\u201d) was its president.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-16\">Research Center obtained its patients from two sisters, Caridad and Barbara Perez. Mendez agreed to pay the sisters 30% of what Research Center made from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>billing for the patients. Dr. Jose \u00d1ap\u00f3les sometimes met with CC1 and Mendez to recommend which treatments to bill, based on how much Medicare was paying for those treatments. They did not discuss what treatments the patients needed. Mendez and CC1 agreed to the arrangement with the sisters and decided which types of claims to submit to Medicare. They caused Research Center employees, including Mendez\u2019s codefendant, Damian Beltran, to prepare and sign forms in which they falsely purported to have provided the specified treatments. Mendez and CC1 submitted the false and fraudulent claims to Medicare.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">The sisters arranged for another individual, Idalmis Gonzalez, to pay cash kickbacks to the patients whom the sisters supplied to the clinic. CC1 and Mendez gave the cash for the kickbacks to either Gonzalez or Barbara. Research Center also paid Barbara, Caridad, and \u00d1ap\u00f3les for providing patients and billing advice by making payments into shell companies controlled by those three individuals. CC1 signed all of the checks to the shell companies, except for one check signed by Mendez.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">During the period at issue, Research Center paid Mendez $755,636.66. Research Center also wrote checks to three additional shell companies: Research Center Phase I-IV of Florida Corp., whose president and vice president were CC1 and Mendez; Olmen International Investment LLC (\u201cOlmen\u201d), whose sole officer was Mendez\u2019s ex-wife, Olga Perez; and Efol Investment LLC (\u201cEfol\u201d), whose sole officer during the relevant period was Olga. Research Center Phase I-IV, in turn, transferred part of its payments to Efol, Olmen, and entities that appeared to benefit its other officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-7\">In September and October 2004, Research Center wrote four checks, all signed by CC1, to a law firm. On November 30, 2004, Olga signed two Efol checks to the law firm, but those checks were deposited back into the Efol account the next day. On December 1, Mendez signed two Research Center checks to the firm, which were deposited back into Research Center\u2019s account the next day. On December 17, Olga signed another Efol check to the firm. Of the funds that were paid into the law firm but not redeposited in the payers\u2019 accounts, half of the money from Research Center and all of the money from Efol was used to purchase a piece of undeveloped land, which was then placed in Efol\u2019s name. In April 2005, Mendez paid his personal income taxes with money from Olmen and Efol. In August 2005, Efol traded its parcel of land back to the seller in exchange for a different parcel of land. The next year, Efol sold that lot for approximately $502,000, and subsequently wired $500,000 to a bank account in Spain.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-9\">In 2009, a federal grand jury returned a superseding indictment charging Mendez in seven counts: (1) conspiracy to commit health care fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1349, (2) health care fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1347, (3) conspiracy to pay health care kickbacks, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, (4) conspiracy to commit money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(h), and (5-7) money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1957. He pled guilty to Count 1 pursuant to a written agreement by which the government would dismiss the remaining counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-10\">In calculating Mendez\u2019s guideline sentencing range, the probation office applied a base offense level of 6, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(a)(2). Because Mendez was responsible for a loss of $16,835,185.60, his offense level was increased by 20 levels, pursuant to \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(K). Another two levels were added, pursuant to \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(9)(C), for the use of sophisticated means. With re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>spect to Mendez\u2019s role in the offense, the probation office concluded that CC1 appeared to be the most culpable individual in this case, but that Mendez was a manager or supervisor. Accordingly, a three-level role adjustment was added, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b). With a 3-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a)-(b), Mendez had a total offense level of 28. His absence of a criminal history placed him in criminal history category I and yielded a guideline range of 78 to 97 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">Both the government and Mendez objected to the application of a sophisticated-means enhancement. The government argued that the offense involved only a single clinic, whose true owners\u2019 names were on the corporate records, and application of the enhancement to this case would require application to all cases involving fraud by HIV clinics. The government also noted that the enhancement had not been applied to the defendants in related cases. Mendez argued that there was no evidence of especially complex or intricate conduct pertaining to the execution or concealment of the offense, and there was no deliberate act to conceal or hide any transaction in which Mendez or Research Center was involved. Mendez also submitted a brief sentencing memorandum that described the circumstances of his arrival in the United States from Cuba, his family, his remorse, and his position that the offense did not involve sophisticated means.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">At the sentencing hearing, the court stated that Mendez was a principal of Research Center, not a mere employee, and he had a role in directing the distribution of the money. The use of shell corporations to move the money around would warrant the two-level enhancement for the use of sophisticated means. The government argued that Mendez\u2019s role as a principal in the company was reflected in the aggravating-role enhancement. It contended that the fraud, as opposed to the money laundering, was not unusually sophisticated. The court asserted that \u201cthe fraud doesn\u2019t stop with the fraud, because the fraud generates fraud proceeds,\u201d so \u201c[t]he fraud stops where the money ends.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b962-7\">Mendez argued that the sophisticated-means enhancement was intended to address concealment that was carried out in a sophisticated, intricate way, and the fraud did not involve \u201can especially complex setup\u201d as compared to other Medicare-fraud cases. Furthermore, Beltran, his codefendant, had not been subject to the enhancement, and the logic should be the same because they were co-conspirators. The court described the scheme as having involved \u201ccreating an entity which purports to provide legitimate medical services and then creates a charade by which those services are not performed,\u201d as well as creating \u201cdocuments for submission to a [gjovernment agency reflecting that services were rendered that were not rendered, ... includ[ing] medical diagnoses and perhaps the results of scientific diagnostic tests.\u201d The court maintained that Mendez\u2019s and Beltran\u2019s situations were different because Beltran did not set up the clinic, decide how to attract patients, or determine which services would be performed, and he was a mere employee with no managerial responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-8\">The government added that \u201cit would be really unfair\u201d to apply the enhancement to Mendez, not only in comparison to the universe of Medicare-fraud cases, but because Mendez had been involved in only the first of the six related clinics involved in this overall investigation. Furthermore, in the 22 convictions that had taken place so far with respect to this investigation, no defendant received a sophisticated-means enhancement, even if his or her fraud was more sophisticated than Mendez\u2019s, unless he or she was involved in operating more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>than one clinic and using \u201cnominee\u201d owners to conceal the principals\u2019 identities. The government acknowledged that the use of shell corporations to send some of his money to a foreign country was \u201cnot ... irrelevant,\u201d but it considered the fact that he had operated the clinic openly in his own name to be more significant. It opined that evidence of money laundering was not the same as evidence that the fraud was sophisticated in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">Mendez added that the other climes\u2019 use of nominee owners affected the issues of concealment and complexity of the \u201csetup,\u201d but in the case of Research Center, everyone\u2019s real name was used. He further asserted that the shell companies had not been formed for illicit purposes, but, rather, had been formed on the advice of another attorney for the purpose of investing in real estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-6\">The court stated that \u201cthe money in these cases finds its way offshore time and time and time again,\u201d and the reason for that \u201chas to do with concealment and ... ensuring that the defendant is going to be able to enjoy the fruits of the fraud.\u201d The government has difficulty recovering the money in such cases because it is sent offshore. The court concluded that this fact could not be separated from the fraud. The facts of the case reflected sophistication in both the execution and the concealment of the disposition of the funds. There was overlap with the role-adjustment determination, as the offense involved the formation of a corporation, a decision as to its business purpose of providing sophisticated medical services, a business model of creating a fiction that those services were being provided, and execution of a charade that involved recruiting and paying patients, as well as creating tens of thousands of documents to support $20 million in billing. The scheme was made more sophisticated by the use of shell corporations to distribute funds and move the money offshore. Thus, the enhancement applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-8\">Both parties recommended a low-end guideline sentence. Mendez and his attorney both declined to make any further statement before the court imposed sentence. The court stated that it had \u201cconsidered the statements of the parties, the presentence report containing the advisory guidelines, and the statutory factors.\u201d Mendez was sentenced to 78 months\u2019 imprisonment and ordered to pay restitution. Mendez objected only to the sophisticated-means enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-10\">We review for clear error the district court\u2019s finding that the defendant used sophisticated means. <em>United States v. Robertson, </em>493 F.3d 1322, 1329-30 (11th Cir.2007). \u201cA factual finding is clearly erroneous when[,] although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1330 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-11\">Section 2Bl.l(b)(9) imposes a two-level increase \u201c[i]f (A) the defendant relocated ... a fraudulent scheme to another jurisdiction to evade law enforcement or regulatory officials; (B) a substantial part of a fraudulent scheme was committed from outside the United States; or (C) the offense otherwise involved sophisticated means.\u201d Application Note 8 explains,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEr\">\u201c[Sophisticated means\u201d means especially complex or especially intricate offense conduct pertaining to the execution or concealment of an offense. For example, in a telemarketing scheme, locating the main office of the scheme in one jurisdiction but locating soliciting operations in another jurisdiction ordinarily indicates sophisticated means. Conduct such as hiding assets or transactions, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>both, through the use of fictitious entities, corporate shells, or offshore financial accounts also ordinarily indicates sophisticated means.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.8(B)). There is no requirement that each of the defendant\u2019s actions be sophisticated; it is sufficient if the totality of the scheme was sophisticated. <em>United States v. Ghertler, </em>605 F.3d 1256, 1267 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">In each case in which we have upheld the application of a sophisticated-means enhancement, the defendant used false identities, fraudulent accounts, or fictitious entities to conceal his participation in the scheme or to execute and conceal the fraudulent transactions. <em>See id. </em>at 1260, 1267-68 (noting that defendant developed inside information on victim companies, impersonated high-ranking company officials, forged false company documents, referenced a confidential internal account number, and used unwitting third parties to receive the cash transfers); <em>United States v. Jennings, </em>599 F.3d 1241, 1246, 1248, 1254 (11th Cir.2010) (describing the formation and use of two fictitious insurance companies to issue illegitimate insurance, the use of third-party administrators to shield the fictitious entities from claimants and regulators, and the provision of misleading certificates of insurance to conceal the fraud); <em>United States v. Clarke, </em>562 F.3d 1158, 1165-66 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 809, 175 L.Ed.2d 560 (2009) (upholding U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2T1.1(b)(2) enhancement because defendant concealed tax fraud by depositing salary into accounts not registered in his own name, using those accounts to pay his personal creditors, and instructing his employers to pay his insurance premiums directly to the carriers); <em>Robertson, </em>493 F.3d at 1327, 1331-32 (upholding U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(5)(C) enhancement where defendant in software-purchasing scam used false names and addresses and fictitious entities to obtain discounts and avoid payments); <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>491 F.3d 1306, 1315 (11th Cir.2007) (upholding \u00a7 2Tl.l(b)(2) enhancement where defendant used campaign accounts and credit cards issued to other people in order to conceal cash expenditures in an attempt to impede the discovery of the existence and extent of his tax fraud).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-9\">For a period of about one year, Research Center employees prepared and signed forms in which they falsely purported to have treated certain patients with prescription drugs, and Mendez and CC1 submitted those claims to Medicare. Mendez and CC1 sometimes received advice from \u00d1ap\u00f3les as to which treatments would garner higher payments. Caridad and Barbara recruited patients, and the patients, Caridad, Barbara, and \u00d1ap\u00f3les each received kickbacks for their participation. Mendez was openly identified as an officer of Research Center, and either he or this then-wife was openly identified as an officer of the three shell companies\u2014 Research Center Phase I-IV, Olmen, and Efol \u2014 discussed by the district court. None of the three shell companies was involved in carrying out or concealing the fraudulent billing. These facts do not bear the hallmarks of sophistication that we have identified in previous cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-10\">Nevertheless, the three shell companies were used to manage a portion of the proceeds of the fraud, either as legitimate holding companies or as fictional money-laundering entities, and $500,000 of those proceeds were eventually transferred to an overseas account. The district court referred to this activity as \u201cthe execution and the concealment of the disposition of the funds,\u201d which it considered to be part of the overall scheme because \u201cthe fraud stops where the money ends.\u201d Mendez does not argue on appeal that the district court erred in considering these facts as part of its sophisticated-means analysis. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number><em>See United States v. Cunningham, </em>161 F.3d 1343, 1344 (11th Cir.1998) (holding that issues not raised on appeal are abandoned). Therefore, the language in Application Note 8 that addresses the use of \u201ccorporate shells or offshore financial accounts\u201d in the scheme is satisfied. Although the applicability of the enhancement is a very close question, we are not \u201cleft with [a] definite and firm conviction\u201d that the district court erred in applying the sophisticated-means enhancement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Robertson, </em>493 F.3d at 1329-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">We review a sentence for reasonableness in a two-step process. First, we must ensure that the district court did not commit any significant procedural error, such as failing to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors or failing to explain the sentence adequately. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Here, Mendez objected to the application of the sophisticated-means enhancement, but he did not object that the district court had failed to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Therefore, to the extent that Mendez intends to raise a procedural challenge to the court\u2019s consideration of the sentencing factors, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Massey, </em>443 F.3d 814, 818 (11th Cir.2006). Under this standard, Mendez must show (1) an error that (2) is plain, (3) affects substantial rights, and (4) seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1776, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-7\">Second, we review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence under an abuse-of-diseretion standard. <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1188 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en </em>banc), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(Nov. 24, 2010) (No. 10-727). We will reverse a sentence under this standard only if the district court has made a clear error of judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 1189. The appellant bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-10\">After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), sentencing is a two-step process that requires the district court first to \u201cconsult the Guidelines and correctly calculate the range provided by the Guidelines,\u201d then to consider the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and determine a reasonable sentence. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786. Those factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the sentencing guideline range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to the victims. <em>Id. </em>(discussing \u00a7 3553(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-11\">The sentence must be sufficient, but no greater than necessary, to punish, deter, protect the public, and provide the training and care outlined in the statute. \u00a7 3553(a). In <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1196-97, we rejected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>the term \u201cparsimony principle\u201d to describe this requirement, noting its tendency \u201cto slant the discussion toward shorter sentences\u201d and pointing out that \u201c[t]he requirement is not merely that a sentencing court ... be stingy enough to avoid one that is too long, but also that it be generous enough to avoid one that is too short.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">Here, Mendez submitted a sentencing memorandum to the district court that discussed his background and his remorse-fulness. After resolution of the sophisticated-means objections, both parties argued that a sentence at the low end of the guideline range would be reasonable. The court stated that it had considered the parties\u2019 statements, the presentencing investigation report, the advisory guideline range, and the statutory sentencing factors. It then imposed the low-end guideline sentence requested by the parties. Mendez did not request clarification as to the court\u2019s weighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Therefore, to the extent that Mendez intends to raise a procedural challenge, he has not shown that the court committed plain error. <em>See Massey, </em>443 F.3d at 818.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">To the extent that Mendez challenges the weighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, most of his argument focuses on the district court\u2019s decision to apply the sophisticated-means enhancement and the fact that not all of the related defendants received the same enhancement. This argument is inapposite to a discussion of substantive reasonableness. <em>See Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786 (noting that correct calculation of the guideline range and consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors are separate steps in the sentencing process). Mendez\u2019s contention that the \u201cparsimony principle\u201d constitutes a cap on the permissible length of a sentence is incorrect. <em>See Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1197. Otherwise, Mendez merely makes the conclusory assertion that the district court did not adequately consider his background, his lack of a criminal history, the improbability that he will reoffend, \u201cthe circumstances underlying and precipitating the offense,\u201d or \u201cthe facts of this individual case.\u201d He does not explain why a 78-month sentence, at the low end of his guideline range, is excessive in light of these factors, or which relevant facts and circumstances he believes to have been overlooked. Mendez has not shown that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in its assessment of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See id. </em>at 1189. The 78-month sentence was not an abuse of the court\u2019s discretion. <em>See id. </em>at 1188.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Mendez\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b965-8\">. Mendez does not argue on appeal that the district court erroneously conflated the sophisticated-means analysis and the aggravating-role analysis. For this reason, and because we uphold the enhancement on the basis of the shell-company transactions, we do not address whether the district court's reasoning in this regard constituted impermissible double-counting. <em>See Cunningham, </em>161 F.3d at 1344.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
