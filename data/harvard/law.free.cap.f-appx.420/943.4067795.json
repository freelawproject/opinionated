Paul appeals his convictions for possession of 5 kilograms or more of cocaine with intent to distribute and possession of 50 grams or more of cocaine base with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Paul argues that the district court abused its discretion by instructing the jury concerning his pretrial flight because the Government presented insufficient evidence to warrant the instruction. Further, Paul argues that the district court abused its discretion by summarily denying Paul\u2019s untimely motion for a new trial as he believes the inclusion of the flight instruction necessitated a new, untainted proceeding. After a review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm Paul\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-22\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s jury instructions for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>541 F.3d 1087, 1089 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam). An erroneous jury instruction constitutes grounds for reversal only if a reasonable likelihood exists that the error affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>Id.; see </em>Fed.R.Evid. 103(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-23\">\u201cEvidence of flight is admissible to demonstrate consciousness of guilt and thereby guilt.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>541 F.3d at 1089 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b969-24\">Analytically, flight is an admission by conduct. Its probative value as circumstantial evidence of guilt depends upon the degree of confidence with which four inferences can be drawn: (1) from the defendant\u2019s behavior to flight; (2) from flight to consciousness of guilt; (3) from consciousness of guilt to consciousness of guilt concerning the crime charged; and (4) from consciousness of guilt concerning the crime charged to actual guilt of the crime charged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b969-25\"><em>United States v. Myers, </em>550 F.2d 1036, 1049 (5th Cir.1977).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Use of the flight instruction is appropriate if the government \u201cmake[s] certain that each link in the chain of inferences\u201d is \u201csturdily supported.\u201d <em>See United States v. Wright, </em>392 F.3d 1269, 1278 (11th Cir.2004). If sufficient evidence is presented so that the jury could reasonably conclude that the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>dant fled to avoid the charged crime, the district court does not abuse its discretion by giving a flight instruction. <em>Williams, </em>541 F.3d at 1089.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by giving the flight instruction. In October 2007, Paul was arrested for the conduct at issue, arraigned, and released pending trial. The Government presented uncontested testimony that, prior to trial, Paul fled the jurisdiction to the Bahamas and was arrested there in June 2008. Paul\u2019s travel and failure to appear violated the terms of his bond. In light of the charges pending against him and the timing of his departure, the district court\u2019s inclusion of a flight instruction was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-6\">Paul next argues that the district court abused its discretion by summarily denying Paul\u2019s motion for a new trial, which he filed on the eve of sentencing and more than 11 months after the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-7\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a new trial under the abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>United States v. Sweat, </em>555 F.3d 1364, 1367 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam). Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33 provides that a \u201ccourt may vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of justice so requires.\u201d \u201cThat is a broad standard. It is not limited to cases where the district court concludes that its prior ruling, upon which it bases the new trial, was legally erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v. Vicaria, </em>12 F.3d 195, 198 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-8\">At the time of Paul\u2019s conviction, motions for a new trial were required to be filed within 7 days after the verdict or finding of guilty. Fed.R.Crim.P. 33(b)(2) (2005) (amended 2009). The district court in this case granted Paul an extension, allowing him to file such a motion within 90 days, i.e., by June 2009. Paul filed his motion for a new trial in March 2010. Even if otherwise untimely, the district court may, on a party\u2019s motion, extend the time to file a motion for a new trial if the defendant \u201cfailed to act because of excusable neglect.\u201d <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 45(b)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-10\">Here, the district court did not specify its reasons for denying Paul\u2019s motion for a new trial. Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that excusable neglect led to the extraordinarily late filing, the motion lacked merit because Paul failed to show that the interest of justice required a new trial. As described above, the Government presented sufficient, uncontested evidence to warrant the flight instruction. Because Paul failed to show that the interest of justice required a new trial, the district court did not abuse its discretion by summarily denying Paul\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b969-17\">. Pursuant to <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), all former Fifth Circuit cases handed down before October 1, 1981 serve as binding precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
