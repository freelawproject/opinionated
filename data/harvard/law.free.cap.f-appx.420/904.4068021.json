The district court thereafter sentenced him to imprisonment for a total of 300 months: 120 months on Count One, and consecutive terms of 240 months and 60 months on Counts Three and Two, respectively, to run concurrently with the Count One sentence. Musson now appeals his sentences, contending that the total term of imprisonment, 300 months, is procedurally and substantively unreasonable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b931-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-13\">When reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence, we apply the deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). After the Supreme Court handed down <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we established a two-part process for district courts to use in determining sentences. <em>United States v. McBride, </em>511 F.3d 1293, 1297 (11th Cir. 2007). First, the district court must consult and correctly calculate the sentence range prescribed by the Sentencing Guidelines. Second, the district court must fashion a reasonable sentence by considering the factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b931-14\">When reviewing for procedural reasonableness, we ensure that the district court (1) properly calculated the Guidelines sentence range, (2) treated the Guidelines as advisory, (3) considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, (4) did not select a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, and (5) adequately explained the chosen sentence. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. Moreover, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c) requires the district court to state its reasons for the sentence in open court. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(1). In complying with \u00a7 3553(c), \u201c[t]he sentencing judge should set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). However, \u201c[t]he appropriateness of ... what to say, depends upon [the] circumstances.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b932-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>After we determine that the district court\u2019s sentencing decision is procedurally sound, we then review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence, again under the abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. \u201c[T]here is a range of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). We consider the final sentence, in its entirety, in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1351 (11th Cir.2006). The district court is \u201cpermitted to attach great weight to one factor over others.\u201d <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1237 (11th Cir.) (quotation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2847, 174 L.Ed.2d 566 (2009). In arriving at a reasonable sentence, the district court shall impose a sentence that is \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary,\u201d to comply with the need for the sentence imposed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-5\">(A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-6\">(B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-7\">(C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-8\">(D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b932-9\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). Other factors that the sentencing court should consider are the following: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the kinds of sentences available; (3) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (4) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (5) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities among similarly situated defendants; and (6) the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786 (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-11\">Here, we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing a total sentence of 300 months\u2019 imprisonment, as that sentence was procedurally and substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-13\">We review questions of statutory interpretation <em>de novo. United States v. Krawczak, </em>331 F.3d 1302, 1305 (11th Cir.2003). Section 924(c) of Title 18 of the United States Code provides that a minimum term of five years will be imposed upon conviction as a consecutive sentence \u201c[ejxcept to the extent that a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided by [\u00a7 924(c) itself] or by any other provision of law.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). The Supreme Court recently has interpreted the \u201cexcept\u201d language under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) as mandating a consecutive five-year sentence upon one\u2019s conviction under that count, unless some other law covering the conduct proscribed by \u00a7 924(c) adds an even greater statutory mandatory minimum, regardless of whether the defendant also received a higher mandatory-minimum sentence for other counts unrelated to the \u00a7 924(c) conduct. <em>Abbott v. United States, </em>562 U.S. -, -, 131 S.Ct. 18, 23, 178 L.Ed.2d 348 (2010); <em>accord United States v. Segarra, </em>582 F.3d 1269, 1272-73 (11th Cir.2009) (holding that the plain language of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) authorizes a district court to impose a consecutive sentence to any other term of imprisonment imposed under a different section), <em>cert. denied, </em>(U.S. Nov. 29, 2010) (No. 09-8536). We reject Musson\u2019s \u00a7 924(c) argument that the district court erred in imposing a consecutive sentence under Count Two because the Supreme Court has conclusively held to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>Based on a review of the parties\u2019 briefs and the record, we affirm Musson\u2019s 300-month total sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b931-11\">. Musson also contends that the district court erred in imposing a consecutive sentence on Count Two under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) because such sentence contradicts the \u201cexcept\u201d clause of that statute. He concedes that our precedent holds otherwise, but raises the point so that he will be able to present it to the Supreme Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
