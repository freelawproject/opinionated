So pointing, respondent insists: that to find that these two \u201csorry\u201d employees were discharged for union activity and not for cause is a perversion of the record; and that to require their reinstatement will subvert rather than advance the policies of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-13\">Impressed as we are with the vigor and resourcefulness of respondent\u2019s counsel, both in brief and upon oral argument, where he almost had the skill to make the worse cause seem the better, and reluctant as we are to require by our decree the reinstatement of these two admittedly dishonest and trifling employees, we are yet compelled to agree with examiner and board that the evidence, circumstantial and other, supports the examiner\u2019s findings in all respects. We think it especially clear that the sequences the record reveals fully support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>his finding that Williams and Folsom, the spearheads among the employees, of the union drive, became marked men and as such were discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">Since we are of the clear opinion that the case was simply a fact ease in which the evidence amply sustains the findings of the examiner, it will serve no useful purpose for us to array and discuss the evidence in respect to any of the charges. As to Folsom, the fact that once discharged for dishonesty, he was taken back on condition that he would act as a secret spy upon, and report the dishonesty of, his fellow workmen, and that when, after a week, he was again discharged, respondent, without proving that there was any of which Folsom knew, complains that he had not reported any stealing, does not in our opinion advantage respondent\u2019s side of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">The order will, therefore, be enforced as written without any fixed tenure being afforded Folsom and Williams thereby and without prejudice, of course, to the absolute right of Respondent at any time to discharge Folsom, Williams, or any other employee for any cause except as prohibited by the act.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b976-8\">. 106 N.L.R.B. No. 86.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b976-9\">. \u201cWe submit that, in view of respondent\u2019s manifest union animus, the prominent part taken by Folsom and Williams in the organizational drive, their precipitate discharge a few days later, and the refusal of Parkman and Vann to assign a definite reason for tbeir discharge\u201d and that \u201cin striking contrast to the reluctance of respondent\u2019s officials to state any reason for the discharges at the time they occurred, a variety of reasons was proffered at the hearing to justify their acts\u201d, and that \u201cthe several reasons assigned individually collapse upon examination.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
