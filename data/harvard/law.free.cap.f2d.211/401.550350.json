This contract provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AncS\">\u201cThe movement contemplated will be done at the sole risk of the \u2018craft to be towed\u2019 and its cargo, and neither the boats and/or any other equipment used in said service nor the owner, charterer or hirer thereof shall be liable for any loss or damage to the \u2018craft to be towed\u2019 or its cargo nor for any damage done by the \u2018craft to be towed\u2019 however occurring.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AP6T\">\u201cThe masters and crews and employees of all boats and/or other equipment assisting the \u2018craft to be towed\u2019, shall, in the performance of said service, become and be the servants of the \u2018craft to be towed\u2019, regardless of whether the \u2018craft to be towed\u2019 assists in the service in any way and irrespective of whether they be aboard the \u2018craft to be towed\u2019 or in command thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ahb\">In May, 1944, appellee\u2019s Towboat Cairo took in tow eight unmanned barges belonging to various persons, and proceeded up the Mississippi River from New Orleans. The Bisso No. 9 was one of these barges. None of the barges had any motive power or steering mechanism.</p>\n<p id=\"A_D\">Because of high water and dangerous conditions prevailing in the Mississippi River above Vicksburg, the Cairo\u2019s tow was up near that point, and moved alternately in groups of four barges, of \u201cdoubles tripped\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"Ar60\">While attempting to negotiate the center span of the Greenville Highway Bridge, the Cairo negligently brought her tow of four barges into collision with a bridge pier; and appellant\u2019s barge was lost in the collision as a direct result of the Cairo\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"AS2D\">The District Court, making full find-ings of fact and conclusions of law, and filing an opinion,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> held that the collision was attributable to the negligence of the Cairo; that the \u201crelease towage agree-ment\u201d in question did not relieve the Cairo from liability for negligence; but that the \u201cpilotage clause\u201d was broad enough to make the Cairo\u2019s crew appellant\u2019s servants and to free appellee from responsibility for their negligence. The libel was accordingly dismissed,</p>\n<p id=\"A0W\">' Appellant raises no question of fact, It rests its case on the facts found by the district judge and his conclusion that the first clause, \u201csole risk and release clause\u201d, of the towage contract was, under The Syracuse, 12 Wall. 167, 79 U.S. 167, 20 L.Ed. 382, and The Wash Gray, (Compania De Navegacion, Interior, S. A., v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co.) 277 U.S. 66, 48 S.Ct. 459, 72 L.Ed. 787, cases invalid. So resting it, it is here insisting that the court erred in holding the second clause, the so-called \u201cpilotage clause\u201d, in the contract, providing that the personnel of the tug are to be deemed \u201cthe servants of the tow\u201d, releases the tug from liability for loss of the tow by negligence the mas^er \u00b0t the tug.</p>\n<p id=\"A58G\">Appellee, opposing this view, urges upon us that, far from its being clear, as appellant argues, that a pilotage clause finds justification only where the tow is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>manned and under its own power, the situation of a tug with a dumb tow makes it more necessary for it to relieve itself of what may approach an insurer\u2019s liability.</p>\n<p id=\"AR9\">As to the \u201csole risk\u201d or \u201crelease\u201d clause, which the court below held invalid, appellee insists that this clause also was valid and effective. Arguing that the cases cited by the district judge in support of his view that the clause was invalid, are not authority for the holding, appellee, citing The Oceanica, 2 Cir., 170 F. 893 and Ten Eyck v. Director General of Railroads, 2 Cir., 267 F. 974, insists that all that the Syracuse and Wash Gray cases held and all that they stand for is that the exculpatoi-y provision denied effect in each of them was not intended by the parties to encompass negligence or at least they did not make this sufficiently clear. It argues in short that these two cases are but applications of the general rule that, while releases from liability for negligence are, except as to common carriers, bailees, etc., generally valid, they are construed strictly against the party favored, and, unless clearly and unequivocally showing that they include negligence, they will not be construed to in-elude it.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> So arguing, it insists that the questioned clause in The Syracuse failed to evince an unequivocal intention to in-elude the negligence of the tower in the risk assumed by the tow, and that the same is true of the release clause involved in The Wash Gray.</p>\n<p id=\"AUj\">In strong support of these views, the brief <em>amici curiae, </em>basing its arguments on the settled law that a tug is not a common carrier when it engages in tow-age, The Margaret, 94 U.S. 494, 24 L. Ed. 146, and that the relationship of bailor \u2014 bailee does not exist between tug and its tow,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> insists that if the tug is not a common carrier or bailee as to its tow, there is no reason in logic or in law why it should not be permitted full freedom of contract in limiting or restricting its liability.</p>\n<p id=\"Aji\">Urging&gt; therefore, that there should be&gt; and ig&gt; no difficulty in the way of parties agreeing as they please in cases gueb ag ^bjS) and t;lrat if the parties to a eontract unequivocally shift the liability for logg or damage to the tow from ^be owner 0f ^he tug to the owner of the toW; there can be no reagon for holding bbe gbjft js invalid, they insist that it would be difficult&gt; if not impossible, gnd apter language for doing so than that employed here. So insisting, they urge upon us that&gt; wh\u00fce tbe digtrict judge was right in exonerating the tug under the \u00abpilotage\u00bb clause&gt; he erred in folding that the release towage agreement did not releage the tug from negli_ gence</p>\n<p id=\"Atu\">We find ourselves in general agreement with the approach of appellee and <em>amici curiae </em>to the questions presented and the positions taken by them below and here, that not merely one, as found by the district judge, but both of the clauses relied on are valid and effective to release the appellee from liability, and that on both grounds the decree should be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"at7-dedup-0\">.
