Bail was issued in the amount of $50,000 pending a determination of the jurisdictional question. After a hearing, the court rendered a decision which did not reach the first reason mentioned, but nevertheless ordered Artukovic\u2019s release upon the ground last named, subject to a $5,000 bond pending appeal. Artukovic v. Boyle, D.C.S.D.Cal., 107 F.Supp. 11. The United States has filed its brief as amicus curiae requesting reversal of the district court judgment. We quote in the margin the statement in the Government\u2019s brief at page 4, as to the \u201cInterest of the United States\u201d.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">We start with the admitted fact that extradition from the United States to a foreign country may be accomplished \u201conly during the existence of any treaty of extradition with such foreign government.\u201d Title 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3181. See, also, Factor v. Laubenheimer, 1933, 290 U.S. 276, 287, 54 S.Ct. 191, 78 L.Ed. 315.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">All parties agree that the \u201cKingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes\u201d changed its governmental structure somewhat and its official title to \u201cKingdom of Yugoslavia\u201d in 1928, and thereafter to the \u201cFederal Peoples\u2019 Republic of Yugoslavia\u201d in 1945, and that these changes were internal and political changes and did not affect the validity of any treaty which was effective under the government of <em>\u201cKingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes\u201d.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Therefore, if the treaty between the United States and Serbia <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>survived as an effective treaty between the United States and the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, it survived as an effective treaty between the United States and the Federal Peoples\u2019 Republic of Yugoslavia, and is effective in the extradition proceedings pending before the United States Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">After an exhaustive hearing and consideration of authorities and official documents, the district court found that there was no treaty of extradition in existence between the demanding nation and the United States, and that there never has been. It was freely admitted by all parties that such a treaty had existed between the United States and Serbia dated May 17, 1902, but Artu-kovic claims that when, in 1918, several principalities or nations, inclusive of the Kingdom of Serbia and the Kingdom of Montenegro, combined under the name of the \u201cKingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes\u201d, a new nation was born which had no carry-over political relations to any of the old governments; and that, therefore, the United States-Serbian Extradition Treaty of 1902 which the demanding government and the United States Marshal claim is in effect between the United States and Yugoslavia, has no validity. On the other hand, the United States Marshal and Consul General of Yugoslavia, as well as the United States by its Amicus Curiae brief, assert that the sovereignty of Serbia, as that country existed upon the date of the United States-Serbian Extradition Treaty of 1902, has continued to exist uninterruptedly and that the combination of countries under the name of \u201cKingdom of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes\u201d was not and is not an entirely new nation but the same country under the change of official title, and is a continuation of the Serbia of 1902 as a Greater Serbia.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">The historic events which lead to the different views we have just set out are not in issue. Whether these events support one or the other of such views is the issue. Since these events are proved by agreement as to fact and by official and authoritative documents, we are in as favorable a position to decide the issue as was the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-11\">The sovereign nation of the Federal Peoples\u2019 Republic of Yugoslavia is the combination of the independent sovereign states of the Kingdom of Serbia and of Montenegro and the Serbian, Croatian and Slovene provinces formerly under the government of the Empire of Austria-Hungary. We have reproduced the portion of appellant\u2019s (Ivancevic\u2019s) opening brief which names and gives a limited political and ethnic reference to each.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We have concluded that the factual statements therein are accurate in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>sofar as they touch the issues of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">The first title assumed by the combination of countries was the \u201cKingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes\u201d, which was subsequently changed by internal politics to the \u201cKingdom of Yugoslavia\u201d, and later to the \u201cFederal Peoples\u2019 Republic of Yugoslavia\u201d. The people of each of these combining countries are preponderantly of Yugoslavic or South Slavic blood and throughout a very, very long period of time they have been keenly conscious of their interrelation and have harbored an unabated ambition to live as a part of a United Yugoslav state. The upheaval in Europe, owing to the First World War, shook several Slav provinces from the old Monarchy of Austria-Hungary and, some time before, other Slav-peopled portions of Turkey had been separated from that country. The opportunity for unity of the South Slavs was embraced and finally accomplished. Serbia, an area of Central Europe peopled by Slavs in the great majority, achieved complete independence in 1878 and was an important going state before and during World War I, with international recognition and official representation in the capitals of the world. Montenegro was a small though independent nation. The other units in the combination, though not full fledged nations, were <em>at the time of </em>the combination free from domination by neighbor countries.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">We recite here certain historic facts which, we think, are critical to the issue. On December 7, 1914, Serbia promulgated a statement in which it characterized its part in World War I as,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-11\">\" * * * a struggle for the liberation and unification of all our un-liberated brethren, Serbs, Croats and Slovenes <em>* * </em><footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-12\">On May 6, 1915, The Yugoslav Committee in London, composed of Yugoslav refugees, announced that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-13\">\u201c * * * the struggle of Serbia and <em>Montenegro is not a </em>struggle of conquest to expand their borders; these two Serbian states are protagonists in the liberation of all Yugoslavs and their task is the task of all of us.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-14\">On July 20, 1917, a Committee of Yugoslavs and representatives of the Serbian government announced from the Island of Corfu affirmation of their principles as,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-15\">\u201c * * * the only and inalienable demand of our people * * * the basis of the principle of free self-determination of peoples, to be lib<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>erated from all foreign enslavement and united in one free, national and independent state.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AGiF\">A few days later, the \u201cMontenegrin Committee for National Unification\u201d announced its acceptance of the Corfu Declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">On October 6, 1918, the \u201cNational Council of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs\u201d was organized as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-6\">\u201c * * * the political body representing all Slovenes, Croats and Serbs * * * \u201d.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">Shortly afterward, Serbia recognized the National Council as the lawful government of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, and on <em>November 24, </em>1918, the National Council resolved to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-18\">\u201c * * * proclaim the unification of the State of the Slovenes, Croats and Serbs * * * with the Kingdom of Serbia and Montenegro into a unified State of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes * * <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-19\">and Montenegro agreed a few days later. Many events of importance to the issue occurred between the dates we have specified, all of them trending toward the same end. The culmination seems well illustrated by the exchange of official communications from the Serbian government to the United States Secretary of State and the Secretary\u2019s reply thereto.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-20\">In 1921, United States Secretary of State Hughes, in answer to a United States citizen, wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>\u201c * * * No formal understanding has been reached with the Government of the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes as to the application of these agreements to the territory of that country which formerly belonged to the Austro-Hungarian Empire. It is the opinion of the Department that the treaties may properly be regarded as applicable to that territory.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aq3\">The trial court discounts the weight of this opinion because it was given in the form of private communication in a non-adversary proceeding. Yet it must be pointed out that the communication in question was not private communication, but an official one of the Secretary of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>State, as such, with respect to a matter peculiarly within his official charge. And but a short time thereafter, Secretary of State Hughes received a communication from the Yugoslav Charg\u00e9 d\u2019Affair es on September 29, 1921, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-5\">\u201c * * * The Government of the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes considers the treaties and conventions concluded between the Kingdom of Serbia and the United States as applicable to the whole territory of the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes as constituted at the present.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Thereafter, the Department, in reply to inquiries, stated that the treaties with Serbia were in force and applicable to the new Kingdom, including territory not part of Serbia before the World War of 1914-18.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">Hyde, in his International Law, Chiefly as Interpreted and Applied by the United States, Vol. 2, page 1535, says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-8\">\u201cIt was logical and natural that the Government of the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, should have acknowledged to that of the United States in 1921, that it considered the treaties and conventions concluded between the Kingdom of Serbia and the United States as applicable to the whole territory of the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, as then constituted. The latter Kingdom embodied, in a territorial sense, the enlargement of the former Kingdom, and was the same State with a bigger body. It was also reasonable to contend, as did the United States in substance in 1921, that that Kingdom should regard those agreements as applicable to its territory which had formerly belonged to the Austro-Hun-garian Empire. * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-15\">Hackworth in \u201cDigest of International Law\u201d, Vol. V, page 375, makes the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-16\">\u201cIt is conceded that the present Kingdom of Yugoslavia has replaced and absorbed the Kingdom of Serbia, and that the convention above referred to [Convention of Commerce and Navigation of October 14, 1881, 2 Treaties, etc. (Malloy, 1910) 1613] is now in full force and effect between Yugoslavia and the United States\u201d, citing Lukich v. Department of Labor and Industries, 1934, 176 Wash. 221, 223, 29 P.2d 388, 389; Urbus v. State Compensation Com\u2019r, 1933, 113 W.Va. 563, 169 S.E. 164.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-17\">That Serbia was the nucleus around and to which the other countries would and did adhere in a united nation is further supported by the proclamation of Prince Regent Alexander of Yugoslavia, Christmas 1919, in which he felicitated the people of his country upon the culmination of Slav unity in government. We quote from the proclamation in the margin.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>The uncontrovertible fact before us is that a national union of the South Slav peoples was effected with Serbia as the nucleus. Serbia took an active part in the transitions which we have sketched; the King of Serbia continued as King of the union; Belgrade remained as the capital; the rights guaranteed by the Serbian Constitution were proclaimed as the rights of every person within the union; the foreign legations and war missions of the Kingdom of Serbia were authorized to act for the union. Both the United States and Yugoslavia acted and have continued to act in accord with the theory that the entity as it existed after the union was the political successor of the original Serbia with international political compacts continuing.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">It does not appear that either the United States or Yugoslavia has ever before requested extradition from the other country, and this might be considered significant. However, in view of what we have already said, we think all possible significance on that score has disappeared. There is another reason, however, why it certainly is of no moment.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-12\">In 1882, the United States and Serbia negotiated a Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, 22 Stat. 963,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and also a Consular Treaty, 22 Stat. 968.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Those treaties have continuously been adhered to and recognized by both governments. The reasons for their continuing validity apply equally to the Treaty of Extradition.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-13\">Difference of opinion exists as to whether the combined country was <em>new, </em>or a continuance of Serbia.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-14\">But, as we have already stated, we are of the opinion that the combination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>countries into the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, and then by internal political action into \u201cFederal Peoples\u2019 Republic of Yugoslavia\u201d was formed by a movement of the Slav people to govern themselves in one sovereign nation, with Serbia as the central or nucleus nation. Great changes in the going government were in the planning, and were brought about, but the combination was not an entirely new sovereignty without parentage. But even if it is appropriate to designate the combination as a <em>new </em>country, the fact that it started to function under the Serbian constitution as the home government and under Serbian legations and consular service in foreign countries, and has continued to act under Serbian treaties of Commerce and Navigation and the Consular treaty, is conclusive proof that if the combination constituted a new country it was the successor of Serbia in its international rights and obligations.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">We hold that the district court was in error in holding that the treaty of extradition entered into by and between the United States and Serbia in 1902 does not constitute a valid and subsisting treaty between the United States and the Federal Peoples' Republic of Yugoslavia.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">We place our decision upon our conclusion that the facts, independent of their political implications, do not support the decision of the district court. Nevertheless, we are not without realization of the high importance of such implications. From every practical and logical standpoint every nation must speak to every other nation through its Chief of State.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Here, the President, as the Chief of State, in recognizing the continuing validity of treaties between the United States and Serbia has acted upon a reasonable basis of fact peculiarly within his sphere of authority.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">There is no exact formula by which it can be determined that a change of a nation\u2019s fortunes amounts to a continuance of the old or the beginning of a new nation, and there can be no better <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>equipped vehicle for decision than the Chiefs of State of the countries concerned. If their agreed decisions, when based upon supporting facts, are not conclusive, they should at least weigh very heavily.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> As the Supreme Court said in Terlinden v. Ames, 1902, 184 U.S. 270, 22 S.Ct. 484, 46 L.Ed. 534, an extradition ease closely resembling the instant case: \u201cAnd without considering whether extinguished treaties can be renewed by tacit consent under our Constitution, we think that on the question whether this treaty has ever been terminated, governmental action in respect to it must be regarded as of controlling importance.\u201d 184 U.S. at page 285, 22 S.Ct. at page 490.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-15\">In our case, open recognition of treaties between the two countries has continued for many years <footnotemark>24</footnotemark> without United States congressional interference, a fact negative in nature, yet highly consistent with the conclusion that the treaties exist in full effectiveness.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>The judgment is reversed and the proceedings are remanded to the district court with instructions to find that the extradition treaty executed by and between the United States and Serbia in 1902 is a present, valid and effective treaty between the United States and the Federal Peoples\u2019 Republic of Yugoslavia, and has been a valid and effective treaty continuously since its execution between the United States and Serbia and through the changes in official title of the latter state to its present title of Federal Peoples\u2019 Republic of Yugoslavia. Upon remand the district court will consider and adjudicate the issues raised by the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b617-18\">.

The proceedings in this case involve the effect of a change in government or a change in the geographical limits, or both, of one party thereto upon the treaty relations of the United States with other governments and not alone its treaty relations with Yugoslavia. The Executive Branch of the Government has proceeded heretofore on the theory that, in the absence of the complete absorption of one of the high contracting parties to the treaty by a third country, a mere change in the form of government or the expansion or contraction of the geographical bound-ries of that high contracting party did not affect the termination of the treaty relations with that party. Consequently, unless the changed conditions were such as to suggest the desirability of new treaties, the prior treaties have been considered as remaining in full force and effect. This practice has been in conformity with the generally accepted principles of international practice and is believed to be sound. A departure from the established practice after this late date could cause great confusion since there is probably no country now existing with which the United States has concluded treaties that has not undergone some change, either with respect to the form of its government or with respect to its boundaries. Heretofore the Department of State has been looked to for a determination of the question whether a specific treaty is still in effect after such changes in government or boundaries. The decision of the District Court, if not reversed, will preclude such a determination. \u201cAs the decision, if not reversed, will affect the entire treaty structure, it is believed that the Government\u2019s interest in the case transcends in importance the interest of the parties to these proceedings whose sole interest is the matter of the possible extradition of the appellee. The Executive Branch of the Government is not presently concerned with this phase of the case and will not be concerned with it unless and until it shall have been certified to the Department of State by the extradition magistrate pursuant to the provisions of [Title] 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3184.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b618-12\">.

Appellants\u2019 Opening Brief at page 18: \u201cSerbia (or Servia, which was then the common spelling) was in 1901 an independent, sovereign state. One of several contiguous areas populated by Yugo, or South, Slavs (Serbs, Croats, Slovenes, Macedonians, Montenegrins are South /or Yugo/Slav nations), Serbia\u2019s absolute independenee was recognized by the Treaty of Berlin in 1878 after centuries of Turkish rule and dependence. As a result of the Balkan Wars of 1912-13, Macedonia was also liberated from the Turks, and the larger part of that area was annexed to Serbia. In 1901, the only other Yugoslav people to have achieved independence were the Montenegrins, who had in fact maintained their independence through the centuries notwithstanding the efforts of the Turks to conquer them. However, Montenegro\u2019s independence was not actually recognized until the Treaty of Berlin in 1878. All other Yugoslav regions continued under foreign rule until 1918, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-13\">\u201c(1) Bosnia and Herzegovina were a Turkish province until 1908, although pursuant to the Treaty of Berlin, they had become an Austrian mandate in 1878 and were occupied and governed by that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>country. In 1908, Bosnia and Herzegovina were annexed by the Austro-Hun-garian Monarchy, of which they became an integral part with limited autonomy in local matters. Klobuk, the village in which the Appellee was born in 1900 is in Herzegovina, not Croatia as the District Court [R. 49] states.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-6\">\u201c(2) Croatia and Slavonia, long under Hungarian domination, were reunited with Hungary under the so-called \u201cCompromise\u201d in 1868, after twenty years of separation, resulting from the Hungarian revolt against Austria in 1848. Integral parts of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, they were permitted only limited autonomy in local matters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-7\">\u201c(3) Dalmatia and Carniola, and Car-inthia, Styria and Istria (we are concerned only with parts of the latter three) were Austrian provinces and integral parts of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy enjoining various degrees of restricted autonomy in local matters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-16\">\u201c(4) Vojvodina (Banat, Backa and Baranja), Medjumurje and Prekomurja were incorporated into Hungary and as such were integral parts of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-17\">\u201cThe unification of the Yugoslavs was effected in 1918 (upon the distintegration of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy resulting from World War I) by the voluntary <em>union with Serbia </em>of Montenegro and the regions of the former Austro-Hungarian Monarchy referred to above.
