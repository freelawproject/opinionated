In addition, it urges upon us that, on the facts of record, libelant\u2019s motion for summary judgment should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-14\">Neither appellant nor appellee makes any point of the fact that the rules of practice in admiralty and maritime cases promulgated by the Supreme Court do not provide for summary judgment procedure. It is true, though, that, by Admiralty Rule 44, it is provided that the district courts may regulate their practice in such a manner, not inconsistent with the rules, as they deem most expedient for the due administration of justice.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b877-15\">While, therefore, our attention is not directed to any general rule, practice, or procedure in the District Court for the Southern District of Florida, adopting, making use of, or otherwise allowing summary judgment procedure in causes in admiralty, the parties and the court agreed to, and by order provided for, its use in this case, and we find nothing inconsistent with the general admiralty rules or erroneous in their having done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-16\">When it comes, however, to the merits of the decision, we think it quite plain that the finding of the district judge will not support the judgment,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and, further, that the case pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>sents issues of fact which cannot be disposed of on summary judgment, and which require a trial on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">The judgment appealed from is, therefore, reversed, and the cause is remanded for such trial, with costs of appeal against the appellee.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b876-25\">.
