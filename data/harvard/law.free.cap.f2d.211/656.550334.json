In Count 2, Harris and one Clifford Bauer were charged with transporting the same automobile on January 17,1953, from Chicago, Illinois, to Indianapolis, Indiana, in violation of the same section of the code. Before trial defendant Har-moved for a severance, and also , , ,, ,, , , moved to require the government to elect n , . , ., .. , the count on which it would proceed. . . . 1 These motions were denied,</p>\n<p id=\"pAcO\">trial, at the close of its case, ^he government moved to dismiss the char\u00a3e against defendant Harris as to Ccmnt 2. This motion was granted. Mo-tions for acquittal were made and denied, but there was no motion for severance, and the trial proceeded with Harris be-ing charged only under Count 1 and gauer being charged only under Count 2. Fack defendant testified. The jury found Harris gu\u00fcty as to Count p and gauer as \u00a30 Count 2. The motions of defendant Harris for a judgment of ac-quittal, for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and for a new trial were denied, and judgment of conviction was entered. Defendant Harris appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"AJ9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>The Chevrolet autemobile described in the indictment was owned by Mrs. Ve-nita Mishler of Kansas City, Missouri, who testified that she parked the automobile in a parking lot in that city on the morning of November 25, 1952; that she gave no permission for anyone to use the car; and that she returned later that day and, upon discovering the car was missing, reported it as stolen to the Kansas City Police Department.</p>\n<p id=\"Ayox\">Joseph Young, the operator of the parking lot, testified that on November 25, 1952, he saw defendant Harris in the Mishler automobile at the parking lot; that he got within three feet of the automobile when Harris told him that it belonged to her sister and that she would return later in the day; that before he had a chance to say anything further defendant drove off; and that he did not give defendant permission to take the automobile. In the courtroom Young positively identified defendant Harris as the person who drove the Chevrolet automobile from the parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"A2XO\">On January 25, 1953, the Chicago police received information from the F. B. I. that a stolen Chevrolet automobile with Missouri license plates was parked at a certain location in Chicago. After keeping the car under surveillance for several hours, the officers observed defendant Harris and co-defendant Bauer get into the Chevrolet at about 8:30 p. m. They then questioned defendant Harris, who first stated that the automobile was hers, After being asked for her driver\u2019s license and vehicle registration, defendant Harris stated that she had obtained the car from a friend in Kansas City, but refused to identify the friend.</p>\n<p id=\"A7PF\">The Chicago police officers placed Harris and Bauer under arrest, taking them first to the 38th District Police Station and, after waiting there for about 2% hours for transportation, taking them to Chieago Police Headquarters at 11th and State Street, arriving there after 11:00 p. m. During the following morning while still in custody of the Chicago police, Harris and Bauer were each questioned by special agents of the F. B. I., at which time Harris gave the name of a man in Kansas City who, she claimed, owned the Chevrolet and had given her permission to use same. She was questioned again by the F. B. I. agents on January 27, and repeated the story that she had told them the day before. On the 27th Bauer\u2019s wife was brought to the station by F. B. I. agents and confronted Bauer. Shortly thereafter Bauer admitted that he knew the Chevrolet automobile had been stolen by Harris. On morning of the 28th, a.t the request a2ents, Bauer signed a statement covering the admissions made by on the previous day. At about 10:30 a- m- on January 28, the Chicago police turned the custody of Harris and Bauer over the F. B. I. and at about 2:00 P- m- they were arraigned before a United States Commissioner,</p>\n<p id=\"Aa9A\">In connection with the testimony of Special Agent Hogan, and as part of the government\u2019s case, Bauer\u2019s statement, identified as Exhibit 7, was received into evidence over the objections of counsel for defendant Harris. In admitting Exhibit 7 into evidence, the court said: \u201cIt may be received subject to the limitations I imposed upon it; it may be received against the defendant Bauer, and is not admissible as against the defendant Harris, so just disregard it as to the defendant Harris.\u201d Included in the statement was, \u201cI met Louise Harris around the early part of December. I knew her casually during the month of December. She had a 1951 Chevrolet, green in color, 1953 Missouri plates, in her possession at the time that I met her. She later told me she stole the 1951 Chevrolet in Missouri before she came Chicago. * * * Pn January 18, 1953,1 accompanied Louise Harris in the 1951 Chevrolet, green in color, 1953 Mis-S0Uld license, to Indianapolis, where we stayed at the Harrison Hotel in IndianaP\u00b0bs\u2019 returning to Chicago on the 21st January. I bad laH knowledge ^hat car was st\u00b0len-</p>\n<p id=\"ANt9\">\u25a0 Before Exhibit 7 was offered in evidence, counsel for Harris moved the court to delete the words, \u201cShe later told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>me she stole the 1951 Chevrolet in Missouri before she came to Chicago.\u201d The court stated, \u201cNo, that will just be \u2014 the jury will be instructed that that is not admissible against her. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"amm-dedup-0\">\u201e As part of government s case, Billie Paustenbach testified .hat Mrs. Elaine Bauer in the presence of her husband Clifford Bauer, said the green Chevrolet had been stolen by Mrs. Harris Defendant Harris was not present at the conversation and the trial judge told the jury, Ladies and gentlemen, that conversation is not admissible against the <em>-t n </em>1 \u25a0 tt . -j-. . . . , defendant Harris. It is admissible . , , \u201e \u201e against defendant Bauer.</p>\n<p id=\"agf-dedup-0\">When defendant Harris made her motion for severance about two months before the trial she was then charged in each count of the indictment with the interstate transportation of a stolen 1951 Chevrolet automobile. In that posture, the denial of the motion was not an abuse of discretion. Rules 8 <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and 13,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 18 U.S.G.A., contemplate that a joint trial may be had under such circumstances. The authorities are in agreement that the trial court has wide discretion in the matter of granting separate trials for defendants jointly charged. Allen v. United States, 91 U.S. App.D.C. 197, 202 F.2d 329; Ross v. United States, 6 Cir., 197 F.2d 660; Cataneo v. United States, 4 Cir., 167 F.2d 820; United States v. Morabette, 7 Cir., 119 F.2d 986, 989. Refusal of a severance motion can only be a reversible error when there is a clear abuse of discretion. Dauer v. United States, 10 Cir., 189 F.2d 343; United States v. Antonelli Fireworks Co., 2 Cir., 155 F.2d 631; Hall v. United States, 83 U.S.App.D.C. 166, 168 F.2d 161, 4 A.L.R.2d 1193. The ruIe ig gimi]ar whgre ^ trkl court or. derg a consolidation of indictments for trial. United States v. Rosenblum, 7 Cir., 176 F.2d 321, 324; United States v. Hibbs, 7 Cir., 152 F.2d 269. Likewise; a motion to ire ^ government to ^ between countg ig addregsed to the __, ni discretion ox the trial court. Randall v. United States, 5 Cir., 148 F.2d 234. In ,, ^ , ,, , . \u00ab the case at bar there is no showing of a c^ear abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"a3x-dedup-0\">Although the court\u2019s instructions to the jury are not a part of the record before us, we must assume that the court correctly instructed the jury that in the consideration of defendant Harris\u2019 guilt or innocence, they should entirely disregard Bauer\u2019s confession, as well as other incriminating statements made by others not in her presence. United States v. Crowe, 7 Cir., 188 F.2d 209, 213; United States v. Tandaric, 7 Cir., 152 F.2d 3, 6; United States v. Gardzielewski, 7 Cir., 125 F.2d 138, 141; United States v. Waldon, 7 Cir., 114 F.2d 982, 984. Further, it must be presumed that the jury conscientiously observed the instructions of the court. United States v. Spadafora, 7 Cir., 181 F.2d 957, 959; United States v. Sorcey, <em>1 </em>Cir., 151 F.2d 899, 903.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqyo\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>The case against defendant Harris on Count 1 was a strong one. Although she never admitted stealing the 1951 Chevrolet, one witness positively identified her as the person who drove that automobile from the parking lot in Kansas City, and testified that she did so without permission. The transportation from Missouri to Illinois was established by the testimony of the defendant herself. The police found Harris and her codefendant in Chicago in the stolen automobile. Quite understandably the jury did not believe her improbable story that a friend in Kansas City had given her permission to drive the car to Chicago and to keep and use it for an indefinite period.</p>\n<p id=\"AnX\">Harris urges that the receipt of Bauer\u2019s statement in evidence was preju-dieial error as to her, because of the failure of arresting officers to take her and Bauer before a commissioner without unnecessary delay. She relies on such cases as McNabb v. United States, 318 U.S. 332, 63 S.Ct. 608, 87 L.Ed. 819; Anderson v. United States, 318 U.S. 350, 63 S.Ct. 599, 87 L.Ed. 829; and Upshaw v. United States, 335 U.S. 410, 69 S.Ct. 170, 93 L.Ed. 100. She also relies on Rule 5(a), Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which provides, \u201cAn officer making an arrest under a warrant issued upon a complaint or any person making an arrest without a warrant shall take the arrested person without unnecessary delay before the nearest available commissioner or before any other nearby officer empowered to commit persons charged with offenses against the laws of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"atf-dedup-2\">r\u201e , . ,. _ , . , ,  The Chicago police had at least nominal custody of Harris and Bauer from 8:30 p. m. Sunday evening until about 10:30 a. m. the following Wednesday. However, it is apparent that the F. B. I. and the city police had an understanding and working arrangement, It was the F. B. I. which did practically all of the questioning and F. B. I. agents took the statements from Harris and Bauer. Had there been objection to the use of the statement made by Harris, the objection should have been sustained. Byars v. United States, 273 U.S. 28, 47 S.Ct. 248, 71 L.Ed. 520; Anderson v. United States, supra; Fowler v. United States, 7 Cir., 62 F.2d 656. However, Harris does not complain about the statement which she gave. In fact in her testimony at the trial she gave the same information in much greater detail. Harris insists, however, that the receipt of Bauer\u2019s statement was prejudieial as to her, in spite of the fact that the jury was admonished when such statement was received that it was not evidence against Harris, and we must assume that the court\u2019s instructions again covered this ruling. This was the best and usual manner of meeting a situation. Kanner v. United States, 7 Cir., 34 F.2d 863, 867.</p>\n<p id=\"AGiq\">Harris insists that Anderson v. United States, supra, is on all fours with the case at bar. In Anderson defendants were detained by State officers in violation of a provision of the State law. There was a working arrangement between the federal officers and the sheriff of Polk County. The court held the admission of the confessions was error, but stated, 318 U.S. at page 356, 63 S.Ct. at page 602: \u201cSo also, while the trial judge appeared to admit the confessions \u2018only to be used against the persons who made them,\u2019 his charge bound the jury to no such restricted use of the confessions.\u201d Under the established law in this circuit, we presume that the court in the case at bar did so limit the effect of the Bauer statement when instructing the jury, just as he had previously advised them when such statement was received in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"A9do\">In the prosecution of violations of Dyer Act cases, the government very seldom can produce, as it did here, an eye-witness who saw the defendant drive away with the automobile which was stolen. As the case on Count 1 against Harris was abundantly proved, we think it falls within the rule stated in Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S. 750, 764, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 1248, 90 L.Ed. 1557: \u201cIf, when all is said and done, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>the conviction is sure that the error did not influence the jury, or had but very slight effect, the verdict and the judgment should stand, * *</p>\n<p id=\"aca-dedup-0\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"a7p-dedup-0\">. \u201cRule 8.
