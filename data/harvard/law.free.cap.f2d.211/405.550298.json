The case was tried to a jury which rendered a verdict for the defendants upon which judgment was entered. A motion by the plaintiff for <em>* </em>judgment n. o. v. or a new trial was denied and the present appeal followed,</p>\n<p id=\"AyM\">Upon thig appea] the plaintiff urges that she is entitled to judgment n. o. v., in the 1\u00a1gM of the decree of the District Court for the Southern District of New York in United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., 66 F.Supp. 323; Id., 70 F.Supp. 323; Id., 70 F.Supp. 53 affirmed in part and reverged in part 334 U.S. 131, 68 S.Ct. 915, 92 L.Ed. 1260, final decree 85 F.Supp. 881, affirmed Loew\u2019s, Inc., v. United States, 339 U.S. 974, 70 S.Ct. 1031, 94 L.Ed. 1380, because no issue was created which could be submitted to the jury on the impact upon the facts of her case of the conspiracy found to exist in the Paramount case and because she was a per-gon injured, and therefore entitled to sue, under the Clayton Act even though she was a non-operating theatre owner. She also urges that she is in any event ent^ed a. new because of the adegcd coercion of a juror by the trial judge and because of errors in the charge of the trial judge to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"AyX\">All of the foregoing contentions were presented to the district court on the motion for judgment n. o. v. or a new trial. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>They were all fully eonsid\u00e9red and correctly decided against the plaintiff in an able and comprehensive opinion filed by Chief Judge Kirkpatrick, 115 F.Supp. 312. We find ourselves in complete accord with his reasoning and conclusions and need add nothing thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"ayb-dedup-1\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
