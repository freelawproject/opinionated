Without considering various difficulties of procedure which may stand in the way of the relief sought, it will suffice to say that no issue of jurisdiction, and hence as to the validity of the judgment, survives the careful findings of waiver and consent to the summary jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court made by the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, In re Petroleum Conversion Corp., D.C.Del., 99 F. Supp. 899, and affirmed on appeal, 3 Cir., 196 F.2d 728, certiorari denied Vaughan v. Petroleum Conversion Corp., 344 U.S. 917, 73 S.Ct. 346, 97 L.Ed. 707. See Cline v. Kaplan, 323 U.S. 97, 100, 65 S.Ct. 155, 89 L.Ed. 97; Bankruptcy Act \u00a7 2, sub. a(7), 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 11, sub. a(7), as amended in 1952, and \u00a7 23, s\u00fcb. b, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 46, sub. b; F.R. 12(h); 2 Collier on Bankruptcy 1J23.08 (14th Ed. 1940) and id. 49-51 (1953 Cum.Supp.),.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-23\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
