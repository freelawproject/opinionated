The elements of the crime under the statute are (1) penetration (2) of a child under the age of sixteen.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">The conviction followed a trial in which the child refused to testify against appellant, despite her earlier statements to police and grand jury incriminating him. Although the earlier statement to the police was introduced at the trial to impeach the child\u2019s testimony exonerating appellant, it did not constitute direct evidence of the crime charged.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Hence, the main props of the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief are medical testimony indicating penetration and testimony of the child\u2019s maternal grandmother that she heard the child make a statement connecting appellant with the assault charged. There was also evidence, pro and con, that appellant had used threats to coerce the child and her mother to change prior accounts of what had occurred and that he sought unsuccessfully to coerce others to do the same. In addition, the child\u2019s mother, who had given an earlier accusatory statement to the police, solemnized her common-law relationship to appellant in a religious wedding ceremony before trial and then invoked the privilege not to testify against her husband. We discuss appellant\u2019s objections to the medical testimony and that of the grandmother before turning to other problems raised by this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-13\">To establish penetration, the prosecution relied primarily on the testimony of Dr. J. F. Mangum, an intern at Gallinger Municipal Hospital, and J. C. Stone, a bacteriologist and assistant supervisor of the hospital\u2019s laboratory.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Dr. Man-gum testified that, although his examination of the child about two hours after the alleged assault revealed considerable reddening of and recent traumatization to the genital area, he could not say \u201cthere had been any intercourse of this child within a matter of two hours.\u201d After stating that he had taken an urethral and a vaginal smear from the child and placed each upon a separate slide for delivery to the hospital laboratory for microscopic examination by technicians, he was shown two slides bearing smears and asked to identify them. In response, he said, \u201cThese are the slides of the type used for us to make our smears at Gallinger Hospital.\u201d He was then asked if he could identify them more specifically, to which he replied, \u201cYes. There is a name scratched on this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>slide,\u201d and proceeded to read the letters of the child's last name. Then the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-4\">\u201cQ. And are those the slides which you transmitted through channels to have examined by your bacteriologist, or by your bacteriological laboratory, in connection with this particular examination of [the child] ? A. We have her name on them. <em>I cannot say that these are definitely the slides that we have made; </em>but they certainly have her name on them. They are the slides of the type that we use, and labeled as we label them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-5\">\u201cQ. Do you have a date on there? A. 8-11-51.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">Bacteriologist Stone testified that slides, marked by the admitting office with the date \u201c8-11\u201d and the letters of the child\u2019s last name and accompanied by a slip containing a request of \u201cwhat they wanted us to look for,\u201d had been received by the bacteriological laboratory from the hospital admitting office in accordance with established hospital procedures. He then stated that his microscopic examination of the slides revealed sperm on the vaginal smear and that this information, as well as the written information previously on the slides and that contained in the accompanying slip, was placed on the slides in a non-erasable fashion. Dr. Mangum\u2019s and Bacteriologist Stone\u2019s testimony demonstrates that the procedures followed in this case were those regularly used by the hospital to make and keep a record of examinations of this kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">Since Dr. Mangum was unable to say there had been sexual intercourse of the child about the time of the alleged assault, proof that she had been carnally assaulted rested substantially on the bacteriologist\u2019s testimony regarding the presence of sperm. That testimony, iff turn, rested solely on the slides which were ultimately admitted in evidence over appellant\u2019s objection that they were not sufficiently identified by Dr. Mangum as those upon which he placed the smears taken from the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-10\">This objection is based upon appellant\u2019s view that the prosecution did not establish the necessary links in the chain of identification between Dr. Man-gum\u2019s taking of the smears, their analysis by Bacteriologist Stone and their production in court. He refers us to Novak v. District of Columbia<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as authority for his position. We think, however, that Novak is not controlling and that the slides in question are admissible under the federal Business Records Act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> That Act provides in pertinent part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-11\">\u201cIn any court of the United States and in any court established by Act \u25a0 of Congress, any writing or record, whether in the form of an entry in a book or otherwise, made as a memorandum or record of any act, transaction, occurrence, or event, shall be admissible as evidence of such act, transaction, occurrence, or event, if made in regular course of any business, and if it was the regular course of such business to make such memorandum or record at the time of such act, transaction, occurrence, or event or within a reasonable time thereafter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-12\">\u201cAll other circumstances of the making of such writing or record, including lack of personal knowledge by the entrant or maker, may be shown to affect its weight, but such circumstances shall not affect its admissibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-13\">\u201cThe term \u2018business,\u2019 as used in this section, includes business, pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>fession, occupation, and calling of every kind.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">It makes admissible in all judicial proceedings, civil or criminal, records made in and pertaining to the regular course of business.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It does not require that the person testifying in respect of the records have personal knowledge of their contents.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">There is no doubt that these slides were made and kept in the regular course of business and that it was the hospital\u2019s regular course of business to make them. Nor is there any question that the Act embraces hospital records.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Under this and similar statutes, cardiograms, electroencephalograms, blood tests and clinical charts have been admitted as hospital records.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We see no distinction between these types of records and the slides in this case. All are admissible \u201cbecause they represent routine reflections of day-to-day operations.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The recording of the data on the slide itself rather than on a separate sheet of paper gives still further assurance of accuracy. Any objections which appellant might have to Dr. Mangum\u2019s or Bacteriologist Stone\u2019s lack of personal knowledge of any of the steps from preparation of the slides to their production in court do not affect their admissibility but go, instead, to the weight to be accorded them.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-14\">As indicated above, we think Novak is clearly distinguishable. In that case, a police officer testified he obtained a specimen of the accused\u2019s urine in a bottle which he labeled with the accused\u2019s name and his own initials and delivered to the Health Department laboratory. A Health Department chemist then testified concerning his urinalysis of a specimen which had been withdrawn from a bottle produced in court and labeled with the accused\u2019s name. We held that testimony inadmissible on the ground that there was \u201cmissing a necessary link in the chain of identification\u201d because the police officer was not asked to identify the bottle produced in court to establish that it was the same one which he delivered to the laboratory and from which the chemist\u2019s analyzed specimen was taken. The key fact which distinguishes Novak from this case is that the specimen there was not taken in the regular course of business of the laboratory involved. Instead, it was taken by an outside agency, the police, and only thereafter delivered to the laboratory.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-15\">Next, we think it was not error to admit testimony by the child\u2019s grandmother \u2014 under the spontaneous exclamation exception to the hearsay rule<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>that she heard the child name the appellant as her assailant. The child made the statement under these circumstances. Within an hour, at most, after the attack was alleged to have occurred in appellant\u2019s home, the child left and went directly to her grandmother\u2019s home three blocks away. There was evidence that when she arrived she was highly distraught and in shock. The grandmother testified that the child was crying upon arrival and went into the bathroom where her mother was; that she (the grandmother) while standing \u201chalfway in\u201d the bathroom door heard her daughter (the child\u2019s mother) tell the child to \u201chush\u201d her crying and \u201cto tell her what was wrong\u201d; that the child said, \u201cRodney [the appellant] just had something to do with me, and this isn\u2019t the first time, but I was scared to tell you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">It is clear enough from the circumstances of time in relation to the alleged offense, and the age and condition of the declarant that there was ample basis for holding the child\u2019s declaration \u201cspontaneous\u201d and admissible in evidence, as an exception to the hearsay rule, \u201cas proof of the facts which they assert.\u201d This exception rests upon the sound premise that \u201c[s]ince [the] utterance is made under the immediate and uncontrolled domination of the senses, and during the brief period when considerations of self-interest could not have been brought fully to bear by reasoned reflection, the utterance may be taken as particularly trustworthy * * *\\\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Since this premise is not affected by the declarant\u2019s later contradiction from the stand, it follows that the trustworthy character of the spontaneous declaration is likewise unaffected by the later contradiction. Moreover, both the declarant and the witness who claims to have heard the declaration are available for cross-examination, so that the jury may determine their credibility for the purpose of resolving the conflict in their testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-10\">Appellant also contends that the trial court erred in ruling that, for the purpose of cross-examining and impeaching its own witness, the prosecution had \u201cbeen taken by surprise\u201d within the meaning of the statute providing in pertinent part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-11\">\u201cWhenever the court shall be satisfied that the party producing a witness has been taken by surprise by the testimony of such witness, such party may, in the discretion of the court, be allowed to prove, for the purpose only of affecting the credibility of the witness, that the witness has made to such party or to his attorney statements substantially variant from his sworn testimony about material facts in the cause; * * *.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-12\">The question arises in this context. Within a few hours after the alleged assault, the child signed a statement prepared by a policewoman from \u201cthe child\u2019s words\u201d describing, in sordid detail, an assault upon her by appellant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>According to the prosecution\u2019s uncontra-dicted representation to the court, she repeated this charge to the indicting grand jury (presumably under oath) but some months later and about six weeks before trial, appellant showed the prosecution a statement, written by him and by the child\u2019s mother and purportedly signed by the child, completely exculpating him. In view of this later contradictory statement, the prosecution asked the court to call the child as its own witness so that it could cross-examine and impeach her in the event she repudiated her earlier accusatory statements. The court refused this request without explanation. The prosecution then called the child as its own witness and when she actually contradicted these earlier statements, the court upheld a prosecution claim of \u201csurprise\u201d under the above quoted statute and exercised its discretion thereunder to permit cross-examination and impeachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\"> Maintaining that the prosecution was not \u201ctaken by surprise,\u201d appellant argues that, under the statute, the court was precluded from permitting cross-examination and impeachment of the child. The statute merely codifies the established rule concerning the impeachment of one\u2019s own witness<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and allows ample latitude for application of a broad concept of \u201csurprise\u201d by requiring only that \u201cthe court shall be satisfied\u201d that \u201csurprise\u201d exists. In terms of our review, this means that the trial court\u2019s ruling on \u201csurprise\u201d may not be disturbed unless it plainly appears that the ruling is without any rational basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-10\">The child\u2019s unequivocal statement to the police <em>on </em>the heels of the alleged event was made before opportunity for reflection and was confirmed by her testimony under oath before the grand jury after opportunity for reflection. The later and contradictory statement, purportedly signed by the child, was made after she and her mother, who had ceased living with appellant after the alleged assault, resumed living with him and were subject to his influence. From these circumstances, we do not think it was incumbent upon the prosecution to believe that once the child was placed under oath on the witness stand and removed from the influence of the accused, she would contradict both her first statement, given immediately after the alleged crime, and her subsequent testimony before the grand jury. The prosecution could reasonably have expected the threatened contradiction to dissolve in the atmosphere of the witness stand.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Thus, when it did not dissolve, there was a rational basis for the trial court\u2019s being satisfied that the prosecution had \u201cbeen taken by surprise\u201d within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-11\">Nor can we agree with appellant\u2019s further contention that even if the written statement to the police was admissible for impeachment purposes only, the court erred in permitting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>prosecution to read the statement <em>in toto.</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We recognize, of course, that despite the court\u2019s careful admonitions as to the statement\u2019s limited purpose, in instructing the jury,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the \u201cpossibility that the jury may accept as the truth the earlier statements in preference to those made upon the stand is indeed real * * *.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> This danger cannot always be obviated or even lessened by requiring the trial court to limit cross-examination so that only the general nature of the earlier statement, and not its specific details, will be made known to the jury. For while there may well be instances where it would be desirable for the trial court to admit only a portion of the impeaching statement, there may also be others where most or all of the specific details of the earlier statement are essential to appraise the contradiction uttered from the witness stand. For this reason we have held that in cases like the present \u201cthe latitude to be allowed in the cross-examination of the witness is within the discretion of the trial justice.\u201d <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We are unable to say that the latitude allowed here constituted an abuse of that discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">Appellant also complains of the prosecutor\u2019s use of the statement in his closing argument. That the prosecution attempted to influence the jury to use it substantively is clear; and certainly this practice is to be condemned. But in light of the court\u2019s charge, in which the jury was soundly and clearly instructed as to the permissible use of the statement, and the failure of defense counsel to object to any part of the argument, we do not think the court committed reversible error in not raising the point <em>sua sponte. </em>After all, the prosecutor was entitled to make use of the statement in arguing the issue of the credibility of the child\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">Finally, one other matter deserves comment. Defense counsel read certain instructions to the jury which was later ordered by the court to \u201cobserve them as though the court himself had given these instructions to you, direct.\u201d This subsequent judicial adoption of defense counsel\u2019s instructions does not save the practice of having instructions read by counsel from running afoul of the unambiguous direction of Rule 30, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 18 U.S.C., that \u201cthe court shall instruct the jury after the arguments are completed.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> This error was not preju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>dicial in the circumstances of this case. But we take this occasion to make clear the necessity for putting an end to the practice in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Upon careful consideration of all the other grounds urged for reversal, we find them without sufficient merit to warrant discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b73-9\">. D.C.Code \u00a7 22-2801 (1951) provides: \u201cWhoever has carnal knowledge of a female forcibly and against her will, or carnally knows and abuses a female child under sixteen years of age, shall be imprisoned for not more than thirty years: <em>Provided, </em>That in any case of rape the jury may add to their verdict, if it be guilty, the words \u2018with the death penalty,\u2019 in which case the punishment shall be death by electrocution: <em>Provided further, </em>That if the jury fail to agree as to the punishment the verdict of guilty shall be received and the punishment shall be imprisonment as provided in this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-14\">Holmes v. United States, 1948, 84 U.S. App.D.C. 168, 169, 171 F.24 1022, 1023, requires proof of penetration for conviction of this crime.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b73-15\">.

This, it is said, is particularly true since the statement, highly harmful to appellant, was prepared by a policewoman and signed by the child without reading it at a time when she was too distraught to know what she was doing. Neither the circumstances of the signing nor the inflammatory nature of its contents provides a bar to admission for impeachment purposes only. Such matters are merely a part of the complex of circumstances which the jury may consider in determining the impeaching effect, if any, of the earlier statement upon the credibility of the testimony uttered from the stand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b78-6\">. The court, at the time of the statement\u2019s admission, did not instruct the jury that the statement was to be used only for impeachment purposes. Such an instruction at that time, as well as in the charge, would certainly have been desirable. But considering the circumstances \u2014 especially the failure of defense counsel to request such an instruction\u2014 we do not think its omission was reversible error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b78-10\">.

As pointed out in the opinion the prosecution was entitled to take refuge in the \"surprise\u201d rule in order to cross-examine the child and to use her written statement to contradict her denial on the stand that defendant had abused her. Certainly the jury were entitled to know fully that she had made a prior inconsistent statement, though I have some question whether the whole statement in all its sordid details was admissible. See 6 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 1904 (3d Ed.). Laying aside, however, my doubts on this score, I think it was in any event reversible error to allow the prosecution to use the statement not merely for impeachment purposes, to which it is confined by our Code, \u00a7 14-104, but as substantive proof of the truth of its contents. It purported to describe in great detail the events which occurred. It was hearsay evidence as to those events and was not admissible to prove them under any exception to the rules excluding hearsay.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> True, the court admonished the jury that the statement was to be considered only on the question of the credibility of the child; but the use made of it, particularly in the closing argument of the prosecuting attorney, was by no means so limited. It was used explicitly as evidence of the truth of its contents. It does not seem to me that Smith v. United States, 57 App.D.C. 71, 17 F.2d 223, Bedell v. United States, 63 App.D.C. 31, 68 F.2d 776, or Di Carlo v. United States, 2 Cir., 6 F.2d 364, certio-rari denied 268 U.S. 706, 45 S.Ct. 640, 69 L.Ed. 1168, supports such use. The situation is more akin to the abuse condemned in Rosenthal v. United States, 8 Cir., 248 F. 684, referred to in the Di Carlo opinion. While the statement was admissible to impeach the child notwithstanding its incidental evidentiary effect beyond that, when it was expressly used as substantive evidence against the defendant the consequence was no longer incidental. It was then, I think, erroneously used for a purpose for which it was inadmissible. This we should not countenance.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b79-10\">. Wigmore, while recognizing this as the settled rule of the courts, and admitting that it was his expressed view in an earlier edition, nevertheless rejects this application of the hearsay rule as unsound. 3 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 1018(b) (3d Ed.). His reasoning is that the rule excludes extrajudicial statements because made out of court by an absent person not subject to cross-examination to test the basis for the former statement; whereas in such a situation as we have here the witness is present and subject to cross-examination. Even were we persuaded by this later view of Wigmore our Code would not permit its adoption.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
