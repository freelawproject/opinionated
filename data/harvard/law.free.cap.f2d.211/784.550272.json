In substance the Board, in agreement with the trial examiner, found that respondent, upon learning of organizational activity among its employees, instituted a program of interrogation, threats of reprisal, and promises or grants of benefits, designed to interfere with and restrain this activity, in violation of \u00a7 8(a) (1) of the Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 151 et seq. The Board further found that respondent dominated and interfered with the formation and administration of a labor organization of its employees in violation of \u00a7 8(a)(2) and (1) of the Act. It entered the usual cease and desist order, and as affirmative action required withdrawal of recognition' from the employees\u2019 committee which it had undertaken to dominate, and to post the usual notices.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-20\">The finding as regards interference, restraint, and coercion of the employees is substantially supported by the evidence considered as a whole. While evidence of the domination of the employees\u2019 committee is not particularly strong, we think there is enough to support the Board\u2019s finding and order in this respect also.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-21\">Accordingly the usual decree enforcing the Board\u2019s order will be entered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
