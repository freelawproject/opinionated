Defendant\u2019s wife was seated in the center of the front seat, and plaintiff Alice Ling, a non-paying guest, was seated on the right. Defendant had been driving between 45 and 60 miles per hour, having increased his speed as the trip progressed. Both the defendant\u2019s wife and the plaintiff guest had remonstrated with the defendant and asked him to drive slower, but received only frivolous answers, with no reduction of speed.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">Defendant\u2019s car suddenly overtook an unlighted motor scooter in the darkness, also travelling westerly along the highway, with two boys riding on it. When defendant\u2019s car was within 10 or 12 feet of the scooter, his wife shouted a warning that he was about to hit it. In an effort to avoid the scooter, defendant swerved his car to the left side of the highway, narrowly missed two cars headed in the opposite direction, lost control of his own car, and collided with a third car also headed east. Mrs. Ling, the guest, received serious injuries in the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\"> The Supreme Court of Florida holds that \u201cThere is no liability for damages under the statute if the degree of negligence is less than \u2018gross negligence\u2019, which is greater degree of negligence than ordinary negligence or mere lack of the care ordinarily exercised by a prudent man.\u201d Winthrop v. Carinhas, 142 Fla. 588, 195 So. 399, 401. As was said in O\u2019Reilly v. Sattler, 141 Fla. 770, 193 So. 817, 818, there must be \u201cconclusive proof of gross negligence before a verdict will be permitted to stand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">Gross negligence, as used in this statute, means excessively reprehensible conduct, or such conduct as justifies an inference of consciousness that injury may probably result from the act done or omitted, and a reckless disregard of the consequences. Juhasz v. Barton, 146 Fla. 484, 1 So.2d 476; Jackson v. Edwards, 144 Fla. 187, 197 So. 833; Dexter v. Green, Fla., 55 So.2d 548. See also Cusack v. Longaker, 2 Cir., 95 F.2d 304.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-10\"> We agree with the conclusion reached by the trial judge that although this evidence might establish ordinary negligence, the facts shown do not constitute \u201cgross negligence or willful and wanton misconduct,\u201d as will be demonstrated by a comparison of the facts in this case with those in the cases hereafter cited in which the Florida Supreme Court held that gross negligence was not shown. Winthrop v. Carinhas, 142 Fla. 588, 195 So. 399; Orme v. Burr, 157 Fla. 378, 25 So.2d 870, 877; Koger v. Hollahan, 144 Fla. 779, 198 So. 685, 688, 131 A.L.R. 886; O\u2019Reilly v. Sattler, 141 Fla. 770, 193 So. 817; McMillan v. Nelson, 149 Fla. 334, 5 So.2d 867; Kozak v. Ake, 147 Fla. 508, 3 So.2d 120; Carver v. Chase, 128 Fla. 287, 174 So. 408; Ayers v. Morgan, Fla., 42 So.2d 2; Baker v. Hausman, Fla., 68 So.2d 572. Here, as in several of the above cited cases, the driver was confronted with a sudden emergency \u2014 the discovery of the unlighted scooter 10 to 12 feet ahead of him in the darkness \u2014 and probably used poor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>judgment in endeavoring to avoid it. His speed may have been too great, but the foregoing cases hold that excessive speed alone does not constitute gross negligence. His conduct may constitute ordinary negligence, but it does not amount to gross negligence as the Florida Supreme Court has defined that term under the Florida guest statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">This case is distinguishable on the facts from Hollander v. Davis, 5 Cir., 120 F.2d 131, in which the driver, while driving at very high speed, voluntarily\u2014 and not to avoid an apparent emergency \u2014crossed to the wrong side of the road and came into collision with oncoming cars.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Appellants point, however, to the latter part of Sec. 320.59, which in effect provides that the issues of negligence, gross negligence, and willful or wanton misconduct, shall be solely for the jury. From this they contend that the action of the trial judge in directing a verdict was contrary to the statute and therefore erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\"> But those matters being procedural, not substantive, are determined by the <em>lex fori. </em>Even in a diversity case, the question of the sufficiency of the evidence to establish gross negligence is determined by the federal courts by their own processes and according to their own rules. This power is not subject to modification or limitation by state statutes or constitutions. It is a power inherent in federal courts. Barrett v. Virginian R. Co., 250 U.S. 473, 476, 39 S.Ct. 540, 63 L.Ed. 1092, 1094; Herron v. Southern Pac. Co., 283 U.S. 91, 94, 51 S.Ct. 383, 75 L.Ed. 857, 860; New York Life Ins. Co. v. Sparkman, 5 Cir., 101 F. 2d 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">The Florida Supreme Court also holds that the statute is not a bar to the exercise by the Florida state courts of their inherent judicial function to determine the sufficiency of the evidence to establish gross negligence. Cormier v. Williams, 148 Fla. 201, 4 So.2d 525; Koger v. Hollahan, 144 Fla. 779, 198 So. 685, 131 A.L.R. 886.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-10\">Finding no reversible error, the judgment appealed from is Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b759-11\">. \u201cNo person transported by the owner or operator of a motor vehicle as his guest or passenger, without payment for such transportation, shall have a cause of action for damages against such owner or operator for injury, death or loss, in case of accident, unless such accident shall have been caused by the gross negligence or willful and wanton misconduct of the owner or operator of such motor vehicle, and unless such gross negligence or willful and wanton misconduct was the proximate cause of the injury, * * Sec. 320.59, Fla.Stat.1951, F.S.A.-</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b760-8\">.
