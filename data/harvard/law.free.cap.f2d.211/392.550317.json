We did so first on the ground that the action was a collateral attack and as such was prohibited by the injunction accompanying the consolidation decree. Moreover, we found that the claims presented were not new but a een passe on e ore or were known at the time of previous attacks on the decree. See, In re Long Island Lighting Co 2 Cir. 197 F.2d 709. Thus the plaintiffs should have been barred from proceeding further on the basis of the allegations presented in the complaint. However, Judge Inch\u2019s order dismissing the action contained the following clause: without prejudice to any further proceedings which the plaintiffs herein may desire to undertake, pursuant to this Court\u2019s reserved jurisdiction in said Civil Action No. 10,413, to vacate or modify the order in the aforesaid action by reason of the aliegations set forth m the <em>complaint here-m.\u201d' </em>In view of our further finding of <em>resjudicata this clause </em>should have been stricken out Accordingly, we modify our former decision by striking out the above clause, and as modified we affirm the order dismissing the action below.</p>\n<p id=\"AB4\">Judgment modified and as modified affirmed; mandate recalled and amended accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
