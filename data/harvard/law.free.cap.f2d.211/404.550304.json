Isbrandtsen-Moller Co., 2 Cir., 126 F.2d 593. Defendard; contends that it is liable for only nominal damages, since the potatoes, purchased' as part of the government\u2019s program of price support, were being sent ag a gift to the Connecticut State Hospital at Middletown, Connecticut. ruie applied is the usual one under the Cummins Amendment, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 20(11), and is not to be varied by special agreement of the parties or, we agree, by special circumstance of one of the parties. Chicago, M. &amp; St. P. R. Co. v. McCaull-Dinsmore Co., 253 U.S. 97, 40 S.Ct. 504, 64 L.Ed. 801, and see Illinois Central R. Co. v. Crail, 281 U.S. 57, 65, 66, 50 S.Ct. 180, 74 L.Ed. 699, 67 A.L.R. 1423. The case of United States v. Northern Pac. Ry. Co., D.C.Minn., 116 F.Supp. 277, and a similar unreported case from the District of Idaho are distinguishable because they allowed damages for such potatoes at an agreed (though very much reduced) price set to prospective purchasers; but it is doubtful if these decisions accord with Chicago, M. &amp; St. P. R. Co. v. McCaull-Dinsmore Co., supra. As Judge Hincks succinctly said: The carrier s part in the national program was to carry not destroy.\u201d So it should not receive the benefit of the intended donation \u2014 in the stead of the State Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"Apu\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
