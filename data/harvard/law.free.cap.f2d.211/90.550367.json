Appendix, \u00a7 9(a), holding that, whatever the status of the administrator or his testator, recovery could not be had where the ultimate beneficial owners were enemies as defined in \u00a7 2(a). We affirm for the reasons stated in the opinion. As to the Attorney General\u2019s motion to dismiss on the ground that he was not substituted for former Attorney General McGranery within six months of his succession to the office,- as required by Fed.RuIes Civ.Proc. rule 25(d), a difficult question is presented, since the Supreme Court has construed most strictly the former 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 780, requiring such substitution, and has even discussed it in terms of jurisdiction of the district court. Snyder v. Buck, 340 U.S. 15, 71 S.Ct. 93, 95 L. Ed. 15. This statute was repealed, effective September 1, 1948, because, according to the Reviser\u2019s Note, it had been superseded by the rules \u2014 see Committee Note to amended F.R. 25(d)\u2014 thus leaving the period of limitation stated only in a procedural rule of court. The rather serious questions thus presented \u00e1re more or less academic here, since the substitution of the defendant Treasurer of the United States was made in proper time. Decision on the main issue is therefore in any event necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-18\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
