These suits were based on the following course of events. The Unions\u2019 officers had filed non-Communist affidavits pursuant to the requirements of \u00a7 9(h) of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In due course, the Unions were notified that they were in compliance with the provisions of that section and hence entitled to avail themselves of the benefits of the Act. Thereafter, and during the effective period of such compliance, the Board, without a hearing, issued a <em>\u201cNotice and Order\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in each case which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>threatened' that failure of the Unions\u2019 officers to affirm the truth of their non-C\u00f3mmunist affidavits would, also without hearing,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-4\">\u201cresult in a finding by- the Board that there is reasonable doubt as to the truth and validity of your affidavits, and therefore in a declaration by the Board that [the respective organization] is not in compliance with filing requirements of Section 9(h) * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">The Board, refused a request by the Unions that it rescind this <em>Notice and Order </em>and then provide an opportunity for hearing on whether it should issue. The gist of the Unions-\u2019 complaint is that, although the Board\u2019s action is not authorized by the Act, nevertheless once they are found not to be in compliance, they will be barred, under the provisions of \u00a7 9(h), from participating in representation .and unfair labor practice proceedings before the Board. They allege that they-already have suffered and will continue, to suffer irreparable damage unless the Board is permanently restrained from pursuing this allegedly unlawful action.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">In the District Court, the Board moved to dismiss each case on the grounds that (1) the court was without jurisdiction of the subject matter, and (2) the complaints failed to state a claim which entitled the Unions to relief. At the consolidated hearing on these motions, it was stipulated that the court might make a final disposition of the cases since there was no dispute as to the facts. During the period which intervened between that hearing and the court\u2019s decision, the Beard filed a \u201cSupplemental Memorandum in Support of its Motion to Dismiss\u201d wherein it offered not to-\u201crevoke * * * [the] unions\u2019 compliance status * * * without first giving * * * [them] an opportunity to be heard.\u201d During the same period, an affidavit was filed on behalf of the Unions charging that despite the Board\u2019s assurances to the court at the hearing that the <em>Notice and Order </em>under attack would not be made effective pending the court\u2019s determination of the cases, the \u201cBoard\u2019s Notice and Order is currently being effectuated against the plaintiff unions throughout the country.\u201d In support of this charge, the affidavit alleged the following: that although one of the Unions (UE) had been successful in a representation election, certification, was withheld by the regional director upon instructions from the Board\u2019s general counsel not to grant certifications in representation proceedings to said Union or issue any complaints upon charges of unfair labor practices filed by said Union, pending a further determination in respect of the Board\u2019s <em>Notice and Order </em>involved herein; that upon information and belief such instructions were issued to all regional directors and this policy had also been applied by withholding disposition of cases before the Board on appeal from rulings of regional directors; that the Board\u2019s refusal of a request to rescind such instructions \u201cis also proof of the lack of sincerity in the Board\u2019s statement to this Court in its Memorandum <em>* * * </em>that * * * [it] will not revoke plaintiff union\u2019s compliance status without first giving plaintiffs an opportunity to.be heard.\u201d The Board made no attempt to deny these allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-12\">In a memorandum opinion covering all three cases,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the District Court rejected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>the Board\u2019s contention that the action assailed here was authorized by an inherent powrer under the Act to protect Board processes from abuse and to prevent subversion of the congressional purpose by the filing of false affidavits. It viewed the Board\u2019s function under the Act, with respect to non-Communist affidavits, as \u201cadministrative only,\u201d and ruled \u201cthat the Board does not have authority to inquire as to the truth or falsity of the affidavits.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Support for this view was found in a congressional intent \u201cto place upon the Department of Justice the duty and power to investigate and to prosecute violators of the Act\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and in the position previously adhered to by the Board that \u201csuch investigations are by the statute made a function of the Department of Justice.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Board\u2019s action was held to be an assumption of power to declare a sanction which was neither expressly authorized by the Act nor intended by Congress. Although the memorandum opinion did not discuss the jurisdictional issues, the District Court\u2019s findings contain general language to the effect that it did have jurisdiction. Identical orders were entered in each case denying the Board\u2019s motion to dismiss, declaring the Board\u2019s <em>Notice and Order </em>a nullity and permanently restraining the Board from requiring anything of the Unions or their officers for the purpose of preserving their present compliance status under \u00a7 9(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">We hold, for the reasons expressed in the trial court\u2019s memorandum, that the Board has no authority under the Act to deprive the Unions of their compliance status under \u00a7 9(h). The scheme of \u00a7 9(h) is clear. It imposes a criminal penalty for filing a false affidavit under \u00a7 9(h), in order to deter Communist officers from filing at all; then the failure of such an officer to file is made the touchstone for barring his union from crucial benefits under the Act, as an incentive to the membership to rid itself of such leadership. There is nothing in the Act or in its legislative history or in good sense to indicate that Congress meant to go further and impose the drastic penalty of excluding the union from the Act\u2019s benefits because its officer had deceived the union as well as the Board by filing a false affidavit. We need not decide whether the union would be barred from the Act\u2019s benefits if its membership was aware of the alleged falsity of the affidavit. The Board makes no claim of such awareness here. To impose this penalty upon the great mass of innocent union members is as reckless as firing a shotgun into a crowd of people in an attempt to stop one who is picking their pockets.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-13\">We also hold that the District Court had jurisdiction of the subject matter. On this issue the Board argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Act makes the Unions\u2019 compliance with the filing requirements of \u00a7 9(h) a condition precedent to their participation in unfair labor practice proceedings under \u00a7 10 <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and certification proceedings under \u00a7 9;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that only Board action in a proceeding under \u00a7 10 is subject to judicial review under the Act; that the procedure initiated by the <em>Notice and. Order\u25a0 </em>is merely a preliminary step to such reviewable Board action; hence, this preliminary step \u2014 like, for example, the issuance of an unfair labor practice complaint or the certification in a representation proceeding \u2014 involves the exercise of Boara discretion which is not reviewable either in the Court of Appeals under the review provisions of the Act, or the District Court in the exercise of its equitable jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>It is clear enough that review of Board action in the Courts of Appeals is limited to unfair labor practice proceedings under \u00a7 10. But the question whether action, preliminary to such proceedings and plainly beyond the scope of statutory authority, may be reviewed by the District Court in the exercise of its equity power was twice reserved by the Supreme Court<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to await \u201cthe required showing of unlawful action by the Board and resulting injury * * * whether by way of departure from statutory requirements or from those of due process of law.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We think the required showing is presented in these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">We have already expressed our view that the Board action assailed here is unlawful. That the injury resulting therefrom is \u201creal, immediate, and incalculable\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> is evident from the instructions issued by the Board\u2019s general counsel to its regional directors throughout the country, as described in the uncon-tradicted allegations of the affidavit filed on behalf of the Unions. These instructions have deprived and, but for the injunction issued below, would have continued to deprive the Unions of crucial benefits under the Act and this without any sort of prior hearing. In these circumstances, it can hardly be said that the action assailed is not ripe for review, or that the Unions should be required to exhaust a dubious opportunity for hearing offered to them after the ax had fallen, or that there is an adequate remedy at law for the injuries resulting from the Board\u2019s unlawful action. Under any reasonable view of such cases as Rochester Tel. Corp. v. United States,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Columbia Broadcasting System v. United States,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee v. McGrath,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the District Court must be held to have properly invoked its equitable jurisdiction to grant relief.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AO0\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-11\">PROCTOR, Circuit Judge, died before the decision in these cases and took no part in their consideration.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b89-7\">. 61 Stat. 146, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 159(h), as amended, 65 Stat. 602 (1951), 29 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 159(h). This section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AR\">\u201cNo investigation shall be made by the Board of any question affecting commerce concerning the representation of employees, raised by a labor organization under subsection (e) of this section, and no complaint shall be issued pursuant to a charge made by a labor organization under subsection (b) of section 10, unless there is on file with the Board an affidavit executed contemporaneously or within the preceding twelve-month period by each officer of such labor organization and the officers of any national or international labor organization of which it is an affiliate or constituent unit that he is not a member of the Communist Party or affiliated with such party, and that he does not believe in, and is not a member of or supports any organization that believes in or teaches, the overthrow of the United States Government by force or by any illegal or unconstitutional methods. The provisions of section 35 A of the Criminal Code shall be applicable in respect to such affidavits.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b89-14\">. The <em>Notice and Order </em>required the Union officers named therein to answer attached questionnaires (1) reaffirming the truth of all non-Communist affidavits previously filed by them with the Board and (2) stating that they had not been members or supporters of any organization believing in or teaching the overthrow of the United States Government by force or by any illegal or unconstitutional methods at any time since the filing of their first \u00a7 9(h) affidavits.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-15\">These are the events which preceded the issuance of the <em>Notice and Order. </em>The Board referred the \u00a7 9(h) affidavits filed with it by the officers here involved to the Department of Justice for investigation and possible perjury prosecution. The Department of Justice initi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>ated grand jury proceedings in the Southern District' of New York to which the officers were called to testify. In their grand jury testimony, they pleaded their constitutional privilege in respect of the truth or falsity of their \u00a7 9(h) affidavits. Although it returned no indictment the grand jury issued and forwarded to the Board a report recommending that the Board declare .the Unions out of compliance with \u00a7 9(h) because of the failure of their officers to testify as to the truthfulness of the affidavits. . The Unions applied for an order expunging the report as unlawful and, after entry of the District Court judgment herein appealed from, their application was granted.
