Appellee moved to quash service on the ground that, under the provisions of Rule 4(d) (3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A., Tenge was not a person upon whom valid service, binding on appellee, could be made; and the issue in this case is reduced to a determination of the question whether Tenge was a managing agent of appel-lee company at the time of the service of summons upon him. The motion was heard in the district court upon the affidavits of appellant and of Tenge; and the district court granted the motion to quash. The uncontroverted proofs submitted by the above-mentioned affidavits disclosed that Tenge was only a salesman, without managerial duties, and that none of his activities resulted in his being a managing agent of appellee company.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-21\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
