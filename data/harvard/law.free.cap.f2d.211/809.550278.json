It appeared, however, that, at or about the same time, he had sold to the female appellee a lease on an adjoining apartment without board approval. He said, \u201c* * * I thought I knew enough of Mrs. Cain to approve her without the board *</p>\n<p id=\"b861-26\">The District Court correctly concluded that appellant\u2019s defense was based on an insubstantial technicality. The corpora-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>\u00bfion was his <em>alter eg\u00f3. </em>The judgment decreeing specific perform\u00e1nce is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">The second appeal, No. 11,948, is from the trial court\u2019s refusal to give the purchasers judgment against Rosen for their\" counsel fee. We cannot say this refusal was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">Affirmed on both appeals.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
