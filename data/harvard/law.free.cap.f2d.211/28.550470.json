Service illegal and for reinstatement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>therein. His primary allegation was that disciplining officials had failed to comply with the statute and regulations governing removal procedures. In detail, the complaint alleged that the notice of charges preferred against him was not sufficiently specific, and that he was not advised of his right to file affidavits with the answer. At the hearing on cross motions for summary judgment, appellant also contended that the notice of charges was signed by officials who lacked such authority. In a written opinion,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 2the District Court held against appellant on all the issues thus raised. Accordingly, it ordered summary judgment in appellees\u2019 favor. Appellant is here seeking reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\"> We think the issues raised below were correctly decided. On this appeal, however, appellant advances a contention which he failed to make in the court below.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In substance, it is that the adverse decision, following his answer to the notice of charges served upon him, did not contain \u201creasons\u201d sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the applicable removal procedure. This presents an issue of law which we consider, despite appellant\u2019s failure to raise it below, because we deem these to be \u201cparticular circumstances\u201d in which \u201cinjustice might otherwise result.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Briefly, these are the pertinent facts. Appellant, a Deputy Collector of Internal Revenue, was notified by letter that certain charges against him would be taken as true unless he offered satisfactory explanation. These charges, involving alleged violations of the Bureau\u2019s \u201cInstructions to Employees,\u201d read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-7\">\u201c * * * acceptance of fees or gifts for preparing the income tax returns over a period of years for taxpayers \u2018Nick\u2019 Robin, Isidore Robin, Peter and Catherine Stahl, Anthony and Magdalina Matje, and Leo C. Coleman. Amongst this group are several whose income is derived from illegal sources, which fact was known to you when you prepared their returns.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">Appellant offered the following explanation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-9\">\u201cIn connection with the money, practically pushed upon me by Mag-dalina Matje, she, knowing I could not type and that I had someone type the return of her father and mother (Peter and Catherine Stahl), which were too lengthy to prepare in longhand, she insisted the typing expenses be defrayed by her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-10\">\u201cRelative to the returns of \u2018Nick\u2019 Robin, Isadore Robin, Leo C. Coleman; I assisted them in the preparation of their returns from figures submitted by them. For this service I never received a fee, gift or any other gratuity. They informed me their incomes were derived from gambling commission; however, I did not think, and still do not think that I violated any Section of Bureau of Internal Revenue \u2018Instructions to Employees\u2019, by assisting them in the preparation of their returns.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-11\">Thereafter, disciplining officials issued the adverse decision which is under attack on this appeal. The decision read in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>\u201cCareful consideration has been given to your reply, together with the facts developed during the investigation, and the conclusion has been reached that the evidence is such as to show your unsuitability for continuance in the Internal Revenue Service.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">The key clause in that decision was \u201cthe evidence is such as to show your unsuitability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Administrative proceedings for removal of employees from the classified Civil Service are governed by 5 U. S.C.A. \u00a7 652(a), and the regulations and administrative interpretation promulgated thereunder. Section 652(a) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-6\">\u201cNo person in the classified civil service of the United States shall be removed or suspended without pay therefrom except for such cause as will promote the efficiency of such service <em>and for reasons given in writing. </em>Any person whose removal or suspension without pay is sought shall (1) have notice of the same and of any charges preferred against him; (2) be furnished with a copy of such charges; (3) be allowed a reasonable time for filing a written answer to such charges, with affidavits; and (4) be furnished at the earliest practicable date with a written decision on such answer.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-10\">The first sentence of this section contains two broadly stated conditions requisite for removal of an employee from the classified Civil Service. They are \u201c[1] for such cause as will promote the efficiency of such service and [2] for reasons given in writing.\u201d Specific requirements for fulfilling those conditions are set forth in the very next sentence of the section. These requirements are that an employee must be served with a notice of the charges preferred against him, be afforded an opportunity to refute them by answer, and \u201cbe furnished with * * * a written decision on such answer.\u201d The applicable regulation makes clear that this decision must state the \u201creasons\u201d for removal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> And, according to the Civil Service Commission\u2019s administrative interpretation of its regulations, a decision adverse to the employee can be based only upon reasons contained in the original notice of proposed adverse action.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b82-11\">Plainly, and we so hold, the requirement of \u201creasons\u201d for removal is not satisfied in this case by the conclusion of \u201cunsuitability\u201d based upon vague references to appellant\u2019s answer and \u201cfacts developed during the investigation.\u201d The decision failed to disclose which of the charges contained in the notice of proposed adverse action were relied upon for removal; or, indeed, whether removal rested upon any of the charges. Under the provisions of the statute and of the regulations outlined above, only find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>ings upon such charges, specifically identified, can constitute the \u201creasons\u201d required in the adverse decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">The purpose of requiring this content for the \u201creasons\u201d for removal is not to provide a record to facilitate judicial review of such \u201creasons\u201d on their merits since review is narrowly limited by the absence of express statutory provision therefor. On the contrary, it is required as a procedural safeguard against just the sort of errors which, if committed at the administrative level, are beyond reach of our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">The judgment below is reversed and the case is remanded to the District Court with directions to enter a declaration in appellant\u2019s favor in accordance with this opinion and to follow our decision in Borak v. Biddle<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> in determining the nature and scope of allowable relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b81-12\">. Mulligan v.

Another contention urged on this appeal for the first time is that under 53 Stat. 487 (1939), 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3991 (1946), only the Collector of Internal Revenue could remove appellant and hence that the authorized representative of the Secretary of tho Treasury who issued the adverse decision had no power to do so. This contention is wholly without merit since under Reorganization Plan No. 26, 64 Stat. 1280 (1950), 5 U.S.C.A. note following section T83Z-15, effective prior to appellant\u2019s removal, tho functions of the Collector were transferred to the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b81-16\">.
