B. Frank Company, the taxpayer, was not entitled to relief under section 722 of the Internal Revenue Code <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> with respect to excess profits taxes for the years 1941 to 1945, which it sought to have refunded. The decision was \u201cReviewed by the Special Division\", as provided by subsection (d) of section 732 of the Internal Revenue Code.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Taxpayer\u2019s motions for reconsideration and vacation of the decision- were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-22\">Petitioning for review here, taxpayer urges that the Tax Court erred in: (1) failing to permit it to assign errors to be heard by the Special Division: (2) in failing to make certain findings of fact, and (3) in failing to grant the relief sought. Petitioner\u2019s assertion that it is entitled to resubmit and argue the case to the Special Division is answered by the decision in Green Springs Dairy, Inc. v. Commissioner, 4 Cir., 208 F.2d 471. This authority, and the provisions of section 732(c) of the Internal Revenue Code,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> require the rejection of petitioner\u2019s claims of errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>Petitioner calls our attention to proposed legislation which it is said may-remove these barriers to the prosecution of its claim, apparently seeking a delay in our decision until such legislation is enacted. We adjudge the case in the light of existing law, and, of course, without prejudice to any future procedure or rights which the Congress may in its discretion grant to petitioner or others similarly situated.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The decision of the Tax Court is Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b550-11\">. 19 T.C. 174.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b550-12\">.
