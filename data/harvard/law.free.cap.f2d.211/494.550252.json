Gifford to set aside a release executed by him and to recov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>er additional damages if or injuries suffered by him while in the employ of appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Appellant pleaded: that, on or about November 25, 1951, while he was employed. by appellee, he received personal injuries requiring the amputation of a foot; that on Dec. 26, 1951, he was induced by appellee\u2019s -agent to execute a release. of his claim for the sum . of $6000, relying' upon' the promise o'f \"ap-pellee\u2019s agent that he would receive in addition, a lifetime job with -appellee, which promise was fraudulently m\u00e1de in that appellee had no intention of employing appellant; and that he relied upon the representation of; appellee\u2019s agent because of their relationship -of trust and confidence, and' appellee\u2019s superior knowledge of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Appellee .answered denying the invalidity of the release pleaded \u2018 by ' ijhe plaintiff in the twelfth paragraph of his complaint. Appellee pleaded that said release is binding and valid, that the plaintiff voluntarily- \u00e1g\u00ed\u00e9ed to\u2019-a-settlement and compromise of all claims arising out of the alleged injury for the sum of $6000 and the cost of an artificial foot, which said plaintiff received. Appellee further denied that, there was any promise or representation to -the plaintiff of a, lifetime job and that there was no oral contract of any sort wherein the plaintiff was to receive- a job for lifetime, and denied any fraudulent or false representations whatever as \u25a0 alleged, and denied that the sum paid was inadequate or unconscionable or that any relationship of trust or confidence existed between appellant and appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-17\">Appellee further pleaded that in addition to the release a voucher was issued, duly endorsed and cashed by appellant reciting a full and complete settlement and; satisfaction of said claim. A copy of the settlement agreement and release and a copy of the voucher were attached to the answer and made a part thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-18\">Appellee filed a motion for separate trial on the issues raised in paragraph XII of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-19\">On April 14, 19.53, appellee\u2019s motion for a separate trial on the issue as to the\u2019 validity-of the release was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-20\">On April 29, 1953, trial of the issue as to the validity of the settlement and release Was: heard before a jury. At': the:, conclusion of the. evidence, appellee filed a motion for a directed verdict stating therein the grounds therefor, and' the \u2019 trial court, for the reasons stat\u00e9d by him\u2019 in his oral opinion,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> granted the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>Appealing from the judgment, plaintiff, citing many cases,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is here insisting that, under their teachings, his evidence entitled him to go to the jury, and that the district judge erred, in finding and holding that plaintiff was bound by, and could not contradict the recitals in, the release, and in instructing a verdict for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">We agree with the appellant that this is so.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is true that the defendant\u2019s testimony flatly contradicts that of plaintiff. But contradictions and conflicts in testimony are to be resolved not by the judge but by the jury. If the jury believed plaintiff\u2019s testimony: that defendant\u2019s manager gave him the promise of a job which he could handle, and, in reliance on that promise, plaintiff made the settlement and signed the release; and that when plaintiff applied for the job it was refused to him; it could have found that the promise of a job was made in fraud to induce plaintiff to sign the release but with no intention of performing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-11\">Because the district judge erred in directing a verdict, the judgment must be reversed and the cause remanded for further and not inconsistent proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b546-14\">. \u201cThis agreement and release made and entered into by and between Ben Nolan Gifford, of Graham, Young County, Texas, party of the first part, and The Wichita Falls &amp; Southern Railroad Company, a corporation acting by and through its General Manager, H.

S. Lemmons, General Manager of the railroad and a Mr. Jernigan who works in the railroad\u2019s office came to see him while he was in the hospital; and that Mr. Lemmons then told him that he could continue living in the bunkhouse until he was able to get around and that they were going to buy him an artificial limb and pay him for the one he <em>lost </em>and give <em>him </em>a job on the railroad, something be could handle; that after he got out of the hospital he went to Graham, Texas, and was living with his wife\u2019s mother and father; that on the 26th of Dec., he drove his car from Graham, Texas, to Wichita Palls (a distance of about 65 miles) and went to the Wichita Palls and Southern Railroad Depot and to Mr. Lemmons\u2019 office to see him.</p>\n<p id=\"AMM\">This was his testimony as to the conversation then had:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ArG\">\u201cQ.

The\u2019Cdurt:\u2019- \u2019\u2019</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-12\">\u2022 \u201cThere are certain rules of law so well \u25a0 established that -they are known even' largely\u2019 to the layman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-13\">\u201cFor instance, a transfer of real estate: by deed or by a lease even, for a longer period than one-\u2019 year, must be in writing. It is part of the Old statute'-- of.: fraud. Again,'a promise to pay the other fellow\u2019s debt must be in writing. . \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-14\">&lt; \u201cAlittost\u2019up to the dignity- of these two: well-known'principles of-law is the one' that controls this case, and that is, when a-man snakes-.a contract, understandingly and\\knowingly, they.are bound by that\u00a1 contract. When- they sit down, or confer together, and,-after they have had., their conference,. reduce it to writing, all - matters that'they do not incorporate in the writing are presumed to \u25a0 have been abandoned, ;or -never to have been .mentioned. , ,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-22\">' \u201cThe -rule is stated very aptly by Judge Ocie Spe\u00e9r, whom we all know, or did know in his lifetime, as one of the great lawyers and great judges of the State of Texas. Judge Speer not only has written many opinions, but he has written textbooks which are recognized as standard authority- by the bar of the country.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-23\">\u201cAfter speaking of a case1 of this character, all testimony by plaintiff relating to plaintiff\u2019s lack, of knowledge of-what.was in th\u2019e instrument, and. that he would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>not have signed it if he had known it had contained the provisions about employment, was objected to by the defendant, because it tendered to vary the terms of the instrument. The Court overruled the objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-6\">\u201cThis was a settlement for the same sum, it seems, $6000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-7\">\u201cNow, referring to this old rale, Judge Speer says, there is another rule as old as our jurisprudence to the effect that all oral agreements made prior to a writing will be presumed to have been merged into the written instrument subsequently executed. Especially is this true when, as in this case, the writing negatives the making of any oral agreement not embodied in the instrument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-8\">\u201cOur courts have not departed from this well established principle, analogous in many respects to the facts in the case before us, and the conclusions here expressed are those in another instance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-9\">\u201cWo conclude that there was no competent evidence before the court that the fraud pleaded by the plaintiff in procuring the release in question, and that since the instrument was complete and unambiguous, and negatives the absence of any agreement previously made, not embodied in the release, that no agreement for future employment had been made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-20\">\u201cIn view of the law, as we think it is, we do not feel that any court, either the trial court or the appellate court, could permit a judgment to stand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-21\">\u201cTherefore, we will instruct the jury to return the verdict for the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b549-22\">.
