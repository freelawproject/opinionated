National Labor Relations Board, 340 U. S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-24\">We hold that it does. Powell was a porter and elevator operator and after he had joined the union the respondent was notified by the New York State Labor Relations Board, on or about March 13, 1951, that the union had filed a petition seeking its certification for collective bargaining with the respondent. Although Powell\u2019s name was not mentioned, he was the only member of the union and, as the Board found, \u201cthe only person on whose behalf the Union was acting.\u201d It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>was found on substantial evidence that after Walter Kocher learned of the union\u2019s petition he said to Powell, \u201cDo you think I am going to let the Union come in here and run my business? If you don\u2019t like the money I am paying, and I am paying more than the Union, why don\u2019t you quit?\u201d On the same day he asked respondent\u2019s bookkeeper, Maryl Bastien, \u201cto find out what salary Ben wanted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">The bookkeeper then talked with Powell; offered him an increase in pay; and asked him if he \u201cwould be happy on the job without the Union\u201d if he received what she was offering him. He told her he would not and that he wanted a forty hour work-week and recognition of the union. She reported her conversation with him to Kocher. This was apparently in March 1951 and on the following April 12, 1951, shortly before there was to be a hearing on the union\u2019s petition before the New York State Labor Relations Board, Powell was discharged. There was evidence to support the respondent\u2019s contention that his discharge was because Walter Kocher reached the conclusion, on information he had received, that Powell was untrustworthy and also because Powell had been impertinent to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Such conflicting evidence presented an issue as to the credibility of witnesses who testified at the hearing before the trial examiner. But when that issue was resolved adversely to the respondent, the record as a whole was left with evidence, not inherently improbable, which was adequate to show that the respondent had interfered with the exercise by Powell of rights, guaranteed him in Section 7 of the Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 157, in violation of Section 8(a) (1). It also supported the inference drawn from the facts as found that the discharge was due to unlawful discrimination, in violation of Section 8 (a) (3), because the employee insisted upon exercising his right to remain a member of the union and to support it in its attempt to secure recognition for collective bargaining purposes. Consequently, the record as a whole is sufficient and the order should be enforced. National Labor Relations Board v. Charles B.
