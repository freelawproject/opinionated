E. 2d 766, certiorari denied 425 U. S. 956 (1976), the city of Canton, respondent herein, had refused to fluoridate its water, and the issue was whether the state might order it to do so. Therein, this court upheld the July 3, 1974, order of the then-Director of Environmental Protection, directing the municipality to begin fluoridating' its water within 30 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">Relator contends that a peremptory writ of mandamus should issue today because his right to command the execution of the act as requested in his application for the writ is plain, and no legitimate excuse can be given for nonperformance. He asserts further that if a peremptory writ of mandamus does not issue in the first instance, such extraordinary circumstances obtain in the instant cause that an alternative writ of mandamus should issue. Relator identifies these extraordinary circumstances as: (1) The indisputable nature of the facts, (2) the plain legal duty imposed by statute and administrative order upon the respondents, (3) the fact that the order already has been appealed through the United States Supreme Court, and (4) the faet that the public health is involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">This court has held that before a writ of mandamus will be granted by the Supreme Court, under its constitutional powers as contained in Section 2 of Article IV of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>Constitution of Ohio,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a clear legal right thereto must be demonstrated. The burden of establishing such right is upon the relator and the writ ordinarily will be refused unless the relator., shows affirmatively that he has no plain and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law. <em>State, ex rel.

E. 2d 784.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">Belator himself notes his potential remedy available through B. C. 6111.30,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> authorizing common pleas courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>to levy $10,000 fines upon officers of municipal corporations who refuse to comply with orders issued pursuant to R. C. 6111.13<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to fluordidate. However, he denies that R. C. 6111.-30 provides an effective means of obtaining the enforcement of his order in the instant cause. We are not persuaded by his argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">In the recent case of <em>Cincinnati, ex rel. Crotty, </em>v. <em>Cincinnati </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St. 2d 27, 361 N. E. 2d 1340, this court assessed a controversy wherein Cincinnati taxpayers and water users filed a complaint in the Court of Common Pleas alleging that the contemplated addition of fluoride into the municipal drinking water would be contrary to those taxpayers\u2019 and water users\u2019 constitutional rights. As was noted in that case, under R. C. 6111.12 the correct procedure for claims that a public water supply is impure is by complaint to the Environmental Protection Agency. Under R. C. 3745.04, an appeal from an order vacating an action of the Director of Environmental Protection might be brought before the Environmental Board of Review, and the Board has exclusive original jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>over any matter which correctly might be brought before it. <em>Grotty, </em>at page 30, held that the statutory scheme for review of actions by the Director of Environmental Protection is exclusive, and that a common pleas court lacks' jurisdiction over such a complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">It is entirely consistent with <em>Grotty </em>for us to hold that the state, before its writ of mandamus will be granted, must establish its clear legal right thereto, showing affirmatively that it lacks a plain and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law. On facts such as obtain in the instant cause, mandamus may not be used as a substitute for what appears to be an adequate remedy available to relator.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">In light of all of the foregoing, the writ prayed for is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">\n<em>Writ denied.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b193-8\">O\u2019Neill, C.
