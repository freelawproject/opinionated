C. 2743.01 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">Except as otherwise provided by statute, municipal corporations are immune from liability in the performance of their governmental functions. See, e. <em>g., Broughton </em>v. <em>Cleveland </em>(1957), 167 Ohio St. 29. Since 1854, however, this court has consistently held that, oven absent statutory authorization, the defense of immunity is not available to a municipality for negligence in the performance of proprietary, as opposed to governmental, functions. The maintenance and operation of a police department by a municipality is a governmental function. <em>Gabris </em>v. <em>Blake </em>(1967), 9 Ohio St. 2d 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">R. C. 2743.02(A) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">\u201cThe state hereby waives its immunity from liability and consents to be sued, and have its liability determined, in the Court of Claims created in this chapter in accordance with the same rules of law applicable to suits between private parties, subject to the limitations set forth in this chapter. To the extent that the state has previously consented to be sued, this chapter has no applicability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-11\">In pertinent part, R. C. 2743.01 provides that:</p>\n<p id=\"b244-12\">\u201cAs used in Chapter 2743 of the Revised Code:</p>\n<p id=\"b244-13\">\u201c(A) \u2018State\u2019 means the state of Ohio, including, without limitation, its departments, boards, offices, commissions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>agencies, institutions, and other instrumentalities. It does not include political subdivisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">\u201c(B) \u2018Political subdivisions\u2019 means municipal corporations, townships, counties, school districts,. and all other bodies corporate and politic responsible for governmental activities only in geographic areas smaller than that of the state to which the sovereign immunity of the state attaches.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">In the insant cause, the Court of Appeals held that \u201cR. C. Chapter 2743 does not specifically grant the state\u2019s political subdivisions any immunity. Therefore, by virtue of the state\u2019s waiver of its immunity, such immunity can no longer be claimed by a political subdivision.\u201d The Court of Appeals reasoned that \u201c[o]nce the sovereign waives, the judicial doctrine falls because there is no longer a source from which the subdivisions can derive their immunity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">This holding of the Court of Appeals is in error. In 1912, Section 16, Article I, of the Ohio Constitution was amended by adding: \u201cSuits may be brought against the state, in such courts and in such manner, as may be provided by law.\u201d The amendment is not self-executing, and statutory authority is required as a prerequisite to the \u25a0bringing of suits against the state. <em>Raudabaugh </em>v. <em>State </em>(1917), 96 Ohio St. 513. Subsequent cases have interpreted Section 16, Article I, as a technical abrogation of the theretofore judicial doctrine of sovereign immunity, although ineffective without the required legislative consent. Thus, the defense of sovereign immunity has been transformed into the defense of \u201clack of consent.\u201d See <em>Krause </em>v. <em>State </em>(1972), 31 Ohio St. 2d 132.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">Further, R. C. 2743.01(A) defines \u201cstate\u201d within the context of R. C. Chapter 2743 and carefully excludes \u201cpolitical subdivisions\u201d from that definition. The General Assembly first clearly separated \u201cpolitical subdivisions\u201d from \u201cstate\u201d and then used the present tense in R. C. 2743.01(B) in describing, bodies which enjoy sovereign immunity: \u201csovereign immunity * * * attaches,\u201d This is seem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>ingly contrary to the derivative immunity required by the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">'-The Court of Appeals interpreted R. 0.-2743.01(A) and (B) and 2743.02(A) as \u201cmeaning that the state has waived its immunity from liability but declined to permit political subdivisions to be sued in the Court of Claims. If * * *' [political subdivisions] cannot be sued in the Court of Claims, they may be sued in any court of record as any other party might be sued.\u201d The Court of Appeals noted that its construction of the statutes \u201cmeans, of course, that R. C. 2743.02(B) is merely superfluous legislation as it is embodied in R. C. 2743.02(A).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">We reject this reasoning. R. C. 2743.02(A) waives the <em>state\u2019s </em>immunity from liability. There would be little reason for the General Assembly to make a detailed distinction-between \u201cstate\u201d and \u201cpolitical subdivision\u201d in R. C. 2743.01 if the effect of 2743.02(A) were to put both the state <em>and </em>political subdivisions on the same plane with regard to waiving sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">If the General Assembly intended to do as the Court of Appeals claims, it could have stated unequivocally that both the state and political subdivisions no longer have the defense of sovereign immunity, and then prescribed the procedure for suing the \u201cstate\u201d and specifically provided that \u201cpolitical subdivisions\u201d shall be amenable to suit in the ordinary course of law. This the General Assembly chose not to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">Further evidence that the legislative intent was not to waive sovereign immunity as a defense for political subdivisions is contained in R. C. 2743.02(B), which provides, in part, that \u201c [t]he state hereby waives the immunity from liability of all hospitals owned or operated by * * Apolitical subdivisions and consents for them to be sued * * Since the demise of charitable immunity, any immunity of these hospitals is derived from the immunity afforded to political subdivisions which create, own and operate them. If R. C. 2743.02(A) had already abrogated sovereign , immunity of political subdivisions, then R. C. 2743.02(B) is su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>perfluous. The last sentence of Subdivision (B)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is a codification of this court\u2019s holding in <em>Sears </em>v. <em>Cincinnati </em>(1972), 31 Ohio St. 2d 157, recognizing that operation of a hospital by a municipal corporation is a proprietary function, and thus immunity is not available to the hospital or municipality. The first sentence of Subdivision (B) is an expansion of <em>Sears </em>and a legislative reversal of <em>Wolf v. Ohio State Univ. Hosp. </em>(1959), 170 Ohio St. 49, and <em>Hyde </em>v. <em>City of Lakewood </em>(1965), 2 Ohio St. 2d 155.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">If R. 0. Chapter 2743 were intended to . completely abolish immunity to political subdivisions, then, logically, the General Assembly would have repealed R. C. 70L02 (waiving immunity of municipalities for certain acts of policemen and firemen in relation to operating a motor vehicle), R. C. 723.01 (concerning responsibility of municipality for maintenance of nuisance in public streets), R. C. 305.12 (liability of county in repair of bridges or roads.), and several other statutes as superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">' In conclusion, R. C. 2743.01 and 2743.02 are forthright and unambiguous, and permit facile discernment of the legislative intent to preserve the defense of sovereign immunity to political subdivisions except \u2022 as otherwise expressed by the General Assembly. Appellees fail to cite- authority that the state may not selectively waive, through the General Assembly, sovereign immunity with regard to political subdivisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed. \u2018</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">\u2022 <em>Judgment reversed.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b247-9\">O\u2019Neill, C.

It is something of an anomaly that the common-law doctrine of sovereign immunity which is based on the concept that \u201cthe king can do no wrong\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was ever, adopted by. the American courts. Nonetheless it was, and the anomaly of its adoption was compounded when the doctrine was applied to municipalities in Mower v. <em>Leicester </em>(1812), 9 Mass. 247, on the rationale that it is preferable for an individual to sustain injury than for the public to suffer inconvenience.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Anomalous or not, however, the doctrine of municipal immunity was soon judicially adopted in virtually every American jurisdiction, including Ohio.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The question raised by the instant cause is whether it should be retained.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>The majority of American jurisdictions have held that it should not,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In doing so they have rejected the argument that abolishing immunity might cause a flood of litigation <em>(Ayala </em>v. <em>Philadelphia Bd. of Public Edn. </em>[1973], 453 Pa. 584, 595, 305 A. 2d 877, 882); emphasized the incongruous results of basing immunity on the governmental or proprietary nature of a municipality\u2019s acts <em>(Hargrove </em>v. <em>Cocoa </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number><em>Beach </em>[Fla. 1957], 96 So. 2d 130); and decried a doctrine which imposes \u201cthe entire burden, of damage resulting from the wrongful acts of the government * * * upon the single individual who suffers the injury * * <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Santa Fe </em>(1943), 47 N. M. 85, 88, 136 P. 2d 480, 482.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">The arguments marshalled by the courts of other jurisdictions apply to Ohio\u2019s municipal immunity doctrine as well. This court does not need to defer to the General Assembly in this area, because Ohio\u2019s sovereign immunity for municipalities, was judicially created (see <em>State </em>v. <em>Franklin Bank of Columbus </em>[1840], 10 Ohio 91; <em>Western College of Homeopathic Medicine </em>v. <em>Cleveland </em>[1861], 12 Ohio St. 375; and <em>Thacker </em>v. <em>Bd. of Trustees of Ohio State Univ. </em>[1973], 35 Ohio St. 2d 49, 67-68 [Justice William B. Brown, dissenting]), and judicially-created doctrines may.be judicially abolished. (See <em>Sears </em>v. <em>Cincinnati </em>[1972], 31 Ohio St. 2d 157, 161, overruling paragraph one of the syllabus in <em>Hyde </em>v. <em>Lakewood </em>[1965], 2 Ohio St. 2d 155; <em>Muskopf v. Corning Hospital District </em>[1961], 55 Cal. 2d 211, 359 P. 2d 457; <em>Molitor </em>v. <em>Kaneland Community Unit District No. 302 </em>[1959], 18 Ill. 2d 11, 25, 163 N. E. 2d 89.)</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Moreover, where the legitimate purpose of a doctrine no longer exists and its application produces unjust results, it should not be retained on the grounds of <em>stare decisis. </em>As Justice Holmes.said:</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">\u201cIt is revolting to hav\u00e9 no better reason for a rule than that it was laid down in the time' of- Henry IV. It is still mor\u00e9 revolting if the grounds upon which-it was laid down have vanished long since,.and the rule, simply persists from blind imitation.of the past.\u201d Oliver. Wendell Holmes, Collected Legal Papers (1920), at page 187. In <em>Avellone v. St. John\u2019s Hospital </em>(1956), 165 Ohio St. 467, 473-475, this court rejected <em>stare decisis </em>and charitable immunity for hospitals on the grounds that the charitable immunity rule had outlived its purpose in light of the \u201csocial conscious: ness of. present day government,\u201d inroads -which, had already been made on the charitable immunity doctrine and the availability- of insurance. Given- the-^legislative and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>judicial inroads on municipal immunity<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the availability of insurance and other types of funding for municipalities,the same arguments apply to the instant cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">In addition, the inequities arising out of judicial attempts to limit immunity by classifying municipal functions as proprietary rather than governmental are as dramatic in'Ohio as in any other jurisdiction. Indeed,-\u201cit is impossible1'to-reconcile all\u2019the decisions of this court dealing'-with the subject of governmental and proprietary functions in relation to a municipality.\u201d <em>Eversole </em>v. <em>Columbus </em>(1959), 169 Ohio St. 205, 208. This court\u2019s <em>ad hoc- </em>approach to the governmental-proprietary doctrine and the General Assembly\u2019s enactment of B. C. 701.02 and 723.01 have, in the name of <em>limiting </em>immunity, placed the individual irrthe following situation. He may risk injury by walking - down a street where a sewer is being <em>maintained or </em>by attending a program at a municipal auditorium or by unwittingly placing himself in the range of a policeman driving negligently and know that he may sue the municipality for his injuries, <em>Portsmouth </em>v. <em>Mitchell Manufacturing Co. </em>(1925), 113 Ohio St. 250. See <em>State, ex rel. </em>White, v. <em>Cleveland </em>(1932), 125 Ohio St. 230; R. C. 701.02.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> If, however, he walks down, a street where a sewer is being <em>constructed, </em>or visits- a muni-, cipal zoo, or, as in the instant cause, he unwittingly places himself in the range of a policeman- who. allegedly negligently shoots him, he has no recourse against the- city; <em>Hutchinson </em>v. <em>Lakewood </em>(1932), 125 Ohio St. 100; <em>Crisafi </em>v. <em>Cleveland </em>(1959), 169 Ohio St. <em>137; Gabris </em>v. <em>Blake </em>(1967), 9 Ohio St. 2d 71.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> If such arbitrary and irrationaFre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>suits are the product of judicial and legislative attempts to expand an individual's recourse against his local government, then it would be much better and simpler to join lire majority of American jurisdictions and abolish municipal immunity altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">The objections that abolishing immunity would create a flood of litigation or that it would financially cripple local governments are insufficient to require a negative answer (see David, Tort Liability of Local Government: Alternatives to Immunity from Liability or Suit [1959], 6 U.C.L.A. L. Rev. 1; Lambert, Tort Law, 36 A.T.L.A. L.J. 29, 23), especially since immunity has already been legislatively and judicially abolished for a number of municipal activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">In addition, if the burden of damages must be imposed, it is much fairer that it be imposed on the municipality than on the victim. In the words of one commentator:</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">\u201c * * * cities and states are active and virile creatures capable of inflicting great harm, and their civil liability should be co-extensive. Even though a governmental entity does not profit from its projects, the taxpaying public nevertheless does, and it is the taxpaying public which should pay for governmental maladministration. If the city operates or maintains injury-inducing activities or conditions, the harm thus caused should be viewed as a part of the normal and proper costs of public administration and not as a diversion of public funds. The city is a far better loss-distributing agency than the innocent and injured vietim.\u201d 32 A.T. L. L.J. 284, 288 (1968); see, also, 2 Harper <em>&amp; </em>James, The Law of Torts (1956), 1622. As Judge Gibson stated in his concurrence to <em>Hack </em>v. <em>Salem </em>(1963), 174 Ohio St. 383, at page .397, <em>\u201c </em>[tjo raise the question of whether the municipality or the injured individual is better able to bear the cost is to answer it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">Where, as in the instant cause, the individual is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>paralyzed 17-year-old boy and the municipality is able to obtain liability insurance, one wonders if the question even need be asked.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">Because the judicially-created doctrine of sovereign immunity for municipalities is a legal anachronism which denies recovery to injured individuals without regard to the municipality\u2019s culpability or the individual\u2019s need for compensation, I believe this court should join the ranks of the majority of American jurisdictions and abolish it. Therefore, I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b253-5\">Celebeezze and Sweeney, JJ., concur in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b248-6\">\u201c* * * earliest common law the doctrine of \u2018sovereign immunity\u2019 did not produce the harsh results it does today. It was a rule that allowed substantial relief. It began as the personal prerogative of the king, gained impetus from sixteenth century metaphysical concepts, may have been based on the misreading of an ancient maxim, and only rarely had the effect of completely denying compensation. How it became in the United States the basis for a rule that the federal and state governments did not have to answer for their torts has been called \u2018one of the mysteries of legal evolution.\u2019 (Borchard, Governmental Responsibility [sic] in Tort, 34 Yale L.
