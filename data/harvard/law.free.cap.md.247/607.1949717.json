A blood test requested by the appellant failed to exclude him as a possible father. The jury found in favor of the appellee and the court entered an order directing the appellant to pay a monthly sum for the support of the child until the child reached the age of twenty-one or became emancipated. The appellant moved for a new trial which was denied. On appeal the appellant contends that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to grant a new trial in view of the insufficiency of the evidence to sustain the verdict of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">\u201cThe general rule is that the disposition of a motion for a new trial is within the sound discretion of the trial court and is not a subject of appeal.\u201d <em>W. B. &amp; A. Electric Railroad Co. v. Kimmey, </em>141 Md. 243, 250, 118 Atl. 648, 650 (1922). Indeed, as was said in <em>State use of Scruggs v. Baltimore Transit Co., </em>177 Md. 451, 454-55, 9 A. 2d 753, 754 (1939)\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-9\">\u201cIt is only when the action of the court has in fact denied the party some substantial right, which goes not to form, but amounts to a denial of the right, that a review is entertained on appeal. The appeal in the case of * * * <em>[Kimmey, </em>supra] * * * exemplifies this point. In that decision the trial court had, by its action on a motion of <em>ne recipiatwr </em>refused in effect to entertain the motion for a new trial. * * * Here [in <em>Scruggs] </em>no such course was pursued. Since nothing is found to have been done * * * which was not in the exercise of the sound discretion of the court, the appeals will be dismissed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">We think the general rule is applicable here for there was no abuse of discretion by the trial court in denying the motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>lor a new trial. We have examined the record and conclude that there was sufficient evidence on which the jury could rationally base its verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">\n<em>Order affirmed; appellant to pay the costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
