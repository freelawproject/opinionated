The realtor showed the property to several prospective purchasers, and on May 11, 1965, showed the property to Arvel B. Musick, the appellee. The appellee discussed the terms of sale with appellant William Potter and on or about May 22, 1965, decided to. purchase the property for the asking price. On May 28, 1965, the appellees executed the contract which had previously been executed by the appellants on May 24, 1965. The contract permitted the sellers to retain possession for sixty days. On June 26, 1965, appellant Vannie M. Potter notified the appellee, Arvel B. Musick, that the appellants did not intend to go through with the contract. Although the appellees in turn notified appellants, in writing, that they were ready, able, and willing to settle, the appellants persisted in their refusal to- execute the deed. This suit for specific performance was then filed by the appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">At the hearing below, the appellant introduced witnesses who testified that the appellant, William Potter, was suffering from mental depression and despondency and that between the dates of May 24, 1965 to and through May 28, 1965, he was not mentally competent to have entered into a binding contract. Two of the appellants\u2019 witnesses were doctors \u2014 one a general practitioner, who was the family physician, the other a psychiatrist. The general practitioner had not seen Mr. Potter from April until June 25, 1965, and he testified that although mentally despondent he had lucid intervals. The psychiatrist testified that much of her information concerning the depressed condition of Mr. Potter came from his son and wife; that she thought his judgment was impaired; that he was confused and depressed; but, \u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean that he isn\u2019t correctly oriented.\u201d She felt that evidence of his depression and impairment of judgment was demonstrated by the fact that he put such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>low value on his property, \u201cbecause even though I don\u2019t know very much about real estate, this didn\u2019t seem to me like a very ..good expression of judgment of the value of this property.\u201d On cross-examination, the psychiatrist, when asked whether or not Mr. Potter\u2019s conduct throughout the negotiations for the sale of his property was perfectly normal, replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I wasn\u2019t there. I don\u2019t know how he acted.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-5\">Q. Well, based on the testimony that you heard today of his conduct, would you say that it was perfectly normal conduct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-6\">A. I couldn\u2019t judge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">Evidence showed that Mr. Potter still drove his automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">Mr. Potter did not testify at the hearing and the chancellor, in his memorandum opinion, stated: \u201cI believe that I have already commented upon the alertness which seemed evident to the Court from Mr. Potter\u2019s appearance at the trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">The appellees, the realtor, and one prospective purchaser all testified that Mr. Potter appeared mentally competent when they had visited him at his property and had conversed sensibly.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-10\">In the court below the appellants attempted to show that $15,500 was not a fair consideration for the property, but have abandoned this contention on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-11\">We are of the opinion that the finding of the chancellor that the appellants had not met the requisite burden of proof to show .that Mr. Potter was mentally incompetent and thus not capable of entering into a binding contract was not clearly erroneous, Rule 886 a; and that he was correct in entering a decree for specific performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-12\">There is no difference in the mental capacity required for the valid execution of a contract for the sale of real property and that required for an instrument testamentary in character, Code (1957), Art. 93, \u00a7 349. The Court believes this case to be controlled by what we had to say on mental capacity in <em>Sachs v. Little, </em>245 Md. 343, 226 A. 2d 283 (1967); <em>Ingalls v. Trustees, </em>244 Md. 243, 223 A. 2d 778 (1966)<em>; Arbogast, Exec. v. MacMillan, </em>221 Md. 516, 158 A. 2d 97 (1960).
