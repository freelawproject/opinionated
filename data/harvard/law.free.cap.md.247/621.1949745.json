The parties were married in 1951. Their only child is a girl, now 13. Until their .separation they lived in publicly owned quarters at Friendship International Airport where the appellant (Golas) is the fire \u25a0chief. From time to time during 1963 and 1964 Golas upbraided his wife (the appellee) for being so much in the company of the friend (Mrs. Littleford). These occasions usually ended in a quarrel garnished, at times, with violence. She testified she \u25a0often had cuts and bruises as a result of his beatings. As he tells it, the cuts and bruises were sustained in his defense against ber assaults upon him and he insists she bruises easily. She would get so mad, he testified, she would put her fist through \u25a0a window. They quarreled for the last time on 9 July 1964 when Golas ordered her to remove Mrs. Littleford\u2019s car from their driveway. She did so but she took the child with her and that night moved in with the Littlefords. A few months later the wife\u2019s mother (Mrs. Barrett) rented a house near the Little-fords in which she installed her daughter and the child. Mrs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>Barrett had a full-time job which made it difficult for her to care for her invalid husband so she moved him in with the appellee, an arrangement which seems to have suited everyone except Golas.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">A few weeks after his wife\u2019s departure he filed a bill for a divorce a mensa. Within a month she countered with a cross-bill alleging \u201cacts of cruelty and vicious conduct\u201d and asking for alimony, support, counsel fees, custody of the child, and an order restraining him from making use of funds deposited in a building and loan association. In the succeeding months Mrs. Barrett tried to effect a reconciliation but she said she \u201cjust couldn\u2019t get those two loggerheads together.\u201d Golas extended the olive branch several times but she refused to return on \u201chis terms.\u201d He said the only answer he ever got from her was that she didn\u2019t \u201cknow what to tell Judy [Mrs. Littleford]\u201d or that she wanted time to think it over. One night in December 1964 he took the daughter out to dinner. When he brought her home his wife invited him to come into the house. About 5 minutes later Mrs. Littleford came in. They had words. Mrs. Little-ford broke his nose and chased him out of the house with a broom. He obtained a warrant for her arrest. Later that night the wife telephoned him and offered to \u201ccome back home\u201d if he would drop the charges against Mrs. Littleford. He did so but she did not come home. She wanted \u201cmore time to think it over,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">In January 1966 Golas filed a supplemental bill asking for a divorce a vinculo alleging desertion. Judge Sachse, before whom the case was tried on 20 April 1966, dismissed the supplemental bill and ordered Golas to pay permanent alimony, support and a counsel fee. He awarded the custody of the child to- the wife and he ordered Golas to pay to his wife \u201cone-half of the net proceeds received * * * from the sale of real estate owned by them as tenants by the entireties.\u201d Golas has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">We think it is unnecessary to consider whether Golas has made out a case against his wife. We have been unable to discover in the rather voluminous record the corroboration required by Maryland Rule S75. The dismissal of his supplemental bill was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">The next assignment of error springs from the well settled' rule that permanent alimony may not be awarded unless the complainant shows grounds sufficient to support a decree of divorce, either a vinculo or a mensa. <em>Levy v. Levy, </em>229 Md. 103, 181 A. 2d 663 (1962); <em>Russell v. Russell, </em>224 Md. 329, 167 A. 2d 770 (1961). The wife referred generally to the mental and physical \u201ctorment\u201d Golas had inflicted upon her. She said she had gotten \u201cmany beatings from him.\u201d She told of specific beatings during 1964. On one occasion, she said, she was so-upset from a beating that she had to see her doctor the next morning. She \u201chad a spell\u201d in his office and he had to give her adrenalin. She has a \u201cheart condition\u201d for which the doctor-prescribes Quinidene. On another occasion after \u201che beat * * * [her] up quite a bit\u201d she left home and went to her friend\u2019s house. Mrs. Littleford wiped the blood off of her face and applied plastic bandages to her cuts. She said he struck her before she left on 9 July. She indicated she would not return to-the marital domicile unless \u201che changed\u201d because she \u201ccertainly couldn\u2019t go on with his fighting and arguing over every-little thing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">The corroboration required by Rule S75 was provided, we-think, by the testimony of Mrs. Littleford and the parties\u2019 daughter. Mrs. Littleford said Golas came to her house one night,, got her out of bed and told her \u201che just beat the devil out of\u201d' his wife and \u201cordered * * * [Mrs. Littleford] to tell * * * [his wife] to keep off of\u201d the Littleford property. The next day she saw the appellee and \u201cshe was bruised\u201d and her face-was cut. She spoke also of the time the appellee came to her home bruised and bleeding. \u201cShe needed a doctor\u2019s attention\u201d' but she [Mrs. Littleford] could not persuade her to do anything about it. The daughter testified that she often heard her parents, \u201chollering\u201d at each other and that \u201cusually it was at night.\u201d She remembered that \u201csometimes Mom had bruises on her arm.\u201d'</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">Judge Sachse had the advantage of seeing and hearing the-witnesses and, obviously, he chose to believe the testimony of' the appellee, her daughter and Mrs. Littleford. We have said, many times that any conduct on the part of the husband that endangers, or creates a reasonable apprehension that it will end: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>in endangering, his wife\u2019s health to a degree rendering it physically or mentally impossible for her properly to discharge the marital duties constitutes the cruelty that is cause for divorce. <em>Schwartzman v. Schwartzman, </em>204 Md. 125, 102 A. 2d 810 (1954); <em>Scheinin v. Scheinin, </em>200 Md. 282, 89 A. 2d 609 (1952); see also cases cited in M.L.E., <em>Divorce, </em>\u00a7 14. While a different conclusion might well have been reached on this, record we are unwilling to say that Judge Sachse was clearly wrong in his decision. <em>Scheinin v. Scheinin, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Neither in his brief nor in his argument before us did Golas, complain of those parts of the Chancellor\u2019s decree (a) granting the care and custody of the little girl to the appellee, (b) ordering the payment of $17.50 per week for her support, and (c) ordering the payment of $300 to appellee\u2019s attorney. In any event, in these circumstances, we see no reason for disturbing the Chancellor\u2019s orders in regard to custody, support and counsel fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">We must agree with Golas that Judge Sachse was without authority to order the division of the proceeds of sale of the realty owned by the parties as tenants by the entireties.

Smith, 227 </em>Md. 355, 176 A. 2d 862 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">\n<em>Decree reversed in part and affirmed in part and case remanded for the passage of a decree to conform with this opinion.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b643-10\">\n<em>Appellant to pay the costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
