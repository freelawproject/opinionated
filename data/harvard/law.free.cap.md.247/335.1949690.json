We find that ruling to have been correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">Shaw, called as a witness by Billings, says he was driving his car south on Route 170 in Anne Arundel County at thirty-five miles an hour in a fifty-mile zone when he observed, some five hundred yards ahead of him, two boys on bicycles, also riding south. One was on the gravel shoulder to his right, the other, the appellant, was also off the road on that side but on what was described as \u201cnot the blacktop area. That little part like a sidewalk.\u201d Shaw pulled slightly to his left, almost to the center line, and as he approached Billings \u201ctouched\u201d his horn. Billings, without looking back, stood up on the bicycle pedals and \u201cshot\u201d the bicycle to the left across the road. Shaw swerved to his left and stopped on the extreme left of the road several feet beyond the point where the right front fender of his car and Billings\u2019 bicycle came into contact.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">It is clear to us that the proximate cause of the accident was Billings\u2019 sudden and not to be anticipated lunge into the roadway. The motor vehicle laws as to the rules of the road apply to a cyclist, Code (1957), Art. 66)4, \u00a7 184 (a). Section 219 (b) of Art. 66)4 provides inter alia that \u201c* * * the driver of an overtaken vehicle shall give way to the right in favor of the overtaking vehicle on audible signal * * Billings was old enough to be bound by the rules of the road and to be guilty of contributory negligence, which would bar his recovery as a matter of law. <em>Kane v. </em>Williams, 229 Md. 59.
