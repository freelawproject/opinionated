Yost (Yost) and Theresa, his wife (Mrs. Yost), went to a dance on Saturday, 25 March 1962, at a union hall in East Baltimore. On their way home, Buettner, in whose car they were riding, collided with a truck owned by Truck Rental Co. and leased to Martin Furniture Corp. (Martin). All were injured in some degree. Charles J. Douglas (Douglas), an employee of Martin, was the driver of the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>Betty and her husband<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sued Martin and Douglas. The Yosts also sued Martin and Douglas. In each case Martin made Buettner a third party defendant. Buettner did not file a cross-claim in either suit. The cases were tried together before Judge Men-chine, without a jury. He found for Betty and the Yosts against Martin and for Martin against Buettner in the third party proceedings. Both Martin and Buettner have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">The Yosts liked \u201cto dance more than anything.\u201d Buettner, Mrs. Yost\u2019s bachelor brother, shared their enthusiasm for dancing. Having made plans to attend the dance Buettner bought the tickets. It was arranged that they would meet at the Yosts\u2019 house and go to the hall in his car. He was to bring Betty whom he had been seeing regularly. The Yosts, however, had not met her. Fie told Betty to meet him at the Sportman\u2019s Bar around 7:00 P.M. He got there a little before she did and when she came in they had a glass of draft beer. It was about 8:00' P.M. when they arrived at his sister\u2019s home. They \u201csat and talked for a half hour or more.\u201d No drinks were served. They left at about 8:45 P.M. and drove directly to the hall, arriving there shortly after 9:00' P.M.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">They went to the table designated on their tickets which they shared with several other couples. On each table were small \u201cCoca-Cola\u201d glasses and pitchers of draft beer which were replenished by waitresses as the evening wore on. In addition to the pretzels and potato chips on the table food was served between 11 and 12 o\u2019clock. Betty said it consisted of \u201cbaked beans and roast beef\u201d and that all of them ate some of it. She drank 4 or 5 glasses of beer and she guessed Buettner drank 6 or <em>7. </em>He said he might have had that many. Yost had 6 to 8 glasses of beer. Mrs. Yost thought she had 3 or 4. None of them drank anything but draft beer. Their dancing seems to have been indefatigable as well as enthusiastic.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">After the dance, a little after 1 o\u2019clock, they went to Stetka\u2019s Bar on Eastern Avenue where another of Mrs. Yost\u2019s brothers was one of the bartenders. Stetka\u2019s was about to close when they arrived so they each had a small beer and started for home, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>shortly before 2 o\u2019clock. Buettner said he was \u201cwide awake\u201d when they left the union hall and no one had expressed any doubts or fears in respect of his ability to drive carefully and safely. Asked, on cross-examination, if she was intoxicated when they left Stetka\u2019s, Betty said she knew she was not intoxicated and that the others \u201call acted normal.\u201d Mrs. Yost said Buettner \u201cseemed all right to\u201d her and that he was operating his car \u201cgood, as well as any other time.\u201d Asked if she \u201ccautioned him\u201d at any time during the evening about \u201cthe fact that he was drinking beer\u201d she said, \u201cNo, it didn\u2019t seem no reason to.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">After leaving Stetka\u2019s Buettner headed east on Eastern Avenue. Betty was beside him. Yost was on the right side of the \u25a0rear seat; Mrs. Yost was on the left side. His car was a 1958 Ford sedan, powered by a 6 cylinder engine with a 3 speed manual transmission. He thought his brakes and tires were in good condition. They chatted, as they went along, about the party and the people who were there. There was very little traffic. Buettner was going between 30 to 35 miles per hour in an area where the posted limit was 35 miles per hour. None of them noticed anything unusual about his driving. Yost said he drove \u201cjust like any other time he drives, perfect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Where Eastern Avenue passes under North Point Boulevard it is divided into eastbound and westbound lanes by a concrete median strip. East of the underpass the grade rises to the crest of a hill. At this point the eastbound lane is further divided into a \u201cfast\u201d lane next to the median strip, a \u201cslow\u201d lane to the right of the \u201cfast\u201d lane and a \u201ccurb\u201d lane to the right of the \u201cslow\u201d lane. The \u201ccurb\u201d lane, about 400 feet further east, becomes an exit ramp leading to a shopping center. Just before reaching the crest of the hill Buettner, in the \u201cslow\u201d lane, became aware of a truck moving in the same direction in the \u201ccurb\u201d lane. He estimated the speed of the truck to be about \u25a020 to 25 miles per hour. Since he was going 30 to 35 miles per hour he intended to pass the truck. There was no other eastbound traffic near him as he remembers it. Asked if he intended to change lanes before passing he said he could have done so but \u201cit didn\u2019t seem like * * * [he] would have to at that time.\u201d Suddenly and without any warning to Buettner, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>truck turned to the left. Fie thought the truck was two- to three car lengths away when it turned across his path. He \u201chit the brakes\u201d but he remembers nothing more.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Neither Betty nor Mrs. Yost was able to recall anything of significance. Yost thought he saw the truck\u2019s tail light blink just before the collision. They all said there was nothing unusual about Buettner\u2019s driving and their testimony appears to confirm his own statement that he was not exceeding the posted limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Corporal Kemmerzell of the Baltimore County Police described the scene of the accident and identified the photographs he had taken. He said the truck, which bore the insignia of \u201cMartin Furniture Company,\u201d was perpendicular to the path of travel, facing north, blocking both the \u201ccurb\u201d lane and most of the \u201cslow\u201d lane. He found debris about in the middle of the \u201cslow\u201d lane. The outside wheel of the double left rear wheel of the truck had been broken off and was lying amidst the debris between the truck and the front of Buettner\u2019s car. The distance between the truck and the front of Buettner\u2019s car was found to be about 8 feet. He said he noticed \u201cstraight skid marks leading directly\u201d to Buettner\u2019s car. He described them as being 132 feet long and \u201csolid\u201d rather than \u201cbroken.\u201d The damage to the truck was confined to the left rear wheel and the suspension. Only the front of Buettner\u2019s car was damaged. Corporal Kemmerzell stated that Buettner\u2019s car \u201cdidn\u2019t strike the rear wheel in regards to following the truck from the rear to the front. It struck the rear wheel from the side, from the left side going toward the right side.\u201d Judge Menchine refused to allow the officer to state his opinion of the speed of Buettner\u2019s car based on either the skid marks or the damage to the front of his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">Corporal Schramm, who came to the scene of the accident with Corporal Kemmerzell, said he could not give an estimate of speed based on skid marks or front end damage. Neither he nor Kemmerzell examined Buettner\u2019s tires or checked his brakes. In his report he said Buettner was \u201capparently normal.\u201d His testimony, in general, supported Kemmerzell\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">Buettner testified that he \u201cdidn\u2019t see any signals at all from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>[the truck] * * * hand signals, light signals or anything.\u201d He said he <em>thought </em>he could bring his car, going 30 to 35 miles, per hour, to a complete stop in \u201cabout a car length or so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">The plaintiffs-appellees produced, as a part of their case in. chief, the testimony of Ivan Aaronson, the president of Martin. At the time of the accident he was general manager. Asked what his duties were he said he \u201cdid everything * * * [he] ran the store, bought merchandise * * * had control over the organization.\u201d He confirmed what had been stipulated as the trial began, that Martin leased the truck from Truck Rental Co. He testified that no one else used the truck and, except for periodic servicing by Truck Rental Co., it was under the complete and exclusive control of Martin.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">Douglas began working for Martin, as a helper, about a year before the accident. Six months later the driver quit \u201cand he [Douglas] became the driver.\u201d Aaronson said he had \u201ccomplete authority to hire and fire\u201d Douglas. The truck was used to deliver furniture to customers and for the movement of furniture from one to another of its three stores. The daily movements of the truck were under the supervision of a warehouseman. Deliveries were made to customers anywhere within a hundred mile radius of Baltimore and deliveries were made on the day of the accident in the \u201cNorth Point Road area.\u201d Aaron-son said Douglas was authorized to take the truck on that day and that he knew Douglas had it. Douglas reported the accident to Aaronson the following morning. He did not reprimand Douglas then or at any other time. Except for the report to-Truck Rental Company, the accident seems not to have been discussed again. Douglas continued to work at the same job and at the same salary, for about two months more when he quit because of some disagreement with Aaronson, entirely unrelated to the accident. We have not been made privy to the reasons why he appears to have fled the realm after leaving Martin\u2019s employ. He was returned <em>non est </em>in both cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">Asked what Douglas had been told in respect of his duties- and responsibilities, Aaronson said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-9\">\u201cWhen we gave him the driver\u2019s job, is that what you want to know ? That\u2019s his responsibility, of course, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>to deliver tbe furniture, pack it, make sure it is delivered to the customer in good shape. The truck, there are certain things that have to be taken care of, the truck. The job, that there is no hitchhikers, that the truck has to be \u2014 after he makes deliveries, the truck comes back to the store, and we tell him there is one, two, three spots to park it in, and maybe forty, fifty other things, but at that time there is a lot of things that we discuss with him because we know he is capable of doing it, and we go over what his duties are.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">He said also that the use of the truck for personal purposes was forbidden.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">Martin\u2019s first and principal contention arises out of the application by the trial judge of a presumption that Douglas was acting within the scope of his employment and his finding that Martin did not rebut that presumption. Martin asserts, and we agree, that where the servant of the <em>owner </em>is involved in a collision, there is a reasonable presumption that the servant was acting within the scope of his employment. But, argues Martin, it must first be proved that the operator of the vehicle is the servant of the person sought to be held and, secondly, it must be shown that the person sought to be held is the <em>owner </em>of the-vehicle. Since it was not the owner of the truck, Martin continues, the presumption that Douglas was acting within the scope of his employment cannot arise. Furthermore, says Martin, the trial judge erroneously applied the definition of \u201cowner,\u201d as it appears in Code, Art. <em>66y2, </em>\u00a7 2, to the situation here presented. \u00a7 2 provides that the \u201cterm owner shall include any * * * corporation * * * having the exclusive use * * * [of the vehicle] under contract of purchase, lease * * We agree-that the statutory definition per se cannot be used to equate lessee with owner within the context of the instant case. <em>Association of Independent Taxi Operators Inc. v. Kern, </em>178 Md. 252, 13 A. 2d 374 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">It should be observed that here we are dealing with two presumptions. The first is that the operator of the vehicle is the servant of its owner; the second, that the servant was acting. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>within the scope of his employment. We are not aware of any reason why these presumptions cannot be applied independently. In the case at bar, for example, it was unnecessary to make use of the first presumption because Martin admitted that Douglas was its servant. Martin, nevertheless, seems to be saying that there is some occult force inherent in the word \u201cowner\u201d which bars the use of the second presumption unless it is applied in connection with the first presumption, and then only where the operator is the servant of the <em>owner.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Why ownership of the truck should be an essential factor in determining whether Douglas was acting within the scope of his employment escapes us. Martin enjoyed all of the benefits of ownership except the holding of title and the burdens flowing therefrom. Douglas surely was no less an employee of Martin merely because Truck Rental held the title. Indeed, assuming Martin had the use of two trucks, one owned and one leased, each alternately driven by Douglas, could it be said that the status of Douglas vis-a-vis Martin and the general public would change each time he shifted from one truck to the other? We think not. <em>Erdman v. Horkheimer &amp; Co., </em>169 Md. 204, 206, 181 Atl. 221 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Martin has cited many cases in support of its position. Perhaps it would be more nearly correct to say that they coincide with its position because none of them says or suggests that the two presumptions are interdependent and can be applied only where the master is also the owner. We have not found nor have we been referred to any decision declaring the presumption that the servant was acting within the scope of his employment to be unavailable because the master was not the owner of the vehicle involved in the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\"><em>Finney v. Frevel, </em>183 Md. 355, 359, 37 A. 2d 923 (1944) is one of a number of the decisions of this Court indicating that the two presumptions are not interdependent. In that case, Judge Collins, for the Court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-9\">\u201cAs to the negligence of Karl E. Frevel, there was no evidence offered that he was either the driver or owner of the car in collision with the station wagon. Ownership and operation of the car, however, are al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>leged in the declaration to be in Frevel. As the ownership was not denied by him in the next succeeding pleading, for the purpose of this case, ownership is admitted in him. Flack\u2019s Code, 1939, Art. 75, Sec. 28, Subsec. 109. Ownership being thus established, a <em>prima facie </em>presumption arises that the operator of the vehicle was the servant and agent of the owner. <em>Pennsylvania R. R. Co. v. Lord, </em>159 Md. 518, 526, 151 A. 400; <em>Gutheridge v. Gorsuch, supra, </em>177 Md. 109, 114, 115, 8 A. 2d 885. <em>A reasonable presumption also arises </em>that the servant and agent was acting in the scope of his employment and upon the business of the master and this presumption exists until rebutted. <em>Erdman v. Horkheimer &amp; Co., </em>169 Md. 204, 181 A. 221; <em>Phipps v. Milligan, </em>174 Md. 438, 199 A. 498; <em>Gutheridge v. Gorsuch, supra.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">See also <em>Penn. R. R. Co. v. Lord, </em>159 Md. 518, 526-27, 151 Atl. 400 (1930); <em>Brown v. Bendix Aviation Corp. </em>187 Md. 613, 621-22, 51 A. 2d 292 (1947); <em>Grier v. Rosenberg, </em>213 Md. 248, 252-55, 131 A. 2d 737 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">We see nothing improper in Judge Menchine\u2019s utilization of the presumption that Douglas was acting within the scope of his employment and we think the evidence was sufficient to support his finding that the presumption was not rebutted.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-10\">Martin next contends the trial judge was clearly erroneous in holding the appellees had sustained the burden of proving that Douglas was acting within the scope of his employment without the aid of the presumption. What we have said in respect of Martin\u2019s first contention makes it unnecessary for us to consider this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-12\">In its final contention Martin says the trial judge erred \u201cin not finding that the appellees assumed the risk or contributed to the cause of the accident.\u201d In respect of the assumption of risk aspect of Martin\u2019s contention we quote from the trial judge\u2019s opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>\u201cAs to the assumption of risk. The defendant argues with vehemence that the plaintiffs should be denied recovery because they assumed the risk of injury when they entered the Buettner car upon leaving Stetka\u2019s Tavern at about 2:00 a.m. The record shows that Buettner had two [one, as we read the record] beers at the Sportsman\u2019s Bar, bottles or glasses, indefinite; five or six small glasses of about four ounces at a dance and one beer, a bottle or glass, at Stetka\u2019s. All of the plaintiffs admit the ingestion of substantially the same quantity of beer during the course of the six hours, most of which was spent dancing. Food was served about midway of the evening. All denied being under the influence of alcohol, and Buettner was recorded by Corporal Schramm, then acting in the Accident Investigation Division of the Baltimore County Police, as, \u2018apparently normal,\u2019 in his report of the accident. There is not the slightest evidence of driving incapacity except the happening of the accident; no suggestion of bizarre behavior at any time during the evening; nothing in the hospital records to suggest that any of the three victims were affected by alcoholic intake. I find no evidence to permit application of the assumption of risk doctrine in this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">In our judgment there is sufficient evidence in the record to support Judge Menchine\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">Judge Menchine, after discussing at length the question whether Betty and the Yosts were guilty of contributory negligence, concluded :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-7\">\u201cUnder such circumstances, I cannot find that these passengers should have sensed danger from the manner in which the vehicle was being operated before the collision. At the very most, my mind is in a state of even balance or equipoise upon the subject so I must find that the defendant has failed to meet the burden of persuasion upon the subject.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">Since we think there was sufficient evidence to support his finding, we cannot say he was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">We turn now to Buettner\u2019s contention that it was error to find him guilty of negligence. In this regard the trial judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-6\">\u201cThe evidence establishes, to my satisfaction, that although the movement of Douglas without warning across the path of Buettner was a competent producing cause of the collision without which it could not and would not have occurred, nonetheless, <em>the excessive speed of Buettner is a contributing cause </em>because I am persuaded that had his vehicle been traveling at a lawful speed, he could have stopped in time to have avoided the collision. I find, accordingly, that both Douglas and Buettner were negligent, and that the negligence of each was a contributing cause of the injuries.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">The trial judge explained how he reached the conclusion that Buettner\u2019s speed was \u201cexcessive,\u201d in these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-8\">\u201cThere is, accordingly, no direct credible evidence of the operation of the vehicle by Buettner at an unlawful speed in this thirty-five mile zone, but it has been held on many occasions that an inference of excessive speed may be drawn from other evidence. Buettner has testified on cross examination that he could stop his vehicle within a car length or so when traveling at thirty to thirty-five miles an hour. As previously stated, I accept as proved that the Buettner vehicle laid down skid marks one hundred and thirty-two feet long. The unsuccessful application of brakes for such a distance justifies the inference of unlawful speed notwithstanding the fact that he was on an incline in the road that led to the point of impact. I draw such inference.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">Although he \u201cfound that the speed of Buettner was unlawful, that is, that it exceeded thirty-five miles per hour in a zone limited to that speed,\u201d he also found that while \u201cit was not possible to fix the actual speed,\u201d he could not infer that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>\u201can extremely high and dangerous speed.\u201d He said \u201cthe tire marks indicate a speed greater than thirty-five miles per hour on the basis of Buettner\u2019s own estimate of his stopping distance at that speed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">In our judgment the trial judge has attributed more significance to Buettner\u2019s estimate of his ability to stop than is justified. Since there is no evidence that Buettner had ever made a trial of his ability to stop within any distance from any speed or that he was aware of the fact that 30 miles per hour is 44 feet per second we must assume that he was simply voicing an erroneous but widely held belief. The trial judge should have rejected as impossible Buettner\u2019s estimate that <em>he </em>could stop <em>Ms </em>car within a \u201ccar length or so.\u201d See the cases collected in 10 M.L.E., <em>Evidence, </em>\u00a7 322.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">In these circumstances, then, is the testimony in respect of the \u201cskid marks\u201d sufficient to support a finding of unlawful speed? We think not. In <em>Shafer v. State, </em>171 Md. 506, 509, 189 Atl. 273 (1937) Chief Judge Bond, for the Court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-7\">\u201cEvidence offered to support a contrary explanation, that the collision was caused by negligent driving of Ogden, consists entirely of testimony of marks on the road seen by witnesses arriving at various times after the accident. Reliance upon such evidence alone for judicial determination of movements leading to a collision, and for imposition of a liability for damages, <em>is beset with dangers, </em>but there would seem to be no room for doubt that in some cases it might amount to proof of negligence. <em>Schier v. Wehner, </em>116 Md. 553, 555, 82 A. 976; <em>Opecelo v. Meads, </em>152 Md. 29, 38, 135 A. 488; <em>Anderson v. Lynch, </em>232 Mich. 276, 279, 205 N.W. 134; <em>Amer. Film Co. v. Moye </em>(C.C.A.) 267 Fed. 419. It would be legally sufficient or insufficient in a particular instance according as it might or might not rise above speculation and conjecture on what had taken place, and so afford the rational basis needed for an adjudication that the defendant\u2019s agent was guilty of negligence which produced the accident.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>In <em>Finney v. Frevel, supra, </em>Judge Collins, citing <em>Shafer, supra, </em>said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-6\">\u201cReliance upon testimony alone of marks upon the road, even though clearly shown to be made by the defendant\u2019s car, to establish negligence has never been favored by this Court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 360.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">It is true that in some later decisions of the Court, where the facts were different, the statements quoted from <em>Shafer, supra, </em>and <em>Finney, supra, </em>were distinguished. Cf. <em>Acme Poultry Corp. v. Melville, </em>188 Md. 365, 371-2, 53 A. 2d 1 (1947); <em>Scott v. James Gibbons Co., </em>192 Md. 319, 330, 64 A. 2d 117 (1949). In the instant case, however, they seem to be both timely and apposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">Officer Kemmerzell said the \u201cskid marks\u201d were \u201csolid\u201d and \u201cunbroken.\u201d In view of his statement that the illumination was \u201cpoor\u201d and his admission that he checked neither the brakes nor the tires of Buettner\u2019s car one wonders about the accuracy of his characterization and, in the absence of any other information except their length, what conclusions might be drawn therefrom. He said they were 132 feet long. Buettner, who looked at them the next day, said they were 10 to 12 feet long. What Kemmerzell meant by \u201ca double set of straight skid marks\u201d is uncertain. Were there two \u201cskid marks\u201d or four \u201cskid marks?\u201d There is nothing in the record to suggest that the \u201cskid marks\u201d indicate a maximum braking effort by Buettner for 132 feet. One could as easily predicate a moderate braking effort for some part of the distance and a maximum effort for the remainder.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">However, accepting Officer Kemmerzell\u2019s testimony at its face value, there are too many imponderables in the evidence in respect of the \u201cskid marks\u201d for us to be persuaded that Judge Menchine\u2019s finding of a speed in excess of 35 miles per hour but less than \u201cextremely high or dangerous\u201d is anything but pure speculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">Since, in our judgment, the evidence is insufficient to support a finding of negligence on the part of Buettner it will not be necessary for us to assume that he was negligent and then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>\u25a0consider whether his negligence could have been a proximate \u25a0cause of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">For the reasons stated the judgments in favor of Betty and the Yosts against Martin will be affirmed. The judgments in favor of Martin against Buettner will be reversed and the cases will be remanded for the entry of judgments in favor of Buettner against Martin for costs. The costs of this appeal will be paid by Martin.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">\n<em>Judgments in favor of Betty Jaskulski and Robert C. Yost and Theresa Yost against Martin Furniture Corp. affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">\n<em>Judgments in favor of Martin Furniture Corp. against John Franklin Buettner reversed and cases remanded for the entry of judgments in favor of John Franklin Buettner against Martin Furniture Corp. for costs.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">\n<em>The costs of this appeal will be paid by Martin Furniture Corp.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b63-8\">.
