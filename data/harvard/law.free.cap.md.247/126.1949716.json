B. Stoner, Connie Lynch, Robert Lyons, William Brailsford, and the National State Rights Party, hereinafter referred to as NSRP, from the temporary order of August 7, 1966, and the interlocutory order of August 30, 1966, rendered by the Circuit Court for Somerset County, chancery division, at the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>stance of the appellees, the President and Commissioners of Princess Anne, the County Commissioners of Somerset County, and Mahlond Price and James E. Lauchner, individually, enjoining each of the appellants individually, as well as the NSRP, from holding rallies or participating in any public demonstrations in Somerset County for a period of ten months. The appellants, thereafter, filed an immediate appeal from the various orders below to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">The appellants, each of whom are members or officers of the NSRP, a white supremacist political organization, held what could be described as a public rally or meeting near the courthouse steps on August 6, 1966, at 7:00 p.m., in the Town of Princess Anne, in Somerset County, for the purpose of publicly advancing the tenets of their cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">The community, or some members of it, were notified four hours in advance of the proposal to hold this meeting. Upon their arrival, the appellants commenced to hook up a public address system. At this time, the appellants were approached by Captain Paul J. Randall, Troop Commander of the State Police for the Eastern Shore District. One of the appellants, Joseph Carroll, Youth Director of the NSRP, together with J. B. Stoner, attorney for the organization, asked Captain Randall if there was any law prohibiting the appellants from setting up an amplifjdng device and holding a rally in front of the courthouse on Somerset Street. Captain Randall advised Mr. Carroll that no such law existed. Accordingly, the privilege of holding the rally was extended to the appellants within the ambit of Captain Randall\u2019s authority. Captain Randall did request that the speeches omit any mention of two pending rape cases involving Negro defendants and a white victim. Thereafter, the rally was commenced by the playing of a musical tape, capable of being heard for several blocks, to the repeated refrain : \u201cSend the niggers north.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">Princess Anne, population 1351 (948 white, 403 Negro) is the county seat of Somerset County, population 19,623 (12,315 white, 7,300 Negro). The county is sparsely settled, the majority of its inhabitants being farmers or watermen. Most of the time it is a tranquil community; however, in 1933 it was the scene of Maryland\u2019s last lynching. In 1964 the town was again <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>the scene of serious racial disturbances during which time there were many demonstrations by students of Maryland State College, located in the town with a predominantly Negro student body of 730. A large detachment of Maryland State Police were called at that time to quell the disturbance and the Troop Commander of the State Police was seriously injured. Concentrated sulphuric acid was indiscriminately thrown at the police. Princess Anne is 40 miles from Cambridge, county seat of Dorchester County, where civil disturbances required the presence of the Maryland National Guard for a period of over a year (1963-64). The appellants, the week previously, had been arrested for causing a race riot in Patterson Park, Baltimore, Maryland, which bad been given full TV, radio and press coverage. It was not mere chance which brought the appellants to Princess Anne.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">At 7:15 Joseph Carroll opened the rally with the announcement that this was a white rally, designed to carry forward the views of the white people organized to oppose black terror, the Communist conspiracy in the United States, unconstitutional injunctions against good white people, such as the appellants, the Negro power structure, a mongrelization of the races and integration of schools and housing. To prevent mongrelization, Carroll assured his audience that they intended to fight in the courts and in every legal manner through the political organization of the NSRP and that they had taken enough off of the \u201cniggers\u201d and enough off of \u201cMartin Lucifer Coon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">The appellant, Richard Norton, leveled his sights at the school integration program. Under freedom of choice, according to Norton, a community was not forced to integrate its schools if it refused to accept, * * * \u201cLBJ\u2019s Judas, thirty pieces of silver.\u201d The price of acceptance, continued Norton, would lead to rape and the \u201csacrifice of white blood\u201d in our schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">Norton lived up to the promise given Captain Randall that no mention would be made of the two pending rape cases involving Negro defendants and a white woman; however, with some relish he reminded the crowd about the 1933 lynching, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-8\">\u201cIn 1933 a nigger grabbed a 75 year old white woman in this town and brutally raped her, brutally raped her. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>What did they do? Did the people go out and say that nigger was a victim of discrimination and that\u2019s why he raped her? No. Let me tell you what happened. I am not advocating this but I am just recounting a bit of history. Three thousand people from this town rose up, took that beast out and hung him. You know what the Baltimore papers said, you know what they said? They called it Eastern Shore barbarism, Eastern Shore barbarism. Now a lot of oldtimers here tonight remember the stickers you all had on your cars and windows, T am an Eastern Shore man and damn proud of it.\u2019 You folks proud of it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-6\">\u201c(Voices) Yeah, yeah.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">On integration of schools, Mr. Norton had this to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-8\">\u201cThe act, this is a political struggle, we\u2019re in. It\u2019s a struggle for survival. Don\u2019t think you have it bad down here with niggers. Really, it\u2019s not too bad yet. Come to Baltimore City, see what\u2019s happening to schools there. The school superintendent of Baltimore City, the excellent Dr. Brain, three years ago his daughter went to Western High School. A nigger girl took a coke bottle, smashed the bottom out, and gouged that poor child\u2019s face. Well, after that Dr. Brain resigned, gone to Portland, Oregon, so his daughter could have plastic surgery. Now these bootlickers and political vermin, some of these preachers will tell you they accept this, this is insanity. Don\u2019t accept it. Never accept it. Organize. Fight it. You\u2019ll win every single time. You want to fight? Come on, let\u2019s hear it. Want to fight?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-9\">\u201c(Voices) Yeah, yeah.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">On employment, Mr. Stoner stated :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-11\">\u201cIf we only hire whites and we move the blacks out legally, in accordance with the law, up to New York or some place like that, we won\u2019t have niggers down here to mix up with.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>Mr. Norton continuing on the theme of their Baltimore rally of the previous week, and the inevitable uprising of the whites, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-5\">\u201cWell, let me tell you last Thursday night in Baltimore City, two thousand people stood out there in front of our speakers\u2019 platform and said that they didn\u2019t like niggers and it certainly shook up the political structure of Baltimore City. They had to go to court to stop him. Now they are going to stop us for awhile.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-6\">\u201cWe know the feelings of people. We watched them for three years building in this country. This country, according to the Newsweek magazine, is probably heading for mass racial violence \u2014 two years, three years, nobody can stop it. We can\u2019t stop it, and LBJ can\u2019t stop it, niggers can\u2019t stop it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-7\">\u201cWe always urge white people to get their gun, always have a gun, know how to use it, always have a good supply of ammunition. I will tell you, friends, you are going to have to use it. It\u2019s no use hiding; you can\u2019t bury your head in the sand like an ostrich. The problems aren\u2019t going to go away. The time is come \u2014 you are going to have to stand up and face it. You are going to have to face it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-10\">\u201cBut come on back <em>7 </em>o\u2019clock tomorrow night. We\u2019re going to take it easy tonight \u2014 we don\u2019t want any heart attacks out there. And tomorrow night I want you people really hollering. No violence, just hollering. We want hollering so loud LBJ is going to hear it. Mayor McKeldin heard it in Baltimore. I understand (sic) pulled him half way out of bed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-12\">The next speaker was the star of the attraction. A self-styled sometime lemon picker from California called the Reverend Connie Lynch whose oratorical harangue in part follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-13\">\u201cEveryone of us has sworn to defend the Constitution. That means you. That means myself. We swore to de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>fend it against its enemies, foreign and domestic. You know what every white person in America should have done when that Supreme Court refused to rule in favor of the Constitution ? [on school integration] They should have been impeached immediately. They should have been tried, convicted and hanged by \u2014 remember, the penalty for treason is death. * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-5\">* * =!=</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-6\">\u201cWhenever they make demands into our white society, when they say they\u2019re going to invade our white communities, we are told we can\u2019t do anything about it \u2014they have a right to come into your communities. But they\u2019re coming in there non-violently. Reminds me of someone coming to my house, knocking on my door, saying, \u2018Now look-a-here, I\u2019m coming into your house, but I\u2019m not coming in there violently; I\u2019m coming in with a non-violent manner.\u2019 Then when he says, \u2018Now-1 see your wife there, non-violently I want your wife. And I see you got a beautiful daughter over here \u2014 with no violence, but non-violently I want your \u25a0daughter.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-8\">\u201cWell, I\u2019ve got an answer to it tonight. I\u2019m willing now and I\u2019ll be willing tomorrow and I\u2019ll always be willing to fight. Yes, hell yes, any way it takes to fight to stop this invasion of our white communities. How do you white folks feel about it out there, huh ? \u201c(Applause.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">The rally lasted approximately an hour and one half.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">During the progress of .the rally the crowd expanded from about fifty at the beginning to about one hundred and fifty to two hundred persons at the conclusion and about twenty-five percent were Negroes, most of whom stood on the fringe of the -crowd. Captain Randall, prior to the beginning of the rally had \u2022called in about thirty-five state policemen and during the progress of the rally asked for, and received, about twenty-six ad\u25a0ditional men.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-11\">The Court has had the benefit of listening to the tape recording made at the rally, which was filed as an exhibit in the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>below. Toward the end, Mr. Norton shouted remarks in crescendo and in an hysterical, high-pitched cadence directed the following diatribe to the Negroes standing on the fringe of the crowd:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-5\">\u201cWell, we aren\u2019t going to scare any more, we aren\u2019t going to run any more \u2014 last summer, Adam Clayton Powell, the nigger congressman from Harlem, stood up and said, \u2018we got the white man on the run.\u2019 Well, personally this is one white man that\u2019s not going to run any more. We\u2019re gonna stop, we\u2019re gonna fight \u2014and I\u2019ll tell you one thing, maybe we\u2019ll have to sit down in the middle of the street, we\u2019ll bring this whole damn program within one year to a crashing halt. We\u2019re going to beat them, we\u2019re going to beat them, we\u2019re going to beat them. We\u2019re going to work together \u2014 they haven\u2019t got a chance. <em>I\u2019m going to tell you niggers out there now the best thing you can do is start taking reservations for Africa for you\u2019re finished. We don\u2019t need you. You\u2019re off, you\u2019re dead. Get ready to leave this country. Get ready to leave this country. You can leave a lot of ways </em>\u2014 you <em>can leave on boat, you can leave running, you can bicycle, or you can leave in a box. This is a white man\u2019s country. Princess Anne is a white man\u2019s town. This is a white man\u2019s county.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">The Court has reviewed the facts of this case in light of <em>Cox v. Louisiana, </em>379 U. S. 536 (1965); <em>Cooper v. Aaron, </em>358 U. S. 1 (1958); <em>Beauharnis v. Illinois, </em>243 U. S. 250 (1952); <em>Terminiello v. Chicago, </em>337 U. S. 1 (1949) <em>Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, </em>315 U. S. 568 (1942); <em>Cantwell v. Connecticut, </em>310 U. S. 296 (1940); <em>Schenck v. United States, </em>249 U. S. 47 (1919); and <em>Rockwell v. Morris, </em>211 N. Y. S. 2d 25 (App. Div. 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">We think the lower court acted in the face of a clear and present danger in issuing the temporary restraining order, dated August 7, 1966, enjoining the appellants from holding rallies, \u201cuntil the matter can be heard and determined in equity or for a period of ten days from the date hereof,\u201d and accordingly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>we affirm this action. We shall have more to say about the interlocutory injunction later in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">To elaborate at length on the cited authorities and their application to the case at bar, would be to write on a page of legal history already crowded. However, comment is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">This Court is well aware that \u201cFreedom of Speech,\u201d as guaranteed by the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States is the cornerstone around which the house of government is built and without which other personal freedoms would atrophy.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">However, as Justice Holmes pointed out in <em>Schenck, supra, </em>freedom of speech is not an absolute right, citing the example at p. 52 that: \u201cThe most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic.\u201d He gave us the \u201cclear and present danger\u201d doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">The speeches delivered by the appellants must not be judged as they abstractly read or sound in the sequestered atmosphere of judicial chambers, but with the realization that they were, in the nature of a harangue, delivered in the humidity of a torrid August night from the courthouse steps of a county seat whose people were not strangers to racial violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">Captain Randall, Corporal Chafifey of the State Police, and Mr. Dashiell, a commissioner of the Town of Princess Anne, all having witnessed previous racial disturbances in Princess Anne and Officer Tenney of the Baltimore County Police testified as to the heightened tension of the crowd as the rally concluded. Colonel Davidson, Chief of Operations of the State Police, testified that at the time of the hearing on the injunction, August 30, 1966, \u201ca very tense atmosphere\u201d still existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">The Court is aware that these witnesses were members of law enforcement agencies and one a town commissioner and that we cannot let our free institutions be circumscribed by the criterion of a police state, as was said by Justice Black in his dissent in <em>Feiner v. New York, </em>340 U. S. 315 (1951) (dissenting opinion at 340 U. S. 321). The Court also realizes that the State has the duty to provide safeguards for those who wish to publicly air their views. Nor, can the authorities rid themselves of an unpleasant task by the simple expediency of not letting mal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>contents or agitators meet. Yet, the testimony of these men, as to the temper of the community and the imminence of danger, cannot be discounted. They wore the mantle of authority and were charged with the onerous burden of preserving the peace. Theirs was the responsibility of providing protection, not only to those persons who might gather at a rally the following night or thereafter, and to the townspeople of Princess Anne, but to the speakers themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">The Maryland State Police have had much experience in recent months with \u201cbrinkmanship diplomacy,\u201d in handling racial meetings and calculating when the \u201cbrink\u201d of peaceable exhortation has been reached. There are countless individuals wdio stand by ready to castigate when the protectors of the public safety miscalculate.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">We must also look at the words of the speeches themselves, the common meaning of the words and the manner in which they were delivered. They do not represent an attempt on the part of those addressing the crowd at intellectual persuasion or an appeal to reason by championing a particular social, religious, racial or political philosophy. These were provocative gut speeches, interlaced with \u201cfighting words,\u201d delivered in an inflammatory manner aimed at the raw emotions of the listeners. As Justice Frankfurter said in <em>Drivers Union v. Meadowmoor Co., </em>312 U. S. 287, 293 (1941) : \u201cBut utterance in a context of violence can lose its signficance as an appeal to reason and become part of an instrument of force. Such utterance was not meant to be sheltered by the Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">The instant setting was far more volatile than that found in <em>Cantwell. </em>The passages are more inflammatory than those of <em>Feiner, Chaplinsky </em>or <em>Cox. </em>The \u201cfighting words\u201d more identifiable as such than in <em>Beauharnais </em>or <em>Chaplinsky.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">In the instant case the remarks and epithets hurled directly at the Negroes on the fringe of the crowd were nothing less than an invitation to mutual violence, for which the opportunity was being set up for the following night.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">Although the State has the duty to provide safeguards for those who wish to publicly air their views, we do not think this duty extends to providing a protected forum from which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>persons may taunt with \u201cfighting words\u201d those who otherwise would be law-abiding citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Nor was this a case of prior restraint, as in <em>Rockwell, supra. </em>The rally was actually staged, the speakers threw down the gauntlet by way of a challenge, particularly to the Negro segment of the community as to what might be expected the following night; at which rally they promised more of the same \u2014only more vituperative, more vicious.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">This is not a case where the speakers were restrained by direct police action. The restraint was not imposed upon the speakers until after the matter was given the disciplined review of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">We have stated that we are of the opinion that the court was correct in issuing its temporary order, dated August 7, 1966, restraining the defendants from holding rallies and meetings until the matter could be determined by a court of equity or for a period of ten days from the date of the issuance of the restraining order. Plowever, we think the court erred in making its interlocutory order for a period of ten months. It is apparent that the lower court meant for its injunction to be coextensive with the academic year of Maryland State College, which was due to commence within a few days after the issuance of the interlocutory decree of August 30, 1966, and which would normally end in June of 1967. However, we think that the period of time was unreasonable and that it was arbitrary to assume that a clear and present danger of civil disturbance and riot would persist for ten months.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">\n<em>Temporary order of August 7, 1966 affirmed, interlocutory order of August 30, 1966 reversed. Bach party to pay their respective costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
