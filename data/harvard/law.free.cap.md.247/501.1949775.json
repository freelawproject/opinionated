J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Aua\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">This Court by per curiam order held on June 14, 1967, that Ch. 142 of the Laws of 1967, sometimes referred to as the Agnew-Hughes-Lee bill (or the amended Cooper-Hughes bill) was invalid and ineffective as a Supplementary Appropriation Bill but was prima facie valid as other legislation. The grounds for holding Ch. 142 to be invalid and ineffective as an appropriation bill were stated in the order to be that the enactment violated :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-10\">\u201cthe requirement of Section 52 (8) of Article III of the Constitution of Maryland that every appropriation not made by the Budget Bill 'shall be embodied in a separate bill limited to some single work, object or purpose therein stated,\u2019 and * * * it does not make 'an appropriation by Law\u2019 as required by Section 32 of Article III of the said Constitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-11\">Chapter 142 increased the State income tax to an extent estimated by the Fiscal Research Bureau to produce for fiscal 1968 $120,264,100 over and above the amount to be produced by the existing income tax law for the same year and contemplated the appropriation of this sum for State aid for increased local po<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>lice protection, for schools and for unrestricted State grants to subdivisions of the State. Chapter 199 of the Laws of 1967, the Budget Bill, appropriated for some of these purposes $21,290,-373 of the expected increase, contingent upon the enactment of Ch. 142. The difference of $98,973,727 between the estimated additional revenues of $120,264,100 and the $21,290,373 appropriated by the Budget Bill was either effectively appropriated by Ch. 142, as the appellees, the Comptroller of the Treasury and the State Treasurer, claimed or was not appropriated at all, as the appellants claimed and this Court held.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">The situation in Maryland before the establishment of the executive budget system by amendment of the Constitution was well described by the late Hooper S. Miles, long Treasurer of Maryland, in his essay, <em>The Maryland Executive Budget System. </em>He said (pages 8 and 9) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-6\">\u201cIt was customary, under the former method, for the Governor to appear in person before a joint meeting of the members of the House of Delegates and the Senate, at the beginning of every regular session of the Legislature, and to address them on \u2018the condition of the State\u2019, \u2014 in the course of which he was expected to direct their attention to the essential needs of the State, and to specifically recommend to their consideration such measures as he judged necessary. Having thus discharged the responsibility imposed upon him by the Constitution, the Governor must thereafter await the final disposition of his recommendations by the Legislature, whose members were free to adopt, alter or entirely ignore any or all of them, except in so far as the Governor, by virtue of his prestige and his influence with the members of the Legislature, might affect the course of his recommendations through the Legislature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-7\">\u201cIt is true, the Governor then had the \u2018power to dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>approve of any item or items of Bills making appropriations of money\u2019 and to thus void the items which he disapproved. However, his use of this veto power on individual items had to be exercised with rare discrimination and with an intimate understanding of the temper of the Legislature, to avoid the danger of antagonizing powerful groups in the Legislature, and thereby jeopardize all of his recommended measures. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-5\">\u201cThe power to fix the fiscal policies and determine the course of the fiscal operations of the State was, therefore, exclusively vested in the Legislature, subject only to the mild restraint of the limited veto powers of the Governor, and whatever power of persuasion he might be capable of exercising with individual members of the Legislature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-6\">\u201cThe old method often witnessed \u2018log-rolling\u2019 or \u2018you help me and I\u2019ll help you\u2019 tactics among many of the members of the Legislature in their efforts to insure passage of the particular appropriations in which they had some selfish or political interest. It was not unusual for excessive appropriations to result from such tactics and also from the pressure of political and professional lobbyists; and, almost as frequently, some of the most important activities or needs of the State were either overlooked or sadly neglected in what was commonly termed, the \u2018Pork Barrel\u2019 scramble.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Emerson Harrington, who served as Governor from 1916 to 1920, in his monograph called \u201cThe First State Executive Budget,\u201d 8 <em>Proceedings of the Academy of Political Science </em>(1920), pp. 18-19, 25, wrote of the situation before the adoption of the budget amendment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-8\">\u201cThe Finance or Ways and Means Committee did not bring out the [general appropriations] bill until almost the last moment. Then the bill carrying all the expenditures for the state departments and the state government was finally passed in the last hours under a suspension of the rules, generally allowing each senator or delegate practically what he wanted for his own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>county or locality, regardless of the amount appropriated and leaving it to the executive to do the paring. In our state the executive, it is true, could cut down or veto the separate items of an appropriation bill, but I understand that in many states even this cannot be done. The members of the two committees appropriated this money upon no scientific or expert plan and had not before them any synopsis or summary either of the revenues or their contemplated expenditures. Largely it was a question of logrolling and of senatorial or delegate courtesy. In our state we had also a system of continuing or annual appropriations, which when marked annual would go on forever as appropriations without any further legislative action. Some of these appropriations of ours were of over 100 years\u2019 standing, and most of them were not known to exist by the average member of the legislature.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">To correct the fiscal dilemma of the State and to prevent its recurrence the Legislature proposed and the voters approved a constitutional amendment which now is embodied in the Constitution as \u00a7 52 of Art. III. The amendment had been prepared by a Commission appointed by the Democratic State Convention held in Baltimore in 1915. The Commission, designated \u201cThe Commission on Efficiency and Economy,\u201d was chaired by Dr. Frank J. Goodnow, president of Johns Hopkins University. Dr. Goodnow, a noted political scientist, had been a member of the national Commission on Efficiency and Economy appointed by President Taft, which in 1912 issued a report on the need for a national budget, which served as a stimulus for the reforms in Maryland. Members of the Maryland Commission, in addition to Dr. Goodnow, were Alfred Pearce, a former Judge of the Court of Appeals, Joseph D. Baker, B. Howell Griswold, Jr., Philip D. Laird, William Miles Maloy, and Neal Parke, later a Judge of this Court. This Commission declared that the purpose of its proposed amendment, \u00a7 52 (8), was to prevent the General Assembly from appropriating any money except by way of an appropriation bill which must be either a Budget Bill or a Supplementary Appropriation Bill as defined and limited by the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>Section 52 may be summarized generally as follows: The Governor must prepare and submit to the Legislature a budget containing a complete plan of estimated income and proposed expenditures for the ensuing fiscal year, including specified mandatory appropriations such as those for the General Assembly, the judiciary and the servicing of the State debt. The Legislature cannot increase any of the appropriation items set out in the budget (other than those for the judiciary and the General Assembly) but it can strike out or reduce items therein other than those for the State debt, the judiciary, the provisions made by law for the establishment and maintenance of the public schools, and the payment of salaries required to be paid by the Constitution. After the Budget Bill has finally been acted upon by both houses, additional appropriations may be made by a majority of the Legislature provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-5\">(a) \u201cEvery such appropriation shall be embodied in a separate bill limited to some single work, object or purpose \u00edj\u00ed \u00ed}c &gt;}\u00ed <em>99</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-7\">(b) Each such appropriation bill \u201cshall provide the revenue necessary to pay the appropriation thereby made [by] a tax, direct or indirect, to be levied and collected as shall be directed in said bill.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-8\">(c) Each such bill is, however, subject to the right of the Governor to veto it, in accordance with the provisions of Section 17 of Article 2 of the Constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">The purpose and aims of the Commission in recommending the executive budget plan and the requirements of controlled and restricted supplemental appropriations by the Legislature were explained in its report \u2014 printed in the <em>Journal of Proceedings of the Senate of Maryland </em>for the Legislative Session of 1916, pp. 129-134 \u2014 and in a series of articles by its members which were printed in The Baltimore Sun in the fall of 1916 and may be found in the pamphlet published in the winter of 1917, called <em>The Maryland Budget Amendment, </em>prepared by Dr. Horace Flack of the Department of Legislative Reference.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In summarizing the provisions for supplementary appropriation bills, Dr. Flack said (p. 53) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>\u201cIn order to meet the objection, however, that the Governor might misuse his power, either by starving objects which the Legislature deems worthy or by trade with individuals or localities, the Committee thought that the power of initiation of financial legislation should be left with the Legislature, subject to but two restrictions: first, such power not to be exercised until after the budget is finally disposed of by both branches of the Legislature; second, that such appropriations must be made by a separate bill for each single work or object. The Committee were of the opinion that this would adequately protect the budget system and yet keep it free from executive abuse.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">A mere reading of Ch. 142 in the light of the purpose and intent of \u00a7 52 of Art. Ill of the Maryland Constitution, explained by the report of the framers of that section (which was adopted in 1916 by the voters of Maryland), can leave no doubt that the 1967 enactment is a textbook example of a clear and conspicuous violation of the proscriptions and limitations of the 1916 amendment. This Court had no choice, no alternative, but to declare this obvious fact. Section 52 (8) spells out that no appropriation other than that effected by the Budget Bill shall be valid unless it is \u201cembodied in a <em>separate bill </em>limited to some single work, object or purpose <em>therein stated </em>and called herein a Supplementary Appropriation Bill\u201d which shall provide the revenue necessary to pay the appropriation thereby made [by] a tax, direct or indirect, to be levied and collected as shall be directed in said bill.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Chapter 142 does not state \u201ctherein\u201d any limited \u201csingle work, object or purpose.\u201d It is an omnibus bill. In \u00a7 1 it establishes a \u201cState Aid for Police Protection Fund\u201d to be paid from the general funds of the State to provide more adequate police protection in the political subdivisions. The amounts given the towns and counties varied markedly. For example, Baltimore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>City was given for one year a special grant of $5,000,000 over and above its share under the formula generally used, or more than 60% of the total funds granted for that year, although the City has only some 40% of the population of the State. Queen Anne\u2019s County has some 20,000 citizens, or about 2% of the population of Baltimore City. Its grant for police protection was to be less than one-tenth of 1% of the allocation to Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Chapter 142 also changed the laws relating to public education, especially as to teachers\u2019 salaries and pensions and the source and distribution of funds. It also created a school building construction aid program in which the State contributes up to eighty per cent of the cost. Under the formula of the bill Baltimore City was to receive about 12% of the total State allocation and Queen Anne\u2019s County 2%. Calvert County, with a population less than that of Queen Anne\u2019s, was to receive about two times the distribution for Queen Anne\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Chapter 142 also made general unrestricted grants to political subdivisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">Clearly, Ch. 142 combines in one bill at least three separate works, objects or purposes and the variances in the grants suggest that typical opportunities for \u201clogrolling\u201d and \u201cback scratching\u201d were present and significant in its passage.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">The Attorney General\u2019s answer is to say that the single object and purpose of Ch. 142 is \u201cfinancial aid to subdivisions.\u201d First, no attempt was made to state such a single purpose, either in the title or the body of House Bill 378 which became Ch. 142. Second, if \u201cfinancial aid to subdivisions\u201d could be held to be a single purpose, the proscriptions, restrictions and limitations of \u00a7 52 (8) on the matter would become meaningless and empty, especially in light of the evils that section was designed to prevent.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">The \u201csingle purpose\u201d requirements were written into a number of State Constitutions after Maryland adopted them in 1916. The courts in several of these States have taken the same view of the meaning of these requirements that we do. In <em>State, ex rel. Jensen v. Kelly </em>(S. D.), 274 N. W. 319, a bill made appropriations for the State Liquor Control Commission and the State Department of Justice and Public Safety, both of which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>were agencies charged with the enforcement of the Liquor Control Act in which were embodied the challenged appropriations.. The Court said (p. 323 of 274 N. W.) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-5\">\u201cTo uphold a special appropriation bill providing funds for separate and distinct departments, institutions, or agencies of the state government is to permit the objectionable practice at which the constitutional provision under consideration is directed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">See also <em>Cottrell v. Faubus </em>(Ark.), 347 S. W. 2d 52; <em>In re House Bill 168 </em>(Colo.), 39 Pac. 1096; <em>McCombs v. Dallas County </em>(Tex. Civ. App.), 136 S. W. 2d 975.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">The Attorney General argued to us that a Supplemental Appropriation Bill is not covered by the provisions of \u00a7 29 of Art. Ill of the Constitution that every law shall embrace but one subject which must be described in its title to prevent the combination in one act of several and distinct incongruous subjects and to require that those interested be fairly appraised of the real nature of the pending legislation. Alternatively, he went on to-argue that in any event the title of House Bill 378 met the tests of \u00a7 29 of Art. III. The suggested result of his arguments was that if Ch. 142 met the tests of \u00a7 29 it met the tests of \u00a7 52\u2019 (8) (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">We shall assume without deciding that \u00a7 29 of Art. Ill applies to Supplemental Appropriations Bills, since we agree with the Attorney General that if it does House Bill 378 embraced, but one subject, as that phrase has been construed and interpreted by this Court, which is adequately described in its title. The meaning of the words \u201cone subject\u201d as used in \u00a7 29 is much broader, we think, than the meaning of the words \u201csome single work, object or purpose\u201d as used in \u00a7 52 (8) (a). As long ago as 1879, our predecessors said in <em>Baltimore v. Reitz, </em>50 Md. 574, 579, that \u201cif several sections of the law refer to and are germane to the same subject-matter, which is described\u2019 in its title, it is considered as embracing but a single subject, and as satisfying the requirements of the Constitution in this respect.\u201d This construction has been reiterated and reaffirmed many' times. See Everstine, \u201cTitles of Legislative Acts,\u201d 9 Md. L. Rev. 196, 205; <em>Allied American Co. v. Commissioner of Motor </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number><em>Vehicles, </em>219 Md. 607, 614; <em>Beshore v. Town of Bel Air, </em>237 Md. 398, 412.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">We find no incongruity in giving the \u201csingle object\u201d requisites of \u00a752 (8) (a) a much more restricted meaning than the \u201cone subject\u201d requirement of \u00a7 29. The construction and effect of \u00a7 29 which we have just discussed had long been established when the framers proposed and the voters ratified the single object doctrine of \u00a7 52 (8). If it had been intended that \u00a7 52 (8) was to mean what \u00a7 29 had been held and was generally understood to mean, certainly the same words of \u00a7 29 that already had been construed would have been repeated in \u00a7 52. They were not, and other words were substituted to insure, we believe in light of the evil to be corrected and the result sought, that \u00a7 52 (8) would be given a much narrower and more restricted meaning than had been given \u00a7 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">In similar situations Courts have found that the word \u201cobject\u201d was to be equated with the word \u201cpurpose\u201d and was to be given a more restricted meaning than the word \u201csubject.\u201d See <em>State, ex rel. Jensen v. Kelly, supra </em>at p. 323 of 274 N. W.; <em>Fahey v. State </em>(Tex.), 11 S. W. 108; <em>People v. Lawrence </em>(N. Y.), 36 Barber 192; <em>cf. In re House Bill 168, supra </em>at p. 1098 of 39 Pac.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">We conclude that the single subject described in the title of House Bill 378 (Ch. 142) as \u201cincreased financial aid by the State to local subdivisions\u201d would gratify \u00a7 29 although it would affront \u00a7 52 (8) (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">Finally, the Attorney General suggests that if Ch. 142 is held to violate the single object or purpose restrictions of \u00a7 52 (8) (a), the many appropriation bills since 1916 that have authorized the creation of a debt of the State for the purpose of raising funds to pay for the construction or improvement of a number of disparate buildings or projects of the State of different kinds and at different locations might be made suspect. It is suggested that <em>McKeldin v. Steedman, </em>203 Md. 89, to which we referred earlier, approved Ch. 780 of the Laws of 1953, a bond bill which \u201ccould not endure under a strict construction of the most restrictive of the words in the phrase \u2018limited to some single work, object or purpose\u2019 as used in \u00a7 52 (8).\u201d The <em>Steed-man </em>case, agreeing with the parties that a bond bill is a Sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>plementary Appropriation. Bill, held only that one section of Ch. 780, directing the use of general funds as the primary source of payment of interest and principal of the bonds to be issued, violated the requirement of \u00a7 52 (8) (b) that \u201ceach Supplementary Appropriation Bill shall provide the revenue necessary to pay the appropriation thereby made [by] a tax, direct or indirect, to be levied or collected as shall be directed in said bill.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">The meaning and effect of the restriction of \u00a7 52 (8) (a) of \u201ca separate bill limited to some single work, object or purpose therein stated\u201d was not brought into question in relation to Ch. 780 by the pleadings, was not argued in the briefs, and was not discussed or decided by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">We think the creation of a State debt in a specified amount in the manner prescribed in \u00a7 34 of Art. Ill by a Supplemental Appropriation Bill gratifies the dictates of \u00a7 52 (8) (a) even though the cash which is to result is directed to be used for multiple purposes. In 1916, as now, \u00a7 34 provided that \u201cNo debt shall be hereafter contracted by the General Assembly unless such debt shall be authorized by a law providing for the collection of an annual tax or taxes sufficient to pay the interest on such debt as it falls due, and also to discharge the principal thereof within fifteen years from the time of contracting the same * * The word \u201cdebt\u201d is often used in the singular as \u201ca debt.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary defines \u201cdebt\u201d as often applying \u201cto a single definite amount of money owed.\u201d In the part of \u00a7 34 quoted above \u201cdebt\u201d appears to have been thought of in this sense. The \u201csingle definite amount of money\u201d to be raised and owed by the State is to be authorized by \u201ca\u201d law. In 1916 \u00a7 34, as far as State debt was concerned, was in effect a preexisting version of the later \u00a7 52 (8) (a)\u2018</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">Support for this reading of \u00a7 34 is offered by various provisions of \u00a7 52. The Goodnow commission which drafted the Budget Amendment did not in its report complain of the evils of debt creation \u2014 except as to the previous undue resort to it \u2022 \u2014 or of bond bills. The report <em>(The Maryland Budget Amendment, supra, </em>p. 13) said: \u201cOut of abundant caution and in order to carry out the purposes of the platform to protect the \u2018State\u2019s outstanding obligations,\u2019 we have left it in the power <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>of the Legislature to pass at any time and in the usual manner <em>an Appropriation Bill </em>for the payment of all the State\u2019s obligations protected by the provision of the Constitution of the United States * * (Emphasis added.) Paragraph 9 of \u00a7 52 is the provision referred to by the commission. Paragraph 14 of \u00a7 52 directs that in the event of inconsistency \u00a7 52 shall prevail over other parts of the Constitution but goes on to say: \u201cBut nothing herein shall in any manner affect the provisions of \u00a7 34 of Article 3 of the Constitution or of any laws * * * passed in pursuance thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">We think \u00a7 52 recognized that \u00a7 34 contemplated that a bill which created a debt of the State and provided for the payment of the interest and principal as specified was a separate appropriation bill, a single package, which, in the later words of \u00a7 52 (8) (a), stated therein the \u201csingle work, object or purpose\u201d \u2014the obtention of funds for State purposes from lenders \u2014 to which it was limited. Section 52 not only recognized this construction, it perpetuated it.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\"><em>Steedman, </em>as has been noted, while recognizing that a bond bill is a Supplementary Appropriation Bill, did not decide or consider whether the appropriation bill under attack in the case met the single purpose requirements of \u00a7 52. Counsel for the appellees were the lawyers, able and experienced, who had been employed to approve the bonds to be issued under the bill before the court. The Attorney General represented the State officials charged with duty of issuing the bonds. The opinion was written in 1953 by Chief Judge Sobeloff who had been chairman of the Commission on Administrative Organization of the State which in its 1952 report dealt exhaustively with the Budget Amendment and the practice under it, as indeed did the opinion. Judge Henderson, who for many years had been Deputy Attorney General, and Judge Hammond, who twice had served as Attorney General, concurred in the opinion. The silence of bond counsel, the Attorney General and the members of the Court on the matter of single purpose \u2014 Ch. 780 authorized a State debt of $15,040,950 to be disbursed for building or improving penal institutions, State parks, mental institutions, training schools, and educational institutions \u2014 can only be considered to have meant a general understanding and acceptance that \u00a7 52 (8) (a) had not been affronted by Ch. 780.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>Significant is the fact that the bond bills enacted just before the Budget Amendment took effect were substantially the same in form and content as those enacted soon after. Chapter 791 of the Laws of 1914 created a \u201cState Omnibus Loan\u201d in the amount of $950,000 to complete the Maryland State Normal School, various armories, four State hospitals and Rosewood Training School. Chapter 681 of the Laws of 1916, signed by Governor Harrington under whose aegis the Budget Amendment was proposed and adopted, authorized a debt of $3,000,000, of which $2,700,000 was to pay for completion and maintenance of State roads ($540,000 in Baltimore City and $2,160,000' in the counties) and the balance for a building at College Park and three armories. Chapter 3 of the Extraordinary Session of 1917 created a State debt of $1,000,000', the proceeds of which were to go to the Maryland Council of Defense, the National Guard, to aid the political subdivisions in providing voting by mail, to acquire State farms at various institutions, assist the unemployed, construct a fish hatchery and stimulate the production of food and dairy products. Chapter 298 of the Laws of 1918, signed by Governor Harrington \u2014 Albert C. Ritchie was Attorney General \u2014 authorized a State debt of $1,000,000 to redeem and pay the certificates of indebtedness issued under Ch. 3 of the Laws of 1917. Chapter 727 of the Laws of 1920 created a State debt of $1,500,000 for a heating plant at Spring Grove Plospital, a barn at Springfield Hospital, a sewage plant at Crownsville Hospital, construction of a tuberculosis sanitarium, improvements at various State schools, construction of a War Memorial, a State Tobacco Warehouse and a bridge over the Severn River. The bonds were issued in 1921 when Albert C. Ritchie had passed from Attorney General to Governor. Attorney General Armstrong advised the State Treasurer on February 11, 1921, that \u201cThe said Act of Assembly [Ch. 727] is valid and constitutional.\u201d (Unreported opinion of the Attorney-General)</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">We are firmly of the view that the framers of the Budget Amendment regarded the creation of a State debt by a Supplementary Appropriation Bill which conformed to the provisions of \u00a7 34 of Art. Ill of the Constitution as in conformity with the requirements of \u00a7 52 (8) (a) of Art. Ill and that if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>the framers had chosen to illumine their report and recommendation with a classic example of the evils to be cured by the single purpose prescription they might well have thought of and used as such an example the conglomerate that is Ch. 142 of the Laws of 1967 \u2014 with much smaller numbers of course.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Since Ch. 142 was not a valid Supplementary Appropriation Bill, no money could be validly drawn from the Treasury of the State by virtue of it under \u00a7 32 of Art. Ill of the Constitution, and we do not reach the question of whether if it had \u2022otherwise been valid as a Supplementary Appropriation Bill its language could have been read to have made an appropriation or appropriations.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">In holding on June 14 last that Ch. 142 was prima facie valid \u2022as legislation we gave recognition to the general presumption in favor of the validity of a statute. The claim of the appellants -was only that Ch. 142 was invalid and ineffective as a Supple-mentary Appropriation Bill and this opinion deals only with that claim and does not decide any other possible challenges to -Ch. 142 since none was raised or decided below or briefed or argued in this Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b523-8\">. Chapter 1 of the Special Session of 1967 appropriated the $98,973,737 unappropriated by Ch. 143 of the L,aws of 1967 so as to permit the effectuation of the several works, objects and purposes of said Ch. 143 as therein set forth and specified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b527-7\">. Much of the history and of the purpose and effect of the Budget Amendment is also set forth in <em>McKeldin v. Steedman, </em>203 Md. 89, 96-101.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
