In the present case it was held that the operation of the estoppel was not affected by certain representations made by the holder of the certificate as to his right to use the stock, or by the fact that the guaranty of the signature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>of the owner of the certificate by the stock exchange house on the power of transfer was procured without the knowledge of the owner after its delivery to the holder.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b456-5\">In a suit in equity to enforce an alleged equitable pledge of certain shares of a corporation in the possession of a trust company subject to a prior pledge to the trust company, it appeared that the shares were transferable only on the books of the corporation on surrender of the certificate, that the. owner of the shares, in whose name they stood, entrusted the certificate together with an instrument of transfer and power of attorney signed by him in. blank to a stockbroker, then known as of good reputation, that the stockbroker dishonestly pledged the shares for his own benefit to the trust company, which took them in good faith under a custom by which such a certificate with an instrument of transfer executed and witnessed as this one was \u201cwhen in the possession of a person who is known and is of good reputation,\u201d is treated \u201cwhen offered for sale, pledge or transfer ... as capable of good transfer and delivery by such holder for such sale or pledge,\" and that thereby the owner of the shares was estopped to deny the validity of the pledge to the trust company. Later the stockbroker, in consideration of the promise of the plaintiff not to sue him at that time for money which he owed the plaintiff, executed an assignment in writing to the plaintiff of all his \u201cright, title and interest\u201d in the shares of stock pledged by him to the trust company, subject to the rights of that company as pledgee. Before accepting this assignment, the plaintiff went to the trust company and inspected the certificate of stock and the instrument of transfer and gave notice to the trust company of the assignment. <em>Held, </em>that there was no pledge to the plaintiff because there was no delivery, and that the owner of the shares was not estopped to assert his title as against the plaintiff, because the custom had no application when the person to whom the owner had delivered the certificate and the instrument of transfer no longer was in possession of them, and because the instrument of transfer from the owner to the stockbroker did not transfer the title to the shares but only a right to acquire such title by surrendering the old certificate to the corporation and obtaining a new one.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b456-6\">In a suit in equity by the owner of certain shares of stock held by the defendant under a pledge from a dishonest stockbroker which the plaintiff under a custom is estopped to deny, if it appears that the broker who pledged the plaintiff\u2019s shares to the defendant also pledged to the defendant to secure the same indebtedness other shares of stock to which the broker had the title, the shares to which the broker had title first should be resorted to in satisfying the defendant\u2019s claim before applying the shares to which the plaintiff has the title subject to the pledge.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-7\">Two bills in equity, filed in the Superior Court on November 18 and 21, 1910, the first by the members of the firm of Baker, Ayling and Company against Robert E.

Exceptions to the master\u2019s report were overruled by <em>Hitchcock, </em>J. The questions in both suits arose from the frauds and dishonesty of the first named defendant, who at the time of the transactions involved in the suits was about twenty-four or twenty-five years of age and was doing business as a stockbroker in Boston, and who after these transactions absconded.

Instead of so doing he pledged it to the Federal Trust Company as collateral to secure $10,000, and also as collateral for all his indebtedness to that company, then amounting to about $41,330, in addition to this new loan of $10,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-7\">\u201cHarriman learned of the fact of the misuse of the stock soon after such misuse and learned it from Davie, and when so informed, though protesting against such use of the stock, so far acquiesced in the transaction that he did not give any notice of it to the Federal Trust Company but permitted the state of facts to continue, seeking in other ways than by reclaiming the stock to indemnify himself. It is still in the possession of the Federal Trust Company held to secure the same obligations for which it holds the American News Company stock as collateral.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-8\">On May 3, 1910, Davie made to Baker, Ayling and Company the assignment which is described in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b458-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>On June 11, 1910, Davie gave an assignment to the defendants Harriman and Chace of his right, title and interest in the stocks h\u00e9ld as collateral by the Federal Trust Company.

Also subject to a lien of Baker, Ayling &amp; Co. . . . amounting to $12,500 now on file with the Federal Trust Company.\u2019 Mr. Wheeler made no inquiries'of the Federal Trust Company or of Baker, Ayling &amp; Company, and no examination of the certificate and powers of attorney in question, never having seen them until August 20, 1910, subsequently to all his dealings with Davie except one \u2014 when he advanced for him at his request one hundred shares of La Salle stock worth $1,000.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_p\">These suits involve the rights of various persons in certain shares of stock. The occasion for litigation arises from the perfidy of Robert E. Davie. William H. Jackson was the owner of eleven hundred and seventy shares of the American News Company, for which he held a single certificate in ordinary form, stating among other things that it was \u201ctransferable only on the books of the company, by him or his attorney, on surrender of this certificate.\u201d He was induced by fraudulent representations of Davie, of such nature that as between the two no title or right to use for his own benefit passed to Davie, to hand to the latter this certificate, together with two instruments, each signed in blank by himself. These are called \u201cpowers of attorney and transfer\u201d and although printed as a single document, they consist of two parts, the first being a bargain, sale and transfer of the stock and the second being an irrevocable power of attorney to sell and make over all or any part of the stock and to do all things necessary to accomplish that purpose. The one of these now material was a transfer of ten hundred and seventy of the eleven hundred and seventy shares of stock represented by the certificate.. The name of the transferee and attorney was left blank.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Davie signed as witness to Jackson\u2019s signature and, after having the signature guaranteed by a firm of stockbrokers, used the certificate and instrument of transfer as collateral, on which he borrowed large sums of money from the Federal Trust Company. The physical possession of the certificate and instrument has continued in the trust company at all times. Davie, during these transactions, was a stockbroker of good reputation in Boston and well known to all the parties to these suits.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">The master found that \u201cwhere a certificate of stock is in the possession of a person who is known and is of good reputation . . . and . . . where the one holding such certificate is. in possession of a separate instrument of power and transfer signed by the person named in the certificate as owner, applicable to such stock with blank spaces left for the apparent purpose of adapting the paper to the transfer of stock when filled appropriately \u2014 it is the custom in Massachusetts \u2014 at least if the signature is guaranteed by a stock exchange house and is witnessed, when offered for pledge, sale or transfer, to treat them as capable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>of good transfer and delivery by such holder for such sale or pledge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-3\">1. It is plain that upon these findings the Federal Trust Company became entitled to all the rights of a pledgee of the ten hundred and seventy shares of stock, no matter how faithless Davie had been to his agreement with the owner, by which he secured possession of the stock and the instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">The case falls within <em>Scollans </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>179 Mass. 346, and <em>Russell </em>v. <em>American Bell Telephone Co. </em>180 Mass. 467. The principle of law established by these cases is that if the owner of stock knowingly places in the hand of another the certificate therefor, either indorsed in blank or by a separate instrument of transfer and power of attorney, the person to whom the certificate and instrument are delivered can pass a good title by delivery or pledge regardless of the relations between him and the owner. This is not on the ground that the certificate becomes a negotiable instrument, but on the ground of estoppel, because the owner, having given another such indicia of title as clothes him with the appearance of ownership, is precluded from setting up title in himself as against a holder in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Jackson seeks to distinguish the present case in that the language used by Davie at the time of procuring the loan from the Federal Trust Company was sufficient to put the latter on inquiry and to indicate that his title was less than might have been assumed if nothing had been said. The circumstance on which he relies is that Davie stated to the Federal Trust Company at the time of obtaining from it the first and subsequent loans \u201cthat stock was practically his.\u201d \u201cThis stock is all right.\u201d \u201cThis was given to him all right, given to him to use in the market.\u201d \u201cIt was given to him to use,\u201d \u201cHe had the right to use that stock.\u201d The master specifically finds that the trust company acted in good faith. This language does not show any limitation upon what appeared to be the rights of Davie under the instrument signed by Jackson in the light of the custom proved. There is nothing in it to suggest that he did not actually possess, with reference to the certificate, the rights which he undertook to exercise. It cannot be said fairly to derogate from the power to transfer the absolute title which, by the words of the instrument in connection with the custom, he appeared to have.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>It is further argued in behalf of Jackson that the custom proved in the case at bar is essentially different from that found in <em>Scollans </em>v. <em>Rollins </em>and <em>Russell </em>v. <em>American Bell Telephone Co., </em>in that it prevails with certainty only \u201cif the signature is guaranteed by a stock exchange house\u201d and that as the guaranty of his signature by the stock exchange house was procured by Davie without the knowledge of Jackson and after the delivery of the instrument to him, Jackson is not prevented, under the somewhat strict rules of estoppel, from setting up title in himself. Entrusting the certificate to Davie in blank was, so far as innocent third persons are concerned, an authorization so to fill the instrument as to make it effective to accomplish its apparent purpose. The guaranty of signature must necessarily be made after the signing and is something with which the owner has no apparent connection. It appears to be chiefly a safeguard against forgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">2. After the certificate had been in the possession of the Federal Trust Company for about four months, Davie became indebted to the firm of Baker, Ayling and Company in large sums, on account of which they threatened action against him. In return for their promise not to bring action at the time, he executed an assignment to Baker, Ayling and Company of \u201cAll my right, title and interest in and to all securities now or hereafter pledged by me with the Federal Trust Company . . . and now consisting of ten hundred seventy (1070) shares of the capital stock of the American News Company and two hundred (200) shares of the preferred stock of the Connecticut River Power Company of Maine, subject, however, to all the rights of the Federal Trust Company to hold the same as collateral.\u201d Before accepting this assignment, Baker, Ayling and Company went to the Federal Trust Company and inspected this certificate of stock and instrument signed by Jackson. They thereupon gave notice to the Federal Trust Company of the assignment to them by Davie.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">A certificate of stock indorsed in blank is not negotiable. It is not governed by the law as to negotiable instruments. It is the evidence of ownership of personal property. Title to the shares of the American News Company, under the form of certificate here disclosed, could be actually transferred only upon the books of the company upon surrender of the certificate. There was, therefore, at common law no completed transfer of title by Jack<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>son, even though he signed the instrument. Apart from controlling custom, this is the common law of this Commonwealth and of England. <em>Scollans </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>173 Mass. 275, 278, 279. <em>France </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>26 Ch. D. 257. <em>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Paris </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>11 App.. Cas. 20. <em>Earl of Sheffield </em>v. <em>London Joint Stock Bank, </em>13 App. Cas. 333, 343. <em>Colonial Bank </em>v. <em>Cady, </em>15 App. Cas. 267, 273, 277, 278, 285. See <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>64 L. J. (N. S.) Ch. 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">That position is the starting point. Baker, Ayling and Company show no right to the shares unless they get beyond this point. But there is a controlling custom found to exist in the case at bar. They rely upon that as giving them rights. That custom is that a certificate in the condition in which this one was \u201cwhen in the possession of a person who is known and is of good reputation,\u201d is treated \u201cwhen offered for sale, pledge or transfer ... as capable of good transfer and delivery by such holder for such sale or pledge.\u201d The arrangement between Davie and Baker, Ayling and Company was not a pledge. It is elementary that physical possession is essential to the existence of a pledge. The physical possession of this certificate has remained at all times in the Federal Trust Company. The transaction between Davie and Baker, Ayling and Company was in writing. It purported to be a transfer directly from him to them, subject to the rights of the trust company, of his rights in the stock. It was not at this time in the \u201cpossession\u201d of Davie, but of the trust company. The custom governs, however, only when the certificate is in the \u201cpossession\u201d of the person undertaking to pass title. Moreover, the further terms of the custom are that when offered for sale or transfer it is \u201ccapable of good transfer and delivery.\u201d While transfer may be in some connections a word of broad significance, it means accurately a passing over of a thing, which implies something more than a constructive act. Delivery also means com- ' manly an actual change of physical custody. That \u201ctransfer and delivery\u201d as used in the phrase expressing the custom are to be construed as referring to manual change in the holding of the certificate is confirmed by the words immediately following, namely, \u201cby such holder.\u201d The only \u201cholder\u201d before mentioned is the person in \u201cpossession\u201dof the certificate. The custom establishes the law on a basis somewhat different from that, which would otherwise govern the rights of the parties. Hence, it is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>be interpreted and applied, not as a loose rhetorical expression, but as a rule of law. So interpreted, it means that title to the stock passes when the certificate and instrument of transfer actually pass from one hand to another. It does not cover the case where the one to whom it was originally delivered by the owner, no longer in possession of it by reason of having parted with it in pledge to a third person for less than its full value, undertakes to deal with the value in excess of the pledge by a symbolical transfer to still another person. This is the reasonable interpretation of the custom as applied to the circumstances here disclosed. It appears to be in harmony with the policy of the Commonwealth as now established by the Uniform Stock Transfer Act, St. 1910, c. 171, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 5, 18, 22, which, however, is not applicable to this transaction. This conclusion is fortified slightly by the form of the instrument given by Davie to Baker, Ayling and Company, which was not in terms a transfer of the entire value of the stock above the pledge to the trust company, but was only of his \"right, title and interest.\u201d These words have acquired in deeds a certain and definite meaning. They convey whatever title the grantor has, be it much or little, and that alone. As words of grant they are limited to the estate and interest of the grantor. They do not impart ownership in fee or any other particular extent of proprietorship. <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Holton, </em>20 Pick. 458, 464. <em>Sweet </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>12 Met. 175. <em>Hubbard </em>v. <em>Apthorp, </em>3 Cush. 419. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>15 Gray, 189. <em>Hoxie </em>v. <em>Finney, </em>16 Gray, 332. <em>Barnstable Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>122 Mass. 172. <em>Spreckels </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>212 U. S. 208, 211. The same rule has been held to apply to sales of personal property. <em>First National Bank </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Loan &amp; Trust Co. </em>123 Mass. 330.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">It is urged, in behalf of Baker, Ayling and Company, that Jackson ought to be as much estopped to assert his title against them as against the trust company. There are two difficulties with this contention. The first is that they rely and must rely upon the custom, and not upon the terms of the instrument of transfer. That appears plainly from the two reports of <em>Scollans </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>173 Mass. 275, and 179 Mass. 346. If they do not come within the terms of the custom, they must fail. The second is that the transfer signed by Jackson, which they examined in-the hands of the Federal Trust Company before agreeing to suspend their ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>tian at law and to take this assignment from Davie, was not in truth a transfer of title from Jackson. It merely transferred a right which enabled Davie to acquire a legal title by surrendering the old certificate to the company and getting a new one. Jackson still continued to be the only shareholder recognized by the company. This was pointed out clearly by Lord Watson, in <em>Colonial Bank </em>v. <em>Cady, </em>15 App. Cas. 267, at 277, 278. The indorsement of a certificate of stock or an instrument of transfer, where title to the stock is transferable only on the books of the company, of itself is an equivocal act. It may mean, apart from custom, something less than or quite different from a transfer of title. 173 Mass. 279. For this reason <em>Stiff </em>v. <em>Ashton, </em>155 Mass. 130, has no application. Unless there is a delivery of possession of the certificate, the usual rule applies, that possession of personal property by a third person is not evidence of title, and the owner is not estopped from asserting his rights. This does not impinge upon the rule that when an owner has so acted as to mislead a third person into the honest belief that the one dealing with the property had a right to do so, he is estopped from showing the truth, because here the extent to which the innocent third person could have been misled depends wholly upon the custom. <em>Jarvis </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>13 Mass. 105; <em>S. C. </em>15 Mass. 389, is distinguishable from the case at bar, for there the certificates were transferable merely by indorsement under a rule of the company. <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Beacon Trust Co. </em>190 Mass. 27, is distinguishable on the ground that a negotiable security was there in litigation. The rule established by custom as to certificates of stock is an exception to the general rule. It does not apply to other brokers or persons invested with possession. <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Dutton, </em>182 Mass. 187, 189. <em>Cooke &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Eshelby, </em>12 App. Cas. 271,277. <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>6 Wall. 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">The argument does not seem to be sound, that it must follow from this position that stock pledged as security in a collateral trust mortgage cannot be held on request of a bondholder. The trustee or mortgagee who holds the stock under s.uch circumstances would stand as the Federal Trust Company does here, and would be responsible to all beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">The suggestion that the Federal Trust Company may be treated as the agent of Baker, Ayling and Company does not appear tenable upon the facts of these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>3. The grounds upon which this judgment rests as to Baker, Ayling and Company dispose adversely of the claims of the other defendants without adverting to distinctions between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">4. The marshalling of assets provided for in the decree was correct in principle. Davie wrongfully used two hundred shares of Connecticut River Power Company stock procured by him from Harriman as security for his loans from the Federal Trust Company, but Harriman assented to this use after knowledge, and does not now claim any priority to this stock on that account. The stock of the American News Company is more than sufficient to satisfy the claims of the trust company. In behalf of Baker, Ayling and Company, who hold the first assignment from Davie, it may be urged that this stock should first be resorted to by the trust company on the \u201cequitable rule . . . that a person having a right to satisfy his debt or claim out of two funds, to but one of which another person can resort, shall be compelled first to exhaust the fund to which the other cannot resort before coming upon the one available to both.\" <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Tanners Leather Co. </em>196 Mass. 163,166. This rule, however, does not apply where the two funds are not derived from a common source or do not belong to a common debtor. The American News Company stock and the Connecticut River Power Company stock do not belong to a common debtor, for the former is the property of Jackson, the right of the trust company to resort to it arising only by estoppel under the custom, while the latter belonged to Davie. Davie being primarily liable, stock to which he had title should first be resorted to. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Savin, </em>141 N. Y. 315.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">The result is that exceptions seventh and eighth of Jackson to the master\u2019s report should be sustained, and otherwise the master\u2019s report should be confirmed, and all other exceptions to it be overruled, and that paragraphs 2, 6, 7, 10 and 11 of the decree of the Superior Court are correct; paragraph 3 is correct, except the concluding portion which orders payment to Baker, Ayling and Company; and the remaining paragraphs are wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">Decree reversed and details of new decree in accordance with this opinion to be fixed in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
