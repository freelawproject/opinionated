He found for the plaintiff in the sum of $932.60; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b141-17\"><em>C. R.

The matter is too plain for discussion. The practice no doubt is to send matters of account to a master, but it was optional with the judge to settle the account himself or send it to a master as he saw fit. The defendant admitted that the taking of the account at that time would not operate as a surprise to him. He is not shown to have been prejudiced in any way by the course that was pursued.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
