The allegations, which, it was assumed in favor of the plaintiff were contained in the declaration, are stated in the opinion., The case was heard upon the demurrer by <em>Pierce, </em>J., who sustained the demurrer and ordered judgment for the defendant. From the judgment entered in pursuance of this order the plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b395-11\"><em>E. M.

The declaration nowhere avers that the plaintiff would have sold her lodging house for that sum, or that the defendant had agreed to buy it at that price, or indeed at any price. The mere desire of the defendant, standing alone, unconnected with any agreement to purchase and going no further than a desire is an immaterial circumstance, and the plaintiff in relying upon it can gain no cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-3\">\n<em>Demurrer sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
