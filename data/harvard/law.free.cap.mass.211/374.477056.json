It was admitted that the plaintiff was in the exercise of due care, and attempted to board the car as a passenger at a point where the car stopped for that purpose. The Court Street station is the Boston terminal of the East Boston tunnel. At this point there is a single track, and the cars come to a stop at what is known as a \u201cdead end.\u201d In each car there are four doors, two on either side, front and rear, and the doors all are opened at the Court Street station for the purpose of allowing incoming passengers to alight and returning passengers to enter the car. At the time passengers are alighting and other passengers are entering, the conductor and -motorman are engaged in reversing their positions, and the doors of the car then are closed preparatory to the return trip over the same track. The two doors on either side for the reception and exit of passengers slide directly back into the side of the car and are operated by compressed air, through the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>tr\u00f3l of small levers on either side of the motorman\u2019s post at each end of the car. There are four of these levers at each end of the car, two on each side for the front and rear doors respectively, the car being made to run with either end as the front.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b401-5\">The evidence in regard to the happening of the accident is stated and described in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b401-6\">At the close of the evidence the judge ordered a verdict for the defendant, and at the request of the plaintiff reported the case for determination by this court.

At the time of the accident the plaintiff was entering the car by the right hand door which was at the forward end of the car. The door is forty-six inches in width and the aperture is divided in the middle by a perpendicular rod. The door in closing passes outside this rod, leaving a space of about three inches. \u201cThe rod is apparently designed as a handhold to steady passengers when entering or alighting from the car, and to separate outgoing and incoming passengers.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s evidence, which is not contradicted, was that the car was pretty well filled, she being the last passenger to enter at this door, all the seats being occupied, \u201cand there were a few people standing in the aisle.\u201d She was passing to the left of the rod previously mentioned when suddenly, without warning, the door started to close and struck her, pinning her body against this rod. The door starts to close slowly and increases its speed as it acquires momentum. Her head, one shoulder, part of her body and one leg were on the inside, the other shoulder, leg and part of her body being held outside the door. She struggled to free herself and was assisted by passengers to a seat, and did not then, or at any other time, see the conductor, and had no communication with any employee of the defendant. She saw the motorman enclosed within his cab, his back being turned toward her.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">There was testimony to the effect that it is possible for a passenger to operate the door by the levers in the rear.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>The car was standing for the reception of passengers, and in attempting to enter the car at the place and at that time the plaintiff had so far entered the car that the defendant owed to her the duty of a common carrier to a passenger. The car, the door and all the levers for moving them were under the exclusive care and control of the defendant. The closing of the door under the circumstances was evidence of negligence, and since the door was under the care of the defendant and since there was absolutely no explanation of the cause for the movement of the door, the negligence was <em>prima facie </em>that of the defendant. And that is so even if some passenger might have intentionally started the machinery by which it was closed. It was the defendant\u2019s duty not only to use care to see that its servants and agents properly managed the machinery, but also to see that no stranger started the mechanism.
