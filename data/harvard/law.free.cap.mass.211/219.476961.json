In such a suit it is immaterial that the immediate purchaser from the defendant was not deceived as to the identity of the goods, and the plaintiff need not show that specific buyers from such purchaser were deceived or that the defendant intended to deceive the public, he being bound to know the probable consequences of supplying the means of deception.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b245-11\">In a suit in equity by a manufacturer to restrain the defendant from selling goods in packages of distinctive design like those which the plaintiff had established the exclusive right to use in his business, where it is shown that the defendant Wrongfully caused his packages to be made in deliberate imitation of those of the plaintiff for the purpose of acquiring as far as possible the plaintiff\u2019s customers and trade, the defendant may be liable not only for the damage suffered by the plaintiff but also to account to the plaintiff for any profits which may have accrued to the defendant from his use of the imitation packages.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-12\">Bill in equity, filed in the Supreme Judicial Court on June 20, 1910, to restrain the defendant from selling, offering or advertising for sale any toothpicks, not manufactured by the plaintiff, in packages like those of the plaintiff or in any packages so similar as to be likely to cause the defendant\u2019s goods to be mistaken for the plaintiff\u2019s goods, and to recover damages and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>profits which had accrued to the defendant from its alleged unlawful acts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-5\">The case was referred to Edward S. Goulston, Esquire, as master. The facts found by the master are stated or referred to in the opinion. The master\u2019s findings as to the acts of the defendant were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-6\">\u201c8. The defendant markets its toothpicks under a great many brand names and in many different forms of package and trade dress, and has probably the largest toothpick business in the United States; prior to the sale to the William Edwards Company hereinafter referred to, the defendant was acquainted with the plaintiff\u2019s package and was not marketing any package with a design bearing any resemblance to the design on the plaintiff\u2019s package, nor does there appear to have been any reason for the defendant to have marketed any package with a design resembling that of the plaintiff except to secure the business of the William Edwards Company as hereinafter set out.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-7\">\u201c9. In February, 1909, that is, about a year and a'half after the plaintiff had first sold to the William Edwards Company a brand of toothpicks under the name of the \u2018Edwards Toothpick\u2019 and packed in the plaintiff\u2019s jobbers\u2019 brand package, a salesman of the defendant called on the William Edwards Company and solicited its business. Prior to this the defendant had been selling the William Edwards Company the defendant\u2019s Ideal Brand of toothpicks in packages wholly different from the plaintiff\u2019s. The William Edwards Company told the defendant\u2019s salesman that it was having the Edwards toothpick made, and the defendant\u2019s salesman requested the right to figure and afterwards obtained an order from the William Edwards Company for the Edwards toothpick, agreeing. to duplicate the package. The defendant thereafter made for the William Edwards Company the Edwards toothpick, making substantially an exact copy of the plaintiff\u2019s package with the exception of the omission of the plaintiff\u2019s monogram on the side of the package; the box maker who made the defendant\u2019s boxes for said Edwards toothpick was furnished by the defendant with one of the plaintiff\u2019s packages with directions to duplicate the same, omitting the plaintiff\u2019s monogram, and practically did duplicate the same except as to the monogram. At the time the defendant took said order from and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>ordered the boxes for the William Edwards Company it was familiar with the plaintiff\u2019s package, and knew that the monogram on the plaintiff\u2019s package indicated the plaintiff was the manufacturer, and the defendant would not have obtained the order from the William Edwards Company except for its offer to furnish the same package under a lower price. . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-3\">\u201c10. After the sale to the William Edwards Company the defendant sold to a number of other dealers toothpicks in packages bearing the design complained of, but with the exception of the Edwards brand all the defendant\u2019s goods sold in said packages were marketed with brand names which were different from any brand names used by the plaintiff. In three instances of sales by the defendant of toothpicks in boxes bearing the design complained of . . . the customer had previously carried in stock and sold the plaintiff\u2019s toothpicks packed in either its factory or jobbers\u2019 package.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-4\">\u201c11. No notice was given to the defendant by the' plaintiff of its claim to the exclusive use of the package and trade dress before the bringing of the bill of complaint; after suit was brought the defendant filled orders which it had theretofore taken for toothpicks packed in the packages complained of, but has since taken no new orders for goods packed in similar packages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-5\">\u201c12. The plaintiff offered no evidence of actual deception, or any evidence of public recognition or reputation of its package except the presumption of such public recognition and reputation as may arise from the plaintiff\u2019s extensive marketing of its product in such package. The defendant\u2019s customers knew that they were getting the defendant\u2019s goods and not the plaintiff\u2019s goods. There is no evidence of the defendant\u2019s passing off its goods as and for the goods of the plaintiff.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-6\">The case came on to be heard before <em>Morton, </em>J., who reserved it upon the pleadings and the master\u2019s report \u2018for determination by the full court. If this court should determine that the plaintiff was entitled to the relief prayed for, the case was to stand for further hearing upon the question of damages and profits; otherwise, such decree was to be entered as to the court should seem meet.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b247-7\"><em>R. Cushman, (C. D. Woodberry </em>with him,) for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b247-8\"><em>W. A. MacLeod, (W. A.

It adopted in the marketing of the product a box or package of distinctive size and shape bearing in colors a characteristic design so collocated as to make the combination dissimilar from any label, form of package, or dress of goods then in use by other manufacturers or dealers. During the development of its trade a certain proportion of the packages had the imprint of the name of various jobbers to whom the exclusive sale of the goods had been given, or of some fanciful word or phrase suggested by them, and the entire production became classified as either the factory brand sold generally to the jobbing trade under brand names used only by the plaintiff, or the jobber\u2019s brand. But while the color of the printing and of the background on the factory brand differed from the jobber\u2019s brand, the quality of the goods was uniform, and every package as it left the factory bore the monogram of the plaintiff, with the further distinguishing design of a wreath overlapped by a curved band with an escalloped gold edge. The plaintiff upon these findings, while claiming no rights of property in the brand name used by the jobber, had acquired a reputation and good will in connection with, and as a part of its business, which generally is recognized as a property right, and will be protected against the unfair competition of rival manufacturers or dealers in similar products. <em>George G. Fox Co. </em>v. <em>Glynn, </em>191 Mass. 344, 349. <em>Reading Stove Works </em>v. <em>S. M. Howes Co. </em>201 Mass. 437, 438. <em>Draper </em>v. <em>Skerrett, </em>116 Fed. Rep. 206.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">It is wholly immaterial, where this right has been invaded, that the retail or wholesale dealer who may be the immediate purchaser of goods put out in imitation is not misled as to their identity. The wrong of unfair competition is present where goods' are so dressed in form, or- marked by decorative symbols, that the ultimate consumer when the goods are distributed for use in the ordinary course of trade, either is, or possibly may be, de- &gt; ceived. The liability to deception being the test, it also is not necessary to show that specific buyers have been actually de- \u2018 ceived or that the infringer intended to deceive the public. He \u25a0 is bound to know the probable consequences, where the means <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>of such deception have been supplied by him. <em>New England Awl &amp; Needle Co. </em>v. <em>Marlborough Awl &amp; Needle Co. </em>168 Mass. 154. <em>Reading Stove Works v. S. M. Howes Co. </em>201 Mass. 437, 440, 441, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">The defendant, for the pin-pose of acquiring the extensive trade of a jobber with whom the plaintiff did business, deliberately duplicated the plaintiff\u2019s box or package in every particular with the exception of the monogram, and thereafter these receptacles filled with toothpicks in which the defendant although not a manufacturer very largely dealt, were widely distributed to consumers through dealers in the trade to whom it sold them. This misappropriation having been an invasion of the plaintiff\u2019s exclusive right to the form, style and dress of the box or package in which its goods had been marketed, it is entitled to injunctive relief even if the defendant had acted innocently. But as the defendant must be presumed to have contemplated the probable effect of its purpose to acquire so far as possible the plaintiff\u2019s customers and trade, it is liable for both actual damages, and profits, if any, realized from the sale of toothpicks in the imitation packages. <em>Regis </em>v. <em>Jaynes, </em>191 Mass. 245. <em>Reading Stove Works </em>v. <em>S. M. Howes Co. </em>201 Mass. 437, 441-443. By the terms of the reservation of the single justice, the case is to stand for further hearing upon these questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">\n<em>Decree accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
