He also stated that he intended to try the case, that he had a good case for trial. Upon the facts as stated by counsel I found that there was an intention to try the case. In my opinion I thought it was not best, in my discretion, to advance this case for speedy trial before cases that had been pending in court for a considerable time. I ruled as a matter of law that it was a question of discretion rather than a question of absolute duty on my part to advance the case, and I believed that I ought not to exercise my discretion in favor of advancing said ease for speedy trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-7\">\u201cI rule as a matter of law that the defendant, under all the circumstances in this case, has no right to have the case advanced for speedy trial, under the construction of the statute.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-8\">The defendant filed the following statement, called on the docket an appeal:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-9\">\u201cNow comes the defendant in the above cause, and being aggrieved by the judgment of the court denying the defendant\u2019s motion to advance said cause for speedy trial, and by the ruling of the court thereon, being a matter of law apparent on the record in said proceeding, hereby appeals to the Supreme Judicial Court.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b58-10\"><em>F.
