The remaining $75.35 claimed in the declaration was for items admitted by the defendant to be due to the plaintiff. Writ in the Municipal Court of the West Roxbury District of the City of Boston dated February 9, 1910.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-6\">The answer, as to the claim for $250, set up the statute of frauds. On appeal to the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>Quinn, </em>J. The plaintiff testified that, because of a failure by Hazard to make a payment of $200, he took his men off the job and they remained away for from eight to ten days; that then the defendant called him upon the telephone on August 10, 1909, \u201cand said \u2018Mac, what is the trouble down there? Why don\u2019t you go down there and finish your work?\u2019 I said, \u2018I will do no more work until I get what is due me and this thing is straightened out/ He said, \u2018Put your men down there in the morning. ... I can\u2019t finish my work until this work is finished. I will be there and we will straighten this matter right there.\u2019 I said, \u2018Well, if that is so, I will be there with my men in the morning, and I want you to be sure/ He said \u2018I will/ I went down with four men in the morning and stood on the sidewalk. Mr. Gruff came .along in a few minutes. \u2018Now Mac,\u2019 said Mr. Gruff, \u2018I want that bit of a buttress built there, \u2019side of the stairs, and I don\u2019t want to pay you one cent for it, but I want you to finish up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>the balance of your contract and I will pay you your money at any time, either before or after the work is done.\u2019 Mr. Gruff and Mr. Hazard were there all this time.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-5\">On August 14, the plaintiff received from Hazard a check of the defendant for $200 and gave to Hazard a receipt reading \"Received of P. Hazard\u201d $200 \u201caccount mason work Dunreath St.\u201d The plaintiff testified that Hazard had acted \u201cas an errand boy\u201d for him in getting the check from the defendant, and that he was looking to the defendant and not to Hazard for payment at that time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-6\">The plaintiff built the buttress referred to above and completed the contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-7\">There was other evidence, some of it tending to corroborate and some to contradict the testimony of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-8\">At the close of the evidence the judge ruled that the agreement of August 10 was within the statute of frauds and ordered a verdict for the plaintiff only for the admitted items of extras and interest, $82.67; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b517-9\"><em>F.

On this the case is close. Considering however the conversation itself, the circumstances under which it was held and the evidence as to the subsequent conduct of the parties, we are constrained to say that, brief and meagre as is the evidence, the plaintiff had a right to go to the jury on the question whether such an understanding was reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-13\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
