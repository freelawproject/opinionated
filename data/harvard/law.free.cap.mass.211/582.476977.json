Writ in the Municipal Court of the City of Boston dated February 18, 1910.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b608-10\">The lessors assigned their rights under the lease to Eugene A. Pope, who originally was the plaintiff in this action. On his death the executrix of his will was admitted as plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b608-11\">On appeal to the Superior Court, the case was heard by <em>Fessenden, </em>J., without a jury. It appeared that the substance of the provisions of the lease as to its term and the payment of rent was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b608-12\">\u201cTo have and to hold the premises hereby demised unto the lessee, for the term of five years beginning with the first day of April in the year nineteen hundred five. Reserving however, to. said lessee the right to surrender said premises on April 1, 1908, by giving said lessors notice in writing of his intention so to do on or before Jan. 1, 1908, and fulfilling all his covenants and agreements herein contained up to the date of surrender.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b608-13\">\u201cYielding and paying therefor the yearly rent of Five hundred dollars, during the said term, by equal quarter yearly payments . . . and also at the legal determination of this lease a proportionate part of the said rent for any part of a quarter then unexpired.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>It also appeared that the defendant covenanted in the lease not to underlet without the consent in writing of the lessor. One Moffett occupied half of the premises described in the lease. There was some evidence that this was done with the knowledge of \"the lessors and without objection on their part.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-5\">After the defendant left the premises, Moffett paid the rent to and including October 1, 1909.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-6\">Other facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b609-7\"><em>L.

The notice which he gave on December 27, 1907, does not avail him, because later he failed to carry out his intention of surrendering the leased premises. Clearly his liability under the lease was not ended by his moving out about May 1, 1909; nor by the occupancy of Moffett without the consent in writing of the lessors; nor by the three months\u2019 notice to quit given on June 7, 1909. The lease was not legally terminated until the lessors\u2019 entry to take possession on January 13,1910; and by its express terms the defendant became liable for \u201ca proportionate part of the said rent for any part of a quarter then unexpired.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">The finding of the trial judge was correct, and the requests for rulings, so far as material, were rightly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-11\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
