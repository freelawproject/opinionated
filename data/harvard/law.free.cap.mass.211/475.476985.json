It appeared that a regulation of the hotel forbade the changing of clothing in any part of the toilet room, but that no notice of the regulation was given to the plaintiff other than the porter\u2019s statement. In redirect examination of the plaintiff he was allowed, subject to an exception by the defendant, to state that he did not understand the porter\u2019s statement to mean that he could not change his stockings inside the closet. <em>Held, </em>that, even assuming that it was error to admit the testimony of the plaintiff as to what he understood to be the meaning of the porter\u2019s statement, such testimony at most was immaterial and its admission did not prejudice the defendant.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-12\">Tort for an assault and battery alleged to have been committed by a porter of the defendant, the proprietor of the New American House in Boston.

There was evidence tending to show that the plaintiff went to the defendant\u2019s hotel, intending to get dinner there; that he first went to the toilet room to have his shoes polished; that, having a new pair of stockings with him, he told the porter that he would like to change his stockings, and that the porter replied that he could not change them there; that the plaintiff then entered one of the toilet closets and began to change his stockings, whereupon the porter forcibly ejected him.

The only exceptions relate to the admission of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">I. The plaintiff\u2019s testimony that he felt humiliated in consequence of the assault and did not sleep any all night was rightly admitted. The insult and indignity inflicted upon him may well have occasioned distress of mind and injury to his feelings more serious than the physical damage, and the plaintiff was entitled to recover reasonable compensation therefor. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Holcomb, </em>99 Mass. 552. <em>Meagher </em>v. <em>Driscoll, </em>99 Mass. 281. <em>Lopes </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>210 Mass. 487.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">2. The defendant introduced testimony of a regulation of the hotel that no clothing should be changed in any part of the toilet room; but there was no evidence that the plaintiff knew of its existence. In redirect examination the plaintiff was allowed to testify that when he was having his shoes polished and the porter said to him, \u201cYou can\u2019t change your stockings here,\u201d he did not understand that the porter was forbidding him to change them inside the toilet room. It does not appear for what purpose this testimony was admitted. Probably the trial judge inferred that the defendant intended to argue in mitigation of damages that the plaintiff provoked the assault by wilfully violating a regulation of the hotel; and deemed it competent for the plaintiff to show that to his mind the somewhat ambiguous notice prohibited the use for the purpose intended of only the public portion of the toilet room. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>But even assuming that this testimony was incompetent, it was at most immaterial and did not affect the merits of the action. A harmless error of this character, that does not appear to have injuriously affected the substantial rights of the parties, furnishes no ground for the reversal of a verdict that was warranted after a full and fair trial. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Fall River Daily Herald Publishing Co. </em>143 Mass. 581. <em>Scaplen </em>v. <em>Blanchard, </em>187 Mass. 73. 1 Wig-more on Evidence, \u00a7 21.</p>\n<p id=\"A1v\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
