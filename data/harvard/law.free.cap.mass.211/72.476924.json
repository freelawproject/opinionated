Nearly nine months thereafter, the lender having brought an action for a balance due on the note, the borrower settled the action by paying the lender .$160.50 and giving a new note for $450 due in two months, the $160.50 representing $100 paid to reduce the principal of the former note, $15.50 as estimated costs, and $45 as advance interest upon the new note. Upon the maturity of the second note the lender brought an action upon it and the borrower contended that under the provisions of R. L. c. 102, \u00a7 51, the lender could recover only the balance still due of the amount of money actually lent in the original transaction with interest at eighteen per cent per annum and $5 for the expense of making and securing the loan. <em>Held, </em>that the borrower had failed to take advantage of the right given to him by the statute to discharge his indebtedness in the manner there provided, and therefore that the lender might recover the full amount of the second note with interest from the date of the writ.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-11\">Contract against Percy H.

On April 8,1910, an action was brought by the plaintiff for a balance remaining due on that note. On April 14,1910, the defendants paid the plaintiff $160.50 and gave it the note in suit which was dated March 24, 1910, and was payable in two months from that date. The plaintiff thereupon surrendered the former note and dismissed the action it had brought thereon. Of the $160.50 paid in cash, $100 was to reduce the principal of the former note, $15.50 was to pay estimated costs in the suit brought thereon, and $45 was to pay interest on the new note for the two months that it was to run.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-3\">At the close of the evidence the defendants asked the presiding judge to rule in substance that the note in suit was a renewal of the former note, and that \u201cat the date of the writ there was due and payable to the plaintiff no more than the original sum actually borrowed, with interest at the rate of eighteen per cent per annum from the time said sum was borrowed . . . until the date of the writ, . . . and a sum not exceeding $5 for the actual expenses of making the loan; but there shall be subtracted from the principal at the date of each payment the sums in excess of such interest paid from time to time.\u201d The rulings were refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-4\">In answer to a question by the judge, the jury found that the note in suit was given as a part of the consideration for the settlement of the action brought by the plaintiff on the former note.

L. c. 102, \u00a7 51, apply only to loans secured by mortgage or pledge of personal property. That section is a codification of prior legislation, which began in St. 1888, c. 388. That act by its terms covered \u201call loans\u201d thereafter contracted \u201cfor less than one thousand dollars,\u201d and must of course be applied to all loans whether unsecured or secured in any manner whatever. St. 1890, c. 416, \u00a7 6, recognized St. 1888, c. 388, as still in force. By St. 1892, c. 428, \u00a7 1, the statute of 1888 was re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>enacted, with a reduction in the fee which lenders were allowed to charge for making papers. Other sections of the act of 1892 provided for the case of such loans secured by mortgage or pledge of personal property. But the first section of this later act was still left to apply to all loans, secured or unsecured. This was the manifest intention of the Legislature. And the same.construction must of course be given to the statute as codified in the Revised Laws, in spite of the title prefixed to \u00a7 47 of c. 102. The construction of a statute is not to be affected by verbal changes in a revision, unless that was plainly intended by the Legislature. <em>Great Barrington </em>v. <em>Gibbons, </em>199 Mass. 527, 529. Much less can titles or headings prefixed to subdivisions of a chapter in a codification have such an effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-3\">It follows that while the original note given by the defendants to the plaintiff remained unpaid, they might have paid or tendered to their creditor the amount of the actual loan made to them, with interest at the rate of eighteen per cent a year and the additional sum of $5, after applying in reduction of the principal sum all payments which they had made in excess of that rate of interest. This would fully ha,ye discharged their indebtedness. But it was their personal privilege, to be availed of only at their election; their note was not an unlawful contract, nor was it invalid. <em>Spofford </em>v. <em>State Loan Co. </em>208 Mass. 84. <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Boston Loan Co. </em>160 Mass. 237. They did not exercise their statutory right, and the plaintiff sued them upon the note. They still might have discharged their indebtedness by making the same payment or tender (R. L. c. 102, \u00a7 51), with what legal costs had accrued, but they failed to do so. Instead thereof, as the jury have found and were warranted in finding, they chose to settle the action by paying a certain sum of money and giving the note now sued on. The \u2022making of such a payment or tender was a condition precedent to the discharge of their liability under the statute. Without that, they remained liable upon their note, and it was right to order a verdict for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">But there was evidence that the money which they paid to the plaintiff when the former suit was settled and the present note was given included, besides what was demanded for the settlement of that suit, the sum of $45 for interest paid in advance upon the new note, that is, of course, until the note should become due. If so, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>the amount actually lent upon this note was only $450, and the defendants might have discharged their indebtedness by the payment or tender of this sum with the interest and expenses prescribed by the statute. But they did not choose to do this, and so cannot now complain of having been held to their bargain. As the verdict included only interest at the rate of six per cent from the date of the writ, they have not been subjected to the burden of any double interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
