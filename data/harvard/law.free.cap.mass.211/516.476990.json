The plaintiff testified that the car was a semi-convertible one, that he approached it while it was standing still and stepped on the fender at the rear, hiding himself from the conductor, that he was standing on a connecting bar a little higher than the fender and was clinging to the window sill. The plaintiff further testified that after the car had gone five or six car lengths the conductor looked around and as he did so shook his fist. \u201cHe was gruff and coarse, and he told me to get off, and he held his hand closed.\u201d \u201cHe turned around,and with closed fist, he made me \u2014 he told me to get off.\u201d \u201cBy his tone he frightened me, and I could not get off.\u201d \u201cWhen he said \u2018get off\u2019 he shook his fist, and leaned over the window, his fist came right close to my face.\u201d \u201c I tried to get off, but couldn\u2019t \u2014 by his tone he frightened me, and I could not get off.\u201d The plaintiff testified that he lost his balance and did not know what happened then.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b542-11\">.

It is contradictory in many respects, but even if it be taken in the light most favorable for the plaintiff it falls far short of showing that the defendant failed to perform the limited duty it owed to the plaintiff. The case must stand in the class with <em>Bjornquist </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Albany Railroad, ubi supra; Albert </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>185 Mass. 210; <em>Massell </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>191 Mass. 491; <em>Anternoitz </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven, &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>193 Mass. 542; <em>Lebov </em>v. <em>Consolidated Railway, </em>203 Mass. 380, and similar cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
