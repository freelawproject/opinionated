A severe windstorm knocked down several of these unbraced walls.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">After the contractor\u2019s insurer, Potomac Insurance Company of Illinois, denied coverage, the owner\u2019s insurer, appellant School Alliance Insurance Fund (SAIF), paid $309,834.07, which represented the total cost to reconstruct the collapsed walls. As the owner\u2019s subrogee, SAIF then filed this action against Thomas, Fama, Potomac, and others, seeking to recover these amounts as damages. On cross-motions for summary judgment, Judge Harry K. Seybolt ruled among other things that SAIF\u2019s claims were barred by the waiver of subrogation clause in the construction contract, because the claimed loss was covered by the owner\u2019s insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">On appeal, SAIF contends that the judge erred in dismissing its claim (1) for contractual indemnification against Thomas because the waiver of subrogation clause in the contract allegedly did not void a contractual duty of Thomas to indemnify SAIF and (2) for breach of contract against Thomas for its failure to obtain insurance allegedly required by contract. SAIF further asserts that the judge erred in dismissing its claims against Potomac, because (a) Potomac allegedly covered the contractual indemnification duty of Thomas to SAIF, as subrogee of Great Meadows, irrespective of a purported exclusion in Potomac\u2019s policy, and (b) the exclusion in Potomac\u2019s policy directly contradicts the reasonable expectations of Thomas and Great Meadows. Finally, SAIF contends that it was error to dismiss its claims because, as a matter of equity and public policy, the taxpayers that fund SAIF, a public entity, should not be responsible for the failure of profit-making, private enterprises, such as Thomas and Potomac, to comply with their contractual duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">As to the last point, we note that it was not raised before the trial court. We decline to address it for the first time on appeal, being satisfied that it does not sufficiently implicate substantial public interest factors. <em>See Nieder v. Royal Indem. Ins. Co., </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>229, 234, 300 A.2d 142 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>As to SAIF\u2019s remaining contentions, from our review of the parties\u2019 arguments in light of the record and applicable principles of law we have concluded that we are in substantial agreement with the reasons for decision set forth by Judge Seybolt in his written opinion of February 21, 2001, reported at 353 <em>N.J.Super. </em>131, 801 A.2d 459 (Law Div.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
