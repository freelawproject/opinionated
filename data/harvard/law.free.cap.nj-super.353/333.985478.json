After his conviction was reversed on appeal, <em>see State v. Grubb, </em>319 <em>N.J.Super. </em>407, 725 A.2d 707 (App.Div.1999), <em>certif. denied, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>333, 736 A.2d 526 (1999), defendant Borough of Hightstown (Borough) initiated disciplinary proceedings, followed by a hearing, which resulted in plaintiffs being terminated \u201cpermanently\u201d from his job. The Law Division affirmed. Plaintiff now appeals from that determination as well as certain interlocutory rulings decided against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Although plaintiff raises a number of issues on appeal, his core arguments are that: 1) the Borough had no jurisdiction to discipline and terminate him because it had never reinstated him as an employee after forfeiture; 2) the Borough was precluded from proceeding based solely on evidence that had been gathered during the criminal investigation; 3) the charges were untimely and filed in violation of his procedural rights; 4) the hearing officer and the trial court made incorrect evidentiary rulings; and 5) the evidence forming the basis of his removal was insufficient because it was not credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">We reject plaintiffs arguments and affirm. We conclude that although the Borough did not formally enact a resolution reinstating plaintiff, the procedural posture of the case, including the language of the termination resolution and plaintiffs pursuit of reinstatement, provided a sufficient basis for the Borough to bring disciplinary charges against plaintiff. We further conclude that the charges were timely filed and were established by competent and credible evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">Most of the facts relevant to the underlying criminal charges forming the basis of the disciplinary proceedings are set forth in our prior opinion in <em>Grubb, supra, </em>319 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 411-14, 725 A.2d 707, which we incorporate. We supplement those facts with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>the substantial procedural history relevant to consideration of the issues on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Plaintiff served as a municipal police officer in the Borough since 1989. The Borough is not a civil service jurisdiction. On March <em>28, 1995, he </em>was arrested after an investigation conducted by the Edison Police Department and the Narcotics Task Force of the Middlesex County Prosecutor\u2019s Office. According to Kevin Hopkins, the Borough\u2019s police chief, the Borough had no previous knowledge that the investigation was being conducted and Hopkins learned of the arrest that same day when he received a copy of the charges from the prosecutor\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">On March 29, 1995, plaintiff was provided with a written \u201cNOTICE OF SUSPENSION.\u201d The notice informed plaintiff that he had been charged \u201cwith the crimes of Possession and Possession with intent to distribute anabolic steroids in the Township of North Brunswick,\u201d and \u201c[tjherefore, in accordance with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-149.1, the Police Department Rules and Regulation 7:3-3, and Section 6-5A(7) of the Hightstown Borough Personnel Policy,\u201d plaintiff was suspended without pay until the charges \u201care disposed of at trial, or otherwise terminated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">Plaintiff was indicted on October 10, 1995, for various charges related to the sale of steroids and other drugs. Following plaintiffs conviction and sentencing and pursuant to the State\u2019s application, the trial judge ordered plaintiff to forfeit his position as a police officer in the Borough and disqualified him from holding any state employment or office of public trust. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">On July 7, 1997, the Borough passed Resolution 213-97, in which it recognized that plaintiff had been suspended without pay and further acknowledged the forfeiture of his office pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:51-2. The resolution directed the Borough administrator and the police chief</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-10\">to take all necessary administrative actions in order to assure that the Court-ordered forfeiture of office is duly recorded in the Borough\u2019s personnel records and that said records indicate that Mr. Grubb\u2019s employment relationship with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>Borough [be] terminated upon his conviction on May 9, 1997, in accordance with <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:51 \u2014 2(b)(2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">Significantly, the resolution also stated that the authorized actions \u201cin no way constitute a waiver of the Borough\u2019s rights to institute departmental charges against Mr. Grubb, in accordance with the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-147, in the event of a successful appeal of the criminal conviction.\u201d Between the date of his suspension and the date of his termination, plaintiff was never served with any notice of disciplinary action and no departmental charges were filed. On May 29, 1997, Hopkins drew up a list of charges \u201cjust for [his] own edification,\u201d but never served them on plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">On March 19, 1999, we reversed plaintiffs conviction and entered a judgment of acquittal. <em>See Grubb, supra, </em>819 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 410, 725 A.2d 707. On July 8, 1999, the Supreme Court denied the State\u2019s petition for certification. <em>See State v. Grubb, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>333, 736 A.2d 526 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Plaintiff pursued his reinstatement. On August 17, 1999, plaintiffs attorney wrote to Hopkins:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-7\">In light of Mr. Grubb\u2019s complete vindication he is entitled to return to his position at the Hightstown Police Department. Would you kindly advise when he should report for duly? Is there anything to be completed prior to Mr. Grubb\u2019s return to the Department?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">On August 19, 1999, the Borough\u2019s attorney responded by enclosing six notices of formal charges that had been prepared and filed that day by Hopkins and delivered to plaintiffs home. As to plaintiffs reinstatement request, Hopkins stated that \u201c[i]n view of the pending disciplinary charges, and other issues involved with the requested reinstatement,\u201d he would review the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">The \u201cNOTICE OF FORMAL CHARGES\u201d identified plaintiff as a Patrolman. The charges of which plaintiff was ultimately found guilty were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-10\">8:1.13; Associating, fraternizing or business transactions at any time, or in any manner whatsoever, with known criminals or persons engaged in unlawful activities;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-11\">8:1.6K; Conduct unbecoming an employee in the public service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-12\">3:1.29; Withholding information concerning criminal activity. SPECIFICATION: Specifically, during an approximate two year period ending March 28, 1995, did meet with a person or person known to engage in unlawful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>activities, and did, sell, purchase and/or exchange with those persons anabolic steroids and prescription medications.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Finally, the notice advised plaintiff: \u201cYOU ARE HEREBY SUSPENDED PENDING DETERMINATION OF THE HEARING\u201d and that \u201c[u]nless you satisfactorily explain or defend the above eharge(s), you will be subject to the penalty or penalties checked below.\u201d The penalties included suspension for a specific number of days, demotion, fine, removal, resignation not in good standing, or other disciplinary action. The box for \u201cREMOVAL\u201d was checked as the penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">The Borough communicated with the Division of Criminal Justice regarding plaintiffs return and was advised on August 23, 1999, that \u201c[t]he reinstatement to active duty of a police officer\u201d was not the same as an initial appointment. Since plaintiff had been absent from active duty for a substantial period of time, the Division recommended that the Borough require that plaintiff complete the police training course before resumption of duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">On August 26, 1999, the Borough\u2019s attorney wrote to plaintiffs attorney regarding plaintiffs request for reinstatement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-8\">The Borough recognizes that the applicable statutes do provide for reinstatement \u201csubject to any disciplinary proceedings or administrative action.\u201d Therefore, in view of the severity of the charges which have been filed against Mr. Grubb, and the significant issues raised by [the Division of Criminal Justice], the Chief has determined that reinstatement must be held in abeyance until such time as the disciplinary charges are resolved. If the disciplinary charges are ultimately resolved in Mr. Grubb\u2019s favor, reinstatement would be implemented, upon agreement by the Borough and Mr. Grubb concerning timing, training, <em>back </em>pay and related issues, or as judicially ordered. In addition, Mr. Grubb would have to undergo the usual background check and physical and psychological testing which would be required of any new officer or officer returning to duty after a four year absence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-9\">Therefore, it would be inappropriate and premature to allow Mr. Grubb to report for duty at this time____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">Plaintiff then moved before the Borough Council, not for immediate reinstatement, but to dismiss the charges on the basis that they were not filed within the forty-five day period mandated by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A: 14-147. On September 21 and 22, 1999, hearings solely on the motion to dismiss for untimeliness were held before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>the mayor and council members. At the hearings, Hopkins stated that at no time did the Hightstown Police Department conduct any internal affairs or other investigation of the matter, and that he had never directed it do so. He agreed that he first learned of plaintiffs arrest on March 28, 1995, and that, at that time, his department was not conducting any investigation of plaintiff; that, prior to plaintiffs conviction, he had never requested any information regarding the prosecutor\u2019s investigation and never saw the indictment; that he had no access to the prosecutor\u2019s files; that he spoke to the prosecutor only twice regarding the matter; and that he had conducted no review of the evidence until August 19,1999. He agreed that the factual bases for those charges were substantially the same as the charges he later brought on August 19,1999, and when he prepared the charges on that date, he relied on copies of the investigative reports, witness statements and the trial transcripts in the possession of the Borough attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">The motion was denied, and plaintiff filed a complaint in lieu of prerogative writs in the Law Division challenging that decision. Judge Feinberg upheld the filing of the charges as timely and dismissed the complaint. <em>See Grubb v. Borough of Hightstown, </em>331 <em>N.J.Super. </em>398, 415, 751 A.2d 1119 (Law Div.2000). The judge found that the \u201cpolicy inherent\u201d in the statute was \u201cto prevent an internal investigation and a criminal investigation from proceeding at the same time....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 406-07, 751 A.2d 1119. She rejected plaintiffs argument that the forty-five day exception applied only when the department initiates a formal active \u201cconcurrent\u201d investigation as \u201cneither reasonable nor beneficial to the interests of the officer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 410, 751 A.2d 1119. To require a department to file disciplinary charges and proceed with hearings prior to disposition of the criminal charges would be \u201ccontrary to the rights afforded to other citizens\u201d and deprive the department of the complete record and appellate rulings developed during the criminal proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 412, 751 A.2d 1119.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Plaintiff also asserted that the department failed to comply with its own regulations that required charges to be filed \u201cwithin a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>reasonable time after which the existence of the alleged or suspected misconduct is made known, or should have been made known, to the department of Police.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 412-13, 751 A.2d 1119. The judge found that the definition of \u201creasonable\u201d in the regulations must be construed in conjunction with the time requirements set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-147, whi ch governed the applicable periods. <em>Id. </em>at 413, 751 A.2d 1119.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">The hearing then resumed before the designated hearing officer, David Schroth, a retired Superior Court Judge. For the first time, plaintiff moved to dismiss the charges on the basis that the Borough had no jurisdiction to consider disciplinary charges against him as his employment as a Borough police officer had been terminated by virtue of Resolution 213-97 and under <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:51-2, which required the forfeiture of his position upon conviction. He contended that \u201c[i]t requires an additional resolution be passed reinstating him to his position of employment in order to have jurisdiction over him.\u201d The Borough argued that \u201conce the decision was overturned, then the basis for the original termination was gone\u201d and \u201cthereafter, they deemed him to be back on the force____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">The hearing officer found that when the conviction was reversed, the resolution was \u201cnugatory,\u201d and that \u201c[i]t means nothing, has no substance.\u201d He also rejected plaintiffs contention that the jurisdiction argument could be appropriately raised at any time, and stated that the motion should have been raised preliminarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">Plaintiff then stated that he wished to waive his right to a hearing and appeal the charges in accordance with the provision of <em>N.J.S.A </em>40A: 14-147, that \u201c[t]he law enforcement officer may waive the right to a hearing and may appeal the charges directly to any available authority specified by law or regulation, or follow any other procedure recognized by a contract, as permitted by law.\u201d The hearing officer denied this motion on the basis that the provision had to be invoked \u201cbefore the commencement of this proceeding,\u201d noting that \u201cthis proceeding is well underway.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>Even though testimony had commenced, plaintiff filed another complaint in lieu of prerogative writs, seeking temporary restraints and pressing the waiver issue. The judge denied the request and concluded that plaintiff was not entitled to relief. <em>See Grubb v. Borough of Hightstown, </em>333 <em>N.J.Super. </em>592, 597-98, 756 A.2d 639 (Law Div.2000).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">The hearing resumed, and the Borough, relying primarily on facts adduced at the criminal trial and the prosecutor\u2019s investigation and witnesses, addressed the specific disciplinary charges. Following the presentation of these proofs, the Borough provided additional proofs to address the specifications dealing with fraternization, withholding information, failure to report and neglect of duty. Hopkins noted that plaintiff had no official reason to associate with Vincent Zarlenga, who had been previously convicted of intent to distribute steroids, or Prince Brown, another individual engaged in the sale of steroids,' and that he had not reported their illegal activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Hopkins also provided additional proofs as to plaintiffs suspension and reinstatement. When the Supreme Court denied certification of the appeal in July 1999, Hopkins took no steps to reinstate plaintiff. Instead, in August 1999, when Hopkins and the Council decided to file disciplinary charges against plaintiff, they \u201clooked at [plaintiffs employment status] as it was still a continuation of the suspension.\u201d In fact, throughout the entire process, it appears that all parties, including plaintiff, Hopkins and the Council, viewed plaintiff as on suspension without pay rather than having been terminated. As Hopkins noted at the hearing, he believed plaintiff was \u201cstill on a suspension status.\u201d The department\u2019s regulations, section 8:1.5, provided that an \u201cappointing authority,\u201d which in 1995, was the Borough administrator, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>\u201cmay suspend without pay ... an employee due to inefficiency, incompetency, misconduct, negligence, insubordination, or for other sufficient cause ____\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although neither Hopkins nor the Borough served plaintiff with a preliminary notice of disciplinary charges at the time of the original suspension, plaintiff neither challenged that lack of action nor challenged his status during the pendency of the criminal charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Plaintiffs testimony from his suppression hearing contained admissions that he had possessed cytomel and aldactazide prior to March 1995, and that he had ordered those substances from abroad; that he had purchased Clenbuterol in 1993, dining a vacation in Mexico, where it was available over the counter, and that he brought some home and used it; that in 1993 or 1994, he had purchased Lebatrona, which was a brand of cytomel, from Zarlenga; that he had offered to mail the Clenbuterol, aldactazide and cytomel to Zarlenga, and that, when he set out from his home, he intended to give them to Zarlenga; that he had two vials of testosterone in his home on March 28; and that he admitted he used testosterone \u201ca few times\u201d from 1985 to 1993. Plaintiff also denied that he intended to accept the Stanozol from Zarlenga, and asserted that he last used steroids in 1993. He admitted that he used them \u201conce\u201d when he was a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">At the close of evidence, plaintiff moved to dismiss the charges on the basis that the department\u2019s allegations relied solely on the investigation by the Middlesex County Prosecutor\u2019s Office, which was conducted in violation of plaintiffs due process rights and thus in violation of departmental regulations. The hearing officer denied the motion. Plaintiffs motion for a dismissal based <em>on </em>due process entrapment was also denied as was his motion to dismiss on the grounds that the police had insufficient probable cause to effect plaintiffs arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>The hearing officer issued his written decision in June 2000. He found the witnesses to be \u201cvery creditable and totally believable\u201d and accepted their testimony \u201cas being totally true and accurate.\u201d Regarding charge one, which involved fraternizing with known criminals, he found plaintiff \u201cobviously guilty\u201d of that charge on the basis that \u201c[t]he evidence makes it vividly clear that Bryan Grubb associated with Zarlenga and Brown over a long period of time and that he got steroids from Prince Brown in the fall of 1994,\u201d and \u201c[i]n addition he dealt illegally with Vince Zarlenga, a known and convicted criminal, and obviously a party engaging in unlawful activities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">On charge two, conduct unbecoming an employee, the hearing officer found that the \u201centire case\u201d was \u201creplete with evidence of Bryan Grubb conducting himself in a manner unbecoming an employee in the public service,\u201d and that \u201c[o]ne need only look at his Oath of Office, which is in evidence, to establish how obviously unbecoming and illegal his actions were.\u201d With respect to charge three, which alleged that plaintiff withheld information concerning criminal activity, the hearing officer concluded that the evidence established plaintiff \u201cwas obviously violating the law over an extended period of time and that he was doing so with others,\u201d and \u201cof course did not disclose the facts or events\u201d to his police department. Charges four through nine were dismissed as duplicative.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">The hearing officer concluded that plaintiff \u201cwas violating the law from day one and continued to do so until the time of his arrest.\u201d He found that plaintiff \u201cbought and sold steroids, nonprescription drugs, and controlled dangerous substances for years while a Hightstown Police Officer\u201d and that \u201can avalanche of completely and totally believable evidence ... establishes Bryan Grubb\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">As to plaintiffs claims of entrapment, the hearing officer stated: \u201c[E]ntrapment is not relevant in these proceedings, in that it is not a defense in this hearing. Furthermore, I didn\u2019t hear any evidence that even touched on the subject matter.\u201d The hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>officer issued the \u201cvery strong recommendation that Bryan Grubb be fired and permanently terminated from ever being a police officer in Hightstown Borough.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Plaintiff filed an appeal in the Law Division. On July 17, 2000, the Council adopted a resolution to \u201caccept the conclusions and recommendations of the hearing officer that said Bryan Grubb be permanently terminated as a member of the police force of the Borough of Hightstown.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">In the Law Division proceeding, the parties offered testimony to supplement the record. The focus of the inquiry was whether the Borough had properly adopted rules and regulations that governed the disciplinary proceeding. The Borough argued that the disciplinary proceedings were premised not only on police regulations and policies, but on statutory authority as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">Judge Feinberg rejected plaintiffs arguments. She concluded that a police officer can be prosecuted for disciplinary infractions even in the absence of properly adopted rules. She also found that the Borough\u2019s witnesses were credible and their testimony reliable, but agreed that she would not consider the intercepted conversations between plaintiff and Zarlenga.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">The judge rejected plaintiffs arguments that due process violations based on entrapment precluded the disciplinary prosecution and found that \u201cplaintiffs constitutional rights were fully protected in this matter.\u201d She found that the Borough\u2019s procedures \u201ccomplied with all the mandatory requirements\u201d and \u201cwere appropriate in this matter.\u201d The judge determined that the evidence seized from plaintiffs home was properly admitted and relevant to the charge that plaintiff traded in steroids and prescription medications during a two-year period and that the charge was \u201csupported by the fact that prescription medications, steroids, and syringes were found in his home.\u201d She concluded that plaintiff was guilty of the charges and affirmed the permanent termination of his employment as a Hightstown police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">On appeal, plaintiff raises the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>I. THE DEPENDANT LACKED JURISDICTION TO PILE CHARGES AGAINST PLAINTIFF AND AS SUCH THE CHARGES MUST BE DISMISSED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-4\">II.

Plaintiff insists that he could not be disciplined unless he was first reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">Plaintiffs removal from office did not arise out of the Borough\u2019s July 7, 1997 resolution terminating his employment, but by the mandate of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2a(l), requiring the forfeiture of office following a conviction for a third-degree crime. The forfeiture takes effect immediately upon conviction, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2b(l), and the trial judge in the criminal proceedings so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">In his argument, plaintiff focuses on the Borough\u2019s July 7, 1997 resolution terminating plaintiff and suggests that absent any new resolution reinstating plaintiff, his lack of employment status precluded the Borough from pursuing disciplinary charges against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">The argument is specious. The Borough\u2019s resolution merely memorialized that which had been accomplished as a matter of statutory mandate. Nothing cited by plaintiff in either the statute or a Borough\u2019s ordinances enabled the Borough to terminate plaintiffs employment by resolution alone absent compliance with the Borough\u2019s statutory obligation to demonstrate that \u201cthe conduct giving rise to the conviction demonstrates that the person is unfit to hold the office, position or employment.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2g-</p>\n<p id=\"b377-12\">Plaintiffs reliance on <em>Rosetty v. Township Comm. of the Township of Hamilton, </em>82 <em>N.J.Super. </em>340, 347, 197 A.2d 600 (Law Div.1964), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>96 <em>N.J.Super. </em>66, 232 A.2d 455 (App.Div.1967), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>is misplaced. Rosetty was a suspended employee, not one subject to forfeiture; at all times he remained a township employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">The forfeiture statute addresses the circumstances presented here. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2e provides: \u201cIf the conviction be reversed or the order of forfeiture be overturned, he shall be restored, if feasible, to his office, position or employment with all the rights, emoluments and salary thereof from the date of the forfeiture.\u201d The effect of the forfeiture is negated by the reversal of the conviction removing the forfeiture bar as a basis for reinstatement, but that does not entitle plaintiff to reinstatement as the statute also imposes a condition of feasibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2c creates a qualified right to reinstatement. The language \u201cif feasible\u201d denotes a \u201cfor cause\u201d standard imposing a condition on the right to reinstatement. <em>Compare Peltack v. Borough of Manville, </em>547 <em>F.Supp. </em>770, 774 (D.N.J.1982). The practical impact of this interpretation under the facts presented here permits plaintiff to perfect his right to reinstatement, but also enables the Borough to press its claim that plaintiff should be terminated based on disciplinary violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Plaintiff was properly suspended pending resolution of the criminal charges. Plaintiff never challenged that suspension. Upon conviction, the provisions of <em>N.J.S. A </em>2C:51-2 became operative, and after reversal and denial of certification by the Supreme Court, plaintiff did not seek to overturn the order of forfeiture, but simply inquired of the municipality when he could return to work. Upon such inquiry, the Borough exercised its prerogative of establishing \u201ccause\u201d and pressed forward with its disciplinary charges \u2014 a right not only contemplated by <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:51-2, but by the language of <em>N.J.S.A </em>40A:14-149.2, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-7\">If a suspended police officer is found not guilty at trial, the charges are dismissed or the prosecution is terminated, said officer shall be reinstated to his position and shall be entitled to recover all pay withheld during the period of suspension <em>subject to any disciplinary proceedings or administrative action.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-8\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>A harmonious reading of these related statutes indicates that the Legislature contemplated circumstances whereby an acquitted officer is presumptively entitled to return to his employment, but a governing body and the public at large are entitled to protection against an officer whose conduct warrants termination. A practical reading of these statutes under the facts presented here warrants the conclusion that the municipality need not reinstate the offending officer only to simultaneously serve him with the \u201cfor cause\u201d disciplinary charges. The unqualified right to be reinstated must be considered with the equally relevant right of a municipality to press its claim that the officer is not worthy of reinstatement, but subject to termination. Applying that statutory scheme here leads us to conclude that the Borough acted properly by pressing forward with its disciplinary proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Plaintiffs belated argument regarding jurisdiction was just that. Neither party to these proceedings acted under the assumption that plaintiffs forfeiture was still effective. Rather, all considered that he was subject to disciplinary charges, and any return to work or reinstatement would await disposition of those charges. The issue of \u201cjurisdiction\u201d was not raised until the hearing had commenced and two actions in lieu of prerogative writs had been tried and determined adverse to plaintiff. It was plaintiff who assumed he could return to work without more. The Borough acted in the same manner and pressed forward with the charges, even inquiring of the Police Training Commission regarding plaintiffs return to employment. The parties\u2019 actions themselves belie any suggestion that the Borough lacked jurisdiction to proceed on its charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">As to the issues raised by Point II, we have carefully considered the record and conclude plaintiffs arguments in this regard are without merit. We affirm substantially for the reasons set forth in Judge Feinberg\u2019s opinion. <em>See Grubb, supra, </em>331 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 404-13, 751 A.2d 1119.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">The issue raised in Point III is likewise without merit. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-118 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>The governing body of any municipality, by ordinance, may create and establish, as an executive and enforcement function of municipal government, a police force, whether as a department or as a division, bureau or other agency thereof, and provide for the maintenance, regulation and control thereof. Any such ordinance shall, in a manner consistent with the form of government adopted by the municipality and with general law, provide for a line of authority relating to the police function and for the adoption and promulgation by the appropriate authority of rules and regulations for the government of the force and for the discipline of its members.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7M\">We have held that the statute permits the municipality\u2019s chief law enforcement officer to use his or her expertise to prepare the rules \u201cas long as the power of final approval, which includes the implied power to reject and revise, is reserved to an appropriate civilian authority.\u201d <em>Hartmann v. Police Dep\u2019t of the Village of Ridgewood, </em>258 <em>N.J.Super. </em>32, 38, 609 A.2d 61 (App.Div.1992). This is precisely the procedure utilized by the Borough.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Regarding the adoption and promulgation of rules and regulations of the Borough\u2019s police department, Ordinance 1998-7, Section 2-19.6a, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-6\">The Borough Council shall have the power, by resolution, to adopt such rules and regulations for the government and discipline of the Police Department as are not inconsistent with New Jersey law or this section. The Chief of Police shall have the power to adopt such additional rules, regulations, procedures and orders as shall be deemed necessary by him to promote the efficiency of the Department. Any such rule, regulation, procedure or order of the Chief of Police shall be sent immediately to the Borough Administrator and to the Borough Council, and they may be modified or annulled by resolution or motion of the Borough Council.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">Thus, in accordance with our holding in <em>Hartmann, </em>the Borough\u2019s ordinance properly reserved to the civilian administrator and council the power of final approval over any regulations adopted by the police chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">Furthermore, as the Borough notes, the existence and content of these regulations were not unknown to plaintiff. The agreement between the Borough and the Policeman\u2019s Benevolent Association recognized that the department\u2019s regulations were \u201cin full force and effect ... and are operative as to the employees\u201d unless contravened by specific provisions in the agreement. On December 1, 1989, plaintiff signed an acknowledgment that he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>received \u201cthe Rules &amp; Regulations of the Hightstown Police Department as approved by Borough Council during May 1989.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Moreover, we have consistently held that \u201ca finding of misconduct by a police officer need not be predicated on the violation of any particular department rule or regulation.\u201d <em>In re Phillips, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>567, 576, 569 A.2d 807 (1990) (quoting <em>In re Emmons, </em>63 <em>N.J.Super. </em>136, 140, 164 A.2d 184 (App.Div.1960)); <em>see also Marjarum v. Township of Hamilton, </em>336 <em>N.J.Super. </em>85, 99, 763 A.2d 796 (App.Div.2000); <em>Hartmann, supra, </em>258 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 39-40, 609 A.2d 61. The Borough\u2019s actions were predicated on its contention that plaintiff had engaged in the purchase and sale of illicit substances, an offense contrary to the principles of law enforcement that plaintiff was hired to uphold. Based on these allegations, the Borough was entitled to discipline plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">Plaintiffs complaint in Point IV that the suspension and removal violated <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-147 is without merit. Plaintiff cites out-of-context the language in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-147, which states an officer may be removed or suspended \u201conly upon a written complaint setting forth the charge or charges----\u201d He argues that this procedure must be followed prior to suspension or termination and that his procedural due process rights were violated because he was deprived of his property interest in his job when he was suspended and then terminated pursuant to resolution, with no hearing and prior to the filing of a written complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">Plaintiff was afforded complete procedural due process prior to his termination. Contrary to plaintiffs assertion that he was terminated by resolution prior to the filing of the complaint and with no hearing, in fact, he was terminated pursuant to the forfeiture statute after he was afforded a full hearing at his criminal trial. The Borough\u2019s resolution merely acknowledged what the forfeiture statute already had accomplished and directed that the Borough\u2019s records be made consistent with that outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">Furthermore, the statute did not require the filing of a written complaint until disposition of the criminal investigation. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number><em>Grubb, supra, </em>331 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 407, 751 A.2d 1119. Plaintiffs suspension notice of March 29, 1995, notified him that he was suspended in accordance with the Department\u2019s emergency suspension provision, section 7:3.3, which provides that no officer may be suspended or suffer any loss in benefits until after he has been found guilty at a departmental hearing, \u201cexcept in cases of a severe nature, when the Chief of Police deems the suspension of the member of immediate necessity for the safety of the public or the welfare of the department.\u201d The suspension notice specified that it was based on the existence of pending criminal charges. That is more than sufficient to meet the objective of the statute and protect the officer\u2019s due process concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Plaintiff also asserts that his suspension violated the rules and regulations because section 7:4.3 requires that complaints forwarded by the prosecutor\u2019s office should be \u201cinvestigated immediately.\u201d Specifically, section 7:4.3 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-6\">Complaints forwarded to this Department from the Prosecutor\u2019s Office, Federal Bureau of Investigation, State and Federal Attorney General\u2019s Office, Sheriff\u2019s Office, etc., will be investigated immediately by the bureau commander or his designee by order of the Chief of Police____The investigator shall pursue the investigation as rapidly as possible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">Contrary to plaintiffs interpretation of section 7:4.3, the provisions of section 7:4.4 make it clear that the mandatory aspects of section 7:4.3 do not apply where criminal allegations are involved. Section 7:4.4(D) describes the investigation process, and specifically provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-10\">Occasionally, when a case indicates possible criminal action against an employee, the Chief of Police will be notified immediately and there is no need to proceed further. If a decision is made to proceed criminally, the detective division shall be requested to initiate a criminal investigation. This will guarantee due process of law and employee constitutional rights. If an investigation is initiated where there is suspicion of criminal activity, employee constitutional rights could be compromised, therefore, he shall be afforded all rights under the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-11\">Section 7:4.3 applies to non-criminal complaints against an officer that are forwarded from another law enforcement agency. Under section 7:4.4, all internal investigation should cease if there is a possibility of criminal charges. Such a procedure avoids duplica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>tion of efforts, which not only protects plaintiff, but the interests of the Borough and the prosecuting agency as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Finally, we conclude that the credible evidence before both , the hearing officer and Judge Feinberg at the trial <em>de novo </em>in the Law Division well supported the result. Both the hearing officer and Judge Feinberg made adequate and appropriate findings both as to the credibility of the witnesses and the sufficiency of the evidence. We reach a similar result regarding the evidential rulings made and affirm substantially for the reasons set forth in Judge Feinberg comprehensive oral opinion of April 20, 2001. The ultimate finding that plaintiff, a police officer, was engaged in criminal activity was well supported by the record. We perceive of no other appropriate remedy than termination and reject any suggestion by plaintiff that the penalty was too harsh.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b372-7\"> Although plaintiff noted that it was appealing from the order of April 28, 2000, memorializing this decision, plaintiff's brief fails to include any argument addressing this issue. We, therefore, deem it to be abandoned and decline to address it. <em>See Liebling v. Garden State Indem., </em>337 <em>N.J.Super. </em>447, 465-66, 767 A.2d 515 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>169 <em>N.J. </em>606, 782 A.2d 424 (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b373-8\"> Although references were made regarding health and other benefits while on suspension, plaintiff made no specific claim for benefits either before the hearing officer or in the Law Division.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
