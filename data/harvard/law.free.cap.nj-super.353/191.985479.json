Defendant admitted liability, and the case was tried on damages only.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">A jury returned a verdict in defendant\u2019s favor, finding that plaintiff had not overcome the verbal threshold for the award of damages in an automobile negligence personal injury case. See <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6A-8a. On appeal, we concluded that the trial court had committed reversible error by admitting into evidence a videotape depicting a car-crash dummy in a car that was struck at five miles per hour. <em>Suanez v. Egeland, </em>330 <em>N.J.Super. </em>190, 749 A.2d 372 (App.Div.2000). Accordingly, we remanded the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">At the second damages trial, defendant heavily relied upon the opinion of Lawrence Thibault, an expert in \u201cbio-mechanics\u201d and \u201cbio-mechanical engineering,\u201d that the \u201cdelta-V\u201d (change in velocity) as a result of the collision between defendant\u2019s car and the car in which plaintiff was riding \u201cwas approximately five miles per hour or less,\u201d and that plaintiff\u2019s herniated lumbar disc could not have been caused by such a low-impact accident. Before trial, plaintiff asked the court to exclude Thibault\u2019s proposed expert opinion on the ground that it has no scientific basis. The trial court denied the request. At the beginning of defendant\u2019s case, plaintiff asked the court to conduct an evidentiary hearing regarding the scientific basis of Thibault\u2019s proposed expert opinion testimony, but the court concluded, based primarily on dictum in an unreported opinion of this court, that Thibault\u2019s proposed opinion testimony was admissible. Thibault then proceeded to testify before the jury that the collision between defendant\u2019s car and the car in which plaintiff was riding did not involve sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>force to have caused plaintiffs herniated disc. The jury subsequently returned a verdict in defendant\u2019s favor, finding that plaintiff had not overcome the verbal threshold.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">On appeal, plaintiffs primary argument is that defendant failed to establish the requisite scientific basis for Thibault\u2019s purported expert opinion that the subject automobile accident could not possibly have caused her herniated disc.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Preliminarily, we note that the trial court should have conducted a preliminary hearing under <em>Rule </em>104 concerning the admissibility of Thibault\u2019s proposed bio-mechanical expert opinion testimony.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See <em>State v. Harvey, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>117, 167, 699 A.2d 596 (1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 <em>U.S. </em>1085, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>811, 145 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d 683 (2000); <em>Vassallo v. American Coding &amp; Marking Ink Co., </em>345 <em>N.J.Super. </em>207, 217-18, 784 A.2d 734 (App.Div.2001). Such a hearing would have afforded the parties and the court an opportunity to explore fully the purported scientific bases of Thibault\u2019s opinions outside the presence of the jury. However, we are satisfied that the parties had an adequate opportunity to present evidence relevant to this issue at trial and that a remand for a <em>Rule </em>104 hearing would not produce any significant additional evidence regarding the scientific basis of Thibault\u2019s expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">In New Jersey, scientific evidence is admissible in a civil case if \u201cit derives from a reliable methodology supported by some expert consensus.\u201d <em>Harvey, supra, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>at 168, 699 A.2d 596 (citing <em>Landrigan v. Celotex Corp., </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>404, 417, 605 A.2d 1079 (1992); <em>Rubanick v. Witco Chem. Corp., </em>125 <em>N.J. </em>421, 449, 593 A.2d 733 (1991)). There are three ways a party offering the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>results of scientific evidence can demonstrate its reliability: \u201c(1) the testimony of knowledgeable experts; (2) authoritative scientific literature; and (8) persuasive judicial decisions.\u201d <em>Windmere, Inc. v. International Ins. Co., </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>373, 379, 522 A.2d 405 (1987); <em>see also Rubanick, supra, </em>125 <em>N.J. </em>at 432, 593 A.2d 733. A party offering novel scientific evidence bears the burden of demonstrating its reliability. <em>Harvey, supra, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>at 167, 699 A.2d 596.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Defendant failed to establish the required foundation of reliability for Thibault\u2019s opinion in any of these ways. Thibault is not a physician or medical researcher. His education and training are in the fields of physics and mechanical engineering, with only basic training in anatomy, physiology and pathology. Moreover, Thibault has not himself conducted or observed tests of low-impact collisions on humans. His knowledge of this subject is derived solely from literature in the field. Consequently, the reliability of Thibault\u2019s opinion turns on whether that literature provides a reliable scientific foundation for the conclusion that a low-impact automobile accident cannot cause a herniated disc.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Defendant did not introduce into evidence any of the scientific literature upon which Thibault relied. Consequently, the only information in the trial record concerning the content of that literature is Thibault\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">Thibault described that literature only in very broad and general terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-8\">Q. [I]f you could just give us an example or run through the studies that you may have relied upon in formulating that chart?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-9\">A. Well, I guess the earliest work was done by Brinkman (phonetic) in 1961. Isolated spinal segments were taken from fresh cadavers, put in a compression machine where you can actually measure the forces to compress until the forces got to a high enough level where they actually start to cause failure of the tissue. That was done over a broad range of age groups in terms of fresh cadaveric material. And those numbers were added to over the next 30 or 40 years by a lot of other investigators.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-10\">Crash tests have been performed where we can\u2019t put instruments inside humans, human volunteers and let us measure those forces so we use dummies. And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>there\u2019s been about 40 years of development of high tech dummies which contain all the instrumentation we need.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-6\">And then, I guess the last is the human volunteer exposure studies that have been done, where mainly scientists like myself, although I wasn\u2019t involved in this study, have volunteered. A lot of M.D.\u2019s and Ph.D.\u2019s and graduate students that were asked to volunteer. In all, there were 646 human volunteers in a car subjected to rear end impacts where the Delta Vs went to as high as 11 miles per hour____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-7\">These were published in journals throughout the world. The studies were done in 15 different institutions in seven different countries. And that\u2019s kind of, you know, the ultimate human volunteer validation, if you will, or verification that, coupling the cadaver work, where you measure the material properties, to the dummy tests where you can put instrumentations inside at the right anatomic locations, to the ultimate simulation, which is to have the human volunteer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-8\">No injuries, other than complaints of stiff necks at the high end, typically developing the date after, and treating basically with ibuprofen, spontaneously resolve over 72 hours____There\u2019s never been reported a disk injury of any kind in 646 studies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-11\">On cross-examination, plaintiffs counsel attempted to get Thibault to identify specific scientific literature that supports his conclusion that the subject accident could not possibly have caused a herniated lumbar disc, but the only specific tests to which Thibault referred involved either cadavers or military personnel under controlled testing conditions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-12\">Q. Where were these studies reported? Lumbar studies?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-13\">A. I didn\u2019t bring that voluminous body of literature with me. There are probably 100 articles.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-14\">Q. Okay. Name one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-15\">A. \u201cSpine,\u201d Brinkman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-16\">Q. What date?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-17\">A.1961,1 stated already.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-18\">Q. That\u2019s the one with the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-19\">A. There\u2019s\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-20\">Q. \u2014dead people that you mentioned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-21\">A. Dead. Dead, yes. Cadavers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-22\">Q. Okay. So that\u2019s one study. Name another study.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-23\">A. Brinkman, '64.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-24\">Q. Okay. What was the subject?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>A. Weiss, '64. Again, taking motion segments, looking at the material properties of the vertebral bodies, the disks, the elastic lamina, the nucleus pulposus, the posterior and anterior ligaments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-5\">Q. Okay. On dead people, am I correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-6\">A. Obviously. We don\u2019t do that on living human beings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-7\">Q. Tell me any journals besides that one; you just named that one. Name other ones.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-8\">A. Well, there\u2019s an entire book that was published by the Navy where they used Navy volunteers riding on sleds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-9\">The data were compared to pilots who ejected and\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-10\">[U]p to Mach two, where they got compressive loading conditions pulling 25 Gs when they fire the rocket motor after they\u2019ve blown the canopy, and they\u2019ve gotten fractured vertebral bodies. That data was con-elated with the sled testing that was done in Mishue (phonetic). That\u2019s been published in Air Guard, Aircoby (phonetic), SAE (phonetic). A whole text was compiled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-11\">Q. Okay. Let\u2019s \u2014 we\u2019ll go on that there one. That was the United States Navy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-12\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-13\">Q. I assume that was sailors?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-14\">A. I don\u2019t know; I assume they were sailors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-15\">Q. Would it be true that people who are in the military have to have certain physical capacity to be in the military?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-16\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-17\">Q. Are most sailors younger than the average population of the United States? That be fair to say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-18\">A. I would assume that admirals probably retire before 65, and the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-19\">A. and the young kids are 18.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-20\">Q. Okay, but the average. There\u2019s not that many admirals in the United States Navy, am I correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-21\">A. I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-22\">Q. You don\u2019t know?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-23\">A. I\u2019m not an authority on the hierarchy of the U.S. Navy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-24\">Q. You think there\u2019s maybe a little more petty officers in the United States Navy than admirals?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-25\">A. Probably.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>Q. Okay. Now, how many admirals were engaged in the tests?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-6\">A. I have no idea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-7\">Q. Okay. So will you agree with me that perhaps that test was not equivalent to Mrs. Suanez because of age, health?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-8\">A. Right. I would say that they would probably be skewed----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-9\">Q. Now that was a sled test?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-10\">A. Those were sled tests. What they do is they put the individual lying rearward. If you could imagine rotating the seat this way and then pushing as if it\u2019s a push test.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-11\">Q. Now, do those subjects in the Navy test, did they know they were being tested or was that a trick by the Navy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-12\">A. No, they knew they were being tested.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-13\">Q. So would it be fair to say if you know you were going to get an impact, you might brace for it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-14\">A. Yes, that\u2019s the worst thing you could do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-15\">Q. Is it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-16\">A. Yeah, the relaxed condition, not knowing it\u2019s coming, doesn\u2019t allow you to contract your muscles and already pre-tense them up so that you can\u2019t take a lot more tolerance beyond a certain point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-17\">Q. So a football player that gets in his position shouldn\u2019t brace himself when he gets hit from the other, from the defender in a football game?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-18\">A. I don\u2019t know what that has to do with anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-19\">Q. Okay. So it\u2019s not good to actually brace yourself if you\u2019re going to get in an accident?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-20\">A. No, I\u2019m saying that it\u2019s \u2014 you, your whole body stiffens when you brace yourself. So you\u2019re in a more vulnerable position than if you\u2019re completely relaxed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-21\">Q. [T]he studies. You mentioned the United States Navy. You mentioned the ones in the early '60s. What other ones specifically for lumbar?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-22\">A. Well, the Ah- Force did an equivalent set. The Navy also, in Pennsylvania at Warminster, built an ejection tower where they had human volunteers sit in an ejection seat. But rather than just blowing them up and letter their parachute open since they were at ground level, they blew them up a very long rail where they were stopped eventually at the top of the rail. The Air Force at Wright Patterson in Columbus, Ohio has done a lot of vertical ejection. I\u2019ve done work with the Army at Fort Rucker in Alabama, where we\u2019re trying to protect helicopter crews from flat belly emergency crash landings. And so the idea was to develop crushable seats so that they would minimize any potential for pelvic or low back trauma. That literature again\u2019s available at Air Guard, Aircoby, SAE, Triple AM (phonetic).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>When plaintiffs counsel pressed Thibault concerning the existence of any scientific literature that would support his opinion concerning the effect of a rear-end automobile collision upon middle-aged women with pre-existing degenerative conditions, Thibault responded with only general and vague references to various articles published in journals in \u201cseven different countries\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-5\">Q. But those Air Force and Army tests weren\u2019t done with middle aged women, am I correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-6\">A. No. The only studies that were done in that regard I\u2019ve already cited. And they varied in age from 19 to 61, both men and women. And these are worldwide.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-7\">Q. Okay. You just got to the point. That\u2019s the only study that you\u2019re aware of?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-8\">A. Yeah, for living human volunteers. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-9\">Q. Okay. And\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-10\">A. Of that age group.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-11\">Q. Okay. And where is that report published?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-12\">A. Well, I have the references here. They\u2019re in Canadian Medical Journal, SAE, Accident Reconstruction Journal of Medicine, Aircoby, SAE Toptech (phonetic), Journal of Forensic Science, Journal of Oral Medicine____Accident Analysis and Prevention. That\u2019s the Triple AM Journal, more Aircoby and SAE papers, another set in Southwestern Association in Falkland, the New Zealand Journal, University of Texas Engineering Journal. There\u2019s 15 different institutions with a lot of different journals in seven different countries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-14\">Q. And how many were middle aged women in the tests?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-15\">A. I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-16\">Q. Okay. Is there any indication in your studies that you\u2019re relying upon whether these people had pre-existing degenerative changes in their lumbar spine?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-17\">A. I would have to read every journal article. No. I mean, I\u2019m sure they examined them all.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-18\">These lengthy excerpts from Thibault\u2019s testimony show that he did not identify any scholarly literature which shows the reliability of his purported expert opinion that the subject automobile accident could not possibly have caused plaintiff to suffer a herniated lumbar disc. The only specific scientific tests to which Thibault referred were performed either upon cadavers or upon military personnel under controlled conditions quite dissimilar from an automobile accident. Moreover, there is no indication <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>that the persons who performed the tests or others in the scientific community have concluded that they provide a reliable foundation for drawing any conclusions concerning the physiological effects of a low-impact automobile accident upon a middle-aged woman. Thibault\u2019s further reliance upon unidentified articles by unidentified authors in various international journals did not provide any discernable foundation in scholarly literature for his opinion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>Suanez, supra, </em>330 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 194, 749 A.2d 372. A court should not admit a purported scientific opinion \u201cthat is connected to existing data only by the <em>ipse dixit </em>of the expert.\u201d <em>General Elec. Co. v. Joiner, 522 U.S. </em>136, 146, 118 <em>S.Ct. 512, </em>519, 139 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d 508, 519 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Defendant also failed to show the reliability of the kind of purported expert opinions expressed by Thibault by the third recognized method, \u2014 \u201cpersuasive judicial decisions.\u201d <em>Windmere, supra, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>at 379, 522 A.2d 405. To the contrary, the decisions brought to our attention have concluded that there is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>reliable scientific foundation in bio-mechanical studies for an expert opinion that a low-impact automobile accident cannot cause a herniated lumbar disc or other serious injury. <em>See, e.g., Smelser v.

June 8, 2000).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">The only decision cited by defendant that seemingly approved the form of expert opinion testimony presented by Thibault is this court\u2019s unreported decision in <em>Barbour v. Laurel Coffee Co., </em>A-1882-96T1 (Jan. 22, 1998). However, we held in <em>Barbour </em>that Thibault \u201cwas not competent to testify regarding wear and tear of discs,\u201d and that \u201c[h]is testimony at times exceeded the scope of his expertise and experience and impermissibly ventured into the world of medicine.\u201d (slip op. at 7). The observation upon which defendant relies \u2014 that \u201cDr. Thibault was surely qualified to testify as an expert regarding whether a low-impact collision, such as the one in this case, could cause a severe neck injury, such as the herniated disc that plaintiff suffered\u201d (slip op. at 6) \u2014 was not essential to our decision and therefore was dictum. Most importantly, the plaintiff in <em>Barbour </em>did not object at trial to Thibault\u2019s testimony and thus our comments were not grounded on an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>evidentiary record concerning the scientific foundation of his opinions. Consequently, <em>Barbour </em>does not qualify as a \u201cpersuasive judicial decision\u201d which supports the conclusion that the expert opinion Thibault expressed in this case was based on scientific knowledge that is considered to be reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">In sum, defendant failed to establish a reliable scientific foundation for Thibault\u2019s purported expert opinion on the basis of Thibault\u2019s own research work, authoritative scientific literature or persuasive judicial decisions. Moreover, Thibault\u2019s testimony played such a critical role in the defense of this action that its erroneous admission cannot be found to have been harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">Accordingly, the judgment in defendant\u2019s favor is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial on damages.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b225-9\"> Although defendant presented similar expert opinion testimony in the first damages trial, plaintiff did not contest its admissibility and the trial court did not make any ruling on the issue. Thus, the mere fact that such testimony was presented without objection at the first trial has no binding effect under the law of the case doctrine or principles of collateral estoppel. <em>See Slowinski v. Valley Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>264 <em>N.J.Super. </em>172, 181-83, 624 A.2d 85 (App.Div.1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b231-7\"> To assure ourselves that we had a complete record of any available scientific materials that might support the expert opinion testimony Thibault gave at trial, we inquired at oral argument whether defendant could identify any specific scholarly literature supporting that opinion which Thibault had failed to mention at trial. In response, defendant submitted a letter from Thibault, dated March 25, 2002, which states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-8\">[I]t is necessary to inform you that such a task is rather extensive, and is beyond the scope of the services provided by Biomechanics, Inc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-9\">Attached please find the following bibliography that serves as a list of selected literature that has been relied upon in reaching my opinions in this matter.

To this end, I have also attached a budget representing a minimum and an estimated maximum to perform such services, provided by a research organization that relies on an extensive in house collection of literature, as well as the resources available at Stanford University and the University of California at Berkeley.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-11\">Based on this response, it is clear that defendant is not in a position to submit any additional materials that could demonstrate a scientific foundation for Thibault's purported expert opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b232-6\"> The unreported opinions in <em>Salerno, Brock, Yaremchak </em>and <em>Mayse </em>are not cited as legal precedent but rather as additional evidence of defendant's failure to demonstrate the reliability of the purported expert opinion expressed by Thibault by means of persuasive judicial decisions. See <em>R. </em>1:36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
