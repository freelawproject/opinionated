Our holding invalidates <em>N.J.AC. </em>11:20-2.17, as amended effective August 7, 1998, and we do not address how the Board may make up any \u201cshortfall\u201d with respect to any second-tier assessment actually imposed thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">The Board was established by the Individual Health Insurance Reform Act, <em>N.J.SA </em>17B:27A-2 to -16.5 (\u201cthe Act\u201d), to oversee and regulate a program designed to make individual health care coverage available and affordable for those not in a group.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See, generally, In the Matter of Individual Health Coverage Program, </em>302 <em>N.J.Super. </em>360, 363-66, 695 A.2d 371 (App.Div.1997); <em>Health Maintenance Org. of N.J. v. Whitman, </em>72 F.3d 1123, 1124-26 (3d Cir.1995). It does so by assessing those health insurance carriers that do not meet their requirements of enrollment and do not show a good faith effort to do so. CIGNA challenges the amended regulations \u201cas an unlawful act of the Individual Health Coverage Program.\u201d Specifically, it contends that, because the program is funded only by assessments against the \u201chealth insurers members\u201d and \u201cno public funds are used in the mission or administration of the IHC Program, ... the IHC Program is not a state agency and does not possess the power to promulgate the regulations at issue or to adjudicate contested cases.\u201d It further challenges the \u201cgood faith marketing precondition to obtaining a statutory pro rata exemption for the obligation of loss sharing\u201d and the \u201csecond-tier assessment\u201d of carriers which is designed \u201cto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>redistribute among non-exempt insurers the losses not shared by exempt and pro rata exempt insurers.\u201d CIGNA argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-6\">In the re-adoption with amendments at issue, the IHC Program added these unlawful procedures and its contested case procedures ,.. Each of these provisions exceed the IHC Program\u2019s statutory authority and conflicts with the IHC Act. Finally, the IHC Program failed to follow the specific procedures set forth in the IHC act for the taking of actions. Accordingly the IHC Program\u2019s actions are invalid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-7\">[Footnote omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">CIGNA therefore asks that the \u201creadoption should be declared null and void, the IHC Program should be directed to readjudicate the loss sharing program for every year since 1993 without the use of the <em>ultra vires </em>procedures, and the IHC Program should be directed to adopt its lawful procedures as a Plan of Operation pursuant to the IHC Act.\u201d CIGNA tells us that \u201cno hardship will result from a readjudieation because the IHC has yet to finally adjudicate the losses for any year since 1992.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">The Board emphasizes that the legislation gave it the power to adopt regulations which it claims were drafted to \u201cfurther and maximize the Legislature\u2019s intent in enacting the IHC Act\u2014 namely, to increase the availability of health-insurance coverage in the individual market across as wide a spectrum of that market as possible,\u201d that the regulations are not arbitrary and capricious, that the good faith marketing requirement provides adequate standards for compliance and that there is no basis to invalidate the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-11\">The IHCP was created pursuant to the Act, adopted in 1992, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>17B:27A-10(a), as part of a comprehensive overhaul of New Jersey\u2019s individual and small-employer health insurance market places. The main purpose of the Act \u201c \u201cwas to ensure that all [New Jersey] citizens would receive the benefits of individual health care coverage.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Individual Health Coverage Program, supra, </em>302 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 363, 695 A.2d 371 (App.Div.1997), quoting <em>Health Maint. Org. of N.J., Inc. v. Whitman, supra, </em>72 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number><em>F.3d </em>at 1124-26. The Legislature found that health insurance insurers were reluctant to offer health insurance on an individual basis or \u201cnon-group basis\u201d because of the high risks involved. <em>Health Maint. Org., supra, </em>72 <em>F.</em>3d at 1126. The result was that individual health insurance was prohibitively expensive for individual consumers and unprofitable for the insurance company. <em>Ibid. </em>The goal of the Act, therefore, was to increase the availability of individual health care coverage, spread the cost of insuring higher-risk individuals among New Jersey\u2019s entire insurance industry, reduce the cost of individual health care coverage, and increase the profitability of the individual health care market. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">As the Third Circuit explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-6\">The central component of the Reform Act is the requirement that all carriers in the state pay an \u201cassessment\u201d that is used to defray financial losses incurred by those companies that provide a disproportionate share of the \u201chigher-risk\u201d individual health insurance coverage in the state____Through the assessment, the Reform Act attempts to spread the cost of insuring higher-risk individuals among New Jersey\u2019s entire insurance industry in order to reduce the cost to the individual while increasing the profitability of insuring those individuals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-9\">New Jersey carriers are required to \u201cpay or play\u201d with respect to the individual health insurance market. For each carrier, the Board establishes a target goal of individual policies, or more specifically \u201cnon-group\u201d policies, that the carrier must issue in a calendar year, if it wishes to obtain an exemption from the assessment. In general, a carrier\u2019s target number of non-group policies for the exemption is calculated based on the carrier\u2019s proportion of the overall state-wide health coverage market, see [JV./.&amp;A] 17B:27A-12(d)(3).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-10\">The State pools the money collected pursuant to the annual assessment and uses it to reimburse carriers who suffer losses in the individual insurance market during the calendar year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-11\"><em>[In Re Individual Health Coverage, supra, </em>302 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 364, 695 A.2d 371, quoting <em>Health Maint.

Within ninety days after the appointment of the initial Board members, the Board was required to submit to the Commissioner \u201ca plan of operation <em>and thereafter, </em>any amendments to the plan necessary or suitable to assure the fair, reasonable, and equitable administration of the [IHCP].\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17B:27A-10(d)(emphasis added). The Commissioner was granted authority to disapprove the plan of operation if \u201cit [was] not suitable to assure the fair, reasonable, and equitable administration of the [IHCP]\u201d and did \u201cnot provide for the sharing of program losses on an equitable and proportionate basis in accordance with\u201d the Act. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17B:27A-10(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">According to the Act, the Board is required to establish procedures for (1) \u201cthe handling and accounting of [IHCP] assets\u201d and to prepare an annual fiscal report to the Commissioner; (2) the collection of assessments from IHCP \u201cmembers\u201d; (3) the approval of \u201ccoverage, benefit levels and contract forms\u201d; (4) the imposition of an \u201cinterest penalty for late payment of an assessment\u201d, and (5) \u201cany additional matters at the discretion of the board.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17B:27A-10(f).

This regulation was also in effect when <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17B:27A was amended in 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">Relevant sections of the Act were amended in 1997. <em>L. </em>1997, c. 146. Therein, the Legislature (1) changed the assessment cycle to a \u201ctwo year calculation period\u201d beginning on January 1, 1997, (2) removed the provisions concerning the \u201cphase in\u201d compliance and the 35% limit on any carrier\u2019s share of IHCP losses, and (3) deleted the relevant provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17B:27A-12(d)(6) and 17B:27A-12(e) regarding those subjects.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">Thereafter, in June 1998, the Board proposed to re-adopt and amend the regulations, which as originally adopted were set to expire in August 1998. 30 <em>N.J.R. </em>2581-2605 (July 20, 1998). On July 10, 1998, the Board held a hearing on the proposal. Appellants submitted a written objection challenging the Board\u2019s status as a state agency and asserting \u201c[t]he IHC Program lacks the rule-making authority to adjudicate contested cases.\u201d Appellants also challenged the Board\u2019s proposed procedures governing the assessment of carriers for reimbursable losses and the grant or denial of pro rata exemptions, including the Board\u2019s requirement that members submit reports concerning their good-faith marketing efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">On August 4, 1998 (filed August 7, 1998), the Board re-adopted the regulations with amendments. 30 <em>N.J.R. </em>3289.

Specifically, appellants argue that the Board cannot exercise the powers of a state agency because it has broad proprietary powers of a private insurance company, including the powers to enter into contracts, and to hire employees and consultants, to sue and to be sued, to borrow money independently of the State, and have those debts carried on the books of the loaning carriers. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17B:27A-11. Appellants also emphasize that the IHCP is funded exclusively by the assessment of its carrier members and not from state funds. Appellants further claim that the Board is not a state agency as defined by the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d) in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B 2(a), because the Legislature did not create it in one of the executive departments of State government and because the Legislature did not give it specific administrative rule-making authority or the authority to adjudicate contested cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">We reject the contention that the Legislature created the IHCP as a private association without rule making or adjudicatory powers. Rather, as it had done in analogous circumstances with respect to automobile insurers, the Legislature adopted the IHCP as a mandatory scheme, to govern the conduct of its carrier members in light of public concern about the availability and cost of coverage. Both the automobile and health insurance industries in New Jersey have always been very highly regulated, and, as the Supreme Court stated in <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number><em>of N.J., </em>124 <em>N.J. </em>32, 50, 590 A.2d 191 (1991), \u201ca participant in a highly regulated industry must anticipate that its profit levels can be capped or even reduced by changes in government regulation.\u201d In fact, in concluding that the \u201c \u2018pay or play\u2019 concept with respect to the individual health benefits insurance market built into the statute is a legitimate device to ensure that health insurance coverage is made available to individual residents of this state who are unable to obtain group or employer-based health insurance coverage,\u201d <em>In re Indiv. Health Coverage, supra, </em>302 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 369, 695 A.2d 371, Judge Kimmelman cited <em>In re American Reliance Ins.

While four of the IHCP Board members are selected by IHCP member carriers and represent the industry, the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance must approve the selection, and a majority of the Board is composed of the Commissioner, or her designee, and four public members chosen by the Governor, with the advice and consent of the Senate. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17B:27A-10(b).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>Accordingly, the Board was created as a public entity administered by representatives of the public to assure that the public interest is best served<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>Both the case law relating to control of an entity and the legislative history of the IHCP require us to reject appellants\u2019 claims that the Board was not created as a state agency for rule making purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">When the Act was first enacted in 1992, the Legislature expressly provided that \u201c[t]he board shall, pursuant to the provision of the \u2018Administrative Procedure Act,\u2019 P.L.1968, c. 410 (C.52:14B 1 et seq.) promulgate rules and regulations necessary to effectuate the provisions of sections 1 through 15, inclusive of this act.\u201d <em>L. </em>1992, c. 161, \u00a7 16. Although the following year the Legislature repealed this particular provision, <em>L. </em>1993, c. 164, \u00a7 12, it continued the Board\u2019s rule making authority by inserting <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17B:27A-16.1(h) which expressly gave the Commissioner rule making power and authority to take any \u201caction required or authorized by\u201d the Act, and by adopting <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17B:27A-16.1(g) which provides that \u201c[njothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the board from adopting any action pursuant to the provisions of the \u2018Administrative Procedure Act\u2019----\u201d <em>L. </em>1993, c. 164, \u00a7 8(g). In fact, <em>N.J.S.A </em>17B:27A-16.1(a) expressly contemplates rule making authority of the type necessary to establish, readopt and amend regulations to provide for the operation of the IHCP:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-9\">a. For the purposes of this section, \u201caction\u201d includes, but is not limited to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-10\">(1) the establishment and modification of health benefits plans;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-11\">(2) procedures and standards for the: (a) assessment of members and the apportionment thereof; (b) filing of policy forms; (c) making of rate filings; (d) evaluation of material submitted by carriers with respect to loss ratios; and (e) establishment of refunds to policy or contract holders; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-12\">(3) the promulgation or modification of policy forms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-13\">\u201cAction\u201d shall not include the hearing and resolution of contested cases, personnel matters and applications for withdrawal or exemptions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-14\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>17B:27A-16.1(a).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-15\">Moreover, <em>N.J.S.A </em>17B:27A-16.1(e) expressly refers to the Board\u2019s rule making power:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-16\">The board may adopt the intended action immediately following the expiration of the public comment period provided in subsection d. of this section, or the hearing provided for in subsection c. whichever date is later. The final action adopted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>the board shall be submitted for publication in the New Jersey Register to the Office of Administrative Law, and shall be effective on the date of the submission or such later date as the board may establish.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Furthermore, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17B:27A-16.1(f) specifically incorporates the provisions relating to the rule making power of administrative agencies by requiring the Board to file its \u201cactions\u201d with the Office of Administrative Law (\u201cOAL\u201d), pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B 5 which deals with rule making. In addition, the 1997 amendment to <em>N.J.S.A </em>17B:27A-12(d)(l) specifically refers to \u201cregulations adopted by the board\u201d for determining the number of non-group life years that a carrier must cover in order to receive an exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">The Legislature\u2019s specific reference to the Board\u2019s power to adopt regulations, and its specific reference to the rule making authority of the Board, leaves no doubt that rule making was contemplated by the IHCP Board similar to any state agency. Nevertheless, appellants claim that the Board cannot be a state agency because the Legislature, instead of requiring complete compliance with the APA and its rule making provisions, allowed the Board to utilize the independent procedure as developed in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17B:27A-16.1.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">An agency may enforce a statutory provision without promulgating a rule pursuant to the provisions of the APA, if there is an adequate statutory standard for the guidance of the administrative agency. <em>Airwork Serv. Div. v. Dir., Div. of Taxation, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>290, 300-01, 478 A.2d 729 (1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>471 <em>U.S. </em>1127, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>2662, 86 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>278 (1985). In such a case, the policy will not be held invalid for failure to meet rule making procedural requirements. <em>Id. </em>at 301, 478 A.2d 729. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17B:27A-16.1 is clearly an expedited rule making provision that expressly allows the Board to follow a rule making procedure alternative to the APA. Moreover, we have been presented with no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>evidence that the Legislature has ever taken action to indicate its disagreement with the Board\u2019s interpretation of the Act by voiding either a regulation adopted by the Board or its power to adopt it. This is significant because legislative inaction constitutes tacit approval of agency action, particularly when the Legislature makes other amendments to the same Act, as it did in 1997, without invalidating the administrative interpretation. <em>Body-Rite Repair Co. v. Dir., Div. of Taxation, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>540, 545-16, 446 A.2d 515 (1982). Here, the Legislature had substantial time in which to declare that the Board does not have the status of a state agency or the jurisdiction to exercise rule making power.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Appellants next claim that the Board is not a state agency because it was not established \u201cin\u201d a specific department of the Executive. The Legislature\u2019s intent was to place the Board \u201cin, but not of\u2019 the Department of Banking and Insurance. <em>See N.J Const. </em>art.

Moreover, we treated the Board like any other agency by applying the general standard of review for administrative agencies, and finding both that the Board\u2019s conclusions were \u201csupported by the undisputed facts,\u201d and not \u201carbitrary, capricious or unreasonable,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>and that the Board\u2019s assessment in that case \u201cdid not violate the legislative policy expressed in the IHC Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 370, 695 A.2d 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">Appellants contend that the Board\u2019s re-adoption of its regulations is invalid because it failed to follow the legislatively-mandated procedures for adopting rules and regulations pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A </em>17B:27A-16.1 and the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52.-14B-1 to -15. Specifically, appellants argue that the Board \u201cden[ied] the public a fair opportunity to comment on proposed rules or regulations\u201d because the proposed regulations were not published in the New Jersey Register until ten days after both the public hearing was held and the public comment period had expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\"><em>N.J.S.A </em>17B:27A-16.1 embodies an independent, expedited rule making procedure. In order to use that procedure, <em>N.J.S.A </em>17B:27A-16.1(b) requires the Board (1) to provide notice of an \u201cintended action,\u201d as defined in the statute, in three newspapers of general circulation in New Jersey, as well as to provide notice and a detailed description of the proposed action to, <em>among </em>others, carriers subject to the provisions of the Act, and (2) to send notice of the proposed action concurrently to the Office of Administrative Law (\u201cOAL\u201d) for publication in the <em>New Jersey Register. </em>The Board must also provide all interested persons with \u201can opportunity to comment in writing on the intended action,\u201d and the comment period must be at least 20 calendar days from the date of the notice. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17B:27A-16.1(d).

In fact, as already noted, the Board received written comments from appellants, as well as written and oral comments from others. Thereafter,. it prepared a report which summarized and responded to the comments, and the report was published in the <em>New Jersey Register, </em>the regulations were adopted on August 4, 1998, and filed on August 7, 1998. The Notice of Adoption, including the Board\u2019s report on the comments it received, was sent to the OAL on August 7, 1998, and published in the <em>New Jersey Register. </em>30 <em>N.J.R. </em>3289 (Sept. 8, 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">As the Legislature, in <em>N.J.S.A </em>17B:27A-16.1, established a specific mechanism for adopting or re-adopting the IHCP regulations incident to the 1997 legislation and the Board adhered to that procedure, we must reject appellants\u2019 contention that the Board violated the authorized procedure for adopting or amending its regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">The specific challenges to two of the regulations pose different issues and one of them has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">Appellants contend that the good-faith marketing requirements in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:20-9.5(f)(2) and 11:20-9.6(1) exceed the Board\u2019s rule making authority; (2) are arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable; and (3) lack appropriate standards. While our conclusion may be debatable, we reject these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-11\">Appellants argue that there is no specific authority in the Act for the Board to impose a good-faith marketing requirement in order for a carrier to receive a pro rata exemption. They contend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>that the Board lacked the authority to establish the good-faith marketing requirement and argue that <em>N.J.AC. </em>ll:20-9.5(f)(2) and 11:20-9.6 are, in any event, inconsistent with the requirements of law.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">The Act requires the \u201cfair, reasonable and equitable\u201d sharing of program losses in a \u201cproportionate\u201d manner. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17B:27A-10(d); <em>see also N.J.S.A. </em>17B:27A-12(a)(2) requiring assessment of each member which has not written its required coverage. <em>N.J.S.A </em>17B:27A-12(d)(5) provides that \u201c[t]o the extent that the carrier has failed to cover the minimum number of non-group person life years established by the board, the carrier <em>shall be assessed by the board on a pro rata basis </em>for any differential between the minimum number established by the board and the actual number covered by the carrier.\u201d (emphasis added.) The wording of this provision presents a colorable basis for the claim that the Board exceeded its authority by relating pro rata exemptions to the imposition of good-faith marketing requirements on carriers that write less than 50% of the minimum required for a full exemption. However, the provision refers to the \u201cminimum number [of individual or non-group policies] established by the board,\u201d and the good-faith exemption can be deemed a valid component in creating the \u201cminimum number established by the board.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Given the legislative history as well as the Act\u2019s overall intent, and recognizing the presumption in favor of regulations adopted by an agency which administers a subject area with specialized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>expertise, <em>New Jersey State League of Municipalities v. Department of Community Affairs, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>211, 222, 729 A.2d 21 (1999), <em>Mayflower Securities Co., Inc. v. Bureau of Securities, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>85, 92-93, 312 A.2d 497 (1973), we conclude that the Board did not exceed its authority by imposing the good-faith marketing requirements. The Legislature\u2019s goal was to increase the availability of individual health insurance coverage, spread the cost of insuring high-risk individuals among New Jersey\u2019s entire health insurance industry, reduce the cost of individual health care coverage, and increase profitability of the health care market. <em>In re Indiv. Health Coverage, supra, </em>302 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 363-65, 369-70, 695 A.2d 371; <em>Health Maint. Org. of N.J., Inc. v. Whitman, supra, </em>72 F.3d at 1123-26. Therefore, the Board\u2019s development of a program that gives incentives and requires carriers to prove that they made a good-faith effort to enroll their target amount of individual or non-group policyholders during a given calculation period is consistent with the Legislature\u2019s intent in establishing the Act and a legitimate component in the determination of the \u201cminimum number\u201d of persons to be covered by each carrier. Stated in \u201cplain language,\u201d we have already upheld the \u201cpay or play\u201d program; a carrier must \u201cpay\u201d unless it \u201cplays,\u201d and we see no reason in the statute why it cannot be required to show that it really \u201cplayed,\u201d or tried to \u201cplay,\u201d when it fell more than 50% short.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Indeed, the Board adopted the good-faith marketing requirement in 1994, which was well before the Legislature amended <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17B:27A-12 in 1997. Accordingly, the Legislature could have ended or changed that policy in 1997, but chose not to do so, and \u201can agency\u2019s construction of a statute over a period of years without legislative interference will under appropriate circumstances [particularly when the statute is otherwise revised] be granted great weight as evidence of its conformity with the legislative intent.\u201d <em>Malone v. Fender, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>129, 137, 402 A.2d 240 (1979). <em>See also Body-Rite Repair Co. v. Director, Div. Taxation, supra, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>at 545-46, 446 A.2d 515. Thus, despite the reference to pro rata assessments in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17B:27A-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>12(d)(5), the Act does not prohibit the Board from adopting limits on the granting of those exemptions in order to encourage carriers to \u201cplay\u201d in good faith by writing their minimum share or close to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">Appellants and intervenor contend that the second-tier assessment regulation, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:20-2.17, also exceeds the Board\u2019s authority and is, in any event, arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable. We agree that this regulation must be declared invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">We recognize that \u201c[t]he judicial role in reviewing administrative regulations is limited. A court may not invalidate a regulation as long as it is \u2018within the fair contemplation of the enabling statute\u2019 and is neither arbitrary nor unreasonable.\u201d <em>Marsh v. New Jersey Dep\u2019t of Environ. Protection, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>137, 149, 703 A.2d 927 (1997). <em>See also N.J. League of Municipalities, supra, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>at 222, 729 A.2d 21 (presumption of validity). Indeed, \u201c[a] finding that an agency acted in an <em>ultra vires </em>fashion in adopting regulations is generally disfavored. Particularly, in the field of insurance, the expertise and judgment of the [agency head] may be given great weight.\u201d <em>New Jersey Coalition of Health Care Prof'ls, Inc. v. New Jersey Dep\u2019t of Banking and Ins., </em>323 <em>N.J.Super. </em>207, 229, 732 A.2d 1063 (App.Div.) (citations omitted), <em>certif. denied, </em>162 <em>N.J. </em>485, 744 A.2d 1208 (1999). Consistent with this principle, the Supreme Court has also held that \u201cthe grant of authority to an administrative agency is to be liberally construed in order to enable the agency to accomplish its statutory responsibilities, and that the courts should readily imply such incidental powers as are necessary to effectuate fully the legislative intent.\u201d <em>New Jersey Guild of Hearing Aid Dispensers v. Long, </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>544, 562, 384 A.2d 795 (1978). On the other hand, we are not bound by an agency\u2019s interpretation of its governing statute or other resolution of a purely legal issue, and we cannot sustain a regulation inconsistent with the legislative will. <em>Green</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number><em>wood v. State Police Training Center, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>500, 513, 606 A.2d 336 (1992); <em>Mayflower Securities, supra</em></p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">As we previously developed, when the IHCP was first adopted in 1992, it contemplated that all carriers would be liable for any assessments required to make up any shortfall due to the fact that no carrier could be liable for an assessment which exceeded 35% of the aggregate net paid losses of all carriers. <em>N.J.S.A </em>17B:17A-12(e). Although that subsection was repealed in 1997, <em>L. </em>1997, c. 146, \u00a7 6, the Act still mandates full payment of reimbursable losses to those carriers who provide coverage under the IHCP.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17B:27A-12(a)(i )(b) specifically provides that if a carrier\u2019s \u201cclaims paid for all health benefits plans during the two-year calculation period exceed 115% of the net earned premium and any investment income thereon for the two-year calculation period, the amount of the excess shall be the net paid loss for the carrier that <em>shall be reimbursable under this act.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Furthermore, those reimbursements are to be funded by assessments on \u201c[e]very member\u201d of the IHCP \u201cunless the member has received an exemption from the board pursuant to <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>17B:27A-12(d) ] and <em>has written </em>a minimum number of non-group person life years as provided for in that subsection.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>17B:27A-12(a)(2). In fact, in order to make the necessary assessments, the Act grants the Board the \u201cspecific authority\u201d to \u201cassess members their proportionate share of program losses and administrative expenses in accordance with the provisions of <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>17B:27A-12].\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17B:27A-ll(a). Thus, the Board has an obligation to assess members in a manner that will produce revenues sufficient to ensure that all carriers entitled to reimbursement will receive the full amount of their reimbursable losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>However, under <em>N.J.AC. </em>11:20-2.17, the existence of a total exemption from the second-tier obligation of those granted pro rata as well as full exemptions may well create a potentially confiscatory payment by the remaining carriers. And because a full reimbursement is mandatory, the Board must reallocate the equivalent of the shortfall through the use of a second-tier assessment or something similar. Indeed, the inclusion of a second-tier calculation is an effective way of furthering legislative intent, especially in light of every member\u2019s ability to avoid or diminish its assessment by meeting its enrollment target. Nevertheless, we agree with appellants and intervenor that the Board\u2019s second-tier assessment, as presently written, is arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable, or inconsistent with legislative intent, because those who receive a pro rata exemption are completely excused from the second-tier assessment irrespective of the amount of its exemption and the consequences it has with respect to the other carriers who must make up the shortfall (in the absence of the 35% cap that no longer exists). Furthermore, completely excusing carriers with a pro rata exemption from the second-tier assessment is inconsistent with the requirement of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17B:27A-12(a)(2) that all members \u201cshall be liable\u201d for the \u201cnet plan losses\u201d of other members \u201cunless the member\u201d has written its full minimum required coverage.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In this connection, we also note that in deleting <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17B:12A-12(e), the Legislature deleted reference to the fact that carriers receiving pro rata exemptions \u201cshall be deemed to have received an exemption [for purposes of making up the shortfall] notwithstanding the fact that the carrier failed to enroll or insure the minimum number of non-group persons required for that calendar year.\u201d <em>L. </em>1992, c. 161, \u00a7 11, <em>repealed by L. </em>1997, <em>c. </em>146, \u00a7 6, eff. July 1, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">Under <em>N.J.AC. </em>11:20-2.17(c), carriers that receive pro-rata exemptions on the first assessment (which is required by and consistent with <em>N.J.S.A </em>17B:27A-12(d)(5)), are completely exempt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>from paying any amount in the second-tier assessment. We conclude that this additional exemption, embodied in <em>N.J.AC. </em>ll:20-2.17(c), is arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable, and inconsistent with legislative intent, because there is no authority in the Act for the Board to excuse carriers with pro rata exemptions from paying any second-tier assessments at all, or to be completely exempt from the requirement of reimbursing those carriers entitled to the mandatory payment of their reimbursable losses. As we have noted, although <em>N.J.SA </em>17B:27A-12(e), <em>repealed by L. </em>1997, <em>c. </em>146, \u00a7 6, originally excluded all members that received any exemption, including pro rata exemptions, from paying any shortfall due to the 35% cap, the Legislature deleted that section in 1997. The Act is now clear that carriers that do not cover their minimum requirements must pay a pro-rata assessment, <em>N.J.SA </em>17B:27A-12(d)(5). They must also contribute to reimbursement of the shortfall, particularly in light of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17B:27A-12(a)(2).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">By allowing carriers with pro-rata exemptions to completely avoid the second-tier assessment, the shortfall that was initially created by the Board\u2019s granting of exemptions in the first place is magnified among only those carriers that are already paying without any exemption, and only those carriers. However, the Act does not authorize the Board to further penalize carriers who are not entitled to any exemption. The Act penalizes them by prohibiting an exemption but does not require them to underwrite the entire program.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">The Board urges us to apply any holding invalidating a regulation prospectively. Since the appeal challenges only the 1998 re-adoption of, or amendments to, the regulations, we decline to apply our decision to the assessments made prior to that year or its \u201ctwo year calculation period.\u201d We are told by appellants that actual assessments have \u25a0 not yet been made under the 1998 regulations. In any event, we do not address the impact of our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>decision on any carrier that has already paid a second-tier assessment under the invalidated regulation. Nor do we address how the Board may endeavor to collect any \u201cshort fall\u201d which may flow from this decision.

We also note that the Commissioner must \"assure that all members of the program are fairly represented\u201d on the Board, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17B:27A-10(b), and that a majority of the governing committee of the Commercial Automobile Insurance Plan involved in <em>Progressive, </em>unlike here, was comprised of industry representatives. <em>See id. </em>at 104, 704 A.2d 562. <em>See also N.J.A.C. </em>ll:20-20.2(a)(3) (Board makes determination as to whether a matter is a \"contested case\u201d and whether to refer it to the OAL) which is premised on the Board\u2019s agency status.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b546-8\"> We bypass consideration of whether the separate or alternative expedited procedure supports the Board\u2019s claim that the Legislature intended to supplement and enhance the Board\u2019s authority on behalf of the State.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b548-7\"> We do not have to pass upon the scope of the Board\u2019s adjudicatory authority in this opinion which deals with the promulgation of regulations. We merely conclude that the definition of \"action\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17B:27A-16.1(a) does not require invalidation of the regulations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b551-8\"> There is no challenge to the specific criteria, including the fifty percent trigger to the \"good-faith\" requirement of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:20-9.5(0(2), -9.6, if it is otherwise valid. Nor does this appeal involve a challenge to the denial of appellants' request for a good-faith exemption or their 1996 assessment based on the denial of the exemption. In light of our prior holding concerning the Board's powers, those subjects are reserved for consideration in the proper forum. We note, however, that our holding, <em>infra, </em>regarding the second-tier assessment may also affect appellants' overall attack on the regulations even if rules of prospectivity do not grant them relief for any assessment before 1998 or its two year calculation period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b554-6\"> Carriers that issue individual benefit plans must report their earned premiums, claims paid and administrative expenses to the Board, and if the claims paid and administrative expenses exceed the premiums collected and investment income thereon, the excess constitutes the carrier\u2019s \"net paid loss.\u201d <em>NJ.S.A. </em>17B:27A-12(a)(l)(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b555-7\"> It is also inconsistent with the limited pro rata assessment embodied in <em>NJ.S.A. </em>17B:27A-12(d)(5).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b556-7\"> We do not preclude the Board's consideration of granting a pro rata exemption on the second-tier.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
