After being advised that her application was denied because she was unemployed and had an adverse credit report, plaintiff filed a Complaint and Order to Show Cause on December 4, 2000, to compel defendant to rent an apartment to her and execute the Rental Assistance Program \u00a7 8 contract. The complaint alleged that defendant\u2019s denial was arbitrary and violative of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:42-100.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">Defendant filed its answer on December 7, 2000, and one week later Judge Graves entered an order requiring defendant to keep one apartment available pending final disposition. Judge Graves denied defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment and thereafter presided over a non-jury trial on January 24, 2001. On February 9, 2001, Judge Graves filed a ten-page opinion in which he found that the testimony of Robert J. Schoonhen, the person responsible for managing the apartment complex, provided \u201cinconsistent and unsubstantiated reasons for not accepting plaintiff as a tenant,\u201d thus concluding that defendant arbitrarily and unfairly rejected her application because of her dependence upon government assistance, rather than her creditworthiness.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">Defendant appeals, raising the following points:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-9\">\n<em>POINT I</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-10\">THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING THE DEFENDANT DID NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE PLAINTIFF WAS NOT CREDITWORTHY UNDER <em>NJ.S.A. </em>2A42-100 WHEN DENYING THE PLAINTIFF\u2019S APPLICATION.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-13\">\n<em>POINT II</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-14\">THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FAILING TO ASCRIBE THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT BEHIND <em>N.J.SA </em>2A:42-100 TO ALSO INCLUDE THE PROTECTION OF THE LANDLORD\u2019S RIGHT TO REFUSE A TENANT BASED <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>UPON CREDIT WORTHINESS AND GIVING UNDUE PREFERENCE TO THE PLAINTIFF.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-7\">\n<em>POINT III</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-8\">THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT SUBSTITUTED ITS JUDGMENT AS TO THE PLAINTIFF\u2019S CREDITWORTHINESS FOR THAT OF THE DEFENDANT\u2019S BUSINESS JUDGMENT.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">We find no error in the proceedings, and affirm for the reasons given by Judge Graves in his comprehensive and well-reasoned written opinion of February 9, 2001. The judge\u2019s findings of fact are adequately supported by the evidence. <em>R. </em>2:11 \u2014 3(e)(1)(A). Defendant\u2019s contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-11\">We however add the following brief comment. Although <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:42-100 makes it unlawful for a landlord to \u201crefuse to rent or lease any ... apartment to another person because of the source of any lawful income,\u201d it does not limit a landlord from refusing to rent an apartment based on the \u201ccreditworthiness\u201d of the prospective tenant. Defendant\u2019s assertion that Judge Graves trespassed upon its business judgment by substituting his standards respecting creditworthiness for those used by defendant, thereby erring in his application of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:42-100, misconstrues Judge Graves\u2019s ruling. Judge Graves found that \u201cthere was no doubt\u201d that defendant rejected plaintiffs application because of her \u201ceconomic status, including her unemployment, lack of sufficient income and her participation in the Section 8 program,\u201d rather than her lack of creditworthiness. As such, he concluded that plaintiffs credit problems, which were disputed, were used as a pretext by defendant for denying plaintiffs application and that the testimony presented by defendant lacked credibility. It would be improper for us to engage in any independent assessment of credibility. <em>State v. Locurto, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>463, 472-75, 724 A.2d 234 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-12\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
