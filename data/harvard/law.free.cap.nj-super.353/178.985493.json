The sentencing judge granted the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-11\">The facts emerged during a jury trial of Gismondi and a co-defendant Stephen Thayer, both police officers of East Greenwich Township, on a five count indictment charging the officers with fourth degree aggravated assault by pointing a firearm at others, second degree possession of a firearm for an unlawful purpose, fourth degree \u201cbias\u201d harassment, third degree terroristic threats, and fourth degree \u201cbias\u201d assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-12\">During the night of April 3 and early morning of April 4, 1998, five teenagers (aged seventeen through nineteen) were gathered outside the home of Vasti Sturdivant in West Deptford, a community adjacent to East Greenwich. Each was related to Sturdivant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>and to each other. They all were going to sleep at Sturdivant\u2019s house that night. Each of the boys was African-American, and the neighborhood was \u201cpredominantly black.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">At trial, each of the five boys described the incident in substantially the same way. As they stood talking in Vasti\u2019s driveway, at about 1:20 a.m. on April 4, 1998, they heard tires screeching from miles away; the noise got louder as the vehicle got closer. Finally, a Ford pickup truck came into view and slammed on its brakes, went in reverse, turned to go around the block, and came back past the boys. It was \u201cdriving all crazy,\u201d very fast and \u201cside to side.\u201d Though the boys did not see who the occupants were, Gismondi later testified that he was the driver and Thayer the front seat passenger.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Gismondi circled the block a second time, again driving very fast. Some of the boys began yelling and cursing at the truck; for example, William Holmes yelled, \u201cwhat the hell are you doing?\u201d The truck slowed but continued making a third circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">On its third pass, the truck stopped next to a playground abutting Vasti .Sturdivant\u2019s property, and the passenger door opened, after which the boys heard gunshots, which some of them saw coming from the passenger side of the truck. Thinking someone was trying to kill them, the boys ran for cover. In the boys\u2019 view, the shots were being aimed at them, as opposed to in the air. The boys variously estimated that there were thirteen to sixteen shots fired, all in rapid succession. While dodging bullets, Jeff Holmes ran into a pole and injured himself; he was treated at a hospital and released.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">Vasti Sturdivant and two neighbors generally corroborated the boys\u2019 account; they could see and hear from their windows much of what had happened. One neighbor, Fred Mills, saw the passenger (Thayer) exit the truck and say \u201cthose bitches.\u201d The boys ran into Vasti\u2019s house, she called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">About 1:20 a.m. on April 4,1998, Sergeant Dobbins of the West Deptford police was dispatched to a residence to check on a report <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>of \u201c[g]unshots being fired in the area.\u201d He testified as to what he saw at the scene:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-6\">I found five teenagers in the park \u2014 the area of the driveway on the side of the house. They were in the driveway, they were in a panic yelling and screaming. They were extremely upset and one of the teenagers came up to me and he stated that he was injured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-10\">Eyewitnesses reported to the responding officers that the culprits, two white males, had fired their guns in the air as they drove by twice in a Ford pickup truck. On the ground near the scene the investigating officers found a paper with Thayer\u2019s name on it, apparently a paper he had written for a college course. Based on that clue, the officers ran a Division of Motor Vehicles cheek, indicating that Thayer was the owner of a Ford pickup with a particular tag number; the officers broadcast an alert for that truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-11\">The officers\u2019 walking search of the area revealed ten spent shell casings from a .40 caliber gun. The State\u2019s ballistics expert testified that the casings came from bullets fired by the service revolver issued to Thayer. Despite an extensive search, both that night and in the daylight, they were unable to find any of the bullets from the casings or any sign of damage from the bullets.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-12\">After the incident, at about 1:41 a.m., Officer Kienholz of the Mantua police department stopped a Thunderbird being driven about 79 miles per hour by Gismondi, whom he recognized. As Gismondi appeared to be \u201cfine,\u201d Kienholz gave him a verbal warning and let him go.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-13\">Later that morning, Lieutenant Goess of the East Greenwich police department was dispatched to Thayer\u2019s home in West Deptford in order to relieve Thayer of his service revolver. Thayer\u2019s wife awakened him, and he appeared to Goess to be highly intoxicated. After a frantic search of the house, Thayer finally found the weapon in a linen closet and gave it to Goess. Another officer relieved Gismondi of his firearm when he came to work the next morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>Thayer and Gismondi had encountered the police in two separate incidents shortly before the shooting episode. At about 12:34 a.m. a 911 call was placed from a pay phone at a Heritage dairy store in Woodbury, a town adjacent to West Deptford. The caller (later identified by Gismondi as Thayer) asked for help because of some \u201cloud music,\u201d to which the 911 operator replied that the police were on the way. Thayer and Gismondi drove off, but the officer dispatched to the phone, Officer Cope, stopped Thayer\u2019s truck because its horn was blowing. Cope did not realize that the truck was occupied by those involved in the 911 call. Because he recognized Gismondi (who then was the passenger), and because Thayer flashed his police badge, Cope did not question the two but drove off to further investigate the 911 call.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">The second incident occurred a short time later, at about 12:50 a.m., when Officer Magee of the National Park police department, saw a Ford pickup truck parked illegally, part on and part off the parking lot of a tavern. He conducted a license tag cheek, which revealed that the truck was registered to Thayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">As Magee started walking toward the truck, Thayer and Gismondi approached him. Magee recognized Gismondi and was aware that he was a police officer, and Thayer identified himself as a police officer, as well. They told Magee they had parked the way they had in order to joke with the owner of the tavern, and they complied with Magee\u2019s directive that they move the truck. Both men were cooperative and did not appear to Magee to be intoxicated. Magee decided not to issue a summons partly as a courtesy to fellow officers and partly because of their explanation for their erratic parking. Later that night, Magee realized that Thayer\u2019s pickup was the one involved in the shooting incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">Gismondi testified on his own behalf and gave the following version of the events: On the night in question he and Thayer were celebrating Gismondi\u2019s pending job change; they began drinking about 8:00 p.m. and, riding in Thayer\u2019s Ford pickup. They went from bar to bar throughout the night. Gismondi was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>drinking beers, while Thayer was drinking shots and beers; Thayer was drinking more than Gismondi.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">About 12:30 a.m., Thayer drove the truck to a pay phone in Woodbury, where he made a \u201cjoking\u201d 911 call. During the call Gismondi was laughing at Thayer\u2019s facial expressions and mannerisms; Thayer was \u201cintoxicated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">After the truck was stopped by Officer Cope, Thayer drove to another bar in National Park, where they encountered Officer McGee. They drank some more before leaving; this time Gismondi took over the driving, and he headed for Thayer\u2019s house in West Deptford.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">At one point Gismondi \u201cinadvertently\u201d drove past an intended turn, and he \u201cjammed on the brakes\u201d and \u201cskidded.\u201d He skid again when braking to make another turn. At some point Thayer told Gismondi to stop because he had \u201chit something.\u201d Thayer got out and felt the truck, at which point \u201cthings started to hit the vehicle.\u201d Gismondi drove forward to get out the \u201cline of fire,\u201d at which time he \u201cheard gunshots and ... took off up the street,\u201d leaving Thayer. He turned around and went back to get Thayer who he saw had been shooting his weapon into the air. Thayer told him that \u201cthey\u201d had been throwing rocks at the truck. Thayer did not say who \u201cthey\u201d were; indeed, he did not know because he never saw anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">Gismondi denied threatening or harassing anyone, and he denied being racist. He did not know, but he assumed, that the neighbor-hood was predominantly African-American. The two went home without reporting the incident, deciding to report it the next day when they had sobered up. Gismondi\u2019s only other evidence was the testimony of several character witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">Gismondi was acquitted by the jury of all offenses except a lesser included offense, petty disorderly harassment. At the time of sentencing the judge considered and ruled upon the State\u2019s motion to forfeit Gismondi\u2019s public office of policeman. In a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>comprehensive oral opinion, Judge Lisa who had presided over the trial, granted the motion. He reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-5\">The application before me is governed by a provision in our criminal Code, 2C:51-2. In Subsection (a) of that section, there is a provision that a person holding any public office, position, or employment, who is convicted of an offense shall forfeit such office or position if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-6\">(1), he is convicted of a third degree or higher crime, which is not the case with Mr. Gismondi here; or (2), he is convicted of an offense involving or touching such office, position, or employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-7\">Subsection (d) of that section goes on to provide if forfeiture is ordered as part of the sentence, it shall be permanent forfeiture.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-8\">Subsection (e) provides that the County Prosecutor or the Attorney General may apply to the court for a waiver of the forfeiture provision where the offense is a disorderly or petty disorderly offense, such as the ease with Mr. Gismondi. However, the prosecutor in this case has not applied for a waiver; and, in fact, has taken the opposite approach and has affirmatively moved for enforcement of the forfeiture provision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-9\">Subsection (b) provides that the court shall enter the order of forfeiture immediately upon a finding of guilty by the trier of fact, unless the court, for good cause shown, orders a stay of that forfeiture pending a hearing on the merits at the time of sentencing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-10\">This provision in its entirety, not just the last one I mentioned, the last subsection, but this provision in its entirety most clearly and obviously applies in situations where the offense arises out of the conduct engaged in by the public employee while acting in the course of his or her public duties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-11\">For example, an on-duty police officer assault [of] a civilian without justification, such as in the case that you just mentioned, Mr. Waller, <em>State v. Lazarcheclt, [Lazarchick] </em>which is reported at 314 <em>N.J. </em>Superior Court Reports, Page 500, decided by the Appellate Division in 1998, and for which certification was denied by the Supreme Court at 157 <em>N.J., </em>Page 546[, 724 A.2d 804].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-12\">In the cases such as this, however, where the conduct which is the basis for the offense for which the conviction occurred was off-duty conduct, a more probing analysis is required.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-13\">In <em>Moore v. Youth Correctional Institute, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>256, 574 A.2d 983, decided in 1990, our State Supreme Court said at Page 269[, 574 A.2d 983]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWf\">The inquiry into whether an offense involves and touches on employment, to the extent of meriting forfeiture, requires careful examination of the facts and the evaluation of various factors in the involve-and-touch analysis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-15\">First, there is a need to assess the gravity of the crime, as revealed by its nature, its context, and the identity of the victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-16\">Second, there is a.need to assess the qualifications required of the employee\u2019s public employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-17\">With respect to the second prong, the qualifications required of the particular employee\u2019s public employment, this is a regular member of a municipal police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>department. There is no need, in my view, in a case such as this one, for a separate hearing for a determination, after hearing testimony and evidence, to determine what the nature of that public employment is. It is commonly known and commonly understood; police officers are sworn to uphold the law, to observe, to be vigilant for, and to apprehend offenders, to investigate alleged violations of the law, and like responsibilities and duties. They are permitted to carry firearms, to make arrests, and to issue lawful orders to citizens in the course of their duties. This is not intended to be an exhaustive explication of the scope of a police officer\u2019s duty, but it is a sufficient recitation to make it dear, in my judgment, that there is no need for a separate hearing for a determination of the scope of a police officer\u2019s duties and the qualifications for someone to hold that office as a police officer. Obviously, the qualifications required to hold such a position require a high level of honesty, integrity, sensitivity, and fairness in dealing with members of the public, knowledge of the law, and a pattern and exhibition of law-abiding conduct. With respect to the first prong of that test enunciated in <em>Moore, </em>there is a need to consider not only the seriousness of the crime, but an evaluation of its nature, its context, and the identity of the victim; or, in this case, victims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-6\">The <em>Moore </em>court at page 271 said the forfeiture statute as applied in a number of cases that they just reviewed is not merely a collateral attempt to punish a criminal offender; it also reflects a belief that the circumstances surrounding the criminal conviction bear directly on an employee\u2019s competency and capacity to continue to do his or her job, or to perform any other job for the state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-7\">Thus, it is proper to consider the circumstances surrounding the conviction as part of the so-called involve-and-touch analysis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-8\">Addressing these factors in this ease, based upon the evidence that I heard in this trial, I find the following to be pertinent:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-9\">First, that harassment is a very low level petty disorderly persons offense. In the overall hierarchy of our criminal and disorderly offenses and the graduation of them in our criminal code, this is the lowest level offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-10\">I find, secondly, that the victim was actually five victims, which magnifies the seriousness of the offense, since it was perpetrated against more than one person. Third, I find that the victims were youthful individuals, which makes the offense more egregious.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-11\">Fourth, I find that the conduct of the defendant was purposeful as opposed to reckless or some lower level of mental culpability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-12\">Fifth, I find that the defendant, in the circumstances surrounding this offense, was engaged in a course of conduct over a period of several hours, placing this into context, which is something that I believe is appropriate to do under the guidelines set forth by the Supreme Court in <em>Moore. </em>And over this course of hours, the defendant was drinking significant amounts of alcohol, driving while drinking, displayed his badge showing his position to other officers during the course of stops, during the course of the evening, in order to avoid repercussions from those stops, for potentially unlawful behavior, driving improperly. He drove his co-defendant to the scene \u2014 excuse me \u2014 he drove his co-defendant to the scene and also from the scene; thereby, fleeing the incident. He did not report the incident <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>to any lawful authority; and, in fact, when confronted by his own superior officers, he denied it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-5\">Although I find as the sixth point, although only harassment, which is a low level petty disorderly offense, the overall context of this incident involved the discharge of a firearm at least ten times by the co-defendant. That conduct, the co-defendant, that conduct by the co-defendant is not imputed to this defendant, as a result of the jury findings in this case. But its presence as part of a fact pattern of what transpired adds a layer of context to the overall significance of this incident. The <em>Moore </em>court stated at page 270 that when the infraction casts such a shadow over the employee as to make his or her continued service appear incompatible with the traits of trustworthiness, honesty, and obedience to law and order, then forfeiture is appropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-6\">It is my conclusion, when considering all of the factors that I have just discussed, that Mr. Gismondi\u2019s conduct in this case meets this criteria. Because of the nature, the circumstances of this offense, although committed while off duty, by the standards that I\u2019ve cited, it does involve or touch upon his office as a police officer; and, therefore, the motion of the State to include forfeiture of office as part of the sentence is granted, and I will include that as part of the sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">Gismondi raises the following points on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-8\">POINT i</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-9\">THE PROSECUTOR\u2019S MOTION TO FORFEIT THE APPELLANT\u2019S PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT WAS MOTIVATED BY THE IMPROPER POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS WAS ARBITRARILY MADE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-10\">POINT II</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-11\">THE TRIAL JUDGE\u2019S DECISION TO FORFEIT THE APPELLANT\u2019S PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT WAS NOT SUPPORTED BY SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE OR ANALYZED UNDER THE CORRECT STANDARD AND MUST BE REVERSED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-12\">POINT III</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-13\">THE APPELLANT WAS ENTITLED TO THE PROTECTIONS AFFORDED POLICE OFFICERS IN <em>N.J.S.A </em>40AU4-147 PURSUANT TO <em>MOORE.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-14\">We affirm for substantially the reasons set forth in Judge Lisa\u2019s thoughtful and comprehensive bench opinion of November 17, 2000. The judge properly construed and applied the statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2(d) and (e) and the ease of <em>Moore v. Youth Correctional Institute at Annandale, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>256, 574 A.2d 983 (1990). <em>Moore </em>bears striking similarities to the present case. There, James Moore, a state corrections officer, was the subject of disciplinary charges by his supervisor and was suspended without pay. <em>Id. </em>at 260, 574 A.2d 983. Following a hearing <em>Moore </em>was removed from his position. <em>Ibid. </em>The day following a successful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>appeal of his removal to the Merit System Board, Moore made a threatening phone call to the home of the supervisor and later drove his truck onto the supervisor\u2019s lawn and parked it in front of his house. <em>Id. </em>at 261, 574 A.2d 983. Later he spun his wheels on the driveway and parked the truck across from the supervisor\u2019s house. <em>Ibid. </em>The police were called and Moore was charged with petty disorderly harassment. <em>Ibid. </em>Nevertheless, Moore continued his pattern of harassing conduct directed at the supervisor. <em>Id. </em>at 260-61, 574 A.2d 983. Moore was convicted in municipal court. <em>Id. </em>at 262, 574 A.2d 983. Ultimately the matter returned to the Merit System Board which assigned an ALJ to hear the case. <em>Ibid. </em>Following another hearing, Moore was found to have forfeited his position as the result of the harassment convictions. <em>Id. </em>at 263, 574 A.2d 983. Moore appealed. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">When the matter reached the Supreme Court, in construing the \u201cinvolving or touching on his public office\u201d language of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2, it analyzed the gravity of the offense rather than whether it took place on or off work hours, or on or off the work site. <em>Id. </em>at 269-70, 574 A.2d 983. Its inquiry focused on the nexus between the offense and the employment and whether the employee\u2019s conduct \u201crendered suspect\u201d his future service to the state. <em>Id. </em>at 270, 574 A.2d 983. In sustaining Moore\u2019s forfeiture of office under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2, the Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-7\">When the infraction casts such a shadow over the employee as to make his or her continued service appear incompatible with the traits of trustworthiness, honesty, and obedience to law and order, then forfeiture is appropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-8\">The forfeiture statute, as applied in the foregoing cases, is not merely a collateral attempt to punish a criminal offender. It also reflects a belief that the circumstances surrounding a criminal conviction bear directly on an employee\u2019s competency and capacity to continue to do his or her job or to perform any other job for the state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 270-71, 574 A.2d 983.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">Following the decision in the present case, the Supreme Court decided another forfeiture ease, <em>McCann v. Clerk of City of Jersey City, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>311, 771 A.2d 1123 (2001). That case involved the question whether it was lawful to bar Gerald McCann, a former Mayor of Jersey City, from running again for that office, where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>early in a second term he was convicted of and sentenced for various federal offenses which occurred while he was out of office between 1986 and 1990. <em>Id. </em>at 316, 771 A.2d 1123. McCann forfeited his mayoralty in 1992 under the terms of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:51-2a(l). <em>Id. </em>at 316-17, 771 A.2d 1123. Nine years later, invoking <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:51-2d, the Clerk of the City refused to process McCann\u2019s February 2001 petition for election.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 317, 771 A.2d 1123.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The Court once again addressed the construction of the \u201cinvolving or touching on\u201d language of both <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:51-2a(2) and <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:51-2d. <em>Id. </em>at 319, 771 A.2d 1123. The Court first noted that the language must mean more than the \u201cdishonesty\u201d language of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:51-2a(l) lest the distinction in language ends in no meaningful difference in the standard for forfeiture under subsections a(l) and a(2). <em>Id. </em>at 321, 771 A.2d 1123. The Court then found added support for this distinction because the sole basis for permanent forfeiture under <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:51-2d is the \u201cinvolving or touching on\u201d language. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">As a result, the Court sharpened the test of subsections a(2) and d for forfeiture. <em>Id. </em>at 322-23, 771 A.2d 1123. In so doing it distinguished <em>Moore </em>and found that <em>McCann\u2019s </em>forfeiture under <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:51-2d could not be sustained. <em>Ibid. </em>The Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-7\">The narrow question in <em>Moore </em>was whether conduct committed during non-business hours and off the premises of the correctional facility at which Moore was employed could be considered to involve or touch on his employment for purposes of forfeiture. In determining that it could, we noted that \u201c[w]hen the infraction casts a shadow over the employee as to malte his or her continued service appear incompatible with the traits of trustworthiness, honesty, and obedience to law and order, then forfeiture is appropriate.\u201d Read in exclusion, that statement could be understood to support the Appellate Division\u2019s construction of subsection (d). However, the language of <em>Moore </em>should be understood in the context of the facts critical to our disposition, and it was undisputed that the petitioner\u2019s harassment of his co-employee in <em>Moore </em>bore a direct and substantial relationship to then-respective governmental positions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number><em>[Ibid, </em>(citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">In view of <em>McCann </em>and the trial judge\u2019s reliance on <em>Moore, </em>we have considered whether Gismondi\u2019s conduct meets the more stringent standard announced in <em>McCann </em>of a \u201cdirect and substantial relationship\u201d to Gismondi\u2019s governmental position. We conclude it does. If Gismondi\u2019s behavior, which could be generically described as drunk and disorderly, had a more attenuated relationship to his public employment, this would be a much more difficult case under McCann. However, in an adjacent community in which Gismondi might well be called on to serve, he drove a truck on a wide-roaming drunken spree with a fellow officer in which an African-American neighborhood was terrorized, a trumped-up 911 call was made, a police service revolver was discharged, police badges were flashed to ward off attempts to investigate their conduct and no report was made to his superiors. Such conduct not only demonstrates bad judgment, but also Gismondi\u2019s participation in an abuse of authority resulting in the disruption of the public peace and exposure to the risk of harm of the lives and property of the citizens Gismondi was sworn to protect.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">In short, we think it clear that even as a less culpable participant in the events of the evening in question, Gismondi\u2019s off-duty conduct involved or touched upon the public office of a policeman. The circumstances forming the basis of his offense of petty disorderly harassment bore a direct and substantial relationship to Gismondi\u2019s public position as a policeman and warranted his permanent disqualification from public office.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">We have also considered whether an even more recent decision of the Supreme Court in <em>Flagg v. Essex County Prosecutor, </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>561, 796 A.2d 182 (2002) bears upon the issues in this ease. There the issue was whether the county prosecutor had properly exercised his discretion in declining to waive forfeiture under N.J.S.A 2C:51-2. Flagg was a twenty-nine year employee of the City of Newark Sanitation Department. He was driving a dump truck and as instructed by a supervisor pieked-up a load of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>construction debris on a Newark Street and deposited it on another street about two blocks away. Flagg was charged with and convicted of various environmental offenses under Title 13E. Eventually, Flagg filed an action to compel the prosecutor to waive forfeiture of office under the statute or to state reasons for not doing so. In the Law Division the prosecutor offered reasons which the Court determined were insufficient and exempted Flagg from forfeiture. The State appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">We found that the standard governing the exercise of prosecutorial discretion was a patent and gross abuse of discretion. Under that standard, we concluded that the prosecutor\u2019s decision to seek forfeiture was not so wide of the mark as to require intervention. We, therefore, reversed. <em>Flagg v. Essex County Prosecutor, </em>336 <em>N.J.Super. </em>506, 512, 765 A.2d 278 (App.Div.2001). On certification to the Supreme Court, it held that the standard was simple abuse of discretion. It, therefore, concluded that on the facts the prosecutor had abused his discretion and thus reinstated the trial judge\u2019s ruling barring the prosecutor from seeking Flagg\u2019s ouster from his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">We hold that it was clearly not an abuse of discretion on the part of the. prosecutor to seek forfeiture given the totality of the factual circumstances here. As we have indicated, Gismondi\u2019s conduct on the evening in question was utterly inconsistent with any reasonable expectation of the qualities of judgment and conduct expected for public employment as a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b218-8\"> There were other grounds as well for barring McCann's candidacy which do not bear upon the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
