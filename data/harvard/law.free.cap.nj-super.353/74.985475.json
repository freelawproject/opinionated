Plaintiff alleged that he was wrongfully discharged by Ciba Specialty Chemicals Corpora<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>tion (Ciba) in violation of the LAD because of his age (50) and his handicaps (Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD), alcoholism, depression and Lyme disease) <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Prior to his employment by Ciba, plaintiff had a history of academic and employment success. He earned an Associates Degree <em>summa cum laude </em>and was valedictorian of his junior college class in 1966. In 1968, he earned his Bachelor of Science degree with a major in botany and a minor in chemistry. After graduating from college, he held a number of jobs with increasing responsibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Plaintiff was hired by Ciba as a Technical Sales Representative on September 1, 1978, to sell and market Ciba\u2019s pigments to industrial customers. He worked from his home in New Jersey and reported to a supervisor in Ciba\u2019s Newport, Delaware, facility. He was promoted to Senior Technical Sales Representative in the late 1980\u2019s. In that position, he was responsible for major national accounts. His job responsibilities included preparing written reports, such as: (1) call reports, documenting key events with customers and customer needs, to identify sales opportunities and develop new products; (2) monthly reports describing activities in his sales territory; (3) quarterly reports to advise customers on the work Ciba did on their behalf during the quarter; and (5) expense reports. Plaintiff submitted these reports to his Delaware-based managers. Plaintiff was also responsible for developing action plans related to market segment sales strategies.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">Plaintiff received good annual appraisals throughout his years at Ciba until 1991. From 1985 to 1989, his annual appraisals indicated that he met or exceeded his job requirements. In 1990, he was rated a \u201cvalued contributor\u201d and received satisfactory ratings in all performance skill factors. His supervisor testified that prior to 1991, plaintiff\u2019s customer relationships were good and, although his reporting was not perfect, he \u201cmet expectations\u201d in this area.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>In 1991, plaintiffs performance deteriorated significantly. In the early part of that year, plaintiff was filing his reports timely. By July, however, his reporting had become sporadic and he had not developed customer-specific business plans. His supervisor, Christopher Whiston, rated his performance for that year below the lowest ranking and plaintiff was placed on a ninety-day performance probation. In a written response to his 1991 evaluation, plaintiff acknowledged that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-6\">The severity of this review has reopened my eyes and mind to the ovei\u2019all requirements and responsibilities of my position as a Senior Tech. Sales Rep. within the Pigments Division. Some personal family matters over the past several years have diverted my attention away from some of these important responsibilities. While I don\u2019t believe that my overall territory customer responsibilities have been neglected, certain job requirements have been lacking and extra effort is in order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-7\">I understand the objectives and terms for my continued employment with Ciba-Geigy. I can and do rededicate myself to fulfilling all of the requirements of my position and look forward to being judged a valued contributor, and more, to the Pigments Division of Ciba-Geigy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">Plaintiffs ninety-day probation required him to perform the basic functions of his job, such as making and documenting customer needs and problems through <em>call </em>reports, analyzing potential opportunities for expanding Ciba\u2019s market and submitting all reports on time. Plaintiff successfully completed his probationary requirements by April 1992. His 1992 and 1993 performance appraisals indicated that he was, once again, a \u201cvalued contributor.\u201d Whiston considered plaintiff \u201ca valuable part of the organization\u201d because he had a lot of years of experience, he had developed customer relations, he understood the business and \u201c[h]e was intelligent, likeable, friendly. He was a strong combination of ... factors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">In 1994, Whiston was promoted and plaintiffs new supervisor was Paul Legnetti. Legnetti had been employed by Ciba since 1981 and had worked with plaintiff from 1981 to 1983, traveling with him five or six times a year. <em>Legnetti had a high regard for </em>plaintiff and \u201cthought Greg was a competent professional salesperson, always ... highly regarded by his customers, ... was well-liked within the organization.\u201d Legnetti rated plaintiff a \u201cvalued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>contributor\u201d in Ms 1994 annual appraisal but noted \u201cdisappointing results\u201d in plaintiffs Dispersion House Study, \u201cnot so much from ... the information gathered as from the reporting of the results.\u201d The Dispersion House Study was assigned to plaintiff during 1994, requiring him to do a market analysis of sales opportunities in the specialized dispersion industry. He had been assigned similar studies in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">In the summer of 1994, plaintiff again began experiencing personal problems and by early 1995, four of his key national accounts complained to Legnetti about lack of services. Specifically, the complaints indicated that plaintiff</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-6\">was not following up on a number of items ... in order to support and fulfill that customer\u2019s expectations, that letters about pricing or about other commitments that we were making to those customers were not being delivered on a timely basis, that the overall level of support and commitment that they perceived when Greg was representing Ciba had declined____[0]ne customer related to [Legnetti] that it almost looked as though Greg didn\u2019t know very much about their business anymore.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">That complaint was from a very long-term customer who had known plaintiff for a long time.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">Plaintiff testified that he had been a \u201csocial drinker\u201d until 1991 when he stopped drinking altogether because Ms wife threw him out of the house for having \u201cbeer breath.\u201d He subsequently attended Alcoholics Anonymous for three months at Ms wife\u2019s urging and did not drink alcohol at all. In the summer of 1994, however, he began drinking again. At the same time, plaintiff\u2019s wife had medical problems for which she was taking a narcotic pain killer and plaintiff began to abuse her medication. His son was being treated for Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD), and plaintiff abused his son\u2019s medication as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-11\">In January 1995, plaintiff saw a psychiatrist, Dr. Jay Kuris, and told Dr. Kuris that he thought he had ADD and that he was an alcoholic. Plaintiff testified that Dr. Kuris prescribed Cylert for ADD, Wellbutrin for depression and Klonopin to help him sleep and stop drinking alcohol. Dr. Kuris did not testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>Later in 1995, plaintiffs performance with one customer became so seriously deficient that Legnetti assigned the customer to another sales representative. Legnetti himself observed a general decline in plaintiffs performance: his reports became sporadic, lacked their former quality and no longer contained necessary details. Legnetti spoke to plaintiff about his observations and the customer complaints \u201con a fairly regular basis.\u201d He asked plaintiff if there was anything causing the problems and plaintiff told him \u201cthat he had some personal issues at home that required a bit of his attention; his wife wasn\u2019t feeling well, ... he had some issues with his son that again required some of his attention, ... and that \u2014 he had been doing personal projects and things like that around the house that took up a bit of his time.\u201d Legnetti took no action at that time, however, hoping plaintiff would work out the problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">In June 1995, Legnetti traveled with plaintiff on a number of sales calls and personally observed plaintiffs poor performance in front of customers. He observed that plaintiff \u25a0was confused, disorganized, \u201cdidn\u2019t recall the details of prior conversations or agreements with those customers, [and] that the overall preparation and analysis that\u2019s required before one goes to see a major customer hadn\u2019t occurred.\u201d Legnetti also observed that plaintiffs driving was erratic, \u201cthat he appeared inattentive while he was driving, speeding up and slowing down ... in the middle lane. Veering over to make a quick exit at the exit ramp.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">Legnetti spoke with plaintiff about his observations and plaintiff admitted that he was unprepared for the calls and had forgotten to bring along necessary documents. He also admitted that he was \u201cnot functioning to [his] full capacity,\u201d and that he was experiencing a number of personal problems on new medications he was taking. He told Legnetti his doctors thought he might have ADD.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">Legnetti reported plaintiffs poor performance to Whiston, now Legnetti\u2019s supervisor, and they agreed to place plaintiff on probation again, hoping plaintiff would respond as he did in 1992. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>Before placing plaintiff on probation, however, Legnetti described the situation to John DeSousa, Ciba\u2019s Human Resources Manager, who became concerned that plaintiffs erratic driving might be caused by substance abuse. DeSousa recommended that plaintiff be seen by Ciba\u2019s on-site Health Services Department (Health Services) in Newport, Delaware.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Plaintiff went to Delaware on July 13, 1995, where he met with Legnetti to discuss performance issues and then with Kay Ciabattoni, an Occupational Health Nurse and head of the on-site Health Services. Plaintiff told Ciabattoni that he was receiving psychotherapy and medication for ADD and discussed his drinking history and his various ailments, including suspected Lyme Disease and a recent shoulder injury. Plaintiff showed Ciabattoni the ten to twelve different medications he was taking, including a narcotic pain killer and an over-the-counter allergy medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Plaintiff met with Dr. David Jesic, an on-duty contract doctor who worked part-time at Health Services. Ciabattoni and Dr. Jesic suggested that plaintiff be evaluated at Bowling Green, a local drug and alcohol treatment center, to determine whether the multiple medications were causing his lack of concentration, difficulty driving and other recent problems. Ciabattoni was aware that plaintiff had been taking his wife\u2019s pain medication and was concerned that \u201cnot all of [plaintiffs] doctors knew ... all of the other medications that other doctors were prescribing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">Plaintiff was evaluated at Bowling Green on July 25, 1995, where it was determined that he was over-medicated and needed to taper off on some of the drugs. Ciabattoni approved plaintiffs request for evaluation and treatment at Carrier Clinic, closer to his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">On July 28, 1995, plaintiff was evaluated at Carrier by a psychiatrist, Dr. Patel. He gave the same medical history he had provided to Health Services and told Dr. Patel that he was a \u201crecovering alcoholic\u201d but had stopped drinking in May 1995. Dr. Patel told plaintiff he was \u201cprobably taking too many drugs,\u201d and that he needed to taper off Klonopin, which has a sedative effect. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>Dr. Patel reported to Ciabattoni that plaintiffs performance problems were related to the medications he was taking and recommended that plaintiff become \u201caffiliated with some sort of an AA group\u201d and with Carrier\u2019s Out-Patient Alcohol Treatment Services (OATS). After attending only one session at OATS, however, plaintiff decided he did not need the program because he had already stopped drinking on his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">On July 27, the day he was evaluated at Carrier, plaintiff requested and was granted work restriction limiting him to paperwork at home because he was uncomfortable driving with all the medications he was taking. On August 10,1995, plaintiff requested, and was granted, an extension of the work restriction because he was still feeling the effects of the medications. On August 16, 1995, plaintiff saw a new psychiatrist, Dr. Vasquez, who specialized in ADD and substance abuse. Dr. Vasquez recommended that plaintiff attend ninety AA meetings in ninety days, but plaintiff declined to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">On August 25, 1995, plaintiff was examined at Health Services and cleared for return to a full work schedule. Dr. Vasquez, his treating psychiatrist, completed a \u201creturn to work\u201d form indicating plaintiffs diagnosis was \u201calcohol dependence.\u201d Plaintiff did not request any further work restrictions or accommodations from Ciba.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">That same day, August 25, plaintiff met with Whiston and DeSousa in Delaware and they informed him that he was being placed on probation for ninety days and, if his performance did not improve, he would be subject to \u201cfurther disciplinary action up to and including termination of [his] employment.\u201d As part of his probationary requirements, plaintiff communicated regularly with Legnetti to review his progress. Legnetti informed plaintiff that he was not meeting his performance objectives satisfactorily. Legnetti testified that plaintiff acknowledged his failures, claiming that personal/family issues were taking up a substantial amount of his time and preventing him from completing the assigned projects. Legnetti stated that plaintiff did not claim at any time that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>his medical condition prevented him from performing his job; plaintiff only mentioned that he was receiving continuing treatment for his Lyme Disease and shoulder problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Plaintiff claimed, however, that he asked Legnetti to be relieved of his participation on the International Standards Organization (ISO) Team, so he could have more time to complete his assigned projects and to review a market opportunities analysis completed by another sales representative. Plaintiff testified that Legnetti refused the request, but Mark Dunn and Michael Williams, the ISO team leaders, testified that plaintiff was not assigned to any ISO audits between August and November 1995. In October 1995, plaintiff volunteered to work on the ISO Auditor Steering Committee but attended only one committee meeting and never asked to be relieved of his participation.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Legnetti testified that plaintiff did not successfully meet the objectives of his performance probation, notwithstanding the numerous extensions of time he was given. Legnetti said that he observed a further decline in plaintiffs performance during the probationary period. Plaintiff admitted that he did not meet the probationary performance objectives, despite extensions of time granted by Legnetti.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">As a result of the \u201cdownward spiral\u201d in plaintiffs performance, on November 17,1995, Legnetti and DeSousa met with plaintiff in Delaware. Legnetti summarized plaintiffs failures to meet his probation objectives, and DeSousa gave him a letter of termination. Plaintiff asked for another chance and for more time to complete his assignments. He also raised the issue of his medical problems. DeSousa responded that plaintiffs doctor had cleared him to return to work without any limitations, and the company had no indication that plaintiff had a medical problem which prevented him from doing his job. Nevertheless, DeSousa told plaintiff if he produced medical documentation, Ciba might reconsider its termination decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">On November 17, the day he was terminated, plaintiff wrote a letter to DeSousa claiming he had been \u201cwrongfully terminated\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>by Ciba without consideration of the fact that his poor performance was \u201cprimarily caused by a series of medical problems that started in January of 1995, and further complications brought on by inappropriate treatment while under the care of a psychiatrist, for diagnosed Attention Deficit Disorder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">On November 20, 1995, plaintiff went to Dr. Vasquez\u2019s office with a three-page letter explaining that he had been terminated by Ciba for not meeting his performance objectives. He asked Dr. Vasquez to contact DeSousa about his treatment and the effect of his medication and illness on his ability to perform his job. In response to plaintiffs letter, Dr. Vasquez contacted Health Services on November 20 and informed them that plaintiff had not been attending the substance abuse meetings as Dr. Vasquez had recommended. DeSousa never received any information, written or otherwise, from Dr. Vasquez or any other treating physician, regarding plaintiffs medical condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">At trial, two psychiatrists testified as experts: Dr. Allwyn Levine for plaintiff and Dr. Morton Fridman for defendant. Dr. Levine testified that plaintiff \u201csuffers from an Attention Deficit Disorder and co-morbid conditions of alcoholism and substance use disorder. He also has some of the other stigmata that are often seen in Attention Deficit Disorder, specifically, organizational difficulties, difficulties in planning. These have basically been lifelong difficulties.\u201d He did not explain, however, how plaintiff had managed academic and employment success until 1991 and again from 1992 to 1994. Dr. Levine testified that by August 1995 plaintiff was no longer suffering from a substance use disorder because he had stopped drinking in 1992. Dr. Levine did not mention plaintiffs admission that he began drinking again in 1994 and stopped in May 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">Defendant\u2019s expert, Dr. Fridman, opined that in 1995 plaintiffs \u201cpresentation was consistent with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, a history of alcohol abuse, as well as depression and anxiety.\u201d Dr. Fridman considered plaintiffs abuse of prescription medications the \u201cmajor problem\u201d affecting his job performance in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>1995. Plaintiffs ADD, on the other hand, was relatively mild and \u201caffecting him minimally in \u201995.\u201d In Dr. Fridman\u2019s opinion, if plaintiff had not been abusing substances or experiencing family/personal problems in 1995, his performance would have been acceptable, as it had been in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">In addition to the two experts, one of plaintiffs succession of treating psychiatrists testified. Dr. Ricardo Fernandez began treating plaintiff in May 2000, almost five years after his termination. After plaintiffs first visit, Dr. Fernandez indicated that plaintiff \u201cseemed\u201d to have a history of ADD and gave plaintiff and his wife questionnaires from which the doctor concluded plaintiff did have ADD. Dr. Fernandez agreed that ADD is difficult to diagnose because its symptoms overlap with other psychiatric conditions and people with ADD often have multiple psychiatric disorders. Dr. Fernandez described ADD as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-5\">Attention deficit disorder is a condition in which a person has an inability to maintain attention and focus on attention and is easily distracted from pursuing tasks that require attention. It usually is a lifelong disorder. It is often, but not always, associated with hyperactivity and impulsivity. These individuals can be impulsive, they can be irritable as well. There is very often a family history of attention deficit disorder ... as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-6\">In order to make the diagnosis you need to see disruption in two areas of functioning-social, academic or occupational.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">At trial, plaintiff did not move for a directed verdict on the question of whether plaintiff was \u201chandicapped\u201d based upon both experts\u2019 agreeing he had ADD, he did not object to the jury charges, nor did he object to the jury verdict form. Indeed, plaintiff submitted proposed jury charges and a proposed jury verdict form presenting the jury with the question of whether plaintiff was handicapped.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">The pertinent questions on the jury verdict form utilized at trial read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-9\">1. Has plaintiff Gregory J. Domurat proven by a preponderance of the evidence that he was handicapped between January and November, 1995?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-10\">Yes_ No_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-11\">If \u2018Wes,\u201d answer the next question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-12\">If \u201cNo,\u201d go to question No. 3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>3. Was plaintiff Gregory J. Domurat performing the essential functions of his job at a level that met defendant Ciba Specialty Chemical Corporation\u2019s legitimate expectations at the time of his termination?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-6\">Yes_ No_</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">The jurors answered \u201cNo\u201d to questions 1 and 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">After the verdict, plaintiff moved for a new trial, contending that \u201cthere was no question but that plaintiff was handicap[ped] according to the undisputed medical evidence in the case and under the standards.\u201d Plaintiff argued on the motion, as he does before us, that since the experts agreed on plaintiffs diagnosis, the court must determine as a matter of law that plaintiff was handicapped.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">After hearing arguments on the motion for a new trial, the trial judge denied plaintiffs application on the ground that the jury was free to make its determination from the evidence as a whole, including the seventeen years plaintiff had successfully done his job at Ciba:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-10\">So clearly it was a fact question. There was no way this court could make that decision about whether there was a handicap____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-11\">Furthermore, the purpose of the whole ADA structure and LAD structure is to identify a handicap for the purpose of remediation, not that an employer must employ someone who chooses a) not to remediate and doesn\u2019t fulfill all facets of the job performance and doesn\u2019t meet the legitimate expectations of the employer and as charged here does not do the essential functions of the job.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-12\">So clearly this jury had it within its purview to say there is no handicap here because there was more than enough evidence to support that proposition. Clearly, the doctors who treated plaintiff in 1995 never showed up. The jury is entitled to consider that and they did apparently. [The expert\u2019s] examinations occurred in the year 2000 \u2014 who knows what was going on with this man in 2000, but that\u2019s five years after the fact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-13\">Plaintiff now appeals on the following grounds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-14\">\n<em>POINT i</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-15\">PLAINTIFF PROVED HE WAS HANDICAPPED UNDER LAD WITH UN-CONTROVERTED EXPERT MEDICAL TESTIMONY CONSISTENT WITH THE STATUTORY CRITERIA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-16\">A. Handicap Under LAD</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-17\">B. Medical Testimony Was Essential To Prove Handicap.

The Jury Should Not Have Decided Any Element Of Plaintiffs <em>Prima Fade </em>Case, Including Whether Plaintiff Was Handicapped</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWg\">\n<em>POINT II</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-6\">PLAINTIFF PROVED HE WAS QUALIFIED TO DO HIS JOB</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ax3\">\n<em>POINT III</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-7\">THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN ITS JURY CHARGE AND SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES NOS. 1 AND 3 REGARDING, RESPECTIVELY, PROOF OF HANDICAP AND PROOF THAT PLAINTIFF WAS QUALIFIED TO PERFORM HIS JOB UNDER LAD[.] THESE ERRORS ENTITLED PLAINTIFF TO A NEW TRIAL TO AVOID AN UNJUST RESULT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AP\">A The Trial Court Asserted Several Times That Plaintiffs One and Only Hurdle Was To Prove Handicap</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-8\">B.

Plaintiff Is Entitled To A New Trial To Avoid An Unjust Result</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-13\">1. Plaintiff Made His Position Known With Respect To The Legal Errors Made By The Trial Court</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-14\">2. Plaintiff Is Entitled To A New Trial In The Interests of Justice</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b118-16\">In Point I, plaintiff essentially argues that the jury\u2019s verdict was against the weight of the evidence. He contends that because the experts for both plaintiff and defendant agreed that plaintiff had ADD and other psychiatric disorders, the judge should have determined that he was handicapped as a matter of law and not submitted the question to the jury. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-17\">The burdens of proof and persuasion are well established for LAD cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-18\">New Jersey courts have traditionally sought guidance from the substantive and procedural standards established under federal law. Specifically, our courts have adopted the burden-shifting framework articulated in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 <em>U.S. </em>792, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>1817, 36 L.Ed2d 668 (1973), to prove disparate treatment under LAD. Under that framework, a plaintiff must first prove a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination. To do so, a plaintiff must show that he or she (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>belongs to a protected class; (2) applied for or held a position for which he or she was objectively qualified; (3) was not hired or was terminated from that position; and that (4) the employer sought to, or did fill the position with a similarly-qualified person. The establishment of the <em>prima, facie </em>case gives rise to a presumption of discrimination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-6\">Once that threshold has been met, the burden of going forward shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, non-diseriminatoiy reason for the adverse employment action. After the employer does so, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show that the employer\u2019s proffered reason was merely a pretext for discrimination. To prove pretext, however, a plaintiff must do more than simply show that the employer\u2019s reason was false; he or she must also demonstrate that the employer was motivated by discriminatory intent. Thus, under the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework, a plaintiff retains the ultimate burden of persuasion at all times; only the burden of proof shifts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-7\"><em>[Viscik </em>v. <em>Fowler Equipment Company, </em>173 N.J. 1, 13-14, 800 A.2d 826 (2002) (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">The LAD is remedial social legislation. Our Supreme Court has stated repeatedly that it must be liberally construed. In <em>Andersen v. Exxon Co., </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>483, 495, 446 A.2d 486 (1982), our Supreme Court made it clear that the definition of \u201chandicapped\u201d is not limited to \u201csevere\u201d disabilities:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-9\">We reject such an interpretation of the New Jersey statute. We need not limit this remedial legislation to the halt, the maimed or the blind. The law prohibits unlawful discrimination against those suffering from physical disability. As remedial legislation, the Law Against Discrimination should be construed \u201cwith that high degree of liberality which comports with the preeminent social significance of its purposes and objects.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-10\">[(Citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-11\">The issue squarely before us is whether the trial judge erred in denying plaintiffs motion for a new trial when the expert witnesses for both plaintiff and defendant agreed that plaintiff suffered from ADD and other psychiatric disorders. In other words, was the trial judge compelled to find that plaintiff was handicapped as a matter of law or was the jury free to make its own determination from the evidence as a whole, disregarding the experts\u2019 testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-12\">We have little doubt that ADD and depression, like alcoholism and other psychiatric disorders, qualifies as a \u201chandicap\u201d under the LAD. <em>Clowes v.

Nothing in those decisions, however, indicates that undisputed expert testimony removes the question from the province of the jury. Indeed, there is a consistent body of law to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">In <em>Waterson v. General Motors Corp., </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>238, 248, 544 A.2d 357 (1988), the Supreme Court held that \u201c[a] jury has no duty to give controlling effect to any or all of the testimony provided by the parties\u2019 experts, <em>even in the absence of evidence to the contrary.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). In <em>Poliseno v. General Motors Corp., </em>328 <em>N.J.Super. </em>41, 59, 744 A.2d 679 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>165 <em>N.J. </em>138, 754 A.2d 1213 (2000), we held that where there is sufficient evidence in the record to the contrary, the jury need not accept the expert\u2019s testimony in whole or in part. In <em>Ardis v. Reed, </em>86 <em>N.J.Super. </em>323, 330, 206 A.2d 890 (App.Div.), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>46 <em>N.J. </em>1, 214 A.2d 313 (1965), we rejected plaintiffs argument that \u201c \u2018total disregard of the plaintiffs\u2019 medical testimony, the credibility of which stands unimpeached, is of itself ground for a new trial,\u2019 \u201d where there was sufficient evidence in the record \u201cto nullify plaintiffs\u2019 contentions.\u201d \u201cWhere [people] of reason and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>fairness may entertain differing views as to the truth of testimony, whether it be uneontradicted, uncontroverted or even undisputed, evidence of such a character is for the jury.\u201d <em>Ferdinand v. Agricultural Ins. Co. of Watertown, N.Y., </em>22 <em>N.J. </em>482, 494, 126 A.2d 323 (1956). In <em>State v. Scelfo, </em>58 <em>N.J.Super. </em>472, 477-78, 156 A.2d 714 (App.Div.1959), <em>certif. denied, </em>31 <em>N.J. </em>555, 158 A.2d 454 (1960), we held that \u201cuncontradicted opinions of ... highly qualified medical experts\u201d were not dispositive on the issue of insanity because \u201csuch testimony is subject to the test of credibility in light of the attendant facts. Also, it is in parity with lay opinion testimony in that the jury is entitled to give each equal weight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Here, the trial judge gave the model jury instruction on assessing the credibility of expert testimony and weighing it together with all other evidence. Notwithstanding the uncontroverted diagnosis of ADD, there was a substantial body of evidence from which the jury could conclude that plaintiff was not handicapped: (1) plaintiff was very successful academically, graduating <em>summa cum laude </em>from junior college and earning his bachelor\u2019s degree in the sciences; (2) he performed job responsibilities well, frequently exceeding his job requirements during his first seventeen years at Ciba; and (3) he was well liked among his coworkers and Ciba\u2019s clients. This evidence directly contradicted Dr. Fernandez\u2019s testimony describing ADD symptoms, diagnostic criteria, and life-time duration.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">We hold that a trial judge is not compelled to find as a matter of law that a plaintiff is handicapped under the LAD solely because of uncontroverted medical evidence where there is sufficient evidence in the record to support a contrary finding by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">Plaintiff next argues that he was \u201cqualified to do his job.\u201d Clearly, the evidence demonstrates that during plaintiff\u2019s seventeen years of prior performance at Ciba he frequently exceeded his job requirements and that he was a \u201cvalued contributor\u201d to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>company in 1992, 1993 and 1994. Question 3, posed to the jury with plaintiff\u2019s consent, specifically asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-5\">Was plaintiff, Gregory J. Domurat, performing the essential functions of his job at a level that met defendant Ciba Specialty Chemical Corporation\u2019s legitimate expectations at the time of his termination?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">The jury answered, \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">Nothing in the LAD protects employees from termination if they are not performing the essential functions of the employer\u2019s legitimate expectations.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-8\">The Law does not prohibit discrimination against the handicapped where \u201cthe nature and extent of the handicap reasonably precludes the performance of the particular employment.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>10:5-4.1; <em>see also N.J.S.A </em>10:5-2.1. (the Law-does not \u201cprevent the termination or change of the employment of any person who in the opinion of his employer, reasonably arrived at, is unable to perform adequately his duties.\u201d)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-9\"><em>[Clowes, supra, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>at 594, 538 A.2d 794.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">Moreover, an employer may terminate a handicapped employee where the handicap \u201cin fact impedes job performance. There should be no second-guessing the employer.\u201d <em>Andersen, supra, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>at 496, 446 A.2d 486.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-11\">The evidence clearly demonstrated that at the time he was terminated, plaintiff was unable or unwilling to perform his job responsibilities. When he was returned to a full work schedule on August 25,1995, there were no medical restrictions indicted by his own treating psychiatrist, Dr. Vasquez; he had rejected substance abuse treatment; he was given clearly delineated responsibilities during his probationary period; and he was granted extensions of time to complete his work. Nevertheless, his performance continued to deteriorate. The jury\u2019s finding that plaintiff was not performing the essential functions of his job at the time of his termination was adequately supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-12\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b122-13\">Plaintiff next argues that the trial court erred in its jury charge and jury interrogatories 1 and 3. Plaintiff did not object to the charge at trial, nor did he object to the verdict form, indicating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>that trial counsel perceived no prejudice would result. <em>State v. Wilbely, </em>63 <em>N.J. </em>420, 422, 307 A.2d 608 (1973). Failure to object to the charges requires plaintiff to make a showing of plain error on appeal. <em>R. </em>1:7-2 and <em>R. </em>2:10-2. To demonstrate plain error, plaintiff must show that the unobjected to jury charge and verdict form was \u201cof such a nature as to have been clearly capable of producing an unjust result.\u201d <em>R. </em>2:10-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">The purpose of jury interrogatories is \u201cto require the jury to specifically consider the essential issues of the case, to clarify the court\u2019s charge to the jury, and to clarify the meaning of the verdict and permit error to be localized.\u201d <em>Sons of Thunder, Inc. v. Borden, Inc., </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>396, 419, 690 A.2d 575 (1997). Jury interrogatories \u201care not grounds for a reversal unless they were misleading, confusing or ambiguous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 418, 690 A.2d 575. Here, jury interrogatories 1 and 3 accurately reflected the elements plaintiff was required to prove and stated properly the time frames the jurors should consider in making their determination. <em>Viscik, supra, </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>at 10, 800 A.2d 826.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">When reviewing a claim of error in a jury charge, we must consider the charge as a whole to determine whether it \u201cadequately eonvey[s] the law to the jury and do[es] not mislead or confuse.\u201d <em>Zappasodi v. State, </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>83, 89, 761 A.2d 96 (App.Div.2000). Our scope of review is limited to whether the jury charge, as a whole, was capable of producing an unjust result. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">Plaintiff claims that the trial judge misstated the law and confused the jury by using the term \u201cADD symptoms\u201d in the charge and \u201cmay have led the jury to conclude that plaintiff was not handicapped in 1995 unless his handicaps[,] which all the psychiatrists said plaintiff had all his life, manifested themselves to his employer, Ciba, in a special way in 1995.\u201d We find no merit in this argument. As we have indicated herein, the evidence supported the jury\u2019s conclusion that plaintiff was not handicapped in 1995 because it was contrary to the experts\u2019 repeated testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>that ADD was a lifelong disability that causes \u201cdisruption in two areas of functioning \u2014 social, academic or occupational.\u201d The evidence adequately demonstrated that plaintiff functioned well in all three areas prior to 1991 and from 1992 to 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Plaintiff further complains that the judge improperly instructed the jury that it could disregard the experts\u2019 testimony while instructing that they could find plaintiff handicapped by \u201ccompetent legal evidence in the record to support a medical diagnosis.\u201d This charge is consistent with our holding that the jury may do precisely what they were instructed to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">Based upon our holdings herein, we find the remainder of plaintiffs arguments without sufficient merit to warrant further discussion. <em>R. </em>2:11 \u2014 3(e)(1)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b108-8\"> In this appeal, plaintiff does not argue that he is handicapped by virtue of Lyme disease or that he was discriminated against on the basis of age.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
