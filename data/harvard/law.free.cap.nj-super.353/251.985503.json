(count four); one count of distributing marijuana, in a quantity less than one ounce, to an undercover police officer, within 1,000 feet of school property, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-5a(l) and 2C:35-7 (count five); and one count of soliciting a person seventeen years of age or younger, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-4, 2C:35-5a, and 2C:35-6 (count six).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-11\">The evidence underlying the charges was seized during the execution of a search warrant on March 7, 2001. Defendant filed a motion to suppress the evidence and the trial court granted the motion. We granted leave to appeal and affirm the order suppressing the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-12\">The issues presented are whether a no-knock search warrant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>was justified by the police affidavit presented to the issuing court,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and, if not, whether the circumstances preceding the entry into defendant\u2019s residence were sufficiently emergent to justify the no-knock entry of defendant\u2019s apartment under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article I, paragraph 7 of the New Jersey Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Here, the motion judge essentially concluded that there was no particularized reasonable basis articulated in the affidavit to support the issuance of the warrant to justify authorizing a no-knock entry of defendant\u2019s apartment, and that no exigent circumstances existed immediately prior to the police entry of the apartment to justify dispensing with the knock and announce rule. Accordingly, the judge suppressed the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">These are the pertinent facts derived from the suppression hearing, the affidavit submitted in support of the warrant, and the warrant itself. On March 7, 2001, Detective Victor Martinez of the West New York Police Department submitted an affidavit to the court and obtained a search warrant for apartment 13 located on the first floor of a building at 453 62nd Street, West New York. The targeted location and occupant are described in paragraph 10 of the affidavit in support of the warrant which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-7\">Based on all the facts contained herein, the affiant has probable cause to believe and does believe that evidence pertaining to the distribution and possession of Marijuana can be found at 453-62nd St.[,] apt[J 13[,] West New York[,] NJ 07093. Described as a gray brick multi-dwelling apartment building with the numbers 453 above exterior doors and a black fire escape on the 62nd St. side. On the person of one (Jane Doe) Hispanic female described as a 5'06\" light skinned Hispanic in her early 30\u2019s with Brown hair below the shoulder length and weighing approx. 180 lbs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">The probable cause for the issuance of the warrant consisted of information obtained from a confidential informant who had proved reliable in the past, two controlled buys of marijuana from the premises to an undercover police officer, as well as \u201cresidential complaints from concerned citizens\u201d concerning a \u201chigh volume of people entering and exiting [the apartment] at all hours through<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>out the night every night of [the] week.\u201d The concluding paragraph of the affidavit requested \u201cthat the affiant be permitted to execute th[e] search warrant during the day time or the night time without being required to knock and announce [his] authority and intention.\u201d In support of the no-knock provision, the affidavit provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-5\">Due to the very nature of drug trafficking, it has been the Affiant\u2019s experience that these illegal activities will take place at any hour of the day or night depending on the availability of the drugs and the needs of the purchaser. Therefore, the affiant must be guided accordingly and execute the search warrant when circumstances indicate that the objectives of the seareh warrant can be best achieved. Furthermore, based on the Affiant\u2019s experience in this field of this investigation, drug traffickers are very sensitive to the possibility of activities such as the execution of a search warrant by law enforcement authorities. Prearranged plans exist both for the destruction of the evidence and for the escape from the premises of the subjects prior to their apprehension and the seizure of contraband. Firearms are also commonly kept in such premises for protection from law enforcement and from competitors. Therefore, in order to gain entrance to the premises in a manner most conducive to the proper and thorough seizure of evidence and to minimize the danger to and enhance the safety of the executing officer, it will be necessary to execute this Search Warrant without knocking and announcing our authority and intention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Based on the affidavit, the court issued the warrant on a finding of probable cause and also authorized the no-knock entry into the premises to be searched.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">On March 7, 2001, prior to the execution of the warrant, the police \u201cset up\u201d surveillance at a location near the apartment which permitted them to observe activities both outside and inside the building, including defendant\u2019s apartment. Detective Sergio Herrera was \u201c[the] cover officer for the entry team for the execution of the warrant.\u201d As \u201ccover officer,\u201d Detective Herrera\u2019s duty was to observe activities occurring in front of the target location, such as drug sales, and to watch for the presence of \u201clookouts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">Detective Herrera testified that at approximately 4:45 p.m. he observed a young man who appeared to be a juvenile (the juvenile) exit apartment 13 and engage in a suspected drug transaction with two other juveniles on the street. After the transaction, the juvenile walked away with the other two juveniles. Five or ten <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>minutes later, the juvenile returned, entered the building and was seen re-entering the targeted apartment. At approximately 5:05 p.m., the juvenile returned to the street where he was again observed engaging in another suspected drug transaction with the occupants of a blue Honda Accord. After that transaction, the juvenile walked away from the building. The officers waited a short time to execute the warrant to assure \u201che had departed the area to make sure he didn\u2019t go in and knock on the door [and] run back in to advise whoever was inside the apartment to alert them to destroy the evidence.\u201d At 5:21 p.m., the warrant was executed without the police first announcing their presence and defendant was arrested. A search of the apartment disclosed drug paraphernalia, currency totaling $246, and suspected marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">At 5:30 p.m., after the police had entered the apartment, the juvenile was arrested on Bergenline Avenue between 61st and 62nd Streets in the middle of yet another drug transaction. At the time of his arrest, the juvenile was unaware that the warrant had been executed or that the police had entered defendant\u2019s apartment. After his arrest, a cell phone the juvenile was carrying was confiscated. The cell phone displayed the telephone number of the targeted premises, suggesting that the juvenile may have been attempting to call defendant to alert her to the police presence. In addition to the cell phone, the police recovered plastic bags containing suspected marijuana and currency in the possession of the juvenile.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">At the suppression hearing, the motion judge determined that the no-knock provision was invalid because it did not contain more than generalized suspicions and \u201cboilerplate language\u201d to justify dispensing with the knock and announce rule iterated by the Supreme Court in <em>State v. Johnson, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>608, 775 A.2d 1273 (2001). Attempting to justify the no-knock provision in the warrant, the State had urged the judge to draw an inference from the fact that the building was described in the affidavit as \u201ca multidwelling apartment building ... [with] a black fire escape\u201d to conclude that the \u201cdrugs could be gotten rid of or the person could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>have gotten out of that apartment.\u201d The judge disagreed, stating that \u201c[e\u2019jvery building in the country has either a fire escape or a window or something from which somebody can either throw the drugs out or jump out.\u201d Therefore, he concluded there was no \u201cparticularized suspicion\u201d to support the conclusion \u201cthat there [was] going to be destruction of the evidence or that the officer\u2019s safety is at issue or the arrest or seizure of the evidence is going to be compromised.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">In addition, the warrant provision aside, the judge determined that the State had failed to demonstrate that exigent circumstances existed to justify the unannounced entry of the apartment, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-7\">Although the State referred to the juvenile as a look-out in its brief, Detective Herrera never testified that the juvenile was, in fact, a look-out or that the police had to dispense with \u201cknoek and announce\u201d because of the juvenile\u2019s presence at the scene and his ability to immediately communicate the police entry. On the contrary, the juvenile had disappeared and was so oblivious to his alleged obligation as a look-out that he was unaware of the police raid until nine minutes after it had begun.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">Accordingly, the judge concluded that \u201cthe State was unable to show the necessary degree of urgency (or for that matter, any degree of urgency) that would equate to a reasonable belief that evidence was about to be destroyed or that the Officers\u2019 safety was in peril.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">On appeal, the State raises the following arguments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-10\">POINT!</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-11\">TRIAL COURT ERRED IN SUPPRESSING EVIDENCE SEIZED BECAUSE THE POLICE HAD PROBABLE CAUSE AND EXIGENT CIRCUMSTANCES.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-12\">A. DEFENDANT DID NOT CHALLENGE THE PROBABLE CAUSE DETERMINATION, BUT RATHER ATTACKED THE \u201cNO-KNOCK\u201d PROVISION CONTAINED IN THE WARRANT.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-13\">B. FAILURE TO FULLY ARTICULATE THE BASIS FOR A \u201cNO-KNOCK\u201d PROVISION DID NOT MERIT SUPPRESSION BECAUSE A REASONABLE DEGREE OF EXIGENCY EXISTED TO JUSTIFY POLICE ENTRY WITHOUT KNOCKING AND ANNOUNCING.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-14\">As a threshold matter, we note the standard governing our review of the issues presented on appeal. To the extent the motion judge\u2019s rulings rested upon factual findings, those determi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>nations \u201cshould not ordinarily be disturbed where \u2018there is substantial evidence to support [his] implicit finding[s].\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Locurto, 157 N.J. </em>463, 471, 724 A.2d 234 (1999) (quoting <em>Meshinsky v. Nichols Yacht Sales, Inc., </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>464, 475, 541 A.2d 1063 (1988)). However, where the rulings are based upon legal conclusions, the judge is afforded no deference on appeal. <em>See Manalapan Realty, L.P. v. Tp. Comm. of Manalapan, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995) (citing <em>State v. Brown, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>595, 604, 573 A.2d 886 (1990)). We are satisfied that Judge\u2019 Schultz\u2019s factual findings are supported by substantial credible evidence in the record and that his legal conclusions are correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">\u201cIn executing a valid search warrant containing an invalid authorization for a no-knock entry into defendant\u2019s residence, the police were in the same position they would have been in if the warrant did not authorize a no-knock entry.\u201d <em>State v. Bilancio, </em>318 <em>N.J.Super. </em>408, 420, 724 A.2d 278 (App.Div.1999). That is, \u201cthe police still could have entered defendant\u2019s apartment without knocking provided exigent circumstances existed justifying the entry.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">The United States Supreme Court has \u201cheld squarely that the method of an officer\u2019s entry into a dwelling \u2018is an element of the reasonable inquiry under the Fourth Amendment.\u2019\u201d <em>Johnson, supra, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>at 616, 775 A.2d 1273 (quoting <em>Wilson v. Arkansas, </em>514 <em>U.S. </em>927, 931, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>1914, 1916, 131 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d 976, 985 (1995)). In <em>Johnson, </em>our Supreme Court held that the application for a search warrant in that case did not set forth sufficient specific facts to justify the issuance of a no-knock warrant. In evaluating the propriety of a no-knock entry under the particular warrant provision there, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-7\">[T]o justify a \u201cno-knock\u201d entry police must have a reasonable suspicion that knocking and announcing their presence, under the particular circumstances, would be dangerous or futile, or that it would inhibit the effective investigation of the crime by, for example, allowing the destruction of evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-8\"><em>[Johnson, supra, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>at 617, 775 A.2d 1273 (quoting <em>Richards v. Wisconsin, </em>520 <em>U.S. </em>385, 394, <em>117 </em>S.Ct. 1416, 1421-22, 137 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d 615, 624).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>The Court further observed that although the \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d standard is a less demanding standard than probable cause, there must be articulated in the warrant application \u201cat least a minimal level of objective justification\u201d for police to enter a dwelling unannounced. <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Illinois v. Wardlow, </em>528 <em>U.S. </em>119, 123, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>673, 676, 145 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d 570, 576 (2000)). In other words, more than \u201ca suspicion or \u2018hunch\u2019 is required.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 618, 775 A.2d 1273 (quoting <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 <em>U.S. </em>1, 27, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>1868, 1883, 20 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d 889, 909 (1968)). While this standard may not be \u201chigh,\u201d it must be satisfied \u201cwhenever the reasonableness of a no-knock entry is challenged.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Richards, supra, </em>520 <em>U.S. </em>at 394-95, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1422, 137 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>at 622).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">The <em>Johnson </em>Court then set forth the \u201ctenets\u201d to be followed in knock and announce cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-7\">First, to justify a no-knock warrant provision, a police officer must have a reasonable, particularized suspicion that a no-knock entry is required to prevent the destruction of evidence, to protect the officer\u2019s safety, or to effectuate the arrest or seizure of evidence. Second, the police officer must articulate the reasons for that suspicion and may base those reasons on the totality of the circumstances with which he or she is faced. Third, although the officer\u2019s assessment of the circumstances may be based on his or her experience and knowledge, the officer must articulate a minimal level of objective justification to support the no-knock entry, meaning it may not be based on a mere hunch.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-8\"><em>[Johnson, supra, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>at 619, 775 A.2d 1273.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">In sum, the Court held that the knock and announce rule requires the State to articulate a sufficient reason \u201cspecific to the crime, to the person under investigation, or to some other permissible factor, that leads them reasonably to believe that destruction of evidence is more than a hypothetical possibility\u201d in order to obtain a warrant authorizing an unannounced entry into a dwelling. <em>Id. </em>at 620, 775 A.2d 1273. However, in invalidating the warrant provision there, the Court made clear that \u201cthe police ... in an appropriate case, [could] justify a no-knock entry absent a specific warrant provision when presented with exigent circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 624, 775 A.2d 1273 (citing <em>State v. Goodson, </em>316 <em>N.J.Super. </em>296, 720 A.2d 381 (App.Div.1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">In this case, the State argues that the facts and circumstances justify the unannounced entry into defendant\u2019s apartment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>despite the invalid no-knoek provision in the warrant. The State hypothesizes a scenario in which it claims there was a risk defendant would escape and the drugs would be destroyed if the police had announced its presence. It essentially asserts that the affiant\u2019s description of the building as a \u201cmulti-dwelling apartment building\u201d with a \u201cfire escape\u201d created an adequate basis for the no-knock entry. However, as the motion judge correctly observed, because those general facts standing alone could apply in every case that did not involve a single-family dwelling, it did not justify the no-knock entry of defendant\u2019s dwelling. We agree. Without more information concerning the configuration of the building and its occupants, \u201cspecific to the crime [and] to the person under investigation,\u201d the State cannot justify the unannounced entry here based on the description of the building. <em>Johnson, supra, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>at 620, 775 A.2d 1273.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Nor does the fact that the juvenile who had been selling marijuana outside the premises and could have served as a lookout had he been present at the precise moment the warrant was executed, \u201csatisfy the destructibility-of-evidence exception to the knoek-and-announce rule[.]\u201d <em>Ibid. See State v. DeLane, </em>207 <em>N.J.Super. </em>45, 503 A.2d 903 (App.Div.1986). Although the juvenile was a potential lookout who might have warned defendant of the imminent execution of the search warrant, in this case he was not acting as a lookout immediately prior to its execution as evidenced by the fact he was selling drugs at a different location and was not even present when the police actually entered defendant\u2019s apartment. Therefore, he could not have alerted defendant of the imminent arrival of the police because he was unaware of it. Hence, the police had no reasonable basis for believing that the juvenile was aware of the execution as it unfolded so as to create an emergent situation justifying the unannounced entry by the police. The fact that the cell phone displayed defendant\u2019s telephone number is immaterial in light of the timing of the execution which occurred nine minutes before the juvenile even became aware that the police had entered the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>We conclude, therefore, that the juvenile\u2019s conduct prior to the execution of the warrant did not create the type of exigency required to create a \u201creasonable, particularized suspicion\u201d by the police that the drugs would be destroyed or defendant\u2019s arrest thwarted if they had announced their presence. <em>Cf. State v. Alvarez, </em>238 <em>N.J.Super. </em>560, 568, 570 A.2d 459 (App.Div.1990). Moreover, if we were to condone this unannounced entry, the purposes of the knock and announce rule would be completely frustrated. <em>See Johnson, supra, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>at 616, 775 A.2d 1273 (listing rationale undergirding the rule: (1) to decrease the potential for violence; (2) to protect privacy; and (3) to prevent the physical destruction of the occupant\u2019s property).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">In sum, given the facts and circumstances surrounding the no-knock entry in this case, the police officers did not act in an objectively reasonable manner under the Fourth Amendment and Article I, paragraph 7 of the New Jersey Constitution when they entered defendant\u2019s apartment without first announcing their presence because no exigency existed justifying the no-knock entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Accordingly, the order suppressing the evidence is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b284-9\"> The identity of the issuing court is unclear in the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
