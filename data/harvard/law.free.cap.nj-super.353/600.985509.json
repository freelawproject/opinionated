The defendants argue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-7\">[T]he Trial Court incorrectly determined that the New Jersey Constitution affords greater protection in this area than the United States Constitution. Second, the Trial Court inappropriately clothed extracurricular activities with near constitutional protections. Third, the Trial Court also failed to recognize the diminished constitutional rights of public school students. Finally, the Trial Court\u2019s holding that random drug testing cannot proceed unless a school\u2019s drug problem exceeds the national norm and the targeted group of students uses drugs more than the general population of students is bad law, bad policy and impractical.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-8\">In this case, students, with parental consent, voluntarily agree to undergo random testing as a condition precedent to participation in extracurricular activities. Accordingly, any claimed constitutional infringement has been freely waived. In the alternative, under the appropriate \u201cspecial needs\u201d balancing test the notable goal of deterring drug use certainly outweighs the minimal intrusion of a confidential urine analysis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-10\">The complaint was filed by parents of three Hunterdon Central students, Shaun Joye, Melissa Greiner and Anna Zdepski. At the time of the complaint, Joye was beginning his junior year, and Greiner and Zdepski were starting their senior year at Hunterdon Central. All three students were engaged in extracurricular activities and wished to continue to do so. All three were also seeking parking permits to drive to and from the school.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-11\">According to the certification of Lisa Brady, the principal of Hunterdon Central, there are approximately 2,500 students enrolled in grades 9 \u2014 12, and Hunterdon Central has been vigorous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>in its efforts \u201cto deter the use of illegal drugs and alcohol by students.\u201d It provides \u201cdrug and alcohol awareness programs\u201d in classes and through student assemblies. It has also established a Student Assistance Program (\u201cSAP\u201d) which employs full time professionals to counsel students and their families. From time to time, the school has conducted \u201cdog sniffing sweeps\u201d and \u201clocker searches\u201d in conjunction with the prosecutor\u2019s office and has implemented \u201csuspicion-based\u201d drug testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">Despite this, the drug problem continued to grow, and in the 1996 to 1997 school year, thirty students were tested for drugs on \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d and twenty-seven tested positive. Ms. Brady also became aware of two students snorting heroin on school premises in 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">According to the certification of John Brasell, Jr., the president of Hunterdon Central Regional High School Board of Education, the Board commissioned the Rocky Mountain Behavioral Science Institute, Inc. (\u201cRMBSI\u201d) of Fort Collins, Colorado to conduct a study \u201cto determine whether there indeed was a problem and, if so, the nature and extent of it.\u201d According to the RMBSI survey, over a third of Hunterdon Central students between grades 10 and 12 had used marijuana and over 10% had used hallucinogens; 12% of sophomores had used stimulants; 12% of juniors had used hallucinogens; and 13% of seniors had used cocaine. The survey also revealed that a substantial portion of the student body perceived that illegal drugs were readily available, including 38% of seniors who reported that heroin was readily \u201cavailable.\u201d The perception by Hunterdon Central seniors of the widespread availability of heroin exceeded the national average, which was 35%.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">In response, in 1997 the school board promulgated a random drug testing policy for student athletes that required consent by a parent or guardian to allow random drug testing as a condition of participation in the sport. A public meeting was held in October 1997, to discuss a comprehensive policy. David Evans, an expert on teen drug and alcohol abuse and the father of a child at Hunterdon Central, gave a presentation explaining drug testing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>and answered questions and concerns raised by parents. Based on Mr. Evans\u2019 suggestion, a community Task Force was established \u201cto evaluate [the] current drug testing procedure ... and present recommendations for optimization to the Board of Education ____\u201d Evans was appointed as Chair, and Joan Greiner, an opponent of the drug testing and one of the plaintiffs herein, was appointed as Vice-Chair.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">Evans certified that the Task Force met throughout 1998 and gathered data from the school SAP personnel and law enforcement agencies. It reviewed the substance abuse program at the school, including its ongoing suspicion-based drug testing and the random drug testing of athletes. The Task Force also \u201creviewed national studies on student drug abuse and received information from school administrators, coaches, the vice-principals, the school nurse and others as to the nature and extent of the drug problem at the school____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">Mr. Evans further certified that the Task Force also obtained law enforcement data from the towns that \u201cfeed students to\u201d Hunterdon Central. He certified that the \u201cdata included arrest reports, overdoses and other drug and alcohol induced mayhem.\u201d He states that in 1996-97, there were forty-one juveniles arrested for drug use with three deaths from heroin overdoses.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">Jan Block, a Student Assistance/Substance Abuse Coordinator at the school, certified that she \u201cobserved a steady increase in the number of students using drugs and a major increase in the frequency and amount of drugs\u201d from 1987 through the 1999-2000 school year when she retired.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">A \u201cfollow-up survey\u201d by RMBSI in the 1999-2000 school year showed that drug use by Hunterdon Central students was reduced.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, the percentage of students who have used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>marijuana over the last twelve months among the general population (5% of ninth graders; 21% of tenth graders; 30% of eleventh graders and 33% of twelfth graders) was significant and above the levels of use by athletes (less than 5%) who were subject to the drug testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">The manner in which defendants propose to test students was not contested, and the trial judge provided a concise synopsis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-6\">The random drug testing was proposed to be conducted in the same manner in which it had been conducted on student athletes for the past three years. Specifically, each week the Athletic Director contacts a grade level Vice Principal and oversees the drawing from a box of ID numbers on the morning of testing. Parents are called to be informed that their child has been selected to be tested and they are given the right to attend if they so chose. The Athletic Director then contacts the appropriate grade level Vice Principal and the student\u2019s schedule is pulled to ascertain the least disruptive time for the testing. At that time, the student is contacted by the Vice Principal and informed that he or she has been selected for a random drug test. The Vice Principal then accompanies the student to the nearest Health Office where the student is interviewed by the nurse and is required to provide a urine sample. The sample is provided in a rest room with the door closed. The sample is tested for adulteration. If the test is positive, the parents are called if they are not already there. A second test based on the sample provided is then performed by Lab Corp., an outside testing laboratory. Lab Corp. conducts a gas chromatography mass spectrometry (\u201cGC/MS\u201d) test which lists the exact chemical nature of the drug. The results of that test are returned to the school within 24 hours. The second test is designed to ensure against false positives.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">Although all the students originally named in the complaint have graduated, the case involves a significant question of public importance involving a program the defendants still seek to implement, and we have elected to decide the issue addressed by the trial judge. <em>See, e.g., IMO Application for Commitment of Geraghty, </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>209, 212, 343 A.2d 737 (1975); <em>Advance Electric Co., Inc. v. Montgomery Twp. Bd. of Ed., </em>351 <em>N.J.Super. </em>160, 166, 797 A.2d 216 (App.Div.2002). <em>Cf. Chandler v. Miller, </em>520 <em>U.S. </em>305, 311, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>1295, 1300, n. 2, 137 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>513, 522 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">There is no dispute before us that the drug testing program involved in this ease would not violate the federal constitution. Plaintiffs so conceded in a letter addressed to us following the decision in June of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Board of Education of Independent School District No. 92 of Pottawatomie County v. Earls, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>2559, 153 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d 735 (2002), which held that random suspicionless drug testing of high school students who participate in extracurricular activities does not violate the Fourth Amendment to the Federal Constitution. Plaintiffs write that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-9\">[b]ecause the standard used by the [United States Supreme! Court in <em>Earls </em>is so inapposite to the standard required by the New Jersey Constitution\u2019s recognition of heightened privacy rights, the decision of the majority in <em>Earls </em>should not affect the outcome of this case. If anything, the decision in <em>Earls </em>highlights the need for New Jersey courts to act independently when enforcing the rights of New Jersey citizens under the State Constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">In <em>Earls, </em>Justice Thomas, writing for the majority, held that Techumseh, Oklahoma\u2019s student drug testing \u201c[pjolicy is a reasonable means of furthering the School District\u2019s important interest in preventing and deterring drug use among its schoolchildren\u201d and noted that there was a reduced expectation of privacy among students in a school setting. <em>Earls, supra, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2569, 153 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d at-. The Court went on to note that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-14\">[significantly, this Court has previously held that \u201cspecial needs\u201d inhere in the public school context. See <em>Vernonia, supra, </em>at 653, 515 <em>U.S. </em>646, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>2386, 132 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>564; <em>T.L.O., supra, </em>at 339-340, 469 <em>U.S. </em>325, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>733, 83 L.Ed.2d 720. While schoolchildren do not shed their constitutional rights when they enter the schoolhouse, see <em>Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School Dist., </em>393 <em>U.S. </em>503, 506, 89 <em>S.Ct. </em>733, 21 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>731 (*1969), \u201cFourth Amendment rights ... are different in public schools than elsewhere; the \u2018reasonableness\u2019 inquiry cannot disregard the schools\u2019 custodial and tutelary responsibility for children.\u201d <em>Vernonia, supra, </em>at 656, 515 <em>U.S. </em>646, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>2386, 132 L.Ed.2d 564. In particular, a finding of individualized suspicion may not be necessary when a school conducts drug testing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-15\"><em>[Earls, supra, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2564-65, 153 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>at-.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-16\">The Court thus rejected a claim that a constitutionally recognized \u201cprivacy interest\u201d was violated by the random testing of students <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>involved in extracurricular activities. The Court then rejected a claim that the manner in which the test was conducted by the Techumseh School District violated constitutional values. <em>Earls, supra, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2566-67, 153 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d at -. The Court found significant that the faculty monitor \u201cwaits outside the closed restroom stall for the student to produce a sample\u201d and that the sample was given \u201cbehind a closed stall\u201d before being sealed and sent for testing. <em>Earls, supra, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2566, 153 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>at-. Moreover, the results are kept confidential and \u201care not turned over to any law enforcement authority,\u201d nor result in academic discipline, except for placing restrictions on participation in the extracurricular activity upon testing positive a second time. <em>Earls, supra, </em>- <em>U.S. </em>at-, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2566-67, 153 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>at-. Finally, the Court addressed the record on which the program was based and the \u201cnature and immediacy of the government\u2019s concerns and the efficacy of the Policy in meeting them.\u201d <em>Earls, supra, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2567, 153 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d at-. The Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-15\">[T]his Court has not required a particularized or pervasive drug problem before allowing the government to conduct suspicionless drug testing. For instance, in <em>Von Raab </em>the Court upheld the drug testing of customs officials on a purely preventive basis, without any documented history of drug use by such officials. See 489 <em>U.S. </em>at 673, 109 <em>S.Ct </em>1384, 103 L.Ed.2d 685. In response to the lack of evidence relating to drug use, the Court noted generally that \u201cdrug abuse is one of the most serious problems confronting our society today,\u201d and that programs to prevent and detect drug use among customs officials could not be deemed unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 674, 489 <em>U.S. </em>656, 109 <em>S.Ct </em>1384, 103 L.Ed.2d 685; cf. <em>Skinner, </em>489 <em>U.S. </em>at 607, n. 1, 109 <em>S.Ct </em>1402, 103 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>639 (noting nationwide studies that identified on-the-job alcohol and drug use by railroad employees). Likewise, the need to prevent and deter the substantial harm of childhood drug use provides the necessary immediacy for a school testing policy. Indeed, it would make little sense to require a school district to wait for a substantial portion of its students to begin using drugs before it was allowed to institute a drug testing program designed to deter drug use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-16\">Given the nationwide epidemic of drug use, and the evidence of increased drug use in Tecumseh schools, it was entirely reasonable for the School District to enact this particular drug testing policy. We reject the Court of Appeals\u2019 novel test that \u201cany district seeking to impose a random suspicionless drug testing policy as a condition to participation in a school activity must demonstrate that there is some identifiable drug abuse problem among a sufficient number of those subject to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>testing, such that testing that group of students will actually redress its drug problem.\u201d 242 F.3d at 1278. Among other problems, it would be difficult to administer such a test. As we cannot articulate a threshold level of drug use that would suffice to justify a drug testing program for schoolchildren, we refuse to fashion what would in effect be a constitutional quantum of drug use necessary to show a \u201cdrug problem.\u201d <em>[Earls, supra, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 122 <em>S.Ct </em>at 2568, 153 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d at--.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">Justice Thomas added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-8\">We also reject respondents\u2019 argument that drug testing must presumptively be based upon an individualized reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing because such a testing regime would be less intrusive. See id. at 12-16. In this context, the Fourth Amendment does not require a finding of individualized suspicion, see <em>supra, </em>at 2565, and we decline to impose such a requirement on schools attempting to prevent and detect drug use by students. Moreover, we question whether testing based on individualized suspicion in fact would be less intrusive. Such a regime would place an additional burden on public school teachers who are already tasked with the difficult job of maintaining order and discipline. A program of individualized suspicion might unfairly target members of unpopular groups. The fear of lawsuits resulting from such targeted searches may chill enforcement of the program, rendering it ineffective in combating drug use. See <em>Vernonia, </em>515 <em>U.S., </em>at 663-664, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>2386, 132 L.Ed.2d 564 (offering similar reasons for why \u201ctesting based on \u2018suspicion\u2019 of drug use would not be better, but worse\u201d). In any case, this Court has repeatedly stated that reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment does not require employing the least intrusive means, because \u201c[t]he logic of such elaborate less-restrictive-alternative arguments could raise insuperable barriers to the exercise of virtually all search-and-seizure powers.\u201d <em>Martinez-Fuerte, </em>428 <em>U.S. </em>at 556-557, n. 12, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>3074, 49 L.Ed.2d 1116; see also <em>Skinner, supra, </em>at 624, 489 <em>U.S. </em>602, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>1402, 103 L.Ed.2d 639 (\u201c[A] showing of individualized suspicion is not a constitutional floor, below which a search must be presumed unreasonable\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-9\">Finally, we find that testing students who participate in extracurricular activities is a reasonably effective means of addressing the School District\u2019s legitimate concerns in preventing, deterring, and detecting drug use. While in <em>Vemonia </em>there might have been a closer lit between the testing of athletes and the trial court\u2019s finding that the drug problem was \u201cfueled by the \u2018role model\u2019 effect of athletes\u2019 drug use,\u201d such a finding is not essential to the holding. 515 <em>U.S., </em>at 663, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>2386, 132 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>564; cf. <em>id., </em>at 684-685, 515 <em>U.S. </em>646, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>2386, 132 L.Ed.2d 564 (O\u2019CONNOR, J., dissenting) (questioning the extent of the drug problem, especially as applied to athletes). <em>Vemonia, </em>did not require the school to test the group of students most likely to use drugs, but rather considered the constitutionality of the program in the context of the public school\u2019s custodial responsibilities. Evaluating the Policy in this context, we conclude that the drug testing of Tecumseh students who participate in extracurricular activities effectively serves the School District\u2019s interest in protecting the safety and health of its students.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-10\"><em>[Id.,-U.S. </em>at-, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2568-2569, 153 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>at-.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>The program before us involves the same type of program as that involved in <em>Earls, </em>both with respect to the students tested and the procedure used. In addition, student drivers possessing parking permits are included in the testing, but no one argues that under the <em>Earls </em>test they cannot be included, particularly given the dangers inherent in driving a vehicle especially by a teenager under the influence of a dangerous substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">A reading of the majority and dissenting opinions in <em>Earls </em>leaves no room for debate about the breath or scope of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s opinion or the validity of the Hunterdon Central drug testing program under the Federal Constitution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That is so despite the way its program is conducted, those covered by it, and whether or not there is the lack of \u00e1 record to show some extraordinary or local problem at the school.

The fact of the matter is that there was no epidemic of controlled dangerous substances of the type about which our society is now concerned at the time that the Fourth Amendment or the forerunner of our Article I, par. 7 was adopted. <em>See N.J. Const. of 1844, </em>art. 1, \u00b6 6. Therefore, while our Article I, par. 7 was adopted before the Fourth Amendment was made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and although there is authority for the view that New Jersey courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>should look to our Constitution as the organic law of this State (unless inconsistent with the minimum protection of the Federal Constitution), <em>see Braithwaite, supra, </em>at 27; <em>see also </em>Garibaldi, supra,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we see nothing in the history or background of the State Constitution to warrant a different interpretation on this question, at least when it comes to the legitimate expectation of privacy among school children. To the contrary, the courts of New Jersey, to date, seem to follow the federal Supreme Court when dealing with issues of drug testing. <em>See N.J. Transit PBA Local 301 v. N.J. Transit Corp., </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>581, 546-49, 701 A.2d 1243 (1997) (adopting federal \u201cspecial needs\u201d test under State Constitution) and 556-65 (upholding random testing based on federal standard); <em>see also International Fed\u2019n of Prof l &amp; Technical Eng\u2019rs, Local 194A v.

Paine Webber, Inc., </em>350 <em>N.J.Super. </em>142, 148, 794 A.2d 816 (App.Div.2002), and on that premise we find it difficult to develop a separate path of rights when officers of the State follow what has been promulgated as valid by the United States Supreme Court. Thus, in the absence of any support in the history, language or intent of our Constitutional drafters, we find no basis for concluding that the State Constitution warrants a different approach than that taken by the United States Supreme Court with respect to the question of drug testing in the public schools under the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Law Division and remand the matter for further proceedings in light of the decision under review and our disposition. We note, however, that, despite the preference of courts to avoid deciding constitutional issues, other contentions raised by plaintiffs were not directly addressed. Among other things, plaintiffs asserted that the Hunterdon Central drug testing policy violates the common law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:40A-12 and State regulations governing the issue, and that the Board exceeded its \u201clawful authority\u201d in promulgat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>ing the drug testing policy under review. In his opinion, the trial court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-5\"><em>N.J.S.A </em>18A:40A-1 et seq. in conjunction with <em>N.J.AC. </em>6:29-3 et seq. establishes procedures for implementation of school programs to prevent and treat substance abuse. Specifically, <em>N.J.S.A </em>18A:40A-10 provides that each local board of education must \u201cestablish a comprehensive substance abuse intervention, prevention and treatment referral program\u201d in the schools of its district. Neither the statutory framework nor the adopted rules and regulations passed to effectuate the purposes of the statute limit the kinds of programs a school district may employ to combat drug abuse. Rather <em>N.J.AC. </em>6:29-6.3(c) provides a list of alcohol and drug policies that is non-inclusive. That section specifically states, \u201cAlcohol and other drug policies of district boards of education shall include, <em>but not be limited to, </em>the following components:____\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-6\">Further, in an unpublished decision relied upon by the plaintiffs in their brief to establish that Hunterdon Central\u2019s drug testing program is unconstitutional, the issue of preemption was specifically rejected by the court <em>Wilson v. Ridgefield Parle Board of Education, </em>No. BER-L-7984-97 (Law Div. Oct. 28, 1997). In that case, the plaintiffs also argued that <em>N.J.S.A </em>18A:40A-1 preempted the school\u2019s random drug testing program. The court held that the statute did not preempt the drug testing program because the Legislature gave local school boards the authority to \u201ccreate and enforce substance abuse policies.\u201d The court went on to hold that the Ridgefield Park policy was within the scheme of the legislation. <em>Id. </em>at 9-11. Accordingly, there is little precedent to support the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments that the Legislature has preempted the field.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">Because the preliminary injunction was converted into a permanent injunction without further proceedings, and the briefs on the appeal to us develop only the constitutional issues, we do not pass upon the power of a local Board of Education to develop its own program without either legislative authority or the establishment of statewide standards. Rather, we remand to permit plaintiffs to proceed on any ground not reached by the trial judge. The trial court should also consider inviting the Attorney General to participate in deciding whether a local Board of Education has the authority to implement drug testing in the absence of legislation permitting same or statewide standards promulgated by the Leg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>islature or the Department of Education. We merely hold that the Hunterdon Central school board\u2019s drug testing program is not unconstitutional, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b635-11\"> Brady certified that \"[t]he clear perception was that drug use among athletes had declined significantly because of the possibility of being tested\u201d and that one student explained that the testing \u201ceased the peer pressure by giving student athletes a reason <em>not to </em>participate in use of alcohol and drugs.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b640-8\"> Justice Breyer wrote a separate concurring opinion but joined the majority opinion.

I agree with Judge Guterl that all of the targeted students had an undiminished privacy expectation in their excretory functions and that in the absence of any showing of a particularized special need for the testing, Hunterdon\u2019s random drug testing program is unreasonable and therefore violates Article I, Paragraph 7 of the New Jersey Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">The majority believes that it is bound by <em>Board of </em>Education, <em>Independent School District No. 92 of Pottawatomie County v.

The majority perceives nothing in the history or background of the State Constitution that would allow our courts to interpret the constitutionality of the random drug testing program differently from that of the United States Supreme Court under the Fourth Amendment.

Hunterdon Central High School is located on Route 31 in Flemington, New Jersey, and provides secondary education to approximately 2,500 students enrolled in grades 9-12. Since 1987 Hunterdon Central has been actively involved in efforts to deter student use of illegal drugs and alcohol as well as counseling and assisting students who have become victims of drugs and alcohol abuse. Hunterdon Central also provides anti-drug awareness programs in classes and through student assemblies, has established a program for professional counseling of students and their families, has from time to time cooperated with the Hunterdon County Prosecutor\u2019s Office in the conduct of searches aided by drug sniffing dogs and has implemented suspicion-based drug testing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-6\">Notwithstanding those efforts, there was a perception by school authorities in 1995 that the use of illegal drugs and alcohol by Hunterdon Central students remained a significant problem which initially lead [sic] to the administration of the American Drug and Alcohol Survey <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to the school population and, thereafter, to the establishment of a program of random drug testing for athletes. That program has been conducted without prior challenge for the last three years, during which time Hunterdon Central has continued to examine the subject of drug abuse among its students. The results of those continued studies have recently motivated Hunterdon Central to expand the random drug testing program to include all students involved in extra-curricular activities or authorized to park an automobile on school properly. <em>Hunterdon Central does not contend that any of its studies have shown that the students singled out for random testing are more likely than other students to be abusing drugs.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>In <em>State v.

The genius of federalism is that the fundamental rights of citizens are protected not only by the United States Constitution but also by the laws of each of the states.

This should be the case irrespective of the context in which the case arises so long as the issue involves a claim of illegal search and seizure that threatens our cherished privacy rights under our State Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">In my view, there is nothing that our Supreme Court stated in <em>N.J. Transit PBA Local 304 v. N.J.

Instead, the Court announced a \u201creasonableness standard\u201d which it believed would \u201censure that the interests of students will be invaded no more than is necessary to achieve the legitimate end of preserving order in the schools.\u201d <em>T.L.O., supra, </em>469 <em>U.S. </em>at 341-42, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 733, 83 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d at 734-35. The phrase \u201cspecial needs\u201d was introduced by Justice Blackmun in his concurring opinion in <em>T.L.O. </em>because of his concerns about rejecting the probable cause standard solely because it was impracticable to obtain a warrant in the school environment. <em>T.L.O., supra, </em>469 <em>U.S. </em>at 351, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 733, 83 L.

Smith, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>599, 616, 637 A.2d 158 (1994). I believe that the principle of \u201cindividualized suspicion\u201d has been transmuted into the \u201cspecial needs\u201d requirement adopted by our Supreme Court in <em>N.J. Transit, supra, </em>and that that requirement must be met to justify the governmental purpose of initiating random drug testing programs in this state. <em>See N.J. Transit, supra, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>at 531, 701 A.2d 1243.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">The United States Supreme Court employed the phrase \u201cspecial needs\u201d after <em>T.L.O. </em>in <em>Vernonia Sch.

There, the Court used the concept in determining to uphold random drug testing of athletes by an Oregon school district. However, in <em>Vemonia, </em>a \u201cspecial need\u201d was found on the facts presented due solely to \u201can alarming situation\u201d: \u201ca large segment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>of the student body, particularly those involved in interscholastic athletics, was in a state of rebellion ... fueled by alcohol and drug abuse as well as the students\u2019] misperceptions about the drug culture.\u201d <em>See Earls, supra, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2575, 153 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d at-(Ginsburg, J., dissenting opinion) (quoting <em>Vernonia, supra, </em>515 <em>U.S. </em>at 649, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2388, 132 <em>L.

In upholding the policy of random drug testing of athletes as \u201creasonable,\u201d in <em>Vemonia, </em>the United States Supreme Court found, on the facts presented, an \u201cimmediate crisis\u201d in the school which impacted the teachers\u2019 custodial responsibilities, thus creating a \u201c\u2018substantial need of teachers and administrators for freedom to maintain order in the schools.\u2019\u201d <em>Vernonia, supra, </em>515 <em>U.S. </em>at 653, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2390, 132 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d at 574 (quoting <em>T.L.O., supra, </em>469 <em>U.S. </em>at 341, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 742, 83 <em>L.

Accordingly, the Court found \u201cthe severity of the need\u201d justified the random drug testing of athletes in light of \u201cthe decreased expectation of privacy\u201d of the student athletes and \u201cthe relative unobtrusiveness of the search.\u201d <em>Vernonia, supra, </em>515 <em>U.S. </em>at 657, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2396, 132 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d at 577.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">Thereafter, in <em>Chandler v.

Ed.2d </em>513 (1997), the United States Supreme Court found unconstitutional a Georgia policy requiring certain candidates for public office to submit to drug testing. There, Justice Ginsburg, writing for an eight-member majority, explained that to successfully make the case that a \u201cspecial need\u201d exists, the government must demonstrate a <em>\u201cconcrete </em>danger demanding departure from the Fourth Amendment\u2019s main rule.\u201d <em>Chandler, supra, </em>520 <em>U.S. </em>at 319, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1295, 137 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 526 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">Despite those precedents, in a five-four decision delivered by Justice Thomas, the United States Supreme Court in <em>Earls </em>interpreted the \u201cspecial needs\u201d requirement as satisfied without a showing of the severity of the need in the particular school based solely on the \u201cnationwide epidemic of drug use\u201d among the student population. <em>Earls, supra, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2568, 153 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number><em>L.

Writing for the Court, Justice Thomas stated that the difference in the levels of expectation of privacy in <em>Vemonia </em>(athletic extra-curricular activities) and <em>Earls </em>(non-athletic extra-curricular activities) was \u201cnot essential\u201d to the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Vemonia </em>because that decision depended on \u201cthe school\u2019s custodial responsibility and authority\u201d not on the diminished expectation of privacy of athletes. <em>Ibid. </em>According to the majority, the intrusiveness is the same irrespective of the nature of the student activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">In an insightful dissenting opinion, Justice Ginsburg, joined by Justices Stevens, O\u2019Connor and Souter, criticized the majority\u2019s approval of the program in the absence of any demonstrated \u201cspecial need ... [to maintain] ... swift and informal disciplinary procedures ... [and] order in the schools.\u201d <em>Earls, supra, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2565, 153 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>at-(Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (quoting <em>Vernonia, </em>515 <em>U.S. </em>at 653, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2386, 132 <em>L. Ed. 2d </em>at 574) (internal quotation marks omitted). Justice Ginsburg explained that in <em>Vemonia </em>the \u201cCourt concluded that a public school district facing a disruptive and explosive drug abuse problem sparked by members of its athletic teams had \u2018special needs\u2019 that justified suspicionless testing of district athletes as a condition of their athletic participation.\u201d <em>Earls, supra, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at -, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2572, 153 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>at - (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). But she also stated that <em>Vemonia </em>\u201ccannot be read to endorse invasive and suspieionless drug testing of all students.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b651-12\">The facts in <em>Earls </em>and the instant case are essentially the same: that is, there was no \u201cimmediate crisis,\u201d in either case and, therefore, no need for the immediate exercise of the \u201cschool\u2019s custodial responsibility and authority\u201d justifying intrusion into the students\u2019 personal privacy; there was only a generalized showing that the entire student body\u2019s involvement with drugs and alcohol was basically comparable to that of the national average. None<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>theless, the <em>Earls </em>Court decided that it was acceptable to suspend our children\u2019s rights in the name of waging war on drugs. We should not follow this unprecedented lead.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">In her dissent, Justice Ginsburg explains the flaw in the majority\u2019s view in <em>Earls. </em>Basically, she maintains that the anti-drug message and \u201cthe desire to augment communication of this message [should] not trump the right of persons \u2014 even of children within the schoolhouse gate \u2014 to be \u201csecure in their persons ... against unreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d She emphasizes the importance of teaching students by example, distinguishing the \u201ccustodial\u201d responsibility from the \u201ctutelary\u201d responsibility of teachers for their students. <em>Earls, supra, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2577, 153 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d at-(Ginsburg, J., dissenting). Her argument is powerful and has persuaded me that the New Jersey Constitution must be interpreted to afford greater rights to students than the Fourth Amendment in these circumstances where no crisis exists and no safety concerns have been demonstrated. This is what Justice Ginsburg stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-9\">In <em>Chandler, </em>the Court referred to a pathmarking dissenting opinion in which Justice Brand\u00e9is recognized the importance of teaching by example: Our Government is the potent, the omnipresent teacher. Por good or for ill, it teaches the whole people by its example. That wisdom should guide decision-makers in the instant case: The government is nowhere more a teacher than when it runs a public school.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-10\">It is a sad irony that the petitioning School District seeks to justify its edict here by trumpeting the schools\u2019 custodial and tutelary responsibility for children. <em>In regulating an athletic program or endeavoring to combat an exploding drug epidemic, a school\u2019s custodial obligations may permit searches that would otherwise unacceptably abridge students\u2019 rights. When custodial duties are not ascendant, however, schools\u2019 tutelary obligations to their students require them to \u201cteach by example\u201d by avoiding symbolic measures that diminish constitutional protections. That [schools] are educating the young for citizenship is reason for scrupulous protection of Constitutional freedoms of the individual, if we are not to strangle the free mind at its source and teach youth to discount important principles of our government as mere platitudes.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-11\"><em>[Earls, supra, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2577, 158 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>at-(Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (emphasis added) (internal quotations and citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-13\">For the reasons stated herein, I would adopt Justice Ginsburg\u2019s analysis in <em>Earls </em>as New Jersey\u2019s constitutional law in the circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>stances of this case and affirm the trial court\u2019s order declaring Hunterdon Central Board of Education\u2019s random drug testing program unconstitutional under Article I, Paragraph 7 of the New Jersey Constitution.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b645-10\"> We reviewed this case on the trial court\u2019s grant of a permanent injunction, treating the matter as a grant of summary judgment by consent of the parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b646-7\"> The survey of students who \"have ever tried a drug\u201d showed that Hunter-don\u2019s percentages are, in most instances, less than the national average, and where they are not the percentages are not so diverse.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b646-8\"> The Hunterdon drug testing program is similar to the program in <em>Earls, supra. </em>Hence, in the words of dissenting Justice Ginsburg, it is not just \"[unreasonable,\u201d but \"capricious, even perverse\" for it \"targets for testing a student population least likely to be at risk from illicit drugs and their damaging effects.\" <em>Earls, supra,-U.S. </em>at-, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2572, 153 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d at -\u2014 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). As for the testing of the athletes, there has been no showing of any special drug abuse problems in this student population to justify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>random drug testing of them. <em>Cf. Vernonia Sch. Dist. 47J v. Acton, </em>515 <em>U.S. </em>646, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>2386, 132 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>564 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b648-8\"> To the extent <em>Desilets v. Clearview Bd. of Educ., </em>265 <em>N.J.Super. </em>370, 627 A.2d 667 (App.Div.1993), concludes otherwise, I disagree with it. The fact that our Supreme Court analyzed the search and seizure issue under the Fourth Amendment in <em>New Jersey v. T.L.O., </em>469 <em>U.S. </em>325, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>733, 83 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d 720 (1985), is not dispositive of the question whether our constitution or even our common law would protect against the search and seizure in this random drug testing case as there is no indication the <em>T.L.O. </em>Court was even called upon to address the issue there under our constitution. Moreover, <em>Desilets </em>was decided before <em>N.J. Transit </em>applied the \"special need\" analytical framework to the issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
