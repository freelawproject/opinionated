The State contends that the motion judge erroneously interpreted existing law and that the automatic exclusion of the out-of-court identification is inappropriate. We agree with the State and now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">Defendant was arrested and subsequently indicted for: (1) first-degree robbery, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:15-1; (2) third-degree theft by unlawful taking, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-3a(3); (3) third-degree possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-4d; and (4) fourth-degree unlawful possession of a weapon, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-5d.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">Defendant challenged the out-of-court identification. A Wade<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> hearing was conducted. The following proofs were presented at the hearing. On February 7, 2003, between 9 and 11 a.m., Reedel Wilson (\u201cthe victim\u201d) was approached by a man, later identified as defendant, on the street in Trenton. Despite snowy conditions, the victim could still see clearly even though she had once suffered a gun shot wound to her cheek and was not wearing the glasses she normally wears only for reading and watching television. The man was white with brown hair and a \u201ccrater[ed]\u201d or \u201cpock mark[ed]\u201d face wearing \u201cblack or blue jeans, black jacket with red sleeves and boots----\u201d He carried \u201ca garden shovel on his shoulder----\u201d The man demanded the victim\u2019s purse and pushed her to the ground even though she complied with the man\u2019s demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-10\">The victim met with Detective Manuel Montez at the Trenton Police headquarters. Detective Montez had the victim view photographs on a computer in an effort to identify her attacker. Detective Montez testified that the computer contained photographs of individuals previously arrested by the police depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>ment. He further testified that, using a program called \u201cpicture link,\u201d he directed the system to display only photographs of individuals who were white, male and within the age range the victim provided in her description of the attacker.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Detective Montez explained during his testimony that it is possible to cull photographs from the system based on a total of seven characteristics including gender, race, height, weight, eye color, hair color and age range. However, Detective Montez testified that he used only race, gender and age, so the number of photographs displayed would be greater.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">Once the desired characteristics were entered into the system, the computer began to display \u201c12 photographs at a time for between 10 and 12 seconds.\u201d After viewing between thirty-six to sixty photographs, the victim identified one of the images as that of the man who had attacked her on the street earlier that day. Detective Montez printed an enlarged version of the photograph, and then had the victim view and sign it as well. None of the other photographs viewed by the victim were printed or maintained as part of the investigative record.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">Detective Montez further testified that after the victim identified defendant\u2019s photograph, he was able to use the picture link system to obtain defendant\u2019s name. Additionally, Detective Mon-tez testified that prior to the victim\u2019s identification he had no \u201cidea who the suspect was by name or otherwise.\u201d He further testified that he did not indicate to the victim whether her attacker would indeed appear in the photographs she was about to view. The victim also testified, and her testimony \u201cwas substantially the same as [Detective] Montez regarding the identification procedure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">Following the hearing, the motion judge ruled that the photographs viewed by the victim constituted an array. He further held that the State\u2019s failure to retain all of the photos viewed by the victim prevented a \u201cmeaningful inquiry into the specific procedure employed by the State.\u201d The judge therefore suppressed the out-of-court identification. The judge went on to rule, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>that the victim\u2019s in-court identification of defendant'would be admissible because it was \u201cbased on her view of him at the time of the commission of the crime, and not as a result of the photographic array employed by the State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">The State argues that the motion judge erred when he construed the display of photographs viewed by the victim as an array subject to <em>State v. Peterkin, </em>226 <em>N.J.Super. </em>25, 543 A.2d 466 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>295, 554 A.2d 850 (1988). The State contends that what the victim actually viewed was, instead, an \u201caverage \u2018mug shot book\u2019 identifieation[ ] used everyday by police departments across the State, whether ... physical or computer generated\u201d and, therefore need not be preserved to be admissible. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">\u201c[Ejnforcement authorities should ... make a complete record of an identification procedure if it is feasible to do so, to the end that the event may be reconstructed in the testimony.\u201d <em>State v. Earle, </em>60 <em>N.J. </em>550, 552, 292 A.2d 2 (1972). Generally, where a photographic identification is employed, the photographs shown to a witness should be recorded. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">While photographic arrays must be preserved to be admissible, the use of mug shot books to develop an as-yet-to-be-determined suspect does not require that all the photographs viewed in the mug shot books be preserved. <em>State v. Ruffin, </em>371 <em>N.J.Super. </em>371, 395, 853 A.2d 311 (App.Div.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">Mug shot books: (1) contain large numbers of randomly selected photographs; (2) are kept for the purpose of investigation, not confirmation; and (3) are a resource \u201cshown to witnesses as a matter of course to see if a suspect [can] be found.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Here, the picture link system was, in effect, a mug shot book. Detective Montez testified that the computer held the photographs of all individuals arrested by the Trenton Police. Instead of going to a shelf and removing only the books containing mug shot photographs of white males in the age range provided by the victim, Detective Montez went to the computer and retrieved only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>the mug shot photographs of those with the same characteristics. We are satisfied that each computerized display containing the twelve photographs was the equivalent of a page of a mug shot book.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">A photographic array, on the other hand, is a different investigative device. Photographic arrays typically contain a small number of photographs. <em>See State v. Ways, </em>180 <em>N.J. </em>171, 175, 850 A.2d 440 (2004) (array contained eight photographs); <em>State v. Robinson, </em>165 <em>N.J. </em>32, 36, 754 A.2d 1153 (2000) (five photographs in photographic lineup); <em>State v. Cook, </em>330 <em>N.J.Super. </em>395, 416, 750 A.2d 91 (App.Div.) (array contained eight photographs), <em>certif. denied, </em>165 <em>N.J. </em>486, 758 A.2d 646 (2000); <em>State v. Burton, </em>309 <em>N.J.Super. </em>280, 286, 706 A.2d 1181 (App.Div.) (array contained six photographs), <em>certif. denied, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>407, 719 A.2d 639 (1998); <em>State v. Rodriquez, </em>264 <em>N.J.Super. </em>261, 268, 624 A.2d 605 (App.Div.1993) (array contained six photographs), <em>affd, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>3, 637 A.2d 914 (1994); <em>State v. Robinson, </em>253 <em>N.J.Super. </em>346, 355, 601 A.2d 1162 (App.Div.) (eight photographs in lineup), <em>certif. denied, </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>6, 611 A.2d 646 (1992); <em>State v. Reyes, </em>237 <em>N.J.Super. </em>250, 567 A.2d 287 (App.Div.1989) (array contained seven photographs); <em>State v. Taplin, </em>230 <em>N.J.Super. </em>95, 552 A.2d 1015 (App.Div.1988) (eight photographs in an array). <em>But see State v. Gunter, </em>231 <em>N.J.Super. </em>34, 554 A.2d 1356 (App.Div.) (three separate arrays containing thirty-five to forty, fifteen and six photographs respectively), <em>certif. denied, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>80, 563 A.2d 841 (1989); <em>State v. Cherry, </em>289 <em>N.J.Super. </em>503, 513, 674 A.2d 589 (App.Div.1995) (array contained forty-two photographs).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Furthermore, police use photographic arrays to confirm or eliminate suspects. <em>See </em>(Letter from Attorney General John J. Farmer, Jr. to All County Prosecutors et al of 4/18/2001, at 1.) (accompanying Attorney General Guidelines for Preparing and Conducting Photo and Live Lineup Identification Procedures). The police typically have someone in mind when they prepare a photographic array to be shown to a witness. <em>See State v. Clausell, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>298, 309, 580 A.2d 221 (1990) (defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>photograph included in array); <em>State v. Tilghman, </em>345 <em>N.J.Super. </em>571, 573, 786 A.2d 128 (App.Div.2001) (noting suspect, who was known to police, was placed in photographic array based on witness\u2019s pre-identification description to confirm whether he was the perpetrator); <em>State v. Pierce, </em>330 <em>N.J.Super. </em>479, 484, 750 A.2d 139 (App.Div.2000) (array contained photograph of suspect); <em>Cook, supra, </em>330 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 416, 750 A.2d 91 (array contained defendant\u2019s photograph); <em>State v. Onysko, </em>226 <em>N.J.Super. </em>599, 601, 545 A.2d 226 (App.Div.1988) (array contained defendant\u2019s photograph). Moreover, police construct photographic arrays and personally present them to witnesses, unlike a mug shot book, which is already assembled for a witness\u2019s perusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Detective Montez testified that he had no idea who the suspect might be prior to showing the victim the picture link system. He also testified that given the situation, the procedure utilized to conduct such an investigation included using the picture link system in the manner he described. In prior use, Detective Montez testified that the system could display \u201canywhere from 100 to over a thousand [photographs].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">Like the identification deemed admissible in <em>Ruffin, supra, </em>which was made with the use of a mug shot book, the victim here was given a collection of photographs containing a potentially large, albeit unknown, number of individuals \u201cin the hope of finding a suspect.\u201d 371 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 395, 853 A.2d 311. It was only happenstance that she saw defendant after viewing only three to five \u201cpages\u201d or screens. Also, like in <em>Ruffin, supra, </em>defendant became a suspect only after the victim identified him. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">The motion judge made no finding that either Detective Montez or the victim\u2019s testimony lacked credibility. In fact, he relied on Detective Montez\u2019s testimony to describe, in his decision, how the picture link system works.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">Given that the computer system here contained large numbers of randomly selected photographs, kept for the purpose of investigation, not confirmation, and is a resource \u201cshown to witnesses as a matter of course to see if a suspect [can] be found,\u201d we conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>that it is essentially a mug shot book and the failure to retain all of the photos seen by the victim is not fatal to the admission of the out-of-court identification. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">We also agree with the State that even if the collection of photographs viewed by the victim was construed as an array, which should have been retained, the failure to retain those photographs does not automatically result in suppression of the out-of-court identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">Our Supreme Court has held that while photographs used in identification procedures should be recorded or retained, a failure to do so will not necessarily invalidate the identification. <em>Earle, supra, </em>60 <em>N.J. </em>at 552, 292 A.2d 2. Instead, such an omission, if not explained, should be weighed in deciding upon the probative value of the identification. <em>Ibid. </em>The question is whether the procedure was so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">\u201cThe issue of admissibility into evidence of eyewitness identifications has evolved into a two-prong test.\u201d <em>Cook, supra, </em>330 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 417, 750 A.2d 91 (citing <em>State v. Madison, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>223, 232, 536 A.2d 254 (1988)). First, the defendant must prove by a preponderance of the evidence \u201cthat the identification procedure was suggestive so as to result in a substantial likelihood of misidentification.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citing <em>State v. Hurd, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>525, 548, 432 A.2d 86 (1981); <em>State v. Santoro, </em>229 <em>N.J.Super. </em>501, 504, 552 A.2d 184 (App.Div.1988)). Second, \u201c[i]f the defendant meets that burden, the court must decide whether the procedure resulted in a \u2018very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>Madison, supra, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>at 232, 536 A.2d 254).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">Here, defendant produced no evidence that the procedure Detective Montez employed was impermissibly suggestive. In fact, Detective Montez testified that he did not indicate to the victim that defendant\u2019s image would even appear in the collection of photographs she was about to view. The victim testified that Detective Montez told her to simply view the photographs to \u201csee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>if the guy was there.\u201d Also Detective Montez did not identify any of the people whose photograph appeared. Additionally, Detective Montez testified that, other than initially inputting the sex, race and age range provided by the victim, he had no control over how the system displayed the photographs. Moreover, Detective Mon-tez testified that the photographs displayed by the picture link system bore no information about the person pictured.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Nothing in the testimony given by Detective Montez or the victim indicates that the procedure was suggestive. Because nothing Detective Montez did or said to the victim, nor anything about the manner in which the picture link system displayed the images could be construed as an attempt to influence the victim to \u25a0 choose defendant\u2019s photograph, there is nothing to suggest that the identification procedure \u201cwas anything other than a neutral presentation.\u201d <em>Ruffin, supra, 371 N.J.Super. </em>at 395, 853 A.2d 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">Even if the procedure employed by Detective Montez was impermissibly suggestive, the identification may reasonably be said to have not resulted in a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification. Even if an identification procedure is deemed impermissibly suggestive, it may still be admissible where the identification \u201cpossesses certain features of reliability.\u201d <em>Manson v. Brathwaite, </em>432 <em>U.S. </em>98, 110, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>2243, 2251, 53 L.Ed.2d 140, 151 (1977). Accordingly, whether an identification may be considered reliable depends on: (1) the witness\u2019s opportunity to view the suspect; (2) the degree of attention the witness gave to the suspect; (3) the accuracy of the description the witness gave before the identification; (4) the witness\u2019s certainty of the identification; and (5) the amount of time between the crime and subsequent identification. <em>Id. </em>at 114, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2253, 53 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 154. Unless the sum of these factors is outweighed by the \u201ccorrupting effect of the suggestive identification,\u201d the identification is reliable and may be admitted. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">In <em>Brathwaite, supra, </em>the showing of a single photograph of a suspect to the witness was conceded to be suggestive. <em>Id. </em>at 109, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2250, 53 L.Ed.2d at 151. However, the identification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>was deemed reliable because: (1) the witness had two to three minutes to observe the suspect; (2) the witness\u2019s attention given to the suspect was not casual or passing; (3) the initial description included the suspect\u2019s race, height, build, hair style and color, and a predominant facial feature; (4) the witness was certain as to the identification; and (5) the identification took place just two days after the witness\u2019s initial observation of the suspect. <em>Id. </em>at 114-16, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2254-55, 53 L.Ed.2d at 154-55.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">Here, the motion judge found that \u201c[t]here was nothing in [the victim\u2019s] testimony or her demeanor which evidenced anything but truthfulness.\u201d The victim testified that although she observed defendant\u2019s face for about five or six seconds, she was able to get a good enough look at his face to notice it was pock marked. The judge found that the victim gave adequate attention to defendant during the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">The victim further testified that when she saw defendant\u2019s photograph on the computer screen she \u201cjumped and ... said that\u2019s him----\u201d Moreover, the victim testified that she was positive that the photograph she signed and dated was that of the person who robbed her. Finally, the victim\u2019s identification of defendant, through the use of the picture link system, occurred, at best, some five hours after the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">Here, because the victim had ample opportunity to view and gave sufficient attention to the defendant during the robbery, provided an accurate description of defendant following the incident and was certain of the identification made within just a few hours after the crime, her ability to make an accurate identification is \u201chardly outweighed by the corrupting effect\u201d of any suggestiveness the procedure might have had. <em>Id. </em>at 116, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2254, 53 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 155. At its essence, the issue here is not the admissibility of testimony relating to the out-of-court identification, but rather the credibility to be afforded it, which is a \u201cmatter of weight for the jury.\u201d <em>Cook, supra, </em>330 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 417, 750 A.2d 91 (citing <em>State v. Farrow, </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>434, 451, 294 A.2d 873 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>(1972) , <em>cert. denied, </em>410 <em>U.S. </em>937, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>1396, 35 L.Ed.2d 602 (1973) ).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">We reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b56-11\"> <em>United States v.
