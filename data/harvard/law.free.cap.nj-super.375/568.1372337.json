On appeal, plaintiffs argue that the pre-tort release signed by Anastasia Hojnowski on behalf of her son, which contains an arbitration provision as well as a limitation of liability, is not enforceable against the son. Its enforceability against the parents is not raised as an issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">On January 3, 2003, Andrew Hojnowski, age twelve, fractured his femur while skateboarding at a skatepark facility operated by Vans. He has subsequently undergone two surgeries for the repair of the injury. In a complaint filed against Vans and its alleged corporate owner, plaintiffs claimed that Vans was liable for Andrew\u2019s injuries as the result of its negligent failure to supervise activities at the park, to control activities of aggressive skateboarders, to warn Andrew\u2019s parents that the activities of aggressive skateboarders would not be monitored, and to provide a safe place to skateboard.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">Prior to Andrew\u2019s accident, on December 26, 2002, as a condition of use of the park, Andrew\u2019s mother executed on Andrew\u2019s behalf a document entitled \u201cRelease and Waiver of Liability and Jury Trial with Indemnity (For All Vans Skateparks, Stores and Facilities (Collectively, \u201cParks\u201d) in New Jersey).\u201d The document commenced by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-9\">Please read this document. It affects Your legal rights against Vans, Inc. if you are injured. Do not sign this document unless you understand it. If You are a minor, Your parent or guardian is required to sign this legal document.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>Additionally, the document, at its conclusion, required a \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d response to the following question: \u201cDo You understand that You are giving up rights by signing this document if You are hurt?\u201d Andrew\u2019s mother responded \u201cyes\u201d to this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">The body of the document commenced with a description of the dangers of skateboarding, in-line skating and bicycle riding. It then set forth the following provisions of relevance to this litigation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-7\">2. Can You Make A Claim For Money If You Are Injured?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-8\">If you are injured and want to make a claim, you must file a demand before the American Arbitration Association (the \u201cAAA\u201d)____ You agree that any dispute between You and Vans will be decided by the AAA. Vans, Inc. will pay all costs of the arbitration for You____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-11\">3. Vans Is Asking You To Give Up Legal Rights in Order to Enter This Park.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqe\">Because using Vans\u2019 Park ... may increase your risk of harm, Vans is asking you to give up certain valuable legal rights. Here are the rights you are giving up when you sign this document:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-13\">(a) You give up your right to sue Vans in a court of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-14\">(b) You give up your right to a trial by jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-15\">(c) You give up the right to claim money from Vans if you are injured unless Vans intentionally failed to prevent or correct a hazard caused by unsafe equipment or devices.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-16\">(d) You give up the right to claim money from Vans if you wait more than one year from the injury in order to make a claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-17\">(e) You give up the right to claim money from Vans, Inc. if you are injured by another person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-18\">(f) You give up the right to recover damages to punish or make an example of Vans, Inc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-19\">4. Rights You Do Not Give Up</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ami\">You do not give up the right:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-20\">(a) To have safe equipment, structures and devices at the Park for Your intended use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-21\">(b) To claim compensation for Your injury from Vans, Inc. if you are hurt because the equipment, structures and devices at the Park are not safe for Your intended use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-22\">(e) To have a neutral arbitrator decide your rights fairly, quickly and completely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-23\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-24\">5. Who is Bound By This Document?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-25\">You are bound by this document.

Other Information Important For You To Know</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-5\">You have the right to demand money if You believe Vans, Inc. intentionally caused You harm. If parts of this document are determined to be invalid, then that portion will be unenforceable and the remainder of the document will continue in full legal force and effect____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">Following the institution of suit, Vans filed for commercial arbitration with the AAA. Plaintiffs then moved to enjoin the arbitration and to invalidate the pre-tort release signed by Andrew\u2019s mother. Vans cross-moved for summary judgment. The court granted Vans\u2019 motion, dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 complaint without prejudice<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and ordering that the parties submit to arbitration. It made no ruling on the validity of the contract\u2019s limitation of liability, finding that the issue was within the jurisdiction of the arbitrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">We are informed that the parties have selected as arbitrator a person with significant experience in tort law, thereby rendering irrelevant any argument by plaintiffs that the arbitration cannot proceed under the auspices of an organization whose focus is upon commercial matters \u2014 an argument that we find in any event to be factually unsupported.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">We construe the document executed by Anastasia Hojnowski on behalf of her son Andrew as bipartite, consisting of an agreement to arbitrate and a pre-tort liability waiver. We first address, as a matter entirely separate from the issue of the validity of the liability waiver, whether in the circumstances presented, a parent can enter into an enforceable contract, binding on the parent\u2019s minor child, that waives the right to trial by jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>of the minor\u2019s bodily injury claims and requires submission of \u201cany dispute\u201d to arbitration. We hold that a parent has such power.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Public policy has long favored arbitration. <em>See, e.g., Martindale v. Sandvik, </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>76, 84-85, 800 A.2d 872, 876-77 (2002); <em>Garfinkel v. Morristown Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology Associates, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>124, 131, 773 A.2d 665, 669-70 (2001); <em>Barcon Assocs. v. Tri-County Asphalt Corp., </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>179, 186, <em>430 </em>A.2d 214, 217 (1981) (discussing long history of arbitration); <em>Jansen v. Salomon Smith Barney, </em>342 <em>N.J.Super. </em>254, 257, 776 A.2d 816, 818 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>205, 785 A.2d 434 (2001).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-7\">The ancient practice of arbitration \u201c[i]n its broad sense, [ ] is a substitution, by consent of the parties, of another tribunal for the tribunal provided by the ordinary processes of law. The object of arbitration is the final disposition, in a speedy, inexpensive, expeditions and perhaps less formal manner, of the controversial differences between the parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-8\"><em>[Garfinkel, supra, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>at 131, 773 A.2d at 670 (quoting <em>Carpenter v. Bloomer, 54 N.J.Super. </em>157, 162, 148 A.2d 497, 500 (App.Div.1959) (quoting <em>Eastern Eng\u2019g Co. v. City of Ocean City, </em>11 <em>N.J. Misc. </em>508, 510-11, 167 A. 522, 523 (Sup.Ct. 1933))).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">We read an agreement relating to arbitration liberally to find arbitrability if that is reasonably possible. <em>Garfinkel, supra, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>at 132, 773 A.2d at 673; <em>Marchak v. Claridge Commons, Inc., </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>275, 282, 633 A.2d 531, 535 (1993); <em>Jansen, supra, 342 N.J.Super. </em>at 257-58, 776 A.2d at 818-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">In this ease, the agreement signed by Andrew\u2019s mother on his behalf provided that: \u201cIf you are injured and want to make a claim, you must file a demand before the American Arbitration Association.\u201d The agreement further eliminated the right to sue in a court of law. \u201cA provision in a written contract to settle by arbitration a controversy that may arise therefrom ... shall be valid, enforceable and irrevocable, except upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of a contract.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:24-1.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The fact that the claim arises in tort, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>contract, is immaterial. <em>Garfinkel, supra, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>at 137, 773 A.2d at 673; <em>Jansen, supra, </em>342 <em>N.J.Super. at </em>258, 776 A.2d at 819.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">No New Jersey case has determined whether a parent, as a condition to her minor child\u2019s entry into a commercial recreational facility and participation in its activities, has the power to agree on behalf of that child that any claim for the minor\u2019s bodily injuries at the facility will be subject to arbitration. However the issue of the binding effect on non-parties of a contractual arbitration clause has been addressed. \u201c[N]on-signatories of a contract ... may ... be subject to arbitration if the nonparty is an agent of a party or a third party beneficiary to the contract.\u201d <em>Garfinkel v. Morristown Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology Assoc., </em>333 <em>N.J.Super. </em>291, 308, 755 A.2d 626, 636 (App.Div.2000), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>124, 773 A.2d 665 (2001) (quoting <em>Mutual Benefit Life Ins. Co. v. Zimmerman, </em>783 <em>F.Supp. </em>853, 865 (D.N.J.), <em>affd, </em>970 F.2d 899 (3d Cir.1992)). <em>See also Jansen, supra, </em>342 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 261, 776 A.2d at 820-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\"> \u201cThe principle that determines the existence of a third party beneficiary status focuses on whether the parties to the contract intended others to benefit from the existence of the contract, or whether the benefit so derived arises merely as an unintended incident of the agreement.\u201d <em>Broadway Maintenance Corp. v. Rutgers, The State Univ., </em>90 <em>N.J. </em>253, 259, 447 A.2d 906, 909 (1982). \u201c[T]he real test is whether the contracting parties intended that a third party should receive a benefit which might be enforced in the courts.\u201d <em>Borough of Brooklawn v. Brooklawn Housing Corp., </em>124 <em>N.J.L. </em>73, 77, 11 A.2d 83, 85 (E. &amp; A.1940). <em>See also Restatement (Second) of Contracts </em>\u00a7 302 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>In this case, it is clear that Andrew\u2019s mother intended that Andrew benefit from the contract that she signed on his behalf. Indeed, her execution of the agreement had no purpose other than to gain for her son the benefit of entry into the skatepark. That the entry was conditioned upon a relinquishment of the right to trial and its replacement with the right to mandatory arbitration does not render the contract against public policy or otherwise avoidable.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">The substitution of one forum for another, in and of itself, has never been declared against the public policy of this State.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We recognize that commentators have found fault with the arbitration process, focusing on concerns such as its cost, limitations upon discovery, the absence of an adequate evidentiary record to support the arbitrator\u2019s decision, the elimination of the right to a jury trial, and severe restrictions upon appellate review. <em>See, e.g., </em>Elizabeth G. Thornberg, <em>Contracting with Tortfeasors: Mandatory Arbitration Clauses and Personal Injury Claims, </em>67 <em>Law and Contemporary Problems </em>253 (Winter/Spring 2004).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nonetheless, those complaints have not gained a foothold in New Jersey\u2019s jurisprudence. A \u201cState interest in favoring arbitration\u201d has instead been recognized. <em>Martindale, supra, </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>at 85, 800 <em>A.2d </em>at 877. We perceive no rational basis for <em>according </em>additional weight in this ease to the concerns enumerated by others, simply because the arbitration provision at issue governs the claims of a minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">We derive support for our conclusion from <em>Allgor v. Travelers Ins. Co., </em>280 <em>N.J.Super. </em>254, 654 A.2d 1375 (App.Div.1995), although we recognize in that case that the benefit to the child was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>of greater significance than that accorded here, and the father\u2019s right to enter into a contract affecting the welfare of his son was concomitantly stronger. There, we found that a father\u2019s contractual agreement to submit underinsured motorist\u2019s (UIM) claims to arbitration bound his minor son, who sought UIM coverage as a family member, determining that he was a third-party beneficiary of the contract. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-4\">In this ease, the optional nature of UIM benefits under N.J.S.A. 17:28-l.lb, and the absence of a statute exempting minors from arbitration, requires plaintiffs rights to be analyzed under contract principles. The third-party nature of plaintiffs benefits and his father\u2019s attempt to provide for plaintiffs welfare fully warrant binding plaintiff to the arbitration provision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-5\"><em>[Id. </em>at 263, 654 A.2d at 1380.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-6\"><em>See also, e.g., Leong v. Kaiser Found. Hosp\u2019s, </em>71 <em>Haw. </em>240, 788 P.2d 164, 169 (1990) (infant was bound by arbitration provision in contract for group medical services); <em>Doyle v. Giuliucci, </em>62 Cal.2d 606, <em>43 </em>Cal.Rptr. 697, 401 P.2d 1, 3 (1965) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">In reaching the conclusion to enforce the arbitration provision of the Vans contract, we choose not to follow the decision of the Florida District Court of Appeals in <em>Shea v. Global Travel Marketing, Inc., </em>870 So.2d 20 (Fla.App.2003), <em>review granted, </em>873 So.2d 1223 (Fla.2004), which held under Florida law that a contractual waiver by a mother of her son\u2019s right to sue a commercial safari operator for potential personal injury claims, and to subject them to arbitration, was contrary to public policy, but that a similar waiver relating to the activities of a non-profit entity would not be void. <em>Id. </em>at 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">In <em>Shea, </em>as here, the waiver signed by the mother limited the liability of the safari company as well as subjected any claims against it to arbitration. The court\u2019s decision that the agreement was unenforceable was, in large measure, based upon the mother\u2019s waiver of remedies, not her choice of forum. The court never articulated why public policy disfavors arbitration, <em>per se, </em>in the context presented \u2014 a proposition for which we find no support in New Jersey precedent, which as we have recognized, strongly favors that form of alternative dispute resolution. We note addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>tionally that the <em>Shea </em>court certified to the Florida Supreme Court the question of \u201cwhether a parent\u2019s agreement in a commercial travel contract to binding arbitration on behalf of a minor child with respect to prospective tort claims arising in the course of such travel is enforceable as to the minor.\u201d Because the Supreme Court has granted review and its decision remains pending, we cannot view the existing decision in <em>Shea </em>even as a dispositive statement of Florida law.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">We recognize that a split of authority exists as to the resolution of cases such as these. <em>See generally </em>Douglas P. Gerber, Note, <em>The Validity of Binding Arbitration Agreements and Children\u2019s Personal Injury Claims in Florida After Shea v. Global Travel Marketing, Inc., </em>28 <em>Nova L. Rev. </em>167, 170-77 (Fall 2003) (discussing reported and unreported decisions). An unreported decision in <em>Troshak v. Terminix Internal. Co., </em>1998 <em>WL </em>401693 (E.D.Pa. 1998) resembles <em>Shea, </em>in that it does not meaningfully distinguish between choice of forum and limitation of remedies in its holding that Pennsylvania courts, if they addressed the issue, would find that: \u201cIf a parent cannot prospectively release the potential claims of a minor child, then a parent does not have the authority to bind a minor child to an arbitration provision that requires the minor to waive their right to have potential claims for personal injury filed in a court of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *5. We decline to follow <em>Troshak </em>for the reasons that we have previously expressed. Additionally, we distinguish between the effect of a waiver of forum that preserves all remedies and a consent to settlement, which a court must review for improvidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">A number of the decisions finding a minor\u2019s claim to be nonarbitrable depend solely upon a determination that the contractual language did not include the minor within the arbitration provisions at issue. They are thus of no particular precedential value here. <em>See Lewis v. CEDU Educ. Serv\u2019s, Inc., </em>135 <em>Idaho </em>139, 15 P.3d 1147, 1151 (2000) (arbitration provisions applied only to contracting parties); <em>Accomazzo v. CEDU Educ. Serv\u2019s, Inc., </em>135 <em>Idaho </em>145, 15 P.3d 1153, 1156 (2000) (same); <em>Ciaccio v. Cazayoux, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>519 So.2d 799, 804 (La.Ct.App.1988) (mother had not signed arbitration agreement as representative of deceased children). Others decline to enforce contractual arbitration provisions against minors who are not third-party beneficiaries or do not seek to enforce the substantive provisions of the contract. <em>See Fleetwood Enterprises, Inc. v. Gaskamp, </em>280 F.3d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir.2002) (children of mobile home buyers injured as the result of inhalation of formaldehyde were not bound by contract signed by parents that required arbitration of claims), <em>op. supp. on denial of reh\u2019g, </em>303 F.3d 570 (5th Cir.2002); <em>Billieson v. City of New Orleans, </em>863 So.2d 557, 562-63 (La.Ct.App.2003) (parents of children suing as the result of the children\u2019s lead poisoning were not third-party beneficiaries of agreement to arbitrate between the City and its property management company), <em>unit denied, </em>870 So.2d 303 (2004); <em>Costanza v. Allstate Insurance Co., </em>2002 <em>WL </em>31528447 at *6-7 (Dist.Ct.E.D.La.2002) (children injured by water leakage were not seeking to enforce their rights under warranty contract, nor were they third-party beneficiaries of contract).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">We find persuasive the language of the Court of Appeals of Ohio in <em>Cross v. Carnes, </em>132 <em>Ohio </em>App.3d 157, 724 N.E.2d 828 (1998). In that case, governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, the producers of the Sally Jessy Raphael Show successfully sought to stay a court action by a child participant who sued on grounds of fraud and defamation when the child was portrayed on the show as a bully. In granting a stay to permit arbitration to proceed under an agreement signed by the child\u2019s mother on the child\u2019s behalf the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-5\">we note that the parent\u2019s consent and release to arbitration only specifies the forum for resolution of the child\u2019s claim; it does not extinguish the claim. Logically, if a parent has the authority to bring and conduct a lawsuit on behalf of the child, he or she has the same authority to choose arbitration as the litigation forum.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 836.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">Significantly, plaintiffs do not argue that Andrew\u2019s mother did not understand the agreement that she signed, that she was coerced into signing it, or that unequal bargaining power between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>her and Vans precludes its enforcement. As a consequence, we find the agreement to arbitrate to be valid and enforceable in connection with the bodily injury claims asserted on Andrew\u2019s behalf. Nothing has been brought to our attention that persuades us that arbitration of personal injury suits by minors against recreational facilities should essentially be barred because the parent, not the child (who is legally incapable of doing so), consents to the forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">The motion judge limited her decision to the issue that we have just discussed, holding: \u201cThere\u2019s no determination by this Court on the merits of the request to invalidate the liability waiver, and that\u2019s for the arbitrators to determine.\u201d We find that conclusion to have been in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">As a general rule, the scope of an arbitrator\u2019s authority is set by the issues that he or she is called upon to decide. <em>United Serv's. Auto. Ass\u2019n v. Turck, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>480, 486, 721 A.2d 1, 4-5 (1998); <em>Berger v. First Trenton Indem. Co., </em>339 <em>N.J.Super. </em>402, 406, 772 A.2d 28, 30 (App.Div.2001). Further, \u201c[arbitrators in the private sector have broad discretion in determining legal issues\u201d so long as they fall within the scope of the arbitration agreement. <em>State of N.J., Dept. of Law and Pub. Safety, Div. of State Police v. STate Troopers Fraternal Ass\u2019n of N.J., Inc., </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>464, 469, 453 A.2d 176, 179 (1982). \u201cThe essence of arbitration is, of course, that the arbitrators decide both the facts and the law.\u201d <em>Daly v. Komline-Sanderson Engineering Corp., </em>40 <em>N.J. </em>175, 178, 191 A.2d 37, 38 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">In the present case, the arbitration agreement pertained to \u201cany dispute between You and Vans.\u201d The language was thus sufficiently broad to encompass any issue regarding the construction of the contract itself. However, we find that the issue of whether Anastasia Hojnowski had the power and authority to limit the liability of Vans to her son Andrew for its negligence to be a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>matter of public policy, not contract interpretation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Further, we hold that such power was lacking in this ease, and thus that Anastasia\u2019s waiver of liability was ineffective to limit the claims asserted on Andrew\u2019s behalf to anything less than the law would allow.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">We commence our analysis of the waiver of liability signed by Anastasia Hojnowski with its terms, which we find to be broad in scope, ambiguous and potentially misleading. First, it appears that liability of any nature is restricted by the release to that arising out of an unsafe condition of \u201cequipment, structures and devices,\u201d thereby precluding claims of liability arising out of conduct, however negligent. Further paragraphs 3(c) and 4(b) of the waiver appear to be internally inconsistent, since paragraph 4(b) preserves the right to compensation for injuries caused by unsafe equipment, structures and devices, but paragraph 3(c) inferentially excepts from liability Vans\u2019 negligent failure to prevent or correct a hazard caused by unsafe equipment or devices. Paragraphs 3(c) and 6, viewed together, suggest that Vans sought to immunize itself from all liability except that caused by intentional conduct on its part that is related to equipment or devices, since each of the two paragraphs specifically preserves only those claims arising out of intentional harm in that regard. Even then, punitive damages are precluded by paragraph 3(f). Injuries caused by \u201canother person,\u201d regardless of circumstances or the identity of the person, are precluded by paragraph 3(e). The release, however construed, is thus far-reaching in its impact, diminishing substantially or eliminating any right of recovery by Andrew arising from negligence and exemplary damages arising from intentional acts that might otherwise be available to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>It has long been the law of New Jersey that without statutory authority or judicial authorization, a parent has no ability to release a claim properly belonging to a child. <em>Moscatello ex rel Moscatello v.

In <em>Zukerman, </em>we held that a parent may reject even a large settlement and proceed to a trial that may result in either a greater or lesser verdict, unless clear and convincing evidence demonstrates that a conflict exists between the parent\u2019s and the infant\u2019s positions or that the parent is otherwise incapable of effectively exercising judgment and discretion in the matter. <em>Id. </em>at 97, 556 A.2d at 786-87. However, that decision cannot be read to authorize a parent to forego any of the child\u2019s substantive rights to recovery. Simply put, no New Jersey statute, rule or decision authorized Andrew\u2019s mother to sign a pre-tort agreement limiting the liability of a tortfeasor to exclude negligent conduct in the circumstances of this case. In light of the protections afforded to the interests of minors in this State in connection with tort claims, family matters and otherwise, we will not here create the exception that the law has heretofore failed to recognize. Thus we declare that aspect of the agreement to have been void from its inception. The sever-ability clause of the agreement preserves the agreement in other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Like agreements to arbitrate the claims of minors, agreements waiving a minor\u2019s substantive remedies have been treated in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>varying fasMons elsewhere.

First, we note the argument, expressed in decisions such as those in <em>Sharon, supra, </em>and <em>Zivich, supra, </em>that a parent can release the tort claims of a child as the result of the parent\u2019s fundamental right to make decisions that bear upon the care, custody and upbringing of their children. 769 <em>N.E.2d </em>at 746. Although we acknowledge that fundamental right to exist, as we must (see, <em>e.g. Troxel v. Granville, </em>530 <em>U.S. </em>57, 65-66, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>2054, 2060, 147 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>49, 56-57 (2000)), we do not read the precedent defining that right (as does our colleague) as encompassing a decision such as this to forego substantial tort remedies, a decision that we find to be different from such fundamental concerns as establishment of a home, upbringing and education, religion, or medical care. <em>See, e.g., Parham v. J.R., </em>442 <em>U.S. </em>584, 604, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>2493, 2505, 61 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>101, 120 (1979)(mental hospital institutionalization); <em>Moore v.

Were it otherwise, existing restrictions on parental conduct in the context of litigation involving minors would long ago have been abrogated in New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">Our colleague would find a mother\u2019s decision to allow her son to skateboard at a Vans commercial facility \u201cconditioned upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>giving Vans a pre-tort release\u201d to be constitutionally protected by the Due Process Clause as an aspect of the constitutional right of a parent to raise a child as the parent deems appropriate. We agree with our colleague that a parent has a constitutionally protected right to direct the activities in which a child may engage. Indeed, this is the thrust of the United States Supreme Court cases that we have cited and upon which our colleague relies, as well as the New Jersey Supreme Court precedent that he cites. However, we disagree that a parent\u2019s authority to relinquish a child\u2019s tort claims is similarly protected. No decision by the United States or New Jersey Supreme Court has recognized that right. Our colleague\u2019s sole direct support is derived from the decisions by courts of other states in <em>Sharon, supra, </em>and <em>Zivich, supra, </em>which we choose not to follow, finding no support for their reasoning in authorities we regard as persuasive and controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">An additional argument is raised that a pre-tort release can be distinguished from a post-injury one, because the pressures on the parent, post-tort, to accept an inadequate settlement, the possibility of parental dishonesty, and the potential existence of indemnification agreements placing the burden of payment on the parent<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> do not exist in a pre-tort context. Before the tort occurs, the argument continues, the parent\u2019s determination to sign a release is tempered by the knowledge that if injury takes place, medical expenses will become the parent\u2019s responsibility. <em>See </em>Angeline Purdy, Note, <em>Scott v. Pacific West Mountain Resort: Erroneously Invalidating Parental Releases of a Minor\u2019s Future Claim, </em>68 <em>Wash. L. Rev. 457, </em>472-75 (1993). Purdy has postulated that a parent is less vulnerable to coercion in a preinjury setting because the \u201cparent has time to examine the release, consider its terms, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>and explore possible alternatives. A parent signing a future release is thus more able to reasonably assess the possible consequences of waiving the right to sue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 473-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">We are unwilling to rest our decision on such prescience on the part of a parent, accompanied by an importunate child, finding no evidence that such a parent rationally calculates the risk of injury to the child or its economic cost before bowing to the child\u2019s request for entry into a craved pleasure ground and signing the release of liability upon which that entry is conditioned. The coercive pressures exerted by children in this context are ones that any parent has experienced.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">We therefore find that although the forces influencing a parent\u2019s decision-making before and after a child has been injured differ, those forces remain in each setting. Thus, a public interest in judicial intervention remains.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">Purdy\u2019s argument was met, we believe effectively, by the Court in <em>Cooper, </em>which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-9\">We do not find these distinctions meaningful or persuasive, however. It may be true that parents in the pre-injury setting have less financial motivation to sign a release than a parent in the post-injury setting who needs money to care for an injured child. Nonetheless, the protections accorded minors in the post-injury setting illustrate Colorado\u2019s overarching policy to protect minors, regardless of parental motivation, against actions by parents that effectively foreclose a minor\u2019s right of recovery. Thus, while a parent\u2019s decision to sign a pre-injury release on his child\u2019s behalf may not be in \u201cdeliberate derogation of his child\u2019s best interests,\u201d Purdy, <em>supra, </em>at 474, the effeet of a release on the child in either the pre-injury context or the post-injury one is the same. If parents are unwilling or unable to care for an injured child, he may be left with \u201cno recourse against a negligent party to acquire resources needed for care and this is true regardless of when relinquishment of the child\u2019s rights might occur.\u201d <em>Scott, </em>834 P.2d at 12. In addition, while pre-injury releases might be less vulnerable to mismanagement, children still must be protected against parental actions \u2014 perhaps rash and imprudent ones \u2014 that foreclose all of the minor\u2019s potential claims for injuries caused by another\u2019s negligence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-10\">[48 P.3d at 1234.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-11\">A concern also exists that a decision precluding a pre-tort waiver of a minor\u2019s rights by a parent will unnecessarily interfere with beneficial school and recreational activities and with athletic events. <em>See Sharon, supra, </em>769 N.E.2d at 747; <em>Shea, supra, </em>870 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>So.2d at 25; <em>Zivich, supra, </em>696 N.E.2d at 205; <em>Simmons, </em>670 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 144-45. <em>See also, e.g., </em>Allison M. Foley, Note, <em>We, the Parents and Participant, Promise Not to Sue ... Until There is an Accident. The Ability of High School Students and Their Parents to Waive Liability for Participation in School-Sponsored Athletics, </em>37 <em>Suffolk U. L. Rev. </em>439 (2004); Richard B. Malamud and John E. Karayan, <em>Contractual Waivers for Minors in Sports-Related Activities, </em>2 <em>Marq. Sports L.J. </em>151 (1992). The concern is of course a legitimate one. Nonetheless, we find a significant measure of protection to exist in an noncommercial context as the result of statutes such as the Charitable Immunity Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-7 and the Tort Claims Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:1-1 to 14-4, and the civil immunity provided to volunteer coaches, managers and officials for non-profit and county or municipal recreational sports teams by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:62A-6 to -6.2, and to trustees, directors, officer and voluntary members of non-profit organizations by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A-.53A-7.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">In a skateboard context, we do not find, as does our colleague, that the \u201claw\u2019s solicitude for the rights of children\u201d has been unjustifiably \u201cexalted over the public\u2019s interest in the continued viability of businesses that make available places for such sporting activities.\u201d We view children to trump economic concerns such as these. We are aware of no public policy that requires the law to provide facilities such as that operated by Vans with an environment from which to operate a business apparently free from the risk of litigation except in the most egregious of cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Nor are we persuaded that, in the context of this litigation, we are equipped with the facts that would enable us to determine that skateboarding outside a facility such as Vans is so unsafe that the Vans of this country must be legally protected at the expense of a minor\u2019s tort rights in the manner that our colleague sets forth. The record contains nothing with respect to the comparative dangers of skateboarding in various venues. To be sure, reported eases can be utilized to create a parade of horribles. However, we lack any evidence by which we can compare the incidence, cireum-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>stance or severity of injuries in skateboard facilities of various types to injuries sustained elsewhere. If, as our colleague postulates, skateboarding is indeed more dangerous when conducted in the streets and a valuable resource providing a safe venue for the sport will be faced with economic extinction as the result of this decision, then the Legislature can be apprised of that fact and can act, as it has to protect other industries that it deemed to be both important and threatened.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">We note in this context the protections against liability for dangers inherent in the sport that already have been afforded to certain other commercial enterprises by the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:13-1 to -11, governing skiing, tobogganing and sledding; the New Jersey Roller Skating Rink Safety and Fair Liability Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:14-1 to -7<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>; and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:15-1 to -12, governing equestrian activities. If the Legislature regards our decision relating to child skateboarders as contrary to any manifestation by it of a willingness to render participants solely responsible for injuries resulting from the inherent risks of this or any other sport, the Legislature remains free to act.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">We do not, as a matter of principle, reject the proposition that a parent should be empowered to permit a child to engage in activities that are accompanied by a degree of inherent risk. What we hold here is that the parent should not, at the same time, be able to waive the child\u2019s claim based on negligence. An issue arises in this context as to whether the parent should be permitted to waive liability for those injuries arising as the result of a danger inherent to the sport of skateboarding or any other sport. We see nothing to be gained by that process, so long as assumption of the risk remains as a defense to any claim of liability. We reach this conclusion, in part, because we find it impossible to define as a matter of law what constitutes a danger inherent to a sport that could definitively be encompassed in a waiver. Such a determina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>tion must be made on a case-by-case basis after full consideration of the factual circumstances giving rise to the injury. As a consequence, the existence of a waiver by a parent <em>of </em>this type <em>of </em>liability will not serve to lessen litigation. A determination will still be required by a judge or arbitrator whether the facts support the imposition of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">Moreover, we regard utilization of the doctrine of assumption of the risk to provide a better means for sorting out the liability of the parties than waiver, since a negligence-based defense has a greater potential for nuanced application and, when appropriate, utilization of concepts of comparative negligence. It further holds the potential for influencing the conduct of Vans and other skateboard facilities in a manner designed to minimize the risk of injury to skateboarders such as Andrew, while protecting it from liability for self-induced injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">We thus return, as the bedrock of our decision, to the principle that the judiciary must stand as guardians of the State\u2019s children in the context of this ease. As the Court stated in <em>Cooper, supra,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-6\">To allow a parent or guardian to execute exculpatory provisions on his minor child\u2019s behalf would render meaningless for all practical purposes the special protections historically accorded minors. In the tort context especially, a minor should be afforded protection not only from his own improvident decision to release his possible prospective claims for injury based on another\u2019s negligence, but also from unwise decisions made on his behalf by parents who are routinely asked to release their child's claims for liability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-7\">[48 P.3d at 1234.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">Were we to decide otherwise, we would be relieving an alleged wrongdoer from its traditional legal responsibility to provide compensation for injuries caused by its negligence and shifting the economic burden to families, public welfare agencies and private charities without any concomitant benefit to either an injured child or his parents. <em>Cf. Gershon v.

While I agree, I do so because \u2014 as more fully explained below in the discussion concerning the release provisions also contained in the agreement \u2014 I believe that, in the absence of legislatively-imposed limits, our courts should defer to a parent\u2019s decisions in such matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>In Section II, the majority has held that the trial judge should have considered the validity of the release provisions. I also agree that, in determining the scope of the arbitrator\u2019s authority, the trial judge should have resolved the purely legal question of whether a parent\u2019s execution of a release of a child\u2019s future tort claims, in these circumstances, was void against public policy. As my colleagues correctly observe, Anastasia did not argue either that she failed to understand the document she signed, that she was coerced into signing it, or that there was an imbalance of bargaining power that might impact upon the enforcement of the release. I would add that there is nothing about the physical appearance of the document or the language utilized by its drafter that would call into question its enforceability.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The size of the print was adequate to give notice of its content and purpose, and the terms were expressed in simple and plain English. Accordingly, I agree with the majority\u2019s holding that the trial judge should have determined whether the pre-tort release was enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">It is at that point, however, that I part company and respectfully disagree with Section III of the majority\u2019s opinion. My disagreement lies largely with my belief that, in the absence of parental unfitness, courts should not overrule parental decisions but should instead defer to a parent\u2019s own weighing of the benefits and risks when entering into agreements that relate to the activities of their children. In essence, I believe we should enforce pre-tort releases executed by parents on behalf of their children to the same extent we would enforce pre-tort releases signed by adults regarding their own claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">While the factual record is somewhat sketchy, I would infer from the circumstances that Andrew was a skateboarding enthusi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>ast and his mother, in permitting Andrew to pursue the sport, sought a place more suitable than the streets, sidewalks and driveways of their community for Andrew to hone his skills and enjoy the sport. To obtain permission to use Vans\u2019 facility, Anastasia was required to sign the document in question. Since Anastasia has not claimed that she did not understand the agreement, and since there is nothing in the record to suggest that her execution of the agreement was not free and voluntary, it must also be assumed that Anastasia weighed the benefits and detriments of the transaction. By upholding Anastasia\u2019s waiver of the right to trial by jury, her waiver of the right to seek relief in a court of law, and her agreement to arbitrate any disputes, the majority has determined, and I agree, that Anastasia could, under these circumstances, validly consent to limit the legal rights that Andrew possessed. But the majority has also determined \u2014 notwithstanding Anastasia\u2019s free, voluntary and knowing execution of the document, and notwithstanding the enforceability of the waiver of some rights through the execution of the document \u2014 that public policy precludes the enforceability of the pre-tort release. Because it is only solicitous of Andrew\u2019s tort claims, I believe the majority opinion has failed to account for other valid, competing policies of interest to the public and, indeed, has adopted a principle that may prove more harmful than beneficial to skateboarding minors. In addition, the majority\u2019s hostility toward pre-tort releases, when applied to minors, is at odds with our Legislature\u2019s willingness to render participants solely responsible for injuries resulting from the inherent risks of similar activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">I disagree with the majority\u2019s opinion because I believe the pre-tort release signed by Anastasia should not be invalidated. I believe this to be so because (a) a parent can legally execute a contract that binds a child, (b) the pre-tort release executed here would be upheld if invoked to avoid a suit based on an adult\u2019s personal injuries, (c) a parent has the constitutional right to make decisions regarding the upbringing of a child which \u2014 despite all good intentions \u2014 we should not interfere with, (d) there are unaccounted countervailing public policies that, in my view, over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>ride the policy exalted in the majority\u2019s opinion, and (e) the pre-tort release does not overreach but, instead, secures only the waiver of the child\u2019s claims to injuries resulting from his assumption of the risks inherent in skateboarding, and, therefore, is in harmony with the policies endorsed by our Legislature in enacting laws that govern similar sporting activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Absent the overriding public policy that the majority has announced, there is no legal reason why a parent cannot enter into an agreement that releases a child\u2019s claim before it accrues, as occurred here. A parent has the right to enter into contracts on a child\u2019s behalf. In fact, the majority, in upholding the arbitration provision and the waiver of a trial by jury, has so held. Thus, any limitation on the right of a parent to contractually affect a child\u2019s interests comes not from contract law nor has that power been limited by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">In considering the basis for the majority\u2019s ruling, I do recognize that a court may, with the exercise of great caution, withhold its power to enforce a contract when warranted by a compelling and plainly apparent public policy. <em>See, e.g., Sparks v. St. Paul Ins. Co., </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>325, 334-35, 495 A.2d 406, 411-12 (1985). But I believe it is important to emphasize that it is only in the potentially murky area of what does or does not conform to public policy\u2014 an area into which we should tred with caution, <em>Allen v. Commercial Cas. Ins. Co., </em>131 <em>N.J.L. </em>475, 478, 37 A.2d 37, 39 (E. &amp; A.1944), because, in so doing, we infringe upon the parties\u2019 common law freedom of contract \u2014 where an obstacle to the enforcement of this pre-tort release lurks.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">It is also, in my view, important to emphasize that public policy is not hostile to the enforcement of pre-tort releases that are given in similar circumstances. The pre-tort release in question \u2014 if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>executed by an adult for the adult\u2019s use of the skateboarding facility \u2014 would undoubtedly be deemed valid. Such pre-tort releases are normally invalidated only when their execution is demanded in exchange for the released party\u2019s providing of a necessary service or commodity of great import, where the released party is under a public duty to exercise care, or where the parties are in grossly disproportionate bargaining positions. <em>See Mayfair Fabrics v. Henley, </em>48 <em>N.J. </em>483, 487, 226 A.2d 602, 604-04 (1967); <em>McBride v. Minstar, Inc., </em>283 <em>N.J.Super. </em>471, 490, 662 A.2d 592, 601-02 (Law Div.1994), <em>aff'd o.b. sub nom, McBride v. Raichle Molitor, USA, </em>283 <em>N.J.Super. </em>422, 662 A.2d 567 (App. Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>319, 670 A.2d 1061 (1995). In this sense, a court should not enforce a pre-tort release when, for example, it is demanded by a hospital prior to treating a patient, <em>Tunkl v. Regents of Univ. of Calif., </em>60 Cal.2d 92, 32 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>33, 383 P.2d 441 (1963), or when included in a residential apartment lease by a landlord possessing superior bargaining power, <em>Kuzm-iak v. Brookchester, Inc., </em>33 <em>N.J.Super. </em>575, 111 A.2d 425 (App. Div.1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Here, the pre-tort release was requested of Anastasia in exchange for permitting Andrew to use Vans\u2019 facility. The right to skateboard in a privately-owned facility is not a \u201cnecessity\u201d nor may any patron seeking admittance be assumed to be in a grossly disproportionate bargaining position. Patrons that do not approve of such an agreement\u2019s terms may simply depart and skateboard elsewhere. <em>See McBride, supra, </em>283 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 491, 662 A.2d at 602. As a result, the courts of most states, including this State, have upheld exculpatory agreements of various types when executed in connection with a person\u2019s participation in sporting activities, <em>see, e.g., </em>Mario R. Arango and William R. Trueba, Jr., <em>The Sports Chamber: Exculpatory Agreements Under Pressure, </em>14 <em>U. Miami Ent. &amp; Sports L. Rev. </em>1, 7 n. 26 (1997), so long as the operator does not seek to insulate itself from a standard of care imposed by statute or regulation, <em>see McCarthy v. Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n for Stock Car </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number><em>Racing, Inc., </em>48 <em>N.J. </em>539, 543, 226 A.2d 713, 715 (1967).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> I would conclude that this pre-tort release would be enforceable if applied to a claim based on an adult\u2019s injuries. Indeed, the point need not be belabored since I do not understand my colleagues to suggest otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">Instead of following the principles set forth above, the majority concludes that the present circumstances differ because the injured suitor is a child and not an adult. While this fact may require consideration, I would nevertheless enforce a pre-tort release executed by a parent in this and other similar circumstances. That is, I disagree with my colleagues because I believe insufficient weight has been given to a parent\u2019s right to make decisions regarding the upbringing of a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">The Supreme Court of the United States has determined that the right of a parent to decide how a child will be raised is one of the oldest and most fundamental rights emanating from the \u201cliberty\u201d interest of the Due Process Clause. <em>Troxel v. Granville, </em>530 <em>U.S. </em>57, 65, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>2054, 2060, 147 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>49, 56 (2000); <em>Pierce v. Soc\u2019y of Sisters, </em>268 <em>U.S. </em>510, 534-35, 45 <em>S.Ct. </em>571, 573, 69 <em>L.Ed. </em>1070, 1077-78 (1925); <em>Meyer v. Nebraska, </em>262 <em>U.S. </em>390, 399-401, 43 <em>S.Ct. </em>625, 627, 67 <em>L.Ed. </em>1042, 1045 (1923). In <em>Troxel, </em>the Court acknowledged its long history of recognizing that the family is a unit within which parents possess \u201cbroad ... authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>over minor children.\u201d 530 <em>U.S. </em>at 66, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2060, 147 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 57 (quoting <em>Parham v. J.R., </em>442 <em>U.S. </em>584, 602, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>2493, 2504, 61 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>101, 118 (1979)). Our own Supreme Court, in adhering to these decisions, has shown equal respect for a parent\u2019s constitutional right to the care, custody and control of a child. <em>Sacharow v. Sacharow, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>62, 79, 826 A.2d 710, 721 (2003) (\u201cTo be certain, both parents have a fundamental right to the care and custody of their children.\u201d); <em>Watkins v. Nelson, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>235, 245, 748 A.2d 558, 563-64 (2000) (\u201c[TJhe right of natural parents to the custody, care and nurturing of their children has risen to the stature of a fundamental right and deserves special protection.\u201d). This fundamental right should be kept free of governmental intervention, even when well-intended, unless there has been \u201cgross misconduct, abandonment, unfitness or the existence of \u2018exceptional circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 237, 748 A.2d at 559. Among many other things, a parent possesses the basic right to make medical decisions for a child, including, at least in that context, the giving of consent to the child\u2019s release of a battery claim. <em>See, e.g., Zivich v. Mentor Soccer Club, Inc., </em>82 <em>Ohio St.</em>3d 367, 696 <em>N.E.2d </em>201, 206 (1998). No doubt thousands of such decisions are made by the parents of New Jersey\u2019s children every day. A parent also has the right to permit or deny a child\u2019s participation in any or all of the recreational activities that may be available. We defer to a parent\u2019s decisions over a child\u2019s desires because we presume the parent possesses superior judgment and wisdom in such matters. <em>See Parham, supra, </em>442 <em>U.S. </em>at 602, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2504, 61 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 118 (\u201cThe law\u2019s concept of the family rests on a presumption that parents possess what a child lacks in maturity, experience, and capacity for judgment required for making life\u2019s difficult decisions.\u201d). In adhering to this approach, I believe our courts should defer to parental decisions in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Accordingly, I strenuously reject the majority\u2019s position that the constitutional right of parents to raise children as they deem appropriate extends only to \u201csuch fundamental concerns as establishment of a home, upbringing and education, religion, or medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>care.\u201d I believe a parent also has the right \u2014 with which the state must not interfere \u2014 to decide whether a child may play football or collect sea shells, learn to ride a horse or engage in birdwatching, go skateboarding or only play video games involving animated skateboarders, or engage in any other type of sport or recreational activity that encompasses inherent risks, or those that are sedate, or all such activities, or none. The majority may not view these matters as important, but, important or not, they and countless others ought to be resolved solely within the sphere of the family and, absent the parents\u2019 unfitness, it should be beyond our courts\u2019 power to say otherwise. To the extent the majority has determined that Anastasia\u2019s decision to allow Andrew to skateboard at Vans\u2019 facility, conditioned upon executing a pre-tort release, is not the type of decision protected by the Due Process Clause, I wholeheartedly disagree. While the majority\u2019s decision stands on the declared principle that the members of \u201cthe judiciary must stand as guardians of the State\u2019s children in this context,\u201d my view is that, absent proof of unfitness, the guardians of this State\u2019s children ought to remain their parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Considering the great importance of the constitutional right to raise a child as a parent deems appropriate, I would not overrule a parent\u2019s decision to allow a child to participate in an inherently risky sporting activity in exchange for the forfeiting of a tort claim emanating from the child\u2019s assumption of the sport\u2019s inherent risks.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Those decisions from other jurisdictions cited by the majority <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that invalidate the application of pre-tort releases to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>claims of children are, in my view, incompatible with this important constitutional right. <em>See </em>Joseph H. King, Jr., <em>Exculpatory Agreements For Volunteers In Youth Activities </em>\u2014 The <em>Alternative To \u201cNerf\u2019 Tiddlywinks, </em>53 <em>Ohio St. L.J. </em>683, 716 (1992) (\u201c[Judicial attitudes toward exculpatory agreements signed by parents on behalf of their minor children seem inconsistent with the powers conferred on parents respecting other important life choices.\u201d). Rather than join with those decisions, I would follow the decisions of sister states that have recognized the superior authority of parents, granted to them by the Due Process Clause, to make decisions of the type made here. <em>See Sharon v. City of Newton, 437 Mass. </em>99, 769 <em>N.E.2d 738 </em>(2002); <em>Zivich, supra, </em>82 <em>Ohio St.3d </em>367, 696 <em>N.E.2d </em>201; <em>Hohe v. San Diego Unified Sch. Dist., </em>224 <em>Cal.App.3d </em>1559, 274 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>647 (1990); <em>see also </em>King, <em>supra, </em>53 <em>Ohio St. L.J. </em>683; Stephanie Ross, <em>Interscholaslic Sports: Why Exculpatory Agreements Signed by Parents Should Be Upheld, </em>76 <em>Temp. L. Rev. </em>619 (2003); Robert Nelson, <em>The Theory of the Waiver Scale: An Argument Why Parents Should Be Able to Waive Their Children\u2019s Tort Liability Claims, </em>36 <em>U.S.F.L.

Rev. </em>457 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">I also disagree with the majority\u2019s holding that our interest in the fairness of a parent\u2019s pre-tort decision is the same as the judiciary\u2019s interest in overseeing a parent\u2019s posi-tort decisions. In this regard, I do not mean to suggest that the judiciary\u2019s interests in the well-being of litigants who are minors should be reduced or eviscerated. Instead, contrary to the majority\u2019s view, I believe that the circumstances that attach to a parent\u2019s decision-making after the child has been injured are far different from those presented prior to the accrual of a cause of action. In stating otherwise, the majority has relied upon and quoted at length a Colorado decision, where the court found this distinction to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>neither \u201cmeaningful [n]or persuasive.\u201d <em>Cooper, supra, </em>48 P.3d at 1234. In my view, the Colorado court\u2019s decision was misguided and unrealistic because there is a palpable conflict between the financial interests of the parent and the financial interests of the child once a cause of action accrues, whereas there is no rational conflict when a parent decides whether to execute a pre-tort release. In this regard, I agree with the following views of one commentator on the particular subject:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-5\">The concerns underlying [some courts\u2019] reluctance to allow parents to dispose of a child\u2019s existing claim do not arise in the situation where a parent waives a child\u2019s future claim. A parent dealing with an existing claim is simultaneously coping with an injured child; such a situation creates a potential for parental action contrary to that child\u2019s ultimate best interests. A parent who signs a release before her child participates in a recreational activity, however, faces an entirely different situation. First, such a parent has no financial motivation to sign the release. To the contrary, because a parent must pay for medical care, she risks her financial interests by signing away the right to recover damages. Thus, the parent would better serve her financial interests by refusing to sign the release____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-6\">Moreover, parents are less vulnerable to coercion or fraud in a preinjury setting. A parent who contemplates signing a release as a prerequisite to her child\u2019s participation in some activity faces none of the emotional trauma and financial pressures that may arise with an existing claim. That parent has time to examine the release, consider its terms, and explore possible alternatives. A parent signing a future release is thus more able to reasonably assess the possible consequences of waiving the right to sue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-7\">[Purdy, <em>supra, </em>68 <em>Wash. L. Rev. </em>at 473-74.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-8\"><em>Accord, Sharon, supra, </em>769 <em>N.E.</em>2d at 747 n. 10; <em>Zivich, supra, </em>696 <em>N.E.2d </em>at 206; <em>see also Zukerman v. Piper Pools, Inc., </em>232 <em>N.J.Super. </em>74, 98, 556 A.2d 775, 787 (App.Div.1989) (finding an absence of a conflict of interest, even after the commencement of suit, when a parent, who acted as guardian ad litem for his injured child and who also had pleaded and pursued his own claim; in reversing the trial judge\u2019s removal of the parent as guardian ad litem, we observed that the parent had supported the child since birth and would presumably continue to do so regardless of the outcome of the suit, and, accordingly, it would be \u201cinappropriate for any court to presume that it knows better than the parents what is in the best interests of [their] child.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>Contrary to the majority\u2019s holding, I would conclude that there is often, if not always, a very real conflict once the child\u2019s cause of action accrues and that this conflict justifies judicial examination of any substantive decisions thereafter made by the parent on the child\u2019s behalf. That is the reason we have repeatedly held that once an injury occurs, a parent may not release or settle the child\u2019s claim without judicial approval. <em>Moscatello ex rel. Mosca-tello v. Univ. of Med. and Dentistry of N.J., </em>342 <em>N.J.Super. </em>351, 360-61, 776 A.2d 874, 879-80 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>207, 785 A.2d 435 (2001); <em>Riemer v.

Royal Globe Ins. Co., </em>214 <em>N.J.Super. </em>374, 377, 519 A.2d 893, 894 (App. Div.1986). On the other hand, there is no conflict between parent and child when a parent decides to execute a pre-tort release in order to permit the child to participate in such an activity and, thus, there is no legitimate public interest in having the judiciary intervene in, or override, such a decision. Indeed, it is interesting to observe that this court has shown more deference to the decisions of a parent to settle or not settle a child\u2019s pending claim than the majority has given to Anastasia\u2019s pre-tort decisions. <em>See, e.g., Zukerman, supra, </em>232 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 95-97, 556 A.2d at 785-87.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>D</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">The public policy that has led the majority to conclude that a pre-tort release may not validly bar a child\u2019s personal injury claim is the law\u2019s solicitude for the rights of children. That is certainly a laudable consideration that should not be discounted,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but here it has been exalted over the public\u2019s interest in the continued viability of businesses that make available places for such sporting activities. In refusing to permit a parent to waive a child\u2019s future tort claim, I believe the majority has failed to appreciate the impact this decision may have upon the operators of such facilities and, indeed, upon other children such as Andrew.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">The result of the majority\u2019s decision may be the inability of operators of such facilities to profitably stay in business. It may be expected that with the evisceration of pre-tort releases, a facility such as Vans may anticipate an increase in insurance premiums, or an unavailability of liability insurance, that may render its business unprofitable.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In addition, it is unlikely this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>economic impact could be overcome by excluding children and allowing only adults into the facility. The vast majority of skateboarders are minors<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and, thus, barring their admission would undoubtedly lead to a precipitous decline in such a facility\u2019s income.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Extrapolating further, the barring of minors from such facilities would cause their return to the streets, driveways and sidewalks in their communities, where the dangers to themselves and others are undoubtedly greater than in the controlled setting of a skateboard facility. <em>See, e.g., Rosen v.

In fact, the choice we may very well be making is between the child having access to such a facility without a right to sue and no such facility at all.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">The majority asserts that there is no evidence to suggest that such recreational facilities would be lost if operators cannot protect themselves through pre-tort releases. My first response is that this evidence may very well come in the form of closed businesses in the near future. For example, as Judge King recognized in <em>Calhanas v. South Amboy Roller Rink, </em>292 <em>N.J.Super. </em>513, 518, 679 A.2d 185, 187 (App.Div.1996), the New Jersey Roller Skating Rink and Fair Liability Act (the Roller Skating Act), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:14-1 to -7, was passed in response to the decline of roller skating rinks both in this State (from 50 such facilities in 1981 to 21 in 1991) and nationwide (from 2,400 in 1975 to 1,150 in 1991). While similar evidence is not presently available regarding what may become of skateboarding facilities in the absence of the Legislature\u2019s protection, if they cannot contractually limit their liability, the majority\u2019s blanket invalidation of pre-tort releases in this setting may very well generate the type of evidence it presently seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Secondly, I believe the evidence the majority claims is now absent can be found in our Legislature\u2019s findings in enacting the Roller Skating Act. While I agree that the Act does not expressly govern the rights and liabilities of the parties to this case, <em>see </em>N.J.S.A. 5:14r-3(b) and (c), the activity in question certainly pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>sesses similarities. Accordingly, I believe we should not discard but give substantial weight to the Legislature\u2019s finding that such activities are worthy of protection and that, without a clear delineation of the extent of an operator\u2019s liability, the survival of such facilities will be greatly jeopardized.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">With regard to the less hazardous activity of roller skating, the Legislature made the following findings that I believe have equal or perhaps even greater applicability to skateboarding facilities:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-6\">a. The Legislature finds and declares that the recreational sport of roller skating is practiced by a large number of citizens of this State; provides a wholesome and healthy family activity which should be encouraged, and attracts to this State a large number of nonresidents, significantly contributing to the economy of this State. Therefore, the allocation of the risks and costs of roller skating is an important matter of public policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-7\">b. The Legislature finds and declares that roller skating rink owners face great difficulty in obtaining liability insurance coverage, and that when such insurance coverage is available, drastic increases in the cost of the insurance have taken place and many roller skating rink owners are no longer able to afford it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-8\">This lack of insurance coverage adversely affects not only the roller skating rink owners themselves, but also patrons who may suffer personal injury and property damage as a result of accidents which occur on the premises of the roller skating rink.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-9\">In order to make it economically feasible for insurance companies to provide coverage to roller skating rinks, the incidence of liability should be more predictable. That predictability may be achieved by defining the limits of the liabilities of roller skating rink operators in order to encourage the development and implementation of risk reduction techniques.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-10\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>5:14-2.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-11\">Since the Legislature has not enacted similar protections for both patrons and operators of skateboarding facilities, I believe that an entity, such as Vans, may attempt to fairly define the scope of its liability through the execution of an agreement such as that in question here. Because the Legislature has seen fit to protect roller skating rink operators by rendering predictable \u201cthe incidence of liability,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:14-2(b), in order to render feasible the providing of liability coverage by insurance companies, I fail to see how it is contrary to public policy for a skateboarding facility operator to secure a similar level of predictability by obtaining pre-tort releases from patrons.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>E</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">I also disagree with the majority\u2019s analysis because I believe the decision to permit the pursuit of a tort remedy, which is the upshot of the majority\u2019s decision, must be squarely centered upon the understanding that the creation of a tort standard \u2014 or, viewed from another legal viewpoint, the rejection of a free and voluntary contract \u2014 should have as its consequence the creation of safer premises and products. The imposition of tort liability is useful in society not merely to compensate injured persons but to deter unsafe conduct by those found liable and others similarly situated. In this way, the law has a shadowy, beneficial impact that guides and molds future conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Here, the result of the majority\u2019s decision is, in my view, all shadow and no benefit. Preventing Vans from insulating itself from claims for injuries sustained by a skateboarder that result from the inherent risks of the sport cannot possibly prompt Vans to mold its conduct in a beneficial way. The imposition of all the tort liability in the world on an operator of such a facility, for injuries resulting from the sport\u2019s inherent risks, will not bring about a beneficial change in its facility. If Andrew merely fell off his skateboard, I fail to see how the imposition of tort liability on Vans would cause Vans to make any beneficial alteration in its premises. Thus, the imposition of tort liability in such an instance would produce no societal benefit. And, if Vans is to be held responsible for injuries resulting from a skateboarder\u2019s mere fall from his skateboard, should we either anticipate or welcome a change in the facility that would protect against similar future occurrences? If such facilities felt compelled by the possibility of tort liability to adopt additional safety precautions to prevent such inevitable injuries, will skateboarding eventually take place in a large padded room by participants wrapped in styrofoam and suspended by wires to catch them from hitting the ground upon falling? At that point, if not much sooner, skateboarding ceases to be skateboarding. An overreaching onslaught of tort liability upon such businesses would eventually bring an end to skate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>boarding and numerous other \u201cextreme sports\u201d as practiced in controlled facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">These views, I hasten to add, are not mine alone. The Legislature has already determined that there is a place in society for other inherently hazardous sports, such as skiing, sledding and tobogganing, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:13-1 to -11, roller skating, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:14-1 to -7, and equine animal activities, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:15-1 to -12. Indeed, while the Legislature has not enacted similar legislation regarding skateboarding, it is noteworthy that skateboarding may be viewed as a combination of roller skating and skiing or sledding, sports our Legislature has determined worthy of its protection through the creation of parameters governing liability and the assumption of risk. Because of its concern that businesses involved in such sports are endangered by ruinous lawsuits and spiraling insurance costs \u2014 thus causing an unwarranted detrimental impact on the State\u2019s economy<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u2014 the Legislature has enacted standards of care that preclude claims for injuries to participants, regardless of age,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> resulting from the inherent risks of skiing, sledding, tobogganing and using other similar vehicles, <em>N.J.S.A. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>5:13-5, roller skating, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:14-6,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and equestrian sports, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:15-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">Since it would seem, without knowing more about how this accident occurred, Andrew\u2019s claim for damages must fail if it is shown that his injury occurred as a result of a risk he assumed, such as falling off his skateboard, being struck or knocked off his skateboard by another participant, by some defect in his own skateboard, or in failing to heed instructions as to the use of the facility, I see no reason why his parent\u2019s promise not to seek damages for the injuries resulting from such inherent risks should not be enforced. Such an agreement, if executed by a parent in conjunction with a child\u2019s use of a ski slope or a roller skating rink, would not be void against, but entirely consistent with, public policy. I believe the same approach should be adopted here.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Just as the Roller Skating Act does not immunize operators but merely \u201cafford[s] them more predictable liability exposure,\u201d <em>Derri-cotte v. United Skates of Am., </em>350 <em>N.J.Super. </em>227, 235, 794 A.2d 867, 872 (App.Div.2002) (quoting <em>Calhanas, supra, </em>292 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 525, 679 A.2d at 191), Vans\u2019 pre-tort release purports to do much the same thing. It makes no attempt to insulate Vans from all claims of all types, but instead advises patrons of their right to sue for some claims but not others. Just as the Legislature has erected parameters for the operation of roller skating rinks that define the operator\u2019s obligations and the risks that patrons assume, I find no public policy that would prevent a skateboarding facility from setting reasonable parameters regarding its undertaking through the securing of pre-tort releases.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">The only question that remains is whether the pre-tort release in question pushes the parameters of what claims may be released and what should be preserved beyond reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">In this regard, it is important to recognize that the pre-tort release does not attempt to extinguish claims based upon some unfitness or unsafe condition of the equipment supplied by Vans, but only claims that are based upon the inherent risks of the sport that the patron has assumed. Paragraph 3(c) of the document in question suggests that the patron gives up any claim unless injured because \u201cVans <em>intentionally </em>failed to prevent or correct a hazard caused by unsafe equipment and devices.\u201d Certainly, a court should not permit enforcement of a release of intentionally wrongful conduct, and the release so acknowledges. In addition, it is observed that the complaint does not allege any intentional conduct by Vans that gave rise to Andrew\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">The question that follows is whether the agreement includes a release of claims based upon Vans\u2019 <em>negligent </em>failure \u201cto prevent or correct a hazard caused by unsafe equipment and devices.\u201d Because the following paragraph of the agreement indicates that the patron does \u201cnot give up the right ... [t]o have safe equipment, structures and devices at the Park for [y]our intended use,\u201d or to seek \u201ccompensation for [y]our injury ... if you are hurt because the equipment, structure and devices at the Park are not safe for [y]our intended use,\u201d I would conclude that the agreement intended to permit a party to seek relief when an injury is proximately caused by some condition or equipment that was rendered or became unsafe as a result of negligent acts or omissions. This approach comports with the principle that an exculpatory agreement, when ambiguous, should be construed against the party relying upon its terms. <em>See Chemical Bank of N.J. v. Bailey, </em>296 <em>N.J.Super. </em>515, 528, 687 A.2d 316, 322-23 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>150 <em>N.J. </em>28, 695 A.2d 671 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">The construction of the agreement that appears most logical is that all claims are released unless specifically preserved within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>document. That is, the document states that \u201cVans is asking you to give up legal rights in order to enter this park,\u201d followed by the statement that \u201cusing Vans\u2019 Park, or even entering the Park as a spectator may increase your risk of harm.\u201d The only reasonable interpretation of this language is that, by executing the document, the patron has expressly assumed the risks inherent in participating in skateboarding or merely watching others engaging in the sport. As outlined at length earlier in this opinion, I cannot conclude that this express assumption of the risk is invalid or unenforceable either when applied to a claim based upon an adult\u2019s or a minor\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Another potential claim \u2014 perhaps that upon which Andrew\u2019s claim is based<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u2014 is when a participant is struck or knocked off his or her skateboard by another participant. The pre-tort release expresses the patron\u2019s agreement to waive a claim if the patron is \u201cinjured by another person.\u201d Again, because such an occurrence normally falls within the inherent risks of the sport, I would uphold the release to this extent. <em>Accord N.J.S.A. </em>5:14-6 (roller skaters assume the inherent risk of injury resulting \u201cfrom incidental contact with other roller skaters or spectators\u201d). However, the agreement also indicates that by executing the agreement, the patron agrees to \u201cabide by the rules of safety/conduct posted in the park\u201d and that the patron understands that \u201cthese rules are strictly enforced.\u201d I would interpret these provisions to mean that Vans has adopted rules for the use of the park and has voluntarily undertaken the obligation to strictly enforce those rules. Accordingly, a fair construction of these provisions would lead to the conclusion that Vans has not attempted to obtain the release of claims based upon the inadequacies of its posted warnings or claims based upon its negligent failure to strictly enforce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>those rules. As a result, I do not believe we need to decide whether a pre-tort release could secure the waiver of a claim based upon negligent supervision,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> because the only reasonable interpretation of the agreement in question reveals that Vans made no attempt to bar such a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">In the final analysis, because of the absence of any evidence as to how this incident occurred, it cannot be said whether the pre-tort release governs this claim. For the reasons expressed above, I would apply the pre-tort release to bar any claim based upon a risk inherent in skateboarding, such as Andrew\u2019s falling from his skateboard without any impact from another skateboarder or if his fall was not otherwise caused by some defect in the structures or equipment supplied by Vans; I would also apply the pre-tort release to bar Andrew\u2019s claim even if he was thrown from his skateboard as the result of a collision with another skateboarder, because that circumstance is also the type of incident that arises from the inherent risk in the sport. However, I would permit the further pursuit of the claim if the collision resulted from a breach of the posted safety rules and from a failure of Vans to strictly enforce those rules \u2014 not because I believe that a pre-tort release may not be obtained in this regard \u2014 but because the agreement in question does not purport to release such a claim. Lastly, if Andrew claims that his injury was proximately caused by some defect in the structures, equipment or devices provided by Vans, I would permit the further pursuit of this claim because it is not encompassed by this release.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>In short, because we do not know, and cannot discern from the record, how this incident occurred, it cannot be said whether Andrew\u2019s claim is barred by the pre-tort release. Hence, in my view, the arbitrator should be instructed to first determine how the incident occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">For these reasons, I concur in the majority\u2019s determination that the agreement in question is binding insofar as it requires that any viable claims be arbitrated and not resolved in a judicial forum. I also concur in the majority\u2019s holding that the trial judge should have ruled on the validity of the pre-tort release and not referred that question to the arbitrator. And lastly, while I disagree with the majority\u2019s disdain for a parent\u2019s pre-tort release of a child\u2019s claims, I agree that in this case the arbitrator must determine how this incident occurred. Other than the analytical differences we have expressed in arriving at this point, the only difference in result lies with my belief that the arbitrator should determine how the incident occurred <em>in order to determine whether the pre-tort release governs this claim, </em>whereas the majority would have the arbitrator determine how the incident occurred <em>in order to determine whether Vans\u2019 defense of assumption of the risk bars Andrew\u2019s claims. </em>As played out in the arbitration proceedings <em>in this case, </em>the distinction drawn in our separate opinions may have no practical consequence. However, we write not just for the ease at hand. There may very well be other future instances, involving the same or similar pre-tort releases, where the consequences of our differing views would not be indistinguishable as ultimately is the case here.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b644-8\"> The dbcument unambiguously cautioned Anastasia in the following plain English: \"Do not sign this document unless you understand it.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b648-8\"> The release in <em>McCarthy </em>was not enforced because NASCAR had attempted, by obtaining the release, to avoid its <em>statutorily-imposed </em>duty of care.
