The Act grants those probation officers in the Probation Officer Community Safety Unit the authority to arrest, detain and transport probationers and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>enforce the criminal laws of this State. The Act further requires the Administrative Director of the Courts to report to the presiding officers of the New Jersey Senate and General Assembly within eighteen months <em>of its </em>effective date as <em>to the </em>effectiveness of the Probation Officer Community Safety Unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">In these back-to-back appeals consolidated for opinion purposes, defendant State of New Jersey and intervenors Probation Association of New Jersey and Probation Association of New Jersey Professional Supervisors Union (collectively, \u201cPANJ\u201d), appeal from entry of an order in the Law Division on January 20, 2004, granting summary judgment in favor of plaintiff, Richard J. Williams, in his official capacity as Administrative Director of the Courts, declaring the Act unconstitutional under the separation-of-powers clause of the Constitution of the State of New Jersey, and thereby void. In A-3389-08T3, PANJ also appeals from those portions of the January 20, 2004 order denying their motion to dismiss the complaint or alternatively transferring the matter to an independent, neutral third party for resolution; denying their motion to compel arbitration and for a stay of the Law Division action pending that arbitration; dismissing their counterclaim; and denying their cross-motion for summary judgment. PANJ further appeals from that portion of an order entered on February 4, 2003, denying their application for status as party defendants and designating them as permissive intervenors pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:33-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">After analyzing the record in the light of the written and oral arguments presented by the parties, we concur with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the Act is void as constituting an impermissible infringement on the plenary constitutional authority of the Supreme Court to make rules concerning the administration of the courts, violative of <em>N.J. Const, </em>Art. III, 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">We reject the contention by PANJ that the trial court erred in declining to submit the issue of comity and constitutionality of the Act to arbitration. It is clear that the facial validity of legislation is not subject to arbitration. PANJ\u2019s argument that the validity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>of the Act must be determined by an impartial arbitrator or entity other than the judiciary is without merit. Absent federal court jurisdiction, the doctrine of necessity requires state court judicial review of the validity of the Act. The remaining contentions of PANJ are without merit and will be discussed <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">The following procedural and factual history is relevant to our consideration of the issues advanced on appeal. On April 23, 2002, plaintiff filed a complaint, captioned \u201cIn the Matter of P.L.2001, Chapter 362,\u201d seeking a judgment declaring <em>L. </em>2001, c. 362 unconstitutional on the grounds that it impinged upon powers granted the Judiciary by the New Jersey Constitution thereby violating the separation of powers clause of the Constitution. <em>N.J. Const. </em>Art. III, fl.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">PANJ moved, on May 2, 2002, for entry of a consent order permitting it to intervene. According to plaintiff, although the court never entered a formal order, PANJ was permitted to intervene on consent of plaintiff and the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">By order issued on June 14, 2002, the trial court ordered the re-captioning of the complaint to specifically name Richard J. Williams, in his official capacity as Administrative Director of the Courts, as plaintiff, and the Legislature of the State of New Jersey, by and through Richard J. Codey and John O. Bennett, in their official capacities as Presidents of the Senate and Albio Sires, in his official capacity as Speaker of the Assembly, as defendants. An amended complaint was filed on June 20, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">On July 22, 2002, PANJ filed a notice of removal of the matter to the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. After a hearing on plaintiffs motion to remand held before Judge Anne E. Thompson on September 18, 2002, the court ordered that the matter be remanded to the Superior Court of New Jersey for lack of federal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">On October 30, 2002, plaintiff forwarded a proposed consent order to the Law Division seeking to delete the named legislative defendants and to replace them with the State of New Jersey as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>defendant. PANJ opposed the consent order, urging that \u201cif the State of New Jersey is named as a defendant in this matter, in effect the plaintiff and the defendant would be the same entity.\u201d Counsel for the State expressed support for the consent order.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">During a December 6, 2002 telephone conference pertaining to PANJ\u2019s opposition to the consent order, Judge Linda R. Feinberg tentatively decided that \u201cbecause the statute <em>\\L. </em>2001, c. 362] has been duly enacted, and because the State is the one who would be authorized and given the authority to enforce it, ... the State is the appropriate party.\u201d Over objection of plaintiff\u2019s counsel and with no objection being interposed by the State, counsel for PANJ requested that his clients be made party defendants. The judge directed the briefing of that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">In a written opinion dated December 6, 2002, Judge Feinberg formalized her tentative oral decision concerning the status of the State and indicated that she intended to sign the proposed consent order. An order embodying the foregoing was entered on January 6,2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">Plaintiff filed a second amended complaint, naming the State as defendant, on January 10, 2003. The State filed an answer dated January 21, 2003, denying the material allegations of the complaint and containing five affirmative defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">In a January 21, 2003 written opinion, Judge Feinberg reiterated her determination that the State of New Jersey was the appropriate defendant, denied PANJ\u2019s request to be designated as party defendants, ruled that PANJ would remain as permissive intervenors, and denied plaintiff\u2019s request that PANJ be dismissed from the action. The judge reasoned, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-9\">Permissive intervention is to be liberally construed by trial courts, with a view to whether intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of rights of the original parties and whether intervention will eliminate the need for subsequent litigation. The court recognizes that PANJ\u2019s members do have an interest in the outcome of this litigation and as such PANJ was permitted to intervene in the action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-10\">PANJ has not demonstrated that there currently exists a [justiciable] controversy for which it should be granted status as a defendant, and in addition has not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>established that it holds a position that cannot be adequately represented by the State. Therefore, the court denies PANTs request to be granted status as a defendant in this action. In addition, the court denies the AOC\u2019s request that PANJ be dismissed from this action. Accordingly, PANJ will maintain its current status of intervenor in the action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-6\">[Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">An order memorializing that ruling was entered on February 4, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">On March 25, 2003, PANJ filed an answer that denied the material allegations of the second amended complaint and contained sixteen affirmative defenses and a five-count counterclaim. Count one of the counterclaim sought injunctive relief restraining state court action while a special master and/or neutral third party decided the matter, a declaratory judgment that plaintiffs actions violated the due process clause of the United States Constitution, and injunctive relief requiring implementation of the Act. Counts two, three and four sought similar injunctive relief. Count five also sought injunctive relief and demanded that the matter be referred to a neutral arbitrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">On March 25, 2003, plaintiff moved for summary judgment, seeking an order declaring the Act unconstitutional under the New Jersey Constitution. Appended to plaintiffs brief in support of the motion were AOC Directive # 10-73, dated May 15, 1974; an Administrative Ruling issued by the Supreme Court on April 28, 1994, captioned \u201cIn the Matter of Proceedings Concerning Probation Officers\u2019 Membership in Law Enforcement Organizations and Proposed Affiliation of PANJ with the New Jersey State Policemen\u2019s Benevolent Association, Inc.\u201d; and AOC Directive # 6-97, dated April 28,1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">AOC Directive # 10-73 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-11\">The Supreme Court, has reviewed the matter of Probation Officers\u2019 carrying weapons in the regular performance of their work. The Court directed that Probation Officers not be permitted to carry weapons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-12\">Probation work is the guidance and assistance to persons under investigation and supervision, and not law enforcement. It is suggested that where Probation Officers occasionally find themselves exposed to hazardous conditions during the course of their work, they use measures other than the carrying of firearms. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>should consider traveling in pairs or requesting a police officer to accompany them on those occasions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The Administrative Ruling dated April 28,1994, issued after five days of hearings before a Special Master and the submission of the Special Master\u2019s report, stated in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-6\">The Court has been asked to review its long-standing policy prohibiting probation officers from becoming members of law enforcement organizations along with the related issue of the propriety of the proposed affiliation of the Probation Association of New Jersey (PANJ) with the Policemen\u2019s Benevolent Association of the State of New Jersey (PBA).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-7\">^ JjC ^</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-8\">Our decision rests on the fundamental difference between probation and police organizations. Probation is an integral part of the judiciary; everything that probation does it does as an arm of the judiciary. Among other things, it is the entity that enforces judicial orders. Given the nature and functions of probation, it must be as impartial as the rest of the judiciary, totally so and scrupulously so. Probation cannot take sides any more than a court may and cannot be perceived as taking sides any more than a court may. It is not pro-this or anti-that, it is not on the side of either men and fathers or women and mothers, it is not on the side of either parents or children, not on the side of either prosecutors or defendants. It has no more right to become allied with a public defender\u2019s office than with prosecutors or police. Probation represents no special interest in society and government but one: the courts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-9\">Police and police organizations have but one interest and one role: law enforcement. Everything they do serves that interest: investigating crime, apprehending criminals, aiding in the prosecution and conviction of the accused, and in the imposition of punishment. The police stand firmly and properly on one side of the scales of criminal justice \u2014 the prosecution\u2019s side.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-10\">Put simply, the functions of police and probation \u2014 one serving the prosecution the other serving the courts \u2014 are not only different, but incompatible. Separation of the two is essential to the impartiality of the probation function and to the integrity of the judiciary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-11\">The Court has therefore decided to maintain its policy of prohibiting probation officers from becoming members of law enforcement organizations, in particular the FOP [Fraternal Order of Police] and the PBA. A directive to that effect will be issued, including a requirement that existing memberships in the FOP may not be renewed and in any event must be terminated by resignation or otherwise by January 1,1995. We also prohibit affiliation of PANJ with the PBA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-12\">AOC Directive # 6-97 further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-13\">On December 7, 1994, the Administrative Director issued Directive # 9-94 prohibiting new membership in the FOP/PBA by probation officers, and requiring resignation by existing members. Enforcement of Directive # 9-94 was suspended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>pending resolution of federal litigation. The United States Supreme Court recently declined to grant the Probation Association of New Jersey\u2019s petition for certiorari regarding our Supreme Court\u2019s decision to uphold the ban on FOP/PBA membership. Accordingly, the Court\u2019s 1994 Administrative ruling should now be enforced. That is, probation officers may not join the FOP or PBA. Existing membership may not be renewed and must be terminated by June 30, 1997.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">On March 24, 2003, PANJ moved to dismiss plaintiffs second amended complaint or, alternatively, to transfer the matter to an independent neutral third party for adjudication of all claims, affirmative defenses and counterclaims. George P. Christie, President of PANJ, submitted a certification in support of the motion in which he concluded that \u201ca hearing in this matter should be conducted by an independent third party neutral and not before the Judiciary and its representatives who have already made a final decision as to the result.\u201d Christie further stated that because safety is of utmost importance to probation officers, not only did PANJ or its predecessors lobby for passage of the Act for eight years, it negotiated collective bargaining agreements with the AOC containing provisions regarding the safety of probation officers. He added that the Act was passed \u201cover the opposition of the Judiciary both in person and in writing through its staff lobbyist, David Anderson, a former trial court administrator, and upon information and belief through other higher representatives of the Supreme Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Christie noted that a directive issued from a meeting of Assignment Judges \u201cor related meetings instructing administrators in the vicinages that the law [Act] is not \u2018self-executing\u2019 ... the Judiciary from top to bottom opposes this law\u201d and that a direct connection exists between plaintiff and the New Jersey Supreme Court. He further stated that probation officers face \u201cthreatening situations and are in harm\u2019s way\u201d on a regular basis, and have been physically confronted and have overseen probationers who committed serious crimes, including murder, while on probation. Christie also noted that based upon the employer-employee relationship between them, the Judiciary and PANJ, \u201care constantly adversaries in court proceedings and proceedings before administrative agencies\u201d and \u201care adversaries in scores of grievance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>matters,\u201d and that \u201cPANJ has filed numerous Unfair Practice Charges against the Judiciary pursuant to the Public Employment Relations Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Counsel for PANJ also filed a certification in support of PANJ\u2019s motion. Among other things, he urged that the Judiciary is \u201cthe party which refuses to enforce the legislation in question to which it is opposed and which PANJ lobbied to enact\u201d and that the State Judicial Unification Act made the Judiciary the employer of probation officers and \u201call contracts and communications with PANJ are with the New Jersey State Judiciary.\u201d Attached to counsel\u2019s certification was a letter from counsel to plaintiff regarding a disciplinary matter in the Mercer Vicinage in which the local President of PANJ was the subject of the discipline and that Judge Feinberg, the judge assigned to the within matter, had been named as a distributee of the letter. Counsel noted that \u201con January 21, 2003, Judge Feinberg issued a decision denying PANJ\u2019s request to be named a defendant in this matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">On March 25, 2003, PANJ moved to compel arbitration and sought a stay of the within action while arbitration was pending. Christie also submitted his certification in support of that application, in which he concluded that the Judiciary\u2019s refusal to implement the Act \u201cis a violation of the Health and Safety Articles [of various collective bargaining agreements between PANJ and the Judiciary] and must be referred to arbitration for resolution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">In support of that contention, Christie referred to language contained in a series of collective bargaining agreements between PANJ and the Judiciary concerning the health and safety of probation officers. In particular, he cited to Article 26.1 of the 2001-2004 collective bargaining agreement for the PANJ Case-Related Professionals Unit that provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-8\">(a) The Judiciary shall continue to make reasonable provisions for the safety and health of its employees during the hours of their employment. The Judiciary will discharge its responsibility for the development and enforcement of occupational safety and health standards to provide a safe and healthful environment in accordance with PEOSHA and any other applicable statutes, regulations or guidelines outlined in the New Jersey Register which pertains to health and safety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>matters. The Judiciary will provide a reasonably safe and healthful place of employment for all employees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-5\">(b) The parties agree to cooperate in maintaining and improving safe working conditions and health protection for the employees with established safety standards and in the promotion of safety, safe working habits and good housekeeping throughout the work environment. Where reasonably possible, each employee will comply with all safety rules and regulations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Article 26.1 of the 2002-2004 collective bargaining agreement for the PANJ, Professional Supervisors Union contained substantially similar language except the following sentence was added at the end of sub-article (a): \u201cReferences to safety are intended to include a concept of reasonable personal security and protections which shall be maintained to assure employees against physical harm.\u201d Sub-article (b) of the Supervisors\u2019 Union Agreement provided that \u201c[w]here applicable, the Judiciary shall be guided by the \u2018Best Practices for Safety Standards for New Jersey Probation.\u2019 \u201d Sub-article (c) of the Supervisors\u2019 Contract contained the same language as sub-article (b) of the Case-Related Professionals\u2019 Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">Christie further stated that the arbitration procedures contained in Article 10 of both agreements provided that the \u201cJudiciary and PANJ agreed to submit contractual issues to binding arbitration!,]\u201d \u201c[plaintiffs effort to bypass the collectively agreed to arbitration process by filing a declaratory judgment action in the New Jersey Superior Court violated the agreements negotiated by PANJ and the Judiciary!,]\u201d and that \u201cany resolution of whether ... [the Act] must be implemented is an issue for one of the five arbitrators designated by PANJ and the Judiciary: Barry Weinberg, a retired judge, James Mastriani, former Public Employment Relations Commission Commissioner, Robert Glasson, Jeffrey B. Tener and Joan Parker.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">Finally, Christie stated that PANJ had pending grievances filed against the Judiciary predicated upon the Judiciary\u2019s failure to address certain safety concerns of probation officers, and that the Judiciary had agreed that the resolution of these issues was subject to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>Judge Feinberg held a conference call with counsel for plaintiff and for PANJ on April 14, 2003. The judge referred to the motion for summary judgment filed by plaintiff and the motions to compel arbitration and appoint a third party neutral filed by PANJ. Noting that plaintiffs motion concerned a constitutional issue, the judge stayed discovery \u201cwithout prejudice.\u201d An order memorializing that determination was entered on April 14, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">On April 29, 2003, PANJ cross-moved for summary judgment. Christie submitted a certification in support of that cross-motion, and in opposition to plaintiffs motion for summary judgment. After repeating the same information contained in his certification submitted in support of the motion to compel arbitration, Christie deta\u00f1ed some twenty-nine instances between May 10, 2001, and April 2003 where probation officers had faced \u201cdangerous situations ... in the course of performing their regular job duties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Christie also stated that probation officers are given a \u201cvery superficial\u201d basic training course and, although they are instructed to abandon a field visit if it appears dangerous, they risk discipline if they do not make these visits. He added that probation officers do not receive self-defense training or have protective equipment and, although they are instructed to seek police assistance if they need help, police are often not read\u00f1y ava\u00fcable.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">Christie further certified that probation officers supervise over 100,000 adult criminal offenders and an additional 15,000 juven\u00fces resulting in a caseload of 170 cases per officer. According to Christie, many of the offenders are dangerous, and there are at least 25,000 outstanding bench warrants for probationers who did not report or comply with conditions of their probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">Christie also stated that New Jersey federal probation officers, New Jersey state parole officers and probation officers in other states are permitted to carry firearms. He further noted that it was his \u201cunderstanding that Judge Feinberg and/or her husband and other New Jersey court judges are authorized to carry firearms.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>Christie repeated information contained in his certification submitted in support of the motion for the matter to be heard by an independent third party neutral, and urged that the Judiciary possessed a \u201cbiased interest\u201d in the outcome of this case and that \u201c[t]he appearance of impropriety throughout the Judiciary is apparent based on the existing employer-employee relationship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">On April 29, 2003, plaintiff cross-moved for summary judgment, seeking dismissal of PANJ\u2019s counterclaim with prejudice. The State also cross-moved for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">On June 13, 2003, oral argument was held before Hon. Paulette M. Sapp-Peterson on PANJ\u2019s motions for reference of the matter to an independent third party; to compel arbitration; and on the motions and cross-motions for summary judgment on the constitutional issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Judge Sapp-Peterson denied PANJ\u2019s motions for reference and to compel arbitration in an oral opinion, defining the issue as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-8\">The basis of this particular application is that the defendants [intervenors] maintain that final arbiters of disputes between the Judiciary and PANJ are third parties, often an arbitrator, a special master or the Public Employees Relation [sic] Commission, otherwise known as PERC. The defendant interveners [sic] argue that no other party to this litigation has had the extensive litigation history with the Judiciary that PANJ has experienced and therefore, it seeks the assistance of administrative agencies or persons who are independent of the Judiciary to resolve this dispute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-9\">The defendants contend that this is necessary because of the adversary relationship between PANJ and the Judiciary and that often includes confrontations with the assignment judges in each vicinage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">In denying the motion to dismiss or alternatively transfer the matter to a third party neutral, and in noting that due process rights had not been implicated, the judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-11\">The Doctrine of Necessity is applicable to the present case. This Court is mindful that this case has been remanded to Superior Court from the New Jersey Federal District Court and on the basis that there was no ... Federal jurisdictional question implicated ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-12\">Clearly, there is a public need to have this matter decided immediately. Moreover, based on the fact that this matter has been remanded to Superior Court from the Federal Court, it is clear that there is no other alternative forum and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>Judiciary as a whole is implicated, thus, the parties can not act without the Judiciary\u2019s involvement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Further addressing PAN J\u2019s motion to compel arbitration, the judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-6\">[T]he interveners rely upon Article 26 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement of 2001-2004 and Article 10 of the ... Agreement, which indicates an intent on the part of the Judiciary to submit any statutory claims including any claims as it relates to ... [the Act], to arbitration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-7\">The Court rejects that particular contention and finds that the scope of ... arbitration deal[s] with ... grievances ... disputes arising under the agreement. In reading the agreement, the clear and unambiguous language of this agreement does not call for the arbitrator to interpret legal questions, that is, to determine the constitutionality of this particular statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">The judge reserved decision on the motions and cross-motions for summary judgment with respect to the constitutionality of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">On December 19, 2003, Judge Sapp-Peterson issued a comprehensive written opinion granting summary judgment to plaintiff and declaring the Act unconstitutional. After reviewing the provisions of the Act, the judge noted that it required the Administrative Director of the Courts to report to the presiding officers of the Senate and General Assembly the effectiveness of the new probation officer unit within eighteen months of the Act\u2019s effective date.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">The judge also found that plaintiffs constitutional challenge could be addressed without resolution of any factual issues raised in opposition as a basis for denying summary judgment, and that it was not necessary to await completion of discovery prior to addressing the legal issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-11\">After reviewing the history of probation in New Jersey, the judge noted that the separation of powers among the three branches of government \u201chas never meant an absolute and perpetual division\u201d and does not \u201cprevent cooperative action among the three branches.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-12\">Setting forth constitutional and case-law authority for the proposition that the Supreme Court is vested with the broadest possible administrative authority, the judge stated that \u201c[ejonsis-tent with this constitutional grant of broad administrative powers, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>the Supreme Court issued Directive # 10-73, prohibiting probation officers from carrying firearms,\u201d and the court further found that the Act \u201cis in direct conflict with\u201d that Directive. The judge added that \u201c[a]n administrative directive prohibiting probation officers from carrying weapons in the performance of their duties involves the internal administration of the courts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">The judge discounted the fact that the Judiciary had never challenged previously-existing statutes \u201cthat outlined the structure of the probation department and procedures to be followed by probation,\u201d as \u201cnot dispositive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">The judge further stated that \u201cthe focus is not upon whether the legislation interferes with the Judiciary, as it is clear that the Court tolerates actions of other branches of government affecting the judicial system,\u201d but \u201cwhat is dispositive, is whether the legislative enactment interferes with the Judiciary\u2019s mandate to administer the courts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">The judge found such interference improper because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-8\">by directing that the Judiciary deploy a certain number of probation officers to the newly created unit, the Legislature is exercising administrative prerogatives over the organization, management and allocation of judicial resources.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-9\">sj\u00ab H4 H*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-10\">Uln addition to being subject to supervision by the Supreme Court, these officers would be subject to supervision by the Attorney General, the chief law enforcement officer of this state____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-11\">[T]he Act requires the Administrative Director of the Courts to report to the Legislature, within eighteen months of the Act\u2019s effective date, on the effectiveness of the unit, despite the Constitution\u2019s explicit provision making the Administrative Director subject to the exclusive supervision by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-12\">In summary, the judge concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AH2\">while the Act represents a legitimate exercise of the Legislature\u2019s police power to address a threat to public safety, its implementation impermissibly intrudes and threatens the Judiciary\u2019s constitutional authority over the administration of the courts.

In discussing the constitutional issues presented, the Court noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-5\">[t]he intent of the 1947 Constitutional Convention was to vest the Supreme Court with the broadest possible administrative authority. Conceptually, such authority encompasses all facets of the internal management of our courts ... This was made clear by the Committee on the Judiciary which considered it a fundamental requirement that the courts be vested with \u2018exclusive authority over administration.\u2019 2 <em>Proceedings of the Constitutional Convention of 18pi, </em>at 1180.... <em>[Lichter v.

Indeed, in the minds of many, if not a majority, of our citizens this was the primary reason for their desire for a new constitution. <em>[Winberry v. Salisbury, </em>5 <em>N.J. </em>240, 244, 74 A.2d 406; <em>cert. denied, </em>340 <em>U.S. </em>877, 71 <em>S.Ct. </em>123, 95 <em>L.

[the plenary] power.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 253, 374 A.2d 449. In responding affirmatively, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-6\">We believe the trial court correctly suggested the answer when it said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-7\">Probation officers function as an enforcement arm of the judicial system. <em>Godfrey v. McGann, </em>37 <em>N.J. </em>28, 179 A.2d 6 (1962). In criminal matters they conduct investigations and submit presentence reports and recommendations, supervise probationary sentences and collect fines; on the civil side they likewise conduct investigations and submit reports in a variety of matters at the direction of the judges, collect and enforce support orders and supervise judgments entered by the courts. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:168-11, 13. In sum, they perform services for the judiciary essential to the fair and efficient administration of justice. [132 <em>N.J.Super. </em>(247) at 250-251 (333 A.2d 300) ]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-8\">The probation office in each county has been aptly described as \u201can arm of the state judicial system.\u201d <em>Essex County Welfare Board v. Perkins, </em>133 <em>N.J.Super. </em>189, 196, 336 A.2d 16 (App.Div.1975). <em>See also, In re: Salaries for Probation Officers of Bergen County, </em>[58 <em>N.J. </em>422, 278 A.2d 417 (1971) ] <em>supra; B. </em>1:34-4.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-9\">It accordingly seems clear that probation officers play an important and indeed vital role in the administration of justice, both in the criminal and civil courts, throughout the State. It follows that as an integral part of the court system, they necessarily come within the regulatory control and superintendence of this Court. <em>[Ibid.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">In view of the foregoing analysis, the Court then posed the critical question whether probation officers, who are \u201csubject to judicial supervision resting upon a constitutional mandate,\u201d are also subject to the Employer-Employee Relations Act. <em>Id. </em>at 254, 374 A.2d 449. The Court resoundingly answered in the negative, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-11\">Stated more generally, can the control of probation officers and of the whole statewide system of probation, seemingly entrusted to the Judiciary by the terms of the Constitution, be in any way diluted or modified by legislation? Subject to what is set forth below, we think it clear that it cannot. As Chief Justice Vanderbilt observed in <em>Winberry v. Salisbury, supra,</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-12\">Complete power and responsibility in the judiciary are concepts quite inconsistent with the notions of overriding legislation. [5 <em>N.J. </em>at 249, 74 A.2d 406]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-P\">The authority conferred upon this Court by <em>N.J. Const., </em>Art. 6, \u00a7 2, It 3, to make rules governing the administration of the judicial system, was not to be found in our earlier Constitutions of 1776 and 1844. It first appeared in the Judicial Article of the Constitution of 1947 and became effective September 15, 1948. <em>N.J. Const., </em>Art. 11, \u00a7 4,1114. At that time there were, of course, on the statute books multiple <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>and farflung legislative arrangements that, in one way or another, were concerned with the administration of the courts of the State and with those public employees who were part of the court system. Examples, as to the latter, might include statutes concerning pension rights, those concerning workmen\u2019s compensation benefits or those having to do with civil service. Each of these bodies of legislation \u2014 and others as well \u2014 affects public employees, including those engaged in aspects of judicial administration. Since September, 1948 much other legislation, of the kind described above, has been adopted, including the New Jersey Employer-Employee Relations Act, which the plaintiff here invokes. The question then arises as to whether these statutory arrangements have precedence over rules of this Court promulgated pursuant to its obligation to insure a proper administration of the court system.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-5\">The conclusion is quite inescapable that the constitutional mandate given this Court to \u201cmake rules governing the administration of all courts in the State\u201d transcends the power of the Legislature to enact statutes governing those public employees properly considered an integral part of the court system.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 254-55, 374 A.2d 449.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-7\"><em>R. </em>1:34-4, entitled \u201cProbation Officers and Volunteers in Probation,\u201d which is included in \u201cChapter IV.

As we noted in <em>Lichter v. Monmouth County, </em>114 <em>N.J.Super. </em>343, 348-49, 276 A.2d 382 (App.Div.1971):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-5\">The jurisdiction of the Chief Justice and the Supreme Court over court reporters is not dependent upon the court\u2019s power to supervise practice and procedure \u201csubject to law\u201d but, rather, the power to make rules governing the administration of the courts. <em>N.J. Const., </em>Art. VI, \u00a7 II, 113. Within the meaning and concept of that constitutional provision, whether court proceedings should be recorded and, if so, by what means, is a matter within the ambit of the administration of the courts. The constitutional administrative power is absolute and unqualified, and our Supreme Court has characterized it as the \u201cplenary responsibility for the administration of all courts in the State.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-6\">[Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">With regard to the binding effect of administrative directives, Judge Stern stated in <em>State v. Linares, </em>192 <em>N.J.Super. </em>391, 397, 470 A.2d 39 (Law Div.1983), that in addition to the Supreme Court\u2019s constitutional authority to \u201cpromulgate rules of administration as well as practice and procedure, ... the Chief Justice, as administrative head of the court system, can promulgate binding directives either directly or through the Administrative Director of the Courts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">In view of the Court\u2019s holding in <em>Passaic County, </em>it is clear that probation officers, as employees of the Judiciary, are unquestionably subject to the Court\u2019s administrative directives promulgated in accordance with its plenary constitutional authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">Contrary to the State\u2019s assertion, the Supreme Court\u2019s authority to promulgate rules of practice and procedure is not implicated in this ease because the directive prohibiting probation officers from carrying weapons and the Judiciary\u2019s policy that probation officers are not law enforcement personnel, clearly fall within the sphere of administration and internal management. The court in <em>Suchit v. Baxt, </em>176 <em>N.J.Super. </em>407, 427, 423 A.2d 670 (Law Div.1980), characterized a \u201cprocedural rule\u201d as \u201cone step in the ladder to final determination and [which] can effectively aid a court function.\u201d Rules falling into the category of practice and procedure include a court rule that limited the time to appeal from a final judgment to forty-five days, <em>Winberry, supra, </em>5 <em>N.J. </em>at 248, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>74 A.2d 406; a long-arm rule, <em>Sears Roebuck &amp; Co. v. Katzmann, </em>137 <em>N.J.Super. </em>106, 109, 348 A.2d 193 (App.Div.1975), and a rule governing the reopening of a judgment, <em>Borough of New Shrewsbury v.

In resolving this conflict in favor of the rule, the Court was called upon to interpret the phrase \u201csubject to law\u201d within the meaning of Article VI, \u00a7 2, H 3 of the Constitution of 1947. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">The Court held that based upon its analysis of the pertinent provisions of the 1947 Constitution, \u201cthe phrase \u2018subject to law\u2019 cannot be taken to mean subject to legislation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 245, 74 A.2d 406. A \u201cdual exercise of rule-making power\u201d would, according to the Court, result in a \u201cchaotic situation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 245-46, 74 A.2d 406. Rather, the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-7\">What, then, is the meaning of \u201csubject to law\u201d? The only interpretation of \u201csubject to law\u201d that will not defeat the objective of the people to establish an integrated judicial system and which will at the same time give rational significance to the phrase is to construe it as the equivalent of substantive law as distinguished from pleading and practice. The distinction between substantive law, which defines our rights and duties, and the law of pleading and practice, through which such rights and duties are enforced in the courts, is a fundamental one that is part of the daily thinking of judges and lawyers. Substantive law includes much more than legislation, it comprehends also the rights and duties which have come down to us through the common law. The phrase \u201csubject to law\u201d in Article VI, Section II, paragraph 3 of the Constitution thus serves as a continuous reminder that the rule-making power as to practice and procedure must not invade the field of the substantive law as such. While the courts necessarily make new substantive law through the decision of specific cases coming before them, they are not to make substantive law wholesale through the exercise of the rule-making power.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-8\">[Id. at 247-48, 74 A.2d 406.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">Through administrative directives, the Supreme Court unambiguously decreed that its employee-probation officers are not to carry firearms, that probation work is not law enforcement, and that probation officers are therefore not permitted to join law enforcement unions such as the PBA and FOP.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>Surely, these directives arose out the Court\u2019s plenary powers to \u201cmake rules governing the administration of all courts in the State,\u201d within the meaning of <em>N.J. Const., </em>Art VI, \u00a7 2, 1f 3, since they are concerned with the function and duties of probation officers. <em>Passaic County, supra, </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>at 253, 374 A.2d 449. The directives do not arise out of the Court\u2019s constitutional authority to make rules governing practice and procedure because the directives have nothing to do with steps leading to a final determination of a lawsuit. Any argument that the directives are subject to the Act is unavailing because, as noted, the directives do not relate to practice and procedure, and the phrase \u201csubject to law\u201d which precedes \u201cpractice and procedure\u201d in <em>N.J. Const., </em>Art VI, \u00a7 2, 113, does not mean subject to legislation. <em>Winberry, supra, </em>5 <em>N.J. </em>at 245, 74 A.2d 406.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Defendants rely upon <em>State v. Leonardos, </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>360, 375 A.2d 607 (1977), to bolster their position that the directives \u201cfall squarely within the practice and procedure of the [Supreme] Court.\u201d In <em>Leonardis, </em>the Court held that \u201c[a]s a procedural alternative to trial, PTI [the pre-trial intervention diversionary program] falls within the practice and procedure over which ... [it] has control through its rule-making powers\u201d and that \u201cPTI ... [is] a remedial aspect of a criminal proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 368, 370, 375 A.2d 607. Here, however, the directives at issue do not relate to a proceeding pending before a court. Rather, they deal with the Supreme Court\u2019s superintendence of the function and duties of a specific class of Judiciary employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Defendants nevertheless argue that since the separation of powers doctrine does not require \u201cwatertight\u201d compartmentalization of the three branches of government, the Judiciary must make every effort to accommodate the Legislature in its enactment of the Act in the interest of comity and must attempt to harmonize its constitutional grant of rule-making power with the Legislature\u2019s grant of police power.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">There is no question that the three branches of government do not stand in isolation from each other. Although the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>Court has unfettered authority to issue these directives, the crucial question to be considered is whether the Judiciary should defer to the will of the Legislature in this particular ease. <em>N.J. Const., </em>Art. Ill, \u00a7 1 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-6\">The powers of the government shall be divided among three distinct branches, the legislative, executive, and judicial. No person or persons belonging to or constituting one branch shall exercise any of the powers properly belonging to either of the others, except as expressly provided in this Constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">In <em>Communications Workers v. Florio, </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>439, 617 A.2d 223 (1992), the Supreme Court considered whether the above-noted constitutional provision was violated by provisions of appropriation legislation containing mandatory language directing \u201cthat personnel reductions shall be accomplished by layoffs of managerial and other exempt personnel outside ... collective bargaining units.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 443, 617 A.2d 223. In discussing the separation of powers provision, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-8\">Despite the explicit constitutional mandate that \u201ccontemplates that each branch of government will exercise fully its own powers without transgressing upon powers rightfully belonging to a cognate branch,\u201d <em>Knight v.

Chief Justice, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>495, 497, 572 A.2d 613 (1990), the Court considered whether it was compelled by its decision in <em>Passaic County </em>to negotiate agency fees with judicial employee labor unions pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-5.5(a). The Judiciary had refused to negotiate that issue. <em>Ibid. </em>The trial court upheld that refusal, reasoning that the Supreme Court had \u201cexclusive power over the administration of the court system, including the power to determine its own policies in the judicial labor relations field, despite conflicting legislative provisions.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>In affirming the judgment of the trial court, the Court unequivocally stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-5\">Plaintiff would read ... <em>[Passaic County </em>1 as somehow creating an inflexible rule of law restricting this Court\u2019s constitutional, exclusive power over the administration of the judiciary. It claims that this Court may adopt rules of administration in conflict with a statute only when it is \u201cconstitutionally compelled\u201d to do so, thereby implying an extremely narrow scope to our power to govern the courts. We disagree. Very simply, and fairly read, that ease sets forth this Court\u2019s policy that when a statute has an impact on our administration, we will follow it unless it interferes with the effective functioning of the courts. And so we have done. The occasions when we have concluded that our exclusive responsibility to administer the judicial system calls for a result different from that ordained by the Legislature are few. In this spirit of comity, we will continue to defer to the Legislature. But our obligation to give the people of this state effective administration of justice, squarely imposed on us by the constitutional grant of exclusive responsibility over the administration of the court system, cannot be diluted, as it would be, by plaintiffs restrictive interpretation of [Passaic <em>County </em>]. Rather, in each instance we must examine the terms of the legislative enactment, its importance, the extent of its interference with sound judicial administration, and the significance of the issue to the judiciary, ultimately striking a balance between the interests served by comity and those served by the administration of justice. The reams of statutory material with which we have complied overwhelm the few instances when we have gone our own way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 501, 572 A.2d 613.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">The Court noted, however, that the question of agency fees was under consideration by the Chief Justice \u201cin his constitutional capacity as administrative head of the judicial branch of government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 498, 572 A.2d 613. The Court added that \u201c[administrative action ... will ordinarily be the means of revising or reversing ... [its] exercise of ... [its constitutionally mandated exclusive power over the administration of the courts], given the quasi-legislative discretion conferred on the Court when acting in its constitutionally allotted field.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 509, 572 A.2d 613. The Court further stated that it remained open to any application addressed to its \u201csound discretion to revise or reverse any administrative decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 509-510, 572 A.2d 613.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">In <em>Knight v. City of Margate, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>374, 431 A.2d 833 (1981), the Court upheld amendments to the New Jersey Conflicts of Interest Law as applied to members of the Judiciary with respect to their dealings with casinos, stating in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>[I]n the full enjoyment of its paramount and exclusive powers over the judicial branch, the Supreme Court has the authority, reasonably to be implied under the twin principles of the separation and interdependence of governmental powers, to permit or accommodate the lawful and reasonable exercise of the powers of other branches of government even as that might impinge upon the Court\u2019s constitutional concerns in the judicial area. The constitutional validity of such action by another branch of government, and the Supreme Court\u2019s ultimate power to accept or reject such action, turn upon the legitimacy of the governmental purpose of that action and the nature and extent of its encroachment upon judicial prerogatives and interests.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-5\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-6\">In many aspects we discern no fundamental schism between the New Jersey Conflicts of Interest Law and judicial interests.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-7\">:{; <em>% </em>:}:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-8\">We do not believe that the restrictions imposed by the latest amendments, <em>L. </em>1981, c. 142, will in any way interfere with the sound administration of the judicial system or undermine the proper regulation of the ethical conduct of members of the judiciary and the bar. Any possible doubts on this score dissipate in light of this Court\u2019s overriding constitutional authority to adopt and fashion its own regulatory and ethical requirements for the judicial branch and the practicing bar at any time it becomes appropriate to do so regardless of the Legislature\u2019s action. [86 <em>N.J. </em>at 390-91, 392, 394, 431 A.2d 833.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">The Court thereby concluded that the New Jersey Conflicts of Interest Law did not conflict with the constitutional power of the Supreme Court. <em>Id. </em>at 394,431 A.2d 833.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">Here, however, since 1974 the Supreme Court has steadfastly maintained that its probation officer-employees are not to carry firearms and must not serve a law enforcement function. The Court\u2019s rationale is grounded upon clearly stated policy that probation must remain a scrupulously impartial arm of the judiciary and must not be allied with prosecutorial or defense elements. The Act directly flies in the face of this policy as embodied in' implementing directives. Therefore, we conclude that this is one of those rare instances where the Court could not defer to the enacted legislation through the exercise of comity. Simply put, the Act remains an unconstitutional intrusion into the Supreme Court\u2019s administration of New Jersey\u2019s Judiciary.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>PANJ argues, however, that <em>Passaic County </em>has been vitiated by the passage of the Judicial Employees Unification Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2B:11-1. Specifically, PANJ maintains that the Unification Act granted probation officers the \u201cunfettered right to negotiate with the judiciary,\u201d and as a first step in the negotiation process, labor and management (the Judiciary) entered into a December 28, 1994, Letter of Agreement which afforded probation worker-employees protection through PERC and which \u201caddressed health and safety as a mandatory subject of bargaining and recognized that disputes between the judiciary and labor unions, will be resolved through the grievance procedure.\u201d This contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">It is clear that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2B:ll-4 provided for elections to establish collective bargaining representatives for Judiciary employee units and that these elections were to be conducted by PERC. However, no provision of the Unification Act diluted the controlling holding in <em>Passaic County, supra, </em>that the \u201cconstitutional mandate given ... [the Supreme] Court to \u2018make rules governing the administration of all courts in the State\u2019 transcends the power of the Legislature to enact statutes governing those public employees properly considered an integral part of the court system.\u201d 73 <em>N.J. </em>at 255, 374 A.2d 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">Although the Judiciary has undoubtedly agreed to participate in employee grievance procedures established by collective negotiations, and while health and safety issues could be addressed through these procedures, such procedures have no relation to a legislative enactment directly interfering with the plenary constitutional prerogatives of the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">PANJ also argues that the trial court\u2019s analogy to <em>Communications Workers v. Florio, supra, </em>is legally deficient because, in that case, the Supreme Court held that the Legislature unconstitutionally hampered executive discretion on staffing decisions, but the Act does not hamper the Judiciary\u2019s discretion with respect to the staffing of the Unit. Simply stated, however, the Act directly interferes with the Judiciary\u2019s constitutional prerogatives in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>first instance because it requires the Judiciary to establish the Unit. That the legislation permits the Judiciary to staff the Unit as the Judiciary sees fit is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">PANJ further argues that safety issues facing probation officers are well documented; that the Act addresses these problems; that more than three dozen states permit some or all probation officers to be armed and to perform law enforcement functions; and that Passaic County allows probation officers to carry handcuffs and provides them with guidelines with respect to the execution of arrest warrants against probationers who have violated conditions of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Although it cannot be disputed that probation officers face dangerous situations and that the Act has a salutary purpose, as noted above, the Act directly clashes with the plenary constitutional authority of the Supreme Court to make rules concerning the administration of the Judiciary. That other states permit their probation officers to carry weapons and to possess law enforcement authority is totally irrelevant. That Passaic County grants its probation officers \u201climited\u201d law enforcement authority is also irrelevant and, in any case, possibly improper, since such may be contrary to Supreme Court directives. <em>See N.J. Const., </em>Art. VI, \u00a7 2, IT 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">In support of its position that probation officers already possess law enforcement powers, PANJ pointed to the legislative history of <em>R.S. </em>2A:168-2, the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:168-11, and our unpublished opinion in <em>State in the Interest of S.B., </em>No. A-6577-00 (App.Div.

Directive # 10-73 prohibits probation officers from carrying weapons and declares that probation work is not law enforcement. It does not preclude these officers from arresting defalcating probationers, and the Supreme Court apparently has not acted to prevent that.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-14\">These statutes, however, do not grant probation officers any additional law enforcement authority not acquiesced in by the Supreme Court. Importantly, they have never been subject to challenge on the grounds that they unconstitutionally interfere with the rule-making powers of the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>To the extent these statutes conflict with subsequent directives of the Supreme Court, both statutes, whose pertinent language is derived, respectively, from sections four and seven of <em>L. </em>1929, c. 156, must yield to such directives. Thus, in <em>George Siegler Co. v. Norton, </em>8 <em>N.J. </em>374, 381-82, 86 A.2d 8 (1952), the Supreme Court considered the effect of court rules upon a previously enacted statute, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-5\">Under the settled construction of Article VI, Section II, par. 3 of the Constitution of 1947, the Supreme Court has exclusive and plenary power to promulgate rules governing practice and procedure in our courts, as distinguished from matters involving substantive law. <em>Winberry v. Salisbury, </em>5 <em>N.J. </em>240, 74 A.2d 406 (1950). It follows, therefore, that where a statute, wholly procedural in its operation, is in conflict, either directly or by necessary implication, with a rule of procedure promulgated by this court pursuant to the authority delegated to it under the Constitution, the latter must prevail. Such was the effect of our holding in the <em>Winberry </em>ease where it was said ... that \u201cOne of the objectives of the people in adopting the Constitution was to provide for uniformity as well as simplification and flexibility in the work of the courts. This objective would be frustrated by any * * * dual exercise of rulemaking power.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">In our unreported opinion in <em>State in the Interest of S.B., supra, </em>the appellant argued that he should have been acquitted on various <em>charges </em>because he was arrested by probation officers, the charges required that the offenses be committed against a law enforcement officer and that a probation officer is not a law enforcement officer. In affirming, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-7\">It is dear that probation officers have the power to arrest a probationer for violating the terms of probation, with or without a warrant, depending on the circumstances. N.J.S.A. 2C:45-3a(2); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:168-11. Moreover, a probation officer has the same arrest powers as a constable for offenses committed in his or her presence. <em>State v. Vigliano, </em>43 <em>N.J. </em>44, 52, 202 A.2d 657 (1964). The mere fact that probation officers have duties with respect to counseling probationers and rehabilitation does not change the fact that they must also function as law enforcement officers when apprehending probationers who violate the terms of probation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">Our unpublished opinion, having no binding effect, <em>see R. </em>1:36-3, held that a probation officer functions as a law enforcement officer when apprehending probationers. This ruling, however, does not make probation officers law enforcement officers for all purposes and certainly has no impact upon issues involving the constitutional power of the Supreme Court presented in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>The State has also cited to a number of statutes concerning the appointment and qualifications of probation officers, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:168-5; the powers and duties of the chief probation officer, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:168-7; salaries and expenses of probation officers, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:168-8; the appointment and compensation of temporary probation officers, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:168-9; the oath to be taken by probation officers, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:168-10; and the powers and duties of probation officers (including the powers of constables in the execution of their duties), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:168-11. The State argues that the Legislature exercised its prerogative regarding the structure and responsibilities of the Probation Department, that the Supreme Court in <em>Passaic County </em>had relied on provisions of the probation officer statute, and \u201cnever took note of any constitutional infirmity.\u201d The State questions why the Legislature is empowered to enact <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:168-5, a statute outlining the structure of the Probation Department and the procedures to be followed by probation officers, but not be permitted to pass the Act, which modifies those structures and procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">However, the fact that the Legislature has enacted statutes pertaining to probation officers, including their powers and duties, does not automatically invest the Act with constitutional validity.</p>\n<p id=\"at-dedup-0\">First, in its brief, the State concedes that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aip\">Ltjhe Legislature\u2019s authority to create the Probation Department, delineate its structure and set forth the procedures to be followed by probation officers as set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A-.168-5 et seq. has never been the subject of constitutional challenge, under either the separation of powers doctrine, or as a violation of the Judicial Article added to the Now Jersey Constitution in 1947.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">Moreover, as noted, the Supreme Court has apparently acquiesced in these statutes, including <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:45-3, which was derived from <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:168-4 (granting probation officers authority to arrest a probationer without a warrant), and <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A: 168-11 (granting probation officers the powers of constables in the exercise of their duties).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">Most significantly, the State\u2019s contention concerning the scope of the Legislature\u2019s authority is belied by the Court\u2019s holding in <em>Passaic County, supra, </em>that probation officers \u201cnecessarily come <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>within the regulatory control and superintendence\u201d of the Supreme Court, that the \u201ccontrol of probation officers and of the whole statewide system of probation, seemingly entrusted to the Judiciary by the terms of the Constitution,\u201d cannot be diluted or modified by legislation, and that the constitutional mandate granted the Supreme Court to \u201cmake rules governing the administration of all courts in\u201d New Jersey, \u201ctranscends the power of the Legislature to enact statutes governing those public employees properly considered an integral part of the court system.\u201d 73 <em>N.J. </em>at 253-55, 374 A.2d 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">The State also contends that the Act is substantive law, enacted pursuant to the Legislature\u2019s constitutionally granted police power, which \u201csupervenes all other law.\u201d This contention lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">The Supreme Court\u2019s firearms directive and the directive prohibiting probation officers from joining police unions were issued in accordance with the Court\u2019s unfettered constitutional prerogative to \u201cmake rules governing the administration of all courts.\u201d These directives did not emanate from the Court\u2019s authority, \u201csubject to law,\u201d to make rules governing practice and procedure. The State\u2019s \u201csubject to\u201d argument is therefore unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">As the Court noted in <em>State v. Vawter, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>56, 63, 642 A.2d 349 (1994):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-8\">Our cases recognize that \u201c[i]n the exercise of police power, a state may enact a statute to promote public health, safety or the general welfare.\u201d The authority of the State to regulate is limited, however; a State may not exercise its police power in a manner \u201crepugnant to the fundamental constitutional rights guaranteed to all citizens.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-9\">[Quoting <em>State, Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Protection v. Ventron Corp., </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>473, 499, 468 A.2d 150 (1983) and <em>Gundaker Cent. Motors v. Gassert, </em>23 <em>N.J. </em>71, 79, 127 A.2d 566 (1956), <em>appeal denied, </em>354 <em>U.S. </em>933, 77 <em>S.Ct. </em>1397, 1 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d 1533 (1957).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-10\">Similarly, although the Act may have been passed in accordance with the exercise of the police power to protect probation officers and the citizenry in general, it nevertheless trammels upon the Supreme Court\u2019s plenary constitutional authority to make rules concerning the administration of the courts. Stated differently, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>that the Act may be considered an exercise of police power does not make it constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Accordingly, we conclude Judge Sapp-Peterson properly ruled that the Act was unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">PANJ also contends the trial court erred in denying their request that the matter be submitted to arbitration in accordance with their collective bargaining agreements. PANJ argues that arbitration is favored and that their collective bargaining agreements require that the Judiciary arbitrate breaches of Articles 26 and 26.1, the health and safety provision. PANJ asserts that by filing a declaratory judgment action, the Judiciary has sought to usurp the arbitration provisions in the 2001-2004 and in the 2000-2004 collective bargaining agreements between the Judiciary and PANJ Case Related Unit and between the Judiciary and PANJ Professional Supervisors Union, respectively. PANJ further asserts that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:24-4 requires that plaintiffs action be stayed pending arbitration. These contentions are devoid of merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">As stated in <em>Board of Educ. of Tp. of Neptune v. Neptune Tp. Educ. Ass\u2019n, </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>16, 22, 675 A.2d 611 (1996):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-10\">[The Employer-Employee Relations Act! created certain substantive rights and limitations, including a rule against the alteration of existing working terms and conditions. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-5.3 provides that \u201c[plroposed new rules or modifications of existing rules governing working conditions shall be negotiated with the majority representative before they are established.\u201d Stated negatively, this rule, known as the prescription against unilateral change of the <em>status quo, </em>\u201cprohibills] an employer from unilaterally altering the status quo concerning mandatory bargaining topics, whether established by expired contract or by past practice, without first bargaining to impasse.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-11\">The overriding issue here \u2014 the constitutionality of the Act \u2014 is exclusively determinable by courts of competent jurisdiction, and not by an arbitrator. \u201cThe function of the courts is to review legislative enactments to determine their constitutionality.\u201d <em>State v.

Indeed, \u201c[n]o administrative agency has jurisdiction to declare a statute unconstitutional.\u201d <em>Stubaus v. Whitman, </em>339 <em>N.J.Super. </em>38, 62, 770 A.2d 1222 (App.Div.2001), <em>certif. denied, </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>442, 794 A.2d 181 (2002). As noted in <em>Student Members of the Playcrafters v.

Bd. of Educ., </em>177 <em>N.J.Super. </em>66, 73, 424 A.2d 1192 (App.Div.), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>88 <em>N.J. </em>74, 438 A.2d 543 (1981):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-5\">Ordinarily, administrative remedies must be exhausted before resort is had to the courts. However, the exhaustion doctrine is neither jurisdictional nor absolute. One of the exceptions to the doctrine arises when only a question of law need be resolved. Thus, when, as in this matter, the only challenge to the Board\u2019s policy is based on constitutional grounds and no factual issues exist which require administrative determination, the doctrine of exhaustion is not applicable, and judicial intervention is justified.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">If an administrative agency, which is vested with \u201cspecialized expertise,\u201d <em>In re Protest of Coastal Permit Program Rules, 354 N.J.Super. </em>293, 330, 807 A.2d 198 (App.Div.2002), lacks jurisdiction to declare a statute facially unconstitutional, then such proposition applies with greater force to an arbitrator. As stated by the Supreme Court of Connecticut in <em>Caldor, Inc. v. Thornton, </em>191 <em>Conn. </em>336, 464 A.2d 785, 791 n. 6 (1983), <em>aff'd, </em>472 <em>U.S. </em>703, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>2914, 86 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>557 (1985) (citations omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-7\">Our conclusion <em>that the </em>board [of mediation] does <em>not </em>possess the authority to decide issues of facial unconstitutionality does not conflict with the established principle that arbitrators act in a quasi-judicial capacity and are empowered to decide factual and legal questions unless the submission states otherwise____ Because of the public policy favoring expeditious dispute resolution in the informal context of arbitration rather than in the more formal, time-consuming and expensive context of ordinary litigation, we have always respected the autonomy of the arbitration process and the attendant authority to decide questions of law and fact consistent with the submission. This autonomy does not, however, extend to determinations of facial constitutionality. A statute which granted the board such power, which lies exclusively under the control of the courts, would be void as a violation of the separation of powers doctrine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-10\">Furthermore, under the applicable collective bargaining agreements, neither the validity of the Act itself, nor the subject matter of the Act \u2014 the arming of probation officers and their enhanced law enforcement functions \u2014 is subject to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>Article 10 of the agreement between the Judiciary and the PANJ Professional Unit provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-6\">Section 1. Grievance Definitions and Procedures</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-7\">1. A grievance is any dispute between the parties concerning the application or interpretation or a claimed breach of the terms of this Agreement (contractual grievance); or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-8\">2. A claimed violation, misinterpretation or misapplication of rules and regulations, existing policies, orders, letters or memoranda or agreements, but not the December 28, 1994 Letter of Agreement and the statements in the November 20, 1994 letter from Theodore J. Fetter of the Judiciary to David Fox concerning the establishment and implementation of the title of Master Probation Officer, and other matters, administrative decisions, or laws applicable to the Judiciary, and policies applicable to the grievant dealing with terms and conditions of employment which are not included in (1) above, as well as disputes or complaints concerning policies or administrative decisions (non-contractual grievance).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-9\">3. All grievances are subject to this procedure, except that arbitration shall not be available for non-eontraetual grievances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-10\">The agreement establishes a series of steps to be followed in pursuing a grievance. Step 4, permitting the union to request arbitration if the grievance is not resolved at Step 3, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-11\">C. The arbitrator shall conduct a hearing to determine the facts and render a decision in writing to the parties. The arbitrator shall not have the power to add to, subtract from, or modify the provisions of this Agreement or laws of the State, or to determine any dispute involving the exercise of legally non-negotiable management function not waived, and shall confine his/her decision solely to the interpretation and application of this Agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-12\">The relevant provisions contained in Article 10 of the collective bargaining agreement between the Judiciary and PANJ Supervisors Union are similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-13\">In addition, managerial prerogative provisions of both collective bargaining agreements entitled \u201cArticle 12 Management Rights\u201d provide as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-14\">12.1 The Judiciary retains and may exercise all rights, powers, duties, authority and responsibilities conferred upon and vested in it by the Statutes and Constitutions of the State of New Jersey and of the United States of America, applicable court decisions and policies promulgated by the Supreme Court of New Jersey under its rulemaking authority, and directives of the Administrative Office of the Courts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>12.2 Except as specifically abridged, limited or modified by the terms of this Agreement, ali such rights, powers, authority, prerogatives of management and responsibility to promulgate and enforce rules and regulations governing the conduct and the activities of judicial employees are retained by the judiciary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Grievances pertaining to \u201claws applicable to the Judiciary\u201d are classified as \u201cnon-contractual\u201d and, as such, are not subject to arbitration. Thus, the facial validity of the Act is not subject to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Moreover, the arming of probation officers, their law enforcement status and their training clearly fall within the realm of managerial prerogatives. <em>See NJ Transit Auth. v. NJ Transit PBA, Local 304, </em>314 <em>N.J.Super. </em>129, 137, 714 A.2d 329 (App.Div.1998) (\u201ca public employer has a prerogative to determine training issues\u201d). <em>See also City of Boston v. Boston Police Patrolmen\u2019s Assoc., Inc., </em>41 <em>Mass.App.Ct. </em>269, 669 <em>N.E.2d </em>466, 468, <em>review denied, </em>423 <em>Mass. </em>1109, 672 <em>N.E.2d </em>538 (1996), (\u201cconsiderations of public safety and a disciplined police force require managerial control over matters such as staffing levels, assignments, uniforms, weapons, definition of duties, and deployment of personnel\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">Managerial prerogatives are not subject to arbitration. As the Court stated in <em>Kearny PBA Local No. 21 v. Town of Kearny, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>208, 215, 405 A.2d 393 (1979),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-8\">what may be submitted to binding arbitration in the public sector is circumscribed. Unlike the private sector, prerogatives of management, particularly those involving governmental policy making, cannot be bargained away to be determined by an arbitrator. The underlying reason for this position is founded on the concern of delegating such power to a private person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-13\">Based upon the Judiciary\u2019s view of the function of probation officers, the Judiciary promulgated \u201cgovernmental policies\u201d that the officers are not to carry weapons and are not \u201claw enforcement\u201d in the traditional sense. Under applicable case law, these policies are nof subject to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-14\">Furthermore, the respective collective bargaining agreements contain managerial prerogative provisions (Article 12) that, among other things, leave the Judiciary free to \u201cpromulgate and enforce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>rules and regulations governing the conduct and the activities of judicial employees ... except as specifically abridged, limited or modified by the terms of\u2019 the agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">The agreements are silent with respect to the carrying of firearms by probation officers or their \u201claw enforcement\u201d status. Even assuming that these agreements could, they do not, in fact, specifically limit the Judiciary\u2019s ability to promulgate administrative directives concerning these subjects. Article 26, contained in both agreements, only refers to occupational health and safety in general. Thus, the agreements are not specifically concerned with issues of firearms and law enforcement. The managerial prerogative provisions of the agreements leave the Judiciary\u2019s powers unfettered with respect to these subjects.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">As to a stay of a court action pending arbitration, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:24-4 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-7\">In an action brought in any court upon an issue arising out of an agreement providing for the arbitration thereof, the court, upon being satisfied that the issue involved is referable to arbitration, shall stay the action, if the applicant for the stay is not in default in proceeding with the arbitration, until an arbitration has been had in accordance with the terms of the agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">Since the issue involving the facial constitutional validity of the Act and issues involving managerial prerogatives were not properly referable to arbitration, no stay of plaintiffs action pending arbitration was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">PANJ also contends that because New Jersey judges are overseen by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and are subject to transfer, promotion and/or demotion by the Chief Justice, the impartiality of the judges to consider the constitutionality and enforceability of the Act is compromised. PANJ argues that since the Supreme Court, which unequivocally opposed passage of the Act, \u201ccontrols the entire [jjudicial system,\u201d recusal of judges, including Supreme Court justices, is ineffective because the Supreme Court possesses the authority to transfer and reassign judges. PANJ urges that because of \u201cthe appearance, if not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>actual impropriety relating to New Jersey judges adjudicating this matter, the matter should be forwarded to a special master.\u201d These arguments are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Although New Jersey judges are subject to assignment \u201cto the Divisions and Parts of the Superior Court\u201d and transfer \u201cfrom time to time ... from one assignment to another, as need appears\u201d by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, <em>N.J. Const., </em>Art. VI, \u00a7 7, 112, they remain independent. Thus, they are nominated and appointed by the Governor, with the advice and consent of the Senate, <em>N.J. Const., </em>Art. VI, \u00a7 6, IT 1, and \u201chold their offices for initial terms of 7 years and upon reappointment shall hold their offices during good behavior.\u201d <em>N.J. Const., </em>Art. VI, \u00a7 6,113.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Judges must remain impartial and independent. Canons 1 and 3A(1), respectively provide in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-7\">1. A Judge Should Uphold the Integrity and Independence of the Judiciary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-8\">An independent and honorable judiciary is indispensable to justice in our society. A judge should participate in establishing, maintaining, and enforcing, and should personally observe, high standards of conduct so that the integrity and independence of the judiciary may be preserved----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-9\">3. A Judge Should Perform the Duties of Judicial Office Impartially and Diligently</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-10\">The judicial duties of a judge take precedence over all other activities. Judicial duties include all the duties of the office prescribed by law. In the performance of these duties, the following standards apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-11\">A. Adjudicative Responsibilities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-12\">(1) A judge should be faithful to the law and maintain professional competence in it. A judge should be unswayed by partisan interest, public clamor, or fear of criticism.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-13\">As the Court noted in <em>Matter of Coruzzi </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>557, 563, 472 A.2d 546 (1984), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>469 <em>U.S. </em>802, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>56, 83 L.Ed.2d 8 (1984), a judicial removal proceeding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-14\">Society invests its leaders with many powers. No power is greater, nor its responsibilities more awesome, than that given a judge. The power to render final judgment is limited only by the law and the judge\u2019s conscience. Society gives this power on condition that judges be independent, trusting them and no one else.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-15\">Accordingly, we conclude that an issue involving the facial constitutionality of an enactment by the New Jersey Legislature is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>solely subject to determination by New Jersey state courts absent federal court jurisdiction. The \u201crule of necessity\u201d requires this.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">In <em>Coruzzi, supra, </em>the respondent, who was convicted of four counts of bribery, maintained that the Supreme Court should totally disqualify itself. 95 <em>N.J. </em>at 564, 573, 472 A.2d 546. In dismissing this contention the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-7\">[W]e doubt that the New Jersey Constitution in granting the power of removal to \u201cthe Supreme Court\u201d (art. VI, \u00a7 VI, para.4) intended the power to be exercised by a court composed exclusively of judges of other courts. We suspect that even if grounds existed for disqualification of the entire Court, the rule of necessity would nevertheless require that the entire Court hear the matter. <em>See Traction Co. v. Board of Public Works, </em>56 <em>N.J.L. </em>431, 439-40, 29 <em>A. </em>163 (Sup.Ct.1894); <em>New Jersey State Bar v.

There, the plaintiff Bar Association instituted a class action against the defendant Realtors to enjoin them from acts alleged to constitute the practice of law. <em>Id. </em>at 205, 287 A.2d 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">Asserting bias and prejudice, defendant moved to disqualify the entire New Jersey judiciary as well as the Chief Justice and Associate Justices of the United States Supreme Court from hearing the matter and for the appointment of an impartial panel of lay arbitrators to hear and decide the case. <em>Id. </em>at 204, 287 A.2d 14. In denying the motion, the court stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A74\">There is a constitutional limitation upon the right or duty of judges to disqualify themselves. Disqualification must yield to necessity where to disqualify would destroy the only tribunal in which relief could be had and thus preclude determination of the issue. In such case it has been held, consistently, the court must act no matter how disagreeable its task may be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-11\">sj\u00ab</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-12\">No matter what theory of judicial disqualification is advanced, there can be no disqualification of the entire judicial system. To do otherwise would contravene and erode our Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>[7d at 209, 211, 287 A.2d 14.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Even assuming the propriety of reference to a special master or to an arbitrator, any report issued by a special master or an arbitrator\u2019s award, would, in all probability, be subject to further judicial proceedings. <em>See R. </em>4:41-5(b), concerning proceedings to adopt, modify or reject a special master\u2019s report, and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:24 \u2014 7 with respect to an application for confirmation, vacation or modification of an arbitrator\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">We conclude that the order of the trial court denying PANJ\u2019s motion to dismiss or to transfer to an independent neutral third party was properly entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">PANJ also maintains that they were entitled to appeal from: (1) adverse orders entered in this case denying their party defendant status, (2) the orders for summary judgment, and (3) the denial of their motions to compel arbitration and stay the proceedings and to dismiss and/or to transfer to a third party neutral independent.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">In support of these contentions, PANJ urges that intervenors have a right to appeal, that Judge Feinberg endowed them with all rights of a party defendant and that they have joined in the State\u2019s notice of appeal. Although plaintiff argues that PANJ\u2019s appeal should be dismissed, no motion to dismiss their appeal was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-10\">Although no order was entered, PANJ was permitted to intervene: Their status as permissive intervenors was confirmed in an order entered in the Law Division on February 4, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-11\">We conclude that once PANJ was permitted to intervene, they became a party to the action. In <em>Wylie v. Hamilton, </em>365 <em>N.J.Super. </em>153, 838 A.2d 514 (App.Div.2004), a UM/UIM carrier-intervenor contended that the trial court improperly penalized it because it failed to file for a trial de novo. <em>Id. </em>at 163, 838 A.2d 514. It urged it was \u201cboth unnecessary and impossible for it to file for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>trial de novo because it had not filed an answer, was not a named defendant in the case and was not given notice of ... [an] arbitration.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We disagreed, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-5\">There is no basis for CNA\u2019s argument that it lacked standing as an intervenor to file for a trial <em>de novo. </em>... To the contrary, CNA, as an intervenor, was a party to the case, fully participating in the discovery process and the Superior Court arbitration. Whether CNA was a \u201cnamed defendant\u201d is irrelevant; ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-6\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">In <em>UFJ Bank v. J &amp; A Int\u2019l Corp., </em>354 <em>N.J.Super. </em>542, 545, 808 A.2d 173 (Ch.Div.2002), the court addressed the issue of whether a party who had only moved to intervene, \u201cappeared in the action\u201d prior to granting of the motion. Answering that question in the negative, the court quoted from <em>Mutual Produce, Inc. v. Penn Cent. Transp. Co., </em>119 <em>F.R.D. </em>619 (D.Mass.1988), stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-8\">Here, the plaintiffs and defendants together have sought to dismiss their eases under Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(a)(l)(ii), which permits all parties to an action to agree to a dismissal without further action by the court. Intervenors were not named parties when plaintiffs and defendants filed their stipulations of dismissal, nor did their filing of a motion to intervene give them party status. Indeed, motions to intervene are not granted automatically, nor does their filing constitute an automatic stay. Rather, the moving party must satisfy the court that it has met the four elements required for a motion to intervene to be granted. The stipulations of dismissal were docketed and became effective before that process had an opportunity to take place. The intervenors, therefore, were not \u201cparties who have appeared in the action.\u201d <em>See District of Columbia v. Merit Systems Protection Bd., </em>762 F.2d 129, 132 (D.C.Cir.1985) (\u201cIntervenors under Rule 24(a)(2) ... are normally treated as if they were original parties once intervention is granted.\u201d) <em>[Id. </em>at 546, 808 A.2d 173.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">Similarly, as noted in <em>New York News v. Newspaper &amp; Mail Deliverers\u2019 Union, </em>139 <em>F.R.D. </em>291, 292-93 (S.D.N.Y.1991), <em>affd, </em>972 F.2d 482 (2d Cir.1992), \u201c[u]nder the Federal Rules,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> however, once a motion for intervention has been granted, the intervenor is treated as if he or she were an original party. 7C [Charles Alan] Wright and [Arthur R.] Miller, [Mary Kay Kane,] <em>Federal Practice and Procedure, </em>\u00a7 1920 at 488.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>In a bankruptcy context, \u201cpermission to intervene as of right endows the intervenor with appellate standing to challenge an adverse judgment entered in ... [an] adversary proceeding.\u201d <em>In re Thompson, </em>965 <em>F.2d </em>1136, 1141 (1st Cir.1992). Also, as noted in 15A Wright, Miller &amp; Cooper, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure, </em>Jurisdiction 2d, \u00a7 3902.1 (1992), \u201cpersons granted intervention in the trial court become parties, and ordinarily have standing to appeal according to the rules that govern any other party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">PANJ also argues that as an interested person affected by the outcome of plaintiffs declaratory judgment action, they should have been named a defendant in accordance with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:16-50, the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">In denying PANJ\u2019s application to be named party defendants, Judge Feinberg found that although PANJ had been granted intervenor status, they had not demonstrated the existence of a justiciable controversy for which they should have been granted defendant status, and they had not demonstrated that they held a position that could not be adequately represented by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:16-56 provides that \u201c[w]hen declaratory relief is sought, all persons having or claiming any interest which would be affected by the declaration shall be made parties to the proceeding.\u201d Although it requires that those \u201cpersons having or claiming any interest\u201d be \u201cmade parties to the proceeding,\u201d it does not require that they be denominated plaintiff or defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">Moreover, PANJ was granted full party status by being named as intervenors. Therefore, any failure to designate it a defendant was of no practical consequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-10\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-11\">PANJ also asserts the trial court erred in dismissing their counterclaim because there was no oral argument on that issue and no part of the court\u2019s December 19, 2003 written decision was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>dedicated to discussing the dismissal of counts two, three and four of their counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Counts two and three of PANJ\u2019s counterclaim recited portions of the Act and demanded injunctive relief requiring its implementation. Count four of the counterclaim recited Article 26 of the collective bargaining agreements relating to health and safety, alleging that plaintiffs failure to implement the Act puts probation officers in significant personal danger and demanded injunctive relief requiring implementation of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Judge Sapp-Peterson heard oral argument directed at the constitutionality of the Act. Her December 19, 2003 opinion declared the Act unconstitutional. The necessary implication of that ruling was the dismissal of those counts of PANJ\u2019s counterclaim demanding implementation of the Act, as that determination left nothing to implement.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">The judge also heard oral argument with respect to PANJ\u2019s application to compel arbitration. In denying that motion, the judge considered Article 26 of the collective bargaining agreements and found that the matter was not an appropriate subject for arbitration. By implication, the judge found no connection between the collective bargaining agreements and the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">Lastly, PANJ argues that summary judgment was premature because it was denied an opportunity to conduct discovery with respect to acquiring information regarding judges who hold gun permits, the Supreme Court\u2019s lobbying effort against the Act and the depth of the potential conflict of interest \u201cwhich exists in the Judiciary ruling on an action instituted by the Judiciary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-11\">However, the fact that some judges may have permits to carry weapons is irrelevant to the core issue herein involving the constitutional validity of the Act. There is also no dispute that the Judiciary lobbied against passage of the Act and will, by necessity, sit in judgment of it. In short as to these subjects, discovery is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>irrelevant. As we noted in <em>Minoia v. Kushner, </em>365 <em>N.J.Super. </em>304, 307, 839 A.2d 90 (App.Div.2004), \u201cwhile ... [a] decision on a summary judgment should be withheld until completion of discovery, nevertheless, discovery need not be undertaken or completed if it will patently not change the outcome.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b583-10\"> New Jersey court rules are based on the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. <em>Freeman v.
