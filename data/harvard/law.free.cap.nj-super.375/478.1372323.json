The judgment was based, in part, on Judge Edward Oles\u2019 letter opinion of October 1, 2003, as orally amended on November 21, 2003, which held that plaintiff Richard Baduini<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was subject to the verbal threshold for injuries he suffered as a result of an accident which occurred in New Jersey on September 6, 2001, while driving his 1995 GMC Jimmy which was insured under a Pennsylvania automobile insurance policy. Judge Oles held that the case is subject to the \u201cdeemer\u201d statute, and that, therefore, plaintiff had to satisfy the verbal threshold, which he admittedly did not do. The judge subsequently ruled that \u201cgross negligence\u201d did not excuse application of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">Plaintiff is a New Jersey resident who owns two vehicles. Both are registered in New Jersey and have New Jersey license plates. The 1998 Honda Accord was principally garaged in this state and insured in New Jersey under a United States Automobile Association (USAA) insurance policy in which he elected what he calls the \u201cno tort threshold.\u201d The 1995 GMC Jimmy was also registered in New Jersey, but principally garaged at the plaintiffs vacation home in Pennsylvania and insured under a USAA policy issued in Pennsylvania with a \u201cfull tort option,\u201d the equivalent to the New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>Jersey \u201cno tort threshold.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Pennsylvania policy listed plaintiffs address as Point Pleasant, New Jersey, but noted that the vehicle was \u201cprincipally garaged\u201d at his Pennsylvania address. According to plaintiff, \u201cUSAA issued two insurance identification cards to me for my 1995 GMC Jimmy. One card was for Pennsylvania and the other for New Jersey.\u201d The \u201cPennsylvania Financial Responsibility Identification Card\u201d in the record noted Point Pleasant, New Jersey, as plaintiffs address. There is no suggestion of fraud.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, the Pennsylvania policy did not provide for the minimum personal injury protection (PIP) benefits, as required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4; <em>see also N.J.S.A. </em>39.-6A-10. To the contrary, the total \u201cmedical expense\u201d covered by the Pennsylvania policy benefit was only $10,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Plaintiff argues that he need not satisfy the verbal threshold, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8(a), because he is not subject to the deemer statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.4, as a result of his personal injury protection (PIP) coverage and \u201cno tort threshold\u201d election made under the New Jersey policy issued on the Honda. New Jersey residents have two policy options, a verbal or \u201climitation on lawsuit\u201d threshold, that bars a plaintiffs suit for non-economic damages if his or her injuries do not satisfy one of the categories set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8(a), or the so-called \u201czero\u201d or \u201cno limitation on lawsuit\u201d threshold under which an injured plaintiff can sue for non-economic damages without limitation. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8(b). The deemer statute extends PIP benefits for accidents occurring in New Jersey to persons injured while riding in out-of-state vehicles insured by carriers who are authorized to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>write motor vehicle coverage in New Jersey. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28 \u2014 1.4.1 **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This coverage is provided in exchange for requiring an injured plaintiff to satisfy the verbal threshold before seeking non-economic damages. \u201cIf defendant\u2019s insurer is authorized to transact or transacts insurance business in New Jersey, by operation of <em>N.J.S. </em>17:28-1.4, defendant is \u2018deemed\u2019 to be covered by <em>N.J.S. </em>89:6A-4 [providing PIP benefits] and thus may benefit from the exemption requiring plaintiff to meet the verbal threshold.\u201d Craig <em>&amp; </em>Pomeroy, <em>New Jersey Auto Insurance Law </em>(Gann 2005) \u00a7 15:3-3(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">In <em>Whitaker v. DeVilla, </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>341, 344, 687 A.2d 738 (1997), the Supreme Court held that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.4 \u201cdeems New Jersey\u2019s \u2018verbal threshold\u2019 ... to apply to the policies of out-of-state residents using their automobiles in New Jersey if their insurers are authorized to do business in New Jersey.\u201d The Court further held that such vehicle owners, if insured by an insurance company authorized to do business in New Jersey, were subject to the verbal threshold regardless of their choice of coverage and that the statute does not violate the equal protection clause. The Court quoted from the Third Circuit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>There is also a clear rational basis to support the Legislature\u2019s determination that out-of-state residents who operate autos in New Jersey should be <em>precluded </em>from recovering for non-economic loss unless the verbal threshold is satisfied. Inherent in the no-fault system is a statutory right to recover damages without the need to satisfy a threshold. The cost of such recovery must be paid out of the auto insurance system. Appellants, and those who would fall into their category, are not New Jersey insured. As such, they are not in a position to finance the cost of non-threshold coverage. Given this situation and the Legislature\u2019s desire to reduce or contain the cost of auto insurance, the legislative judgment was rationally consistent with the purpose of the statute. Furthermore, if the broadest coverage (no threshold) was provided to persons who did not pay for it, then the added cost to the insurer would have to be borne by others, namely consumers who purchase auto insurance. The Legislature reasonably concluded that such a situation would not foster reduced auto insurance premiums.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-5\"><em>Whitaker, supra, </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>at 355, 687 A.2d 738 (quoting <em>Dyszel v. Marks, </em>6 F.3d 116, 127 (3d Cir.1993)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">After <em>Whitaker </em>was decided, the Legislature added a provision to the deemer statute which also requires</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACm\">[a]ny insurer authorized to transact or transacting automobile or motor vehicle insurance business in this State ... [to] include in each [out-of-state] policy coverage to satisfy at least the personal injury protection benefits coverage pursuant to <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4 or <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.3] for any New Jersey resident who is not required to maintain personal injury protection coverage pursuant to <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4] and who is not otherwise eligible for such benefits, whenever the automobile or motor vehicle insured under the policy is used or operated in this State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">This requirement is in addition to the requirement at the time <em>Whitaker </em>was decided, to the effect that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-8\">[a]ny insurer authorized to transact or transacting automobile or motor vehicle insurance business in this State ... shall include [in each out-of-state policy] at least the liability insurance requirements of [N.J.S.A. 39:6B-1 or <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-3], the uninsured motorist insurance requirements of <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.1] and personal injury protection benefits coverage pursuant to <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4 or <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.3] whenever the automobile or motor vehicle insured under the policy is used or operated in this State.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APHb\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.4.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">Unlike <em>Whitaker, </em>plaintiff in this case is a New Jersey resident who insures a vehicle in this state and another vehicle out-of-state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>and pays for what he calls the \u201czero or no tort option\u201d on both policies. The question is whether the deemer statute still applies. In <em>Whitaker, </em>the plaintiff chose the \u201cfull tort\u201d option under his Pennsylvania policy, but the Supreme Court nevertheless held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-6\">We are convinced that the Legislature expressly intended that the deemer statute, as amended, would impose the verbal threshold on all out-of-state insureds that sustain automobile accident injuries in New Jersey and whose policies were issued by insurers authorized to transact business in New Jersey.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-7\"><em>[Whitaker, supra, </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>at 356, 687 A.2d 738.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">As Justice Stein further noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-9\">Because non-resident insureds do not contribute to the costs incurred by New Jersey insurers in defending full tort option claims, the Legislature obviously recognized that allowing non-residents the benefit of the full tort option for damages incurred in New Jersey accidents inevitably would increase the liability exposure of New Jersey insurers and generate pressure for increased premiums. See <em>Dyszel, supra, </em>6 <em>F.</em>3d at 127. The deemer statute is a pragmatic legislative response to that concern.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-10\"><em>[Id. </em>at 357, 687 A.2d 738.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-11\">We are satisfied that the statute is applicable when plaintiff is a New Jersey resident who owns and registers a vehicle in this state, but obtains coverage for another vehicle out-of-state, at a vacation home or for any other reason, from a carrier writing automobile insurance in New Jersey. The 1998 post-WMtofer amendments to the statute do not affect the holding of <em>Whitaker </em>in these circumstances. There is no question that a New Jersey resident who is injured while riding in a vehicle insured by a carrier who writes automobile insurance in this state would get PIP protection for an accident occurring here. Plaintiff pays premiums on the Honda vehicle registered and insured in New Jersey, and we recognize that policy would provide PIP protection to plaintiff, at least if he had no other policy with such protection. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4.2; Craig &amp; Pomeroy, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 12:2. <em>See also </em>Craig &amp; Pomeroy, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 6:3-4 (regarding insuring cars registered in New Jersey). However, plaintiffs Pennsylvania premiums are not used to provide PIP benefits under the policy for the GMC Jimmy.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As noted in defendant\u2019s brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>The fact that plaintiff also had a New Jersey-insured Honda that his wife principally drove does not negate the facts that he was operating a Pennsylvania-insured vehicle when the accident occurred and that he was not contributing to the costs of New Jersey insurers since the insurance premiums for the Jimmy were paid for a Pennsylvania policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-5\">Under the position advanced by plaintiff, New Jersey residents would be free to insure their vehicle in other states where they happen to have a second residence, pay lower premiums to the other state\u2019s insurance company, thus not contributing to New Jersey insurers\u2019 expenses, and then claim the right to the zero threshold while operating the vehicle in their home state of New Jersey.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Stated differently, because USAA would have been required to pay PIP benefits under the Pennsylvania policy for an accident occurring here, the rationale of <em>Whitaker </em>applies, so that plaintiff must satisfy the verbal threshold to bring his action here. Irrespective of whether plaintiff was entitled to PIP benefits under his New Jersey policy, we find no support for the view that the deemer statute does not apply to New Jersey residents who purchase less protection and cheaper policies for a second vehicle garaged and insured out-of-state merely because they have a policy issued in New Jersey for a car registered and garaged here.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">We also agree with Judge Oles that there was insufficient proof of \u201cgross negligence\u201d to avoid the application of the verbal threshold. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8.1(e)(last sentence). As it was agreed that plaintiff did not satisfy that threshold, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b531-11\"> We refer to Richard Baduini as plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b532-6\"> New Jersey law provides for a \"limitation on lawsuit option,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8(a), and a \"no limitation on lawsuit option,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b532-7\"> Neither party asserts that an automobile registered in New Jersey must be insured here.

We do not believe that the amendments to the statute enacted since <em>Whitaker v. DeVilla, </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>341, 687 A.2d 738 (1997), was decided affect our disposition with respect to a New Jersey resident injured in New Jersey who is entitled to protection under a policy issued by a carrier authorized to write automobile insurance in New Jersey. <em>See </em>Craig and Pomeroy, <em>New Jersey Auto Insurance Law, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1.2-11, 3.1, 3.2; <em>see also Gov\u2019t Employees Ins.

We can find no legislative history or basis for concluding the Legislature endeavored to limit the coverage provided in the \"deemer\u201d statute, as upheld by <em>Whitaker, </em>at least with respect to New Jersey residents who are protected under policies written out-of-state by carriers who write automobile insurance in New Jersey.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b534-10\"> Given the undisputed fact that USAA wrote both policies, we omit language dealing with affiliated or related carriers or the impact of an amendment to the pre-existing language concerning carriers related to insurers who do not write automobile insurance in New Jersey.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b535-12\"> It is without dispute that the same carrier issued both policies and that it was therefore within the contemplation of the carrier that the GMC would be driven in New Jersey.
