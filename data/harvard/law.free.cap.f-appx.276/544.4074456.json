The action remains pending, but Swackhamer has filed this interlocutory appeal to challenge the district court\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> denial of his motion for appointment of counsel. Following careful review, we affirm. <em>See Slaughter v. City of Maplewood, </em>731 F.2d 587, 588-89 (8th Cir. 1984) (in certain types of cases, including \u00a7 1983 actions, appellate court has jurisdiction to review \u2014 for abuse of discretion \u2014 district court\u2019s interlocutory decision to deny appointment of counsel).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-19\">Early in the proceedings, the court denied Swackhamer\u2019s request for counsel upon finding that his claims were not legally or factually complex and that Swackhamer showed he was capable of presenting his case without the benefit of appointed counsel. In denying Swackhamer\u2019s subsequent motions for counsel, the court relied on that first ruling and the absence of any reason to revisit or modify it. We reject Swackhamer\u2019s argument on appeal that the district court abused its discretion in light of Swackhamer\u2019s mental illness and psychotropic medications, because \u2014 despite these circumstances \u2014 Swackhamer demonstrated an ability to understand and present his claims, which we agree with the court are not overly complex. <em>See Stevens v. Red-wing, </em>146 F.3d 538, 546 (8th Cir.1998) (pro se litigant has no statutory right to have counsel appointed in civil case; relevant factors to consider include complexity of case, ability of indigent litigant to investigate facts, existence of conflicting testimony, and ability of indigent to present his claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-20\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b569-17\">. The Honorable H. David Young, United States Magistrate Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas, to whom the case was referred for final disposition by the consent of the parties pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
