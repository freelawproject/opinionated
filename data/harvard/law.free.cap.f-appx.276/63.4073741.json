Sept. 23, 2004), <em>aff'g </em>No. A78 840 552 (Immig.Ct.N.Y.City, Aug. 27, 2003). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-18\">Where, as here, the BIA summarily affirms the decision of the IJ without issuing an opinion, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See, e.g., Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Yu Sheng Zhang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>362 F.3d 155, 159 (2d Cir.2004). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Manzur v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>494 F.3d 281, 289 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>(2d Cir.2007). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>See Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t. of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">As an initial matter, we lack jurisdiction to review any challenge to the agency\u2019s denial of withholding of removal and relief under the CAT because Weng did not present a meaningful challenge to the IJ\u2019s denial of these categories of relief before the BIA. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Karaj v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 113, 119 (2d Cir.2006). The petition for review is dismissed to that extent. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Regarding asylum, we find that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence. The IJ found at least seven inconsistencies or implausibilities within Weng\u2019s testimony and between that testimony and the documentary evidence he submitted. The IJ properly questioned whether Weng was a member of Falun Gong, which was the basis of his claim for relief, because he could not identify where his Falun Gong certificate had come from, nor could he list any of the eight moral characters of Falun Gong printed on this certificate. <em>See Secaidar-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 308 (2d Cir.2003).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We also find reasonable the IJ\u2019s conclusion that it was implausible that Weng would have divorced his wife and fled his country on account of problems caused by his Falun Gong practice, only to practice \u201cwhen he\u2019s in a good mood\u201d or about once a week after reaching the United States. <em>See Wensheng Yan v. Mukasey, </em>509 F.3d 63, 66-68 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">Furthermore, the IJ properly found inconsistencies between Weng\u2019s testimony and his supporting evidence. The IJ properly gave Weng\u2019s purported statement of dismissal little weight where it contradicted his own testimony as to when he became a Falun Gong practitioner. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 342 (2d Cir.2006). The IJ also noted multiple inconsistencies between Weng\u2019s testimony and a letter from his friend, Xin Nian Ma, as to whether Ma himself was a Falun Gong practitioner, whether Weng\u2019s father had passed away in 2002, and whether a mutual friend had experienced any problems associated with Falun Gong. <em>See Surinder Singh v. BIA, </em>438 F.3d 145, 148 (2d Cir.2006) (per curiam). Finally, the IJ properly found that Weng did not produce any medical records to substantiate his claim that he was beaten by the police. <em>Xiao Ji Chen, </em>471 F.3d at 341; <em>Zhou Yun Zhang v. I.N.S., </em>386 F.3d 66, 78 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007) (en banc). These findings, all proper, were \u201cspecific examples in the record of inconsistent statements\u201d and, thus, provided substantial evidence for the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>Zhou Yun Zhang, </em>386 F.3d at 74. As such, we need not reach the IJ\u2019s additional adverse credibility findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DISMISSED, in part, and DENIED, in part. As we have completed our review, any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b89-7\">. Unlike <em>Rizal v. Gonzales, </em>442 F.3d 84, 90-92 (2d Cir.2006), in which this Court found that an applicant need not possess a certain quantum of doctrinal knowledge to be eligible for asylum, here, the IJ\u2019s implausibility finding was based on questions stemming directly from the certificate that Weng submitted. Given Weng\u2019s testimony that he had practiced Falun Gong for six months and demonstrated his knowledge of Falun Gong to obtain the certificate, the IJ did not err in finding that Weng\u2019s inability to testify to any of the moral characters was a negative factor in assessing his credibility. <em>Id. </em>at 90 (\u201cIndeed, we can certainly imagine instances in which the nature of an individual applicant's account would render his lack of a certain degree of doctrinal knowledge suspect and could therefore provide substantial evidence in support of an adverse credibility finding ... \u2019\u2019).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
