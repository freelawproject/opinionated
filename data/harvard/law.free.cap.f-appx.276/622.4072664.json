(\u201cPhelps Dodge Miami\u201d), and its denial of Gonzales\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment. Established precedent from this circuit compels the court to affirm the district court\u2019s decision. Because the parties are familiar with the facts of this case, we recount them here only as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-15\">The court reviews de novo the grant of summary judgment. <em>Cinelli v. Sec. Pac. Corp., </em>61 F.3d 1437, 1440-41 (9th Cir. 1995). It reviews the district court\u2019s decision \u201cin the light most favorable to the nonmoving party to determine whether any dispute of material fact exists and whether the district court properly applied applicable law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1441.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-16\">Benefits provided in a welfare plan do not vest automatically under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\u201cERISA\u201d). <em>Curtiss-Wright Corp. v. Schoonejongen, </em>514 U.S. 73, 78, 115 S.Ct. 1223, 131 L.Ed.2d 94 (1995); <em>Grosz-Salomon v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., </em>237 F.3d 1154, 1160 (9th Cir.2001). As a result, an employer is \u201cgenerally free under ERISA, for any reason at any time, to adopt, modify, or terminate welfare plans.\u201d <em>CurtissWright Corp., </em>514 U.S. at 78, 115 S.Ct. 1223; <em>Grosz-Salomon, </em>237 F.3d at 1160; <em>Cinelli, </em>61 F.3d at 1441.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-17\">Following its acquisition by Phelps Dodge Corporation, Cyprus Amax Minerals Company (\u201cCyprus Amax\u201d) was free to terminate the Severance Plan at issue here because the Severance Plan and the Summary Plan Description do not expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>vest welfare benefits and plainly reserve Cyprus Amax\u2019s right to terminate the Severance Plan. Cyprus Amax properly terminated the Severance Plan consistent with its terms and the other plan documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">Gonzales argues that Cyprus Miami Mining Corporation\u2019s (\u201cCyprus Miami\u201d) Employee Handbook (\u201cEmployee Handbook\u201d) constitutes a \u201cbinding agreement\u201d that vested welfare benefits and therefore precludes Cyprus Amax from terminating the Severance Plan. It is true that parties may set out by agreement or private design whether welfare benefits vest, or whether they may be terminated, but such an agreement must be found in the plan documents and must be stated in clear and express language. <em>Grosz-Salomon, </em>237 F.3d at 1160; <em>Cinelli, </em>61 F.3d at 1441. Gonzales\u2019s argument that the Employee Handbook vested rights in the Cyprus Miami employees and precluded termination of the Severance Plan fails because the Employee Handbook does not contain sufficient information to qualify as a plan document under this court\u2019s strict criteria. <em>See Cinelli, </em>61 F.3d at 1441-42 (stating that a plan document must \u201c(1) provide a policy and a method for funding the plan, (2) describe a procedure for plan operation and administration, (3) provide a procedure for amending the plan, and (4) specify a basis for payments to and from the plan\u201d) (quoting <em>Watkins v. Westinghouse Hanford Co., </em>12 F.3d 1517, 1523 n. 1 (9th Cir.1993), and citing 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1102(b)). Even if the court characterized the Employee Handbook as a plan document, Gonzales\u2019s argument would fail because the Employee Handbook does not vest benefits in clear and express terms and does not convey rights apart from, or greater than, those contained in the Severance Plan. <em>See id. </em>at 1441 (recognizing that contractual vesting of benefits must be stated in clear and express language); <em>see also Grosz-Salomon, </em>237 F.3d at 1160 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">Gonzales\u2019s argument that section 1(3) of the Severance Plan renders the Employee Handbook a \u201cwritten agreement\u201d that provides severance benefits also fails. Among other reasons, Gonzales is seeking benefits under the Severance Plan itself, and section 1(3) relates to severance benefits \u201cdifferent\u201d than those contained in the Severance Plan and granted pursuant to a written agreement between the company and an individual employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">Finally, the court does not reach Gonzales\u2019s argument, first raised clearly on appeal at oral argument, that Phelps Dodge Miami violated ERISA by failing to provide Gonzales with notice of changes to the company\u2019s benefits plan because Gonzales did not raise that claim in his opening brief. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A) (stating that a brief must contain \u201cappellant\u2019s contentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of the record....\u201d); <em>Int\u2019l Union of Bricklayers &amp; Allied Craftsman Local Union No. 20, AFL-CIO v. Martin Jaska, Inc., </em>752 F.2d 1401, 1404 (9th Cir.1985) (stating that the court \u201cwill not ordinarily consider matters on appeal that are not specifically and distinctly raised and argued in appellant\u2019s opening brief.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s decision is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b647-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b647-13\">. The Second, Fourth, and Eleventh Circuits have also recognized that the existence of a clause reserving the company's right to modify or terminate the plan, which exists in the relevant documents here, is inconsistent with an employer's alleged intent to vest benefits. <em>Gable v. Sweetheart Cup Co., </em>35 F.3d 851, 856 (4th Cir. 1994) (holding that a \"modification clause, standing alone, is more than sufficient to defeat plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the company provided vested benefits and thus waived its statutory right to modify or terminate the health benefit plan\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>514 U.S. 1057, 115 S.Ct. 1442, 131 L.Ed.2d 321 (1995); <em>see Alday v. Container Corp. of Am., </em>906 F.2d 660, 666 (11th Cir.1990) (rejecting a claim for vested lifetime benefits due, in part, to the company\u2019s express reservation of the right to terminate the plan); <em>see also Moore v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., </em>856 F.2d 488, 492-93 (2d Cir. 1988) (same).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
