Oct. 30, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-11\">The BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen is a discretionary decision as to which review is limited. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam); <em>Jin Ming Liu v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 109, 111 (2d Cir.2006) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-12\">The Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) provides that an individual may file only one motion to reopen, and that such motion must be filed within ninety days of the issuance of a final administrative order. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). These limitations, however, do not apply when an individual files a motion to reopen to apply for asylum or withholding of removal \u201cbased on changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality or in the country to which deportation has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e)(7)(C)(ii); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(H). Here, it is undisputed that Liu\u2019s motion to reopen was untimely and numerically barred, as it was his third motion, and it was filed with the BIA in April 2007, more than five years after the BIA\u2019s final order affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-13\">While the BIA found that Liu failed to demonstrate changed country conditions in China with regard to the enforcement of the family planning policy, Liu argues that in reaching this conclusion, the BIA failed to consider the complete record. In particular, a newspaper article in the record, titled \u201cFujian: One Over-Birth, the Whole Family Detained,\u201d published in March 2007, asserts that \u201c[t]he family planning policy is getting stricter this year,\u201d and that the enforcement of the policy was tightened in Fujian Province. According to the article, \u201cIn Fujian Province, with the largest population of \u2018Returned Oversea Chinese,\u2019 the local family planning cadres preach \u2018one over-birth, the whole family detained.\u2019 The detained family members are cruelly treated.\u201d The article asserts that family planning officials consider women who have already borne two daughters, like Liu\u2019s wife, to be \u201chigh-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>risk\u201d and require them to undergo sterilization. The article reports that in one town, the authorities compel the appearance of women who have gone into hiding to escape sterilization by destroying their homes and detaining their families in \u201cfamily planning school,\u201d where living conditions are allegedly worse than those in prison. Two other articles contain similar reports. Although Liu has not brought these documents in particular to our attention, we nevertheless take cognizance of them as they appear in the record. <em>See Jin Xiu Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>468 F.3d 109, 111 (2d Cir.2006) (per curiam); <em>Tian Ming Liu v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>468 F.3d 167, 169 (2d Cir.2006) (per curiam), <em>on rehearing at, </em>473 F.3d 48 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">We will generally presume that the agency \u201chas taken into account all of the evidence before [it], unless the record compellingly suggests otherwise.\u201d <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 338 n. 17 (2d Cir.2006). Here, the record \u201ccompellingly suggests\u201d that the BIA did not consider the articles submitted by Liu when it denied his motion. Moreover, the BIA\u2019s decision did not address other documents in the record which indicate that persons born in foreign countries are treated as Chinese citizens if at least one parent is a Chinese citizen who does not have permanent residence in a foreign country. Taken together, these documents, if authentic could indicate that: (1) conditions in China have changed; (2) the birth of Liu\u2019s children in the United States will be perceived as a violation of the family planning policy in Fujian province; and (3) the punishment Liu faces \u2014 arrest and detention or sterilization \u2014 will be forced. <em>Cf. Matter of S-Y-G-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 247, 251 (BIA 2007), <em>appeal docketed, </em>No. 07-3415 (2d Cir. Aug. 13, 2007); <em>Matter of J-H-S-, </em>24 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 196 (BIA 2007), <em>appeal docketed, </em>No. 07-2689 (2d Cir. June 22, 2007). Accordingly, we conclude that in failing to consider these documents, the BIA exceeded its discretion. <em>See Shou Yung Guo v. Gonzales, </em>463 F.3d 109, 115 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Zhi Yun Gao v. Mukasey, </em>508 F.3d 86, 88 (2d cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is GRANTED, the decision of the BIA is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this order. As we have completed our review, petitioner\u2019s pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is GRANTED, pending the issuance of a new decision by the BIA.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
