R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b663-22\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-23\">Michael Benoit appeals pro se from the district court\u2019s order granting the petition of the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) to enforce summonses and denying Benoit\u2019s motion for recusal. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-24\">The district court properly concluded that it had subject matter jurisdiction over the action pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7604(a), and personal jurisdiction over Benoit, who was personally served with the petition and summonses. <em>See Burnham v. Superior Court, </em>495 U.S. 604, 610-12, 110 S.Ct. 2105, 109 L.Ed.2d 631 (1990) (holding that personal seivice in a state is sufficient for establishing personal jurisdiction).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-25\">The district court did not commit clear error by enforcing the summonses because the proof of service indicates that Benoit was personally served with the summons in accordance with 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7603. Further, the IRS has the authority to investigate Benoit\u2019s tax liability under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7602(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-26\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Benoit\u2019s motion for recusal challenging the judge\u2019s prior rulings. <em>See United States v. Studley, </em>783 F.2d 934, 939 (9th Cir.1986) (explaining that \u201ca judge\u2019s prior adverse ruling is not sufficient for recusal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-27\">The district court properly determined that Benoit could not assert a blanket Fifth Amendment privilege to avoid appearing at an administrative proceeding. <em>See United States v. Drollinger, </em>80 F.3d 389, 392 (9th Cir.1996) (per curiam) (stating that a taxpayer confronted with a summons to appear for examination and produce documents must \u201cpresent himself for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>questioning, and as to each question elect to raise or not raise the [Fifth Amendment] defense\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">The district court did not violate Benoit\u2019s due process rights because Benoit was afforded notice and a meaningful opportunity to respond to the petition. <em>See Rio Prop., Inc., v. Rio Int\u2019l Interlink, </em>284 F.3d 1007, 1016-17 (9th Cir.2002) (stating that due process requires \u201cnotice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b663-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
