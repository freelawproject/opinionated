R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b661-17\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-18\">Robert B. Keenan appeals the district court\u2019s order dismissing his action alleging claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for violations of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 407(a), as well as state law claims. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo a dismissal pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), <em>Arrington v. Wong, </em>237 F.3d 1066, 1069 (9th Cir.2001), and we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-22\">The district court erred in dismissing the complaint with regard to Keenan\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims because he sufficiently alleged that First California Bank deprived him of his rights under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 407(a), and acted under the color of state law by surrendering Social Security funds in his bank account at the explicit direction of the California Franchise Tax Board. <em>See Franklin v. Terr, </em>201 F.3d 1098, 1100 (9th Cir.2000) (explaining that a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff must allege deprivation of a right under federal law and that defendant acted under color or state authority); <em>Carlin Communications, Inc. v. Mountain States Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>827 F.2d 1291, 1295 (9th Cm.1987) (concluding that where the state commanded a phone company to take specific action with regard to a customer it \u201cconverted its otherwise private conduct into state action for purposes of \u00a7 1983\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-23\">Contrary to First California Bank\u2019s contentions, California Revenue and Taxation Code \u00a7 18674(a) does not provide immunity from Keenan\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims. <em>See Rimes v. Stone, </em>84 F.3d 1121, 1126-27 (9th Cir.1996) (\u201cthe existence of \u00a7 1983 immunities is a matter of federal law\u201d and \u201c[cjonduct by persons acting under color of state law which is wrongful under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 or \u00a7 1985(3) cannot be immunized by state law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-24\">Because it is unclear whether the district court premised dismissal of the state law claims on dismissal of the \u00a7 1983 claims, we reinstate the state claims and remand to the district court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-25\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b661-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
