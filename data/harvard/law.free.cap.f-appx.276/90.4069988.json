July 13, 2005), <em>aff'g </em>No. A78 953 306 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Mar. 30, 2004). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-19\">When the BIA summarily affirms the decision of the IJ without issuing an opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See Tumm v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, and we treat those findings as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Delgado v. Mukasey, </em>508 F.3d 702, 705 (2d Cir. 2007). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-20\">We find no error in the agency\u2019s denial of Qiu-Lin\u2019s CAT claim \u2014 a claim predicated on Qiu-Lin\u2019s assertion if returned to China that she would, more likely than not, be arrested and tortured as a result of illegally departing her native country in the first place. We have held that an applicant cannot demonstrate that he or she is more likely than not to be tortured \u201cbased solely on the fact that [he or she] is part of the large class of persons who have left China illegally\u201d and on generalized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>evidence indicating that torture occurs in Chinese prisons. <em>Mu Xiang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>432 F.3d 156, 159-60 (2d Cir .2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Here, Qiu-Lin provided no basis for the IJ to conclude that she, or someone in her \u201cparticular alleged circumstances,\u201d faces an elevated risk of torture. <em>See Mu-Xing Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 130, 143-44 (2d Cir.2003). Although she submitted evidence that some repatriated Chinese citizens are detained, Qiu-Lin failed to show that a person in her particular circumstance is more likely than not to be detained and tortured. <em>See Mu Xiang Lin, </em>432 F.3d at 158-59. Accordingly, we leave undisturbed the agency\u2019s finding that QiuLin failed to meet the burden of proof for her CAT claim. See <em>Mu-Xing Wang, </em>320 F.3d at 143-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
