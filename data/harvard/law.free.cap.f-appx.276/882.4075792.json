He began providing logistical support and conducting education talks in 1997. In early 1998, Mojiea-Sanchez learned that the committee had been receiving written and telephonic threats. The campaign ended in mid-1998. However, in mid-1999, Mojiea-Sanchez received a threat by phone, and fled the county. He returned home, found the situation unchanged, and decided to move his family to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-11\">Mojiea-Sanchez entered the United States on November 25, 1999 on a nonimmigrant visa. On June 17, 2003, he was served with a notice to appear for having overstayed his visa. His application for asylum was denied by the asylum officer hearing his case, and referred to an immigration judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) for removal. The IJ determined that Mojiea-Sanchez lacked the extraordinary or changed circumstances needed to consider his asylum application. The BIA affirmed, and denied Mojica-Sanchez\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-13\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b907-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-15\">We lack jurisdiction to consider the merits of the underlying removal order, but can consider the denial of the motion for reconsideration. Mojiea-Sanchez had 30 days after the September 29, 2006, entry of the BIA\u2019s order affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief, to file his petition for review. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). Mojica-Sanchez filed a motion for reconsideration with the BIA, which was denied on January 26, 2007. He did not file his petition until February 22, 2007. The statutory time limit for filing a petition for review in an immigration case is mandatory, jurisdictional, and not suspended or tolled by the filing of a motion to reconsider. <em>Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). Because Mojica-Sanchez\u2019s petition is untimely as to the September 29, 2006 BIA decision, we do not have jurisdiction to review that decision. However, it is timely as to the BIA order denying the motion for reconsideration, and we have jurisdiction to review that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-17\">Mojiea-Sanchez argues that the BIA erred (1) by requiring him to prove to the IJ that he fell within the changed-circumstances exception to the time limit for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>filing asylum applications, (2) by failing to review the IJ\u2019s determination that MojicaSanchez could relocate within Columbia, and (3) denying him CAT relief where the Columbian government has willfully accepted the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Columbia\u2019s (\u201cFARC\u201d) acts of torture. We review the denial of a motion to reconsider for an abuse of discretion. <em>Assa\u2018ad v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321, 1341 (11th Cir. 2003). \u201cWe review the BIA\u2019s statutory interpretation <em>de novo, </em>but will defer to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of a statute if it is reasonable and does not contradict the clear intent of Congress.\u201d <em>Jaggernauth v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>432 F.3d 1346, 1350 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">Mojica-Sanchez contends that, once he had proven to an asylum officer that he fell within the changed-circumstances exception to the normal one-year time limit for filing an asylum application, he was not required to re-prove it to the IJ. To establish asylum eligibility, an alien must show that he is a refugee because he has suffered past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a)-(b). In addition, an asylum applicant has the burden of proving that his petition was timely or fell into the changed or extraordinary circumstances exceptions from 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.4(a)(2). An asylum determination may be made by either an asylum officer, who has initial jurisdiction over an asylum, or an IJ, upon referral from the asylum officer. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.2(a)-(b); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.14(a)-(c). Once referred to the IJ, the IJ obtains exclusive jurisdiction over the asylum application. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Mojica-Sanchez\u2019s motion to reconsider because neither the IJ nor the BIA was bound by the asylum officer\u2019s determination that Mojica-Sanchez has shown extraordinary or changed circumstances. In his removal proceedings before the IJ, Mojica-Sanchez had the burden of proving any ground on which he should receive relief from removal. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.8(d). In order to receive asylum, an alien must show both a timely application and persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 208.4(a)(2), 208.13(a)-(b). As such, Mojica-Sanchez had the burden of showing that he met all of these requirements. While the Federal Regulations includes exceptions to this general burden-of-proof rule, <em>see, e.g., </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(l)(ii) (placing the burden of proof on the government to show that an alien could not reasonably relocate within his country of origin, once the alien has established past persecution), it contains no exception for an issue that may have been previously considered by an asylum officer. MojicaSanchez points to a code provision that gives the asylum officer the authority to make a timeliness determination, but the same subsection also provides the IJ and BIA with authority to make this determination, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.4(a)(1). MojicaSanchez presents no compelling argument for why the asylum officer\u2019s determination should be controlling, especially after removal proceedings have been initiated and the IJ has exclusive jurisdiction over the asylum application, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-8\">Next, Mojica-Sanchez argues that the BIA abused its discretion by failing to review the IJ\u2019s determination that he could have relocated within Colombia. To obtain withholding of removal, an alien must show that it is more likely than not that he will be persecuted upon being returned to his country. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1232 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). Where an alien has shown past persecution, it is presumed that his life or freedom would be threatened if returned to his native country, but the government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>can rebut this presumption by showing that the alien could relocate to another part of his native country and that it would be reasonable for him to do so. <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir .2003) (citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(1)). Internal relocation is only an issue if an applicant for withholding of removal can otherwise show past persecution or a future threat to life or freedom. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b). As Mojica-Sanchez failed to show either past persecution or a future threat, the BIA did not abuse its discretion when it declined to examine the moot issue of internal relocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">Finally, Mojica-Sanchez argues that the Colombian government has willfully accepted FARC\u2019s acts of torture and that, as such, he is entitled to CAT relief. CAT provides relief for an alien who can show that it is more likely than not that he will be subjected to torture if removed. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2). However, MojicaSanchez\u2019s motion for reconsideration did not specify any errors of fact or law in the BIA\u2019s final order affirming the IJ\u2019s decision, but merely reiterated his prior arguments on this point. A motion for reconsideration should specify the reason for the motion by pointing to such errors. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 240(c)(6)(C); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e)(6)(C); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1). Thus, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-8\">After careful consideration of the briefs of the parties, and thorough review of the record, we find no reversible error. Accordingly, we DISMISS Mojica-Sanchez\u2019s petition as it pertains to the BIA\u2019s September 26, 2006, order, and DENY the remainder.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-9\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
