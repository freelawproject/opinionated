On appeal, he argues that the district court imposed an unreasonable sentence because it did not determine that prison was the most effective means of treatment for his substance abuse problem, and because his 12-month prison sentence is \u201cgreater than necessary\u201d to meet the statutory goals of sentencing under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-21\">The district court is not required to explicitly state that prison was the most effective means of treating Lynch\u2019s medical needs. <em>See United States v. White Face, </em>383 F.3d 733, 740 (8th Cir.2004) (district court need not mechanically list every \u00a7 3553(a) consideration when sentencing defendant upon revocation of supervised release; all that is required is evidence that court has considered relevant matters and that some reason be stated for its decision; if sentencing judge refers to some considerations contained in \u00a7 3553(a), appellate court is ordinarily satisfied that district court was aware of entire contents of relevant statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-22\">We conclude that Lynch\u2019s sentence is not unreasonable. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e), (h) (authorizing up to 2-year prison term upon revocation of supervised release where original offense was Class C felony; court may also order subsequent supervised release for term not to exceed term of supervised release authorized by statute for original offense minus any term of imprisonment imposed upon revocation); <em>United States v. Tyson, </em>413 F.3d 824, 825-26 (8th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (court reviews revocation sentences under \u201cunreasonableness\u201d standard announced in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 258-63, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-23\">Accordingly, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b570-19\">. The Honorable John A. Jarvey, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Iowa.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
