In the presesentence investigation report (\u201cPSR\u201d), Thomas was found responsible for distributing 229.5 grams of crack cocaine resulting in a base offense level of 34. However, because he qualified as a career offender, Thomas\u2019 adjusted offense level was 37. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(USSG) \u00a7 4B1.1 (2004). Deducting three points for acceptance of responsibility, Thomas\u2019 total offense level was 34. No other adjustments were made. Based on a total offense level of 34 and a Criminal History Category of VI, Thomas\u2019 Guidelines range was 262-327 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-16\">Thomas was sentenced following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The district court applied the holding of <em>Booker </em>and sentenced Thomas to 270 months imprisonment. In both his sentencing objections in the district court and on appeal, Thomas challenged the 100:1 crack to powder cocaine ratio. On appeal, Thomas further argued that the district court failed to fully account for all the factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000). Rejecting these claims, we affirmed. <em>See United States v. Thomas, </em>187 Fed.Appx. 268 (4th Cir.2006) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-17\">The Supreme Court granted Thomas\u2019 petition for writ of certiorari, vacated this court\u2019s judgment and remanded the case for further consideration in light of <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558,169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007) holding that a sentencing judge is free to consider the disparity between the Guidelines\u2019 treatment of crack and powder cocaine offenses in determining whether, \u201cin the particular case, a within-Guidelines sentence is \u2018greater than necessary\u2019 to serve the objectives of sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 564 (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-19\">Upon review of the record, we conclude that resentencing is warranted. Therefore, we vacate Thomas\u2019 sentence and remand to the district court for resentencing in light of <em>Kimbrough. </em>We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-20\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
