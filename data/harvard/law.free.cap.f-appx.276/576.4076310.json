Hayes appeals pro se from the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action alleging prison officials violated his constitutional right of access to the courts by denying him adequate access to the law library during prison lock-down periods. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo a dismissal for failure to state a claim, <em>Cholla Ready Mix, Inc. v. Civish, </em>382 F.3d 969, 973 (9th Cir.2004), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-23\">The district court properly dismissed Hayes\u2019 action because the allegations in Hayes\u2019 amended complaint demonstrate that, even if his access to the law library was deficient, he did not sustain an actual injury as a result of defendants\u2019 conduct. <em>See Letvis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 351-53, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996) (holding that there is no abstract freestanding right to a law library, and a prisoner must demonstrate that his efforts to pursue a non-frivolous legal claim were hindered); <em>see also Sands v. Lewis, </em>886 F.2d 1166, 1171 (9th Cir.1989) (holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>that an \u201cactual injury consists of some specific instance in which an inmate was actually denied access to the courts\u201d). Even accepting Hayes\u2019 contentions of denial of law library access during lockdown, the record supports the district court\u2019s conclusion that Hayes\u2019 federal habeas petition was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Hayes leave to file a second amended complaint. <em>See Chappel v. Lab. Corp. of Am., </em>232 F.3d 719, 725-26 (9th Cir.2000) (stating that district court has discretion to deny leave to amend when amendment would be futile).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Hayes\u2019 remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">Hayes\u2019 December 14, 2006 motion to receive a copy of the motions he submitted on November 27, 2006 is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">Hayes\u2019 request for judicial notice is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b600-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
