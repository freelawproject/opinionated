He appeals the 168-month consecutive sentence he received on the \u00a7 924(c) count, arguing that such sentence is unreasonable. He contends that he should have received a 10-year consecutive sentence, pursuant to \u00a7 924(c) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4(b), and that the district court\u2019s upward variance was not justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-26\">The district court\u2019s non-guidelines sentence is reviewed for unreasonableness, using an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Martinez has abandoned by failing to brief any argument that the district court com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>mitted procedural errors in calculating, selecting, or explaining the reasons for the sentence imposed. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). This court\u2019s review is thus confined to whether the sentence is substantively unreasonable. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 596.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Martinez argues that the \u00a7 924(c) sentence is unreasonable because the variance was not warranted, especially as he had no criminal history points, citing the application notes to \u00a7 2K2.4(b). To the extent that Martinez contends that a variance in a \u00a7 924(c) case is authorized only on the basis of a defendant\u2019s criminal history being underrepresented, the argument is without merit. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2K2.4, comment. (n.2(B)); <em>see also United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 518-19 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The district court properly relied on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors to impose a variance in this case. It specifically relied on the nature and circumstances of the offense, which it found to be \u201coutrageous\u201d and \u201chorrendous,\u201d involving Martinez and his codefendant firing 17 shots at a vehicle in a Wal-Mart public parking lot during a busy holiday shopping season. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1). The district court also relied on the characteristics of the defendant, noting that Martinez was a self-admitted paid assassin for a violent Mexican drug cartel. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1). The court additionally relied on the need to protect the public and for just punishment given the seriousness of the offense, noting that the true nature of Martinez\u2019s offense was attempted murder or conspiracy to commit murder, and it used the guidelines calculation for such offense as the basis for the variance. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) and (a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">Martinez makes no argument that the district court\u2019s consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors was improper, and he has failed to show that the sentence imposed was unreasonable. <em>See Yohey, </em>985 F.2d at 224-25; <em>see also See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b394-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
