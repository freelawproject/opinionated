Smith argues (1) the district court erred in refusing to depart downward from the advisox-y Guidelines sentencing range based on Smith\u2019s extraordinary restitution efforts, and (2) his sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>Upon careful review of the record, we conclude the district court\u2019s decision not to depart downward is unreviewable, because the court was aware of its authority to depart and of the arguments advanced in support of a downward departure, and determined a departure was not warranted. <em>See United States v. Miles, </em>499 F.3d 906, 909-10 (8th Cir.2007) (explaining a district court\u2019s awareness of the defendant\u2019s arguments precludes a conclusion the court abused its discretion in failing to adopt them); <em>United States v. Frokjer, </em>415 F.3d 865, 875 (8th Cir.2005) (stating a district court\u2019s discretionary decision not to depart downward is unreviewable; declining to review the defendant\u2019s claim that she was entitled to a departure when the court clearly recognized it had authority to depart and declined to exercise that authority). We further conclude Smith\u2019s sentence, at the bottom of the uncontested, advisory Guidelines range, is not unreasonable. <em>See United States v. McGhee, </em>512 F.3d 1050, 1051 (8th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (holding, after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), this court reviews a sentence to determine whether the sentence is unreasonable with regard to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) by applying a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard, citing <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)); <em>United States v. Haack, </em>403 F.3d 997, 1003-04 (8th Cir.2005) (declaring a district court abuses its discretion by imposing an unreasonable sentence when the court overlooks a relevant factor, gives significant weight to an improper or irrelevant factor, or makes a clear error of judgment in weighing appropriate factors).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">We affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b558-19\">.
