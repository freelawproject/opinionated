No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-25\">On appeal, Brunson argues that the district court violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights by enhancing his sentence pursuant to the Aimed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d) based on prior convictions that were not charged in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>indictment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Brunson concedes that his argument is foreclosed by <em>AlmendarezTorres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), and acknowledges that he raises it only to preserve it in case the Supreme Court overrules <em>Almendarez-Toms. </em>Brunson failed to raise a constitutional challenge to his sentence in the district court; so we review his claim only for plain error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2005).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">Under <em>Almendarez-Toms, </em>which remains binding precedent, \u201cthe government need not allege in its indictment and need not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant had prior convictions for a district court to use those convictions for purposes of enhancing a sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>410 F.3d 1307, 1315-16 (11th Cir.2005); <em>see also United States v. Wade, </em>458 F.3d 1273, 1278 (11th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2096, 167 L.Ed.2d 816 (2007) (explaining that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains good law \u201cuntil the Supreme Court overrules it.\u201d) (citations omitted). Because we continue to follow <em>Almendarez-Toms, </em>the district court did not err, much less plainly err, in using Brunson\u2019s prior convictions to enhance his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-8\">Brunson also argues that his Florida conviction for fleeing or eluding law enforcement was not a violent felony and, thus, did not qualify as a predicate offense under the ACCA.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We review <em>de novo </em>whether a particular conviction is a violent felony for purposes of the ACCA. <em>United States v. Day, </em>465 F.3d 1262, 1264 (11th Cir .2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-13\">Brunson violated Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(3)(a), which provides that one commits a second-degree felony if he \u201cwillfully flees or attempts to elude a law enforcement officer ... and during the course of the fleeing or attempted eluding ... [djrives at high speed, or in any manner which demonstrates a wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b975-14\">The ACCA defines a \u201cviolent felony,\u201d in relevant part, as a crime punishable by more than one year of imprisonment that has an element of physical force, is one of several enumerated offenses, or \u201cotherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i)-(ii). Because the crime of fleeing or eluding does not have an element of physical force and is not among the enumerated offenses, whether a violation of the Florida statute is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d turns on whether such violation \u201cotherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b976-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>We have not addressed whether a violation of section 316.1935(3) is a violent felony for purposes of the ACCA. But we have concluded that it is a crime of violence under the career offender provision, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). <em>United States v. Orisnord, </em>483 F.3d 1169, 1182-83 (11th Cir. 2007), <em>petition for cert, filed, </em>(U.S. Oct. 11, 2007) (No. 07-7070). In <em>Orisnord, </em>we concluded that the touchstone of the \u201ccrime of violence\u201d inquiry was the potential risk of injury, instead of actual violence or injury. <em>Id. </em>at 1182. And we concluded that attempting to flee from law enforcement combined with a person\u2019s occupation of a motor vehicle \u201cmost assuredly presented] a \u2018potential risk of physical injury\u2019 to others\u201d based on the likelihood that a person fleeing would drive recklessly, turning a pursuit into a high-speed chase, with the \u201cpotential for serious harm to pedestrians, other drivers, and the pursuing officers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1182-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">And our cases interpreting \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the career offender provision provide important guidance in determining what is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA \u201cbecause the definitions for both terms are virtually identical.\u201d <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>489 F.3d 1112, 1113 (11th Cir.2007) (citation omitted); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) (a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d includes a crime punishable by a year of imprisonment that, among other things, \u201cotherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">Because the career offender provision contains an identical residual clause in its definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as the ACCA\u2019s definition of \u201cviolent felony;\u201d and we have concluded that a violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(3) is a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d we conclude that it also is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA. In addition, it is clear under the categorical approach that the conduct encompassed by the statute, in an ordinary case, presents a serious potential risk of injury to others. <em>See James, </em>127 S.Ct. at 1597; <em>Orisnord, </em>483 F.3d at 1182-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-9\">Accordingly, we affirm Brunson\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b975-9\">. The ACCA provides \"In the case of a person who violates section 922(g) ... and has three previous convictions by any court ... for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another, such person shall be ... imprisoned not less than fifteen years.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b975-11\">. Under a plain-error analysis, we may not correct the error unless there is \"(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights,\u201d and \"(4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b975-15\">. Brunson concedes that the other two convictions \u2014 for two separate instances of carjacking and aggravated assault \u2014 qualifying him for an enhanced sentence under section 924(e) are violent felonies within the meaning of the ACCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b975-16\">. In addition, we must employ a \"categorical approach\u201d when determining whether an offense is a violent felony under the ACCA\u2019s residual provision, considering \u201cwhether the elements of the offense are of the type that would justify its inclusion within the residual provision, without inquiring into the specific conduct of [a] particular offender.\u201d <em>James v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number><em>United States, </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 1593-94, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007). The relevant inquiry is \"whether the conduct encompassed by the elements of the offense, in the ordinary case, presents a serious potential risk of injury to another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1597.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
