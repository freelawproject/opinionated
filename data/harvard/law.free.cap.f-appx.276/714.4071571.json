We grant the petition and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-24\">Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631, we conclude that it was \u201cin the interest of justice\u201d for the district court to transfer Esparza de Rubio\u2019s habeas petition to this court, as it was filed one day after the REAL ID Act became effective. <em>Cf. Puri v. Gonzales, </em>464 F.3d 1038, 1042-43 (9th Cir. 2006) (concluding that transfer was not in the interest of justice where habeas petition was filed almost three months after the REAL ID Act, and petitioner also filed a contemporaneous petition for review); <em>see also Rodriguez-Roman v. INS, </em>98 F.3d 416, 424 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-25\">On the merits, the BIA abused its discretion in granting DHS\u2019s motion to reconsider on the ground that Esparza de Rubio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>had been deported. <em>See Reynoso-Cisneros v. Gonzales, </em>491 F.3d 1001, 1002 (9th Cir.2007) (per curiam) (8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(d) does not preclude BIA jurisdiction over motions to reopen filed by-aliens after their deportation). We therefore grant the petition for review and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b738-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
