Myung Lee purchased car insurance and signed a writing, pursuant to 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1734, that she was purchasing uninsured motorist and underinsured motorist coverages for an amount less than the limits of liability for bodily injury. Subsequently, Daniel Lee, the insured\u2019s son, got into an accident in Myung Lee\u2019s car and suffered several injuries. The parties dispute whether Lee is entitled to receive $15,000, the amount already paid by Progressive and indicated in the policy as the underinsured motorist coverage, or $100,000, the amount of bodily injury coverage in the policy. Appellant argues that because the policy did not indicate the amount of the underinsured motorist coverage on the same page as the \u00a7 1734 writing, the writing is invalid. There is nothing in the statute that requires the writing to include the amount of the coverage on the same page as the signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">Accordingly, and substantially for the reasons set forth in the District Court\u2019s February 21, 2007, 2007 WL 603042, decision, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
