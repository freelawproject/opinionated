MIRIAM GOLDMAN CEDARBAUM,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> District Judge.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b37-17\"> The Honorable Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b37-26\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b37-27\">Jhon Jairo Arce appeals from a judgment of the district court sentencing him principally to the mandatory minimum of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>120 months\u2019 imprisonment for conspiracy to distribute, and possess with intent to distribute, five kilograms or more of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, and for possession with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841. We assume the parties\u2019 and counsel\u2019s familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case, and with the issues raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">A district court may grant safety-valve relief and depart below a mandatory minimum sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) if, among other things, the defendant has \u201ctruthfully provided to the Government all information and evidence\u201d regarding his offenses. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(5). On appeal, Arce argues that the district court improperly denied safety-valve relief based on its finding that Arce had been untruthful regarding his initial involvement with the drug distribution conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">In order to satisfy the requirements of section 3553(f)(5), \u201cthe defendant must prove to the sentencing court, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he has provided the requisite truthful information to the government.\u201d <em>United States v. Jimenez, </em>451 F.3d 97, 102 (2d Cir.2006). Whether or not the district court erred as a matter of law in failing to adopt a burden-shifting approach of the sort advocated by Arce, the district court did not clearly err in concluding that Arce had ultimately failed establish his eligibility for safety-valve relief. Contrary to Arce\u2019s suggestions, the district court\u2019s conclusion was not based solely on unsupported speculation. Rather, the district court disbelieved Arce\u2019s statements in light of the nature of the information that Arce possessed and the roles he was permitted to play within the conspiracy. It was well within the district court\u2019s discretion to find Arce\u2019s account incredible in light of inconsistencies pointed out by the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">Aree\u2019s explanation of why he became involved with the conspiracy is not, as he argues, an irrelevant matter that has no bearing on his eligibility for safety-valve relief. The statements in question relate directly to the charged offense. In <em>United States v. Gambino, </em>106 F.3d 1105 (2d Cir.1997), we observed that \u00a7 3553(f)(5) requires a defendant to \u201cdisclose information beyond the conspiracy period alleged in the indictment [and] disclose information regarding conduct, including the related acts of others, occurring in preparation for that offense, or in the course of attempting to avoid detection or responsibility for that offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1111 (internal quotation marks omitted). To the extent Arce was dishonest about threats made by the drug cartel in Colombia, such dishonesty is well within the scope of \u201crelated acts of others\u201d and even the avoidance of \u201cresponsibility for that offense.\u201d The district court therefore did not err in denying Arce\u2019s request for safety-valve relief based on its finding that Arce was untruthful in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
