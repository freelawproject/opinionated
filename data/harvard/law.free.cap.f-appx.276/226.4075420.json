For the reasons below, we will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-26\">Atia, a citizen of Egypt, was admitted to the United States as a visitor in November 1999. In April 2001, an Application for Alien Labor Certification was filed on his behalf. In March 2003, while the application was pending, Atia was charged as removable for overstaying his admission period. Atia conceded removability. In October 2005, after several adjournments, the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) denied Atia\u2019s motion to continue the removal proceedings. The BIA dismissed Atia\u2019s appeal, and Atia filed a timely petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-27\">We review the denial of a continuance for abuse of discretion. <em>Khan v. Attorney General, </em>448 F.3d 226, 233 (3d Cir.2006). We resolve this question on a case by case basis according to the facts of each case. <em>Ponce-Leiva v. Ashcroft, </em>331 F.3d 369, 377 (3d Cir.2003). The denial of a continuance may only be reversed if it is arbitrary, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>irrational, or contrary to law. <em>Khan, </em>448 F.3d at 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Atia argues that a continuance should have been granted based on the BIA\u2019s decision in <em>Matter of Velarde, </em>23 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 253 (BIA 2002). In <em>Velarde, </em>the BIA addressed when a motion to reopen could be granted to provide an alien with the opportunity to file for adjustment of status based on a marriage to a citizen. Here, however, Atia sought a continuance based on a pending labor certification application. Atia\u2019s situation is more like the alien\u2019s in <em>Khan, </em>in which the alien challenged the denial of a continuance while his wife\u2019s labor certification application was pending. We concluded that the Department of Labor\u2019s delay in the processing of Khan\u2019s wife\u2019s application did not make the IJ\u2019s denial of a continuance an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Atia likewise argues that he should not be penalized for the Department of Labor\u2019s delay in processing his application. He argues that his case is different from <em>Khan </em>because he is the principal applicant and he has two labor certification applications pending at the Department of Labor. However, these differences do not distinguish this case from <em>Khan, </em>and we conclude that the IJ in this case did not abuse his discretion in denying Atia\u2019s motion for a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">Accordingly, we will deny the petition for review. However, we are troubled by Atia\u2019s allegations that his labor certification application has been pending with the Department of Labor since 2001. If his application has been pending that long,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we believe such delay to be unconscionable. Accordingly, we will stay issuance of our mandate for ninety days to allow the Department of Labor to act on Atia\u2019s labor certification application should a petition be pending before it. We expect such a decision to be forthcoming. No further stays or extensions will be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b251-8\">. While the record contains correspondence dated July 1, 2004, from the New Jersey Department of Labor requesting additional information for Atia's Labor Certification Application, C.A.R. at 157-160, there is nothing in the record showing that Atia's application was ever received by the United States Department of Labor. Atia has not described any efforts he has taken to ascertain the status of his application. We note that the Employment and Training Administration of United States Department of Labor has a website through which one can check the status of a \u201cbacklog case.\u201d <em>See </em>http://pds.pbls.doleta. gov/.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
