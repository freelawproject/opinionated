We will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-14\">Greene was adopted by United States citizen parents and admitted to this country in August 1977, when he was 2 months old. In 2003, he was convicted in New Jersey state court of endangering the welfare of a child. The next year, he was convicted of the same charge in New York state court. The Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) charged Greene with being removable pursuant to Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(ii) [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii)], as an alien who has been convicted of two moral turpitude crimes not arising out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct. Greene conceded the charge of removability and applied for cancellation of removal under INA \u00a7 240A(a) [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a)].<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-16\">The IJ concluded that Greene was statutorily eligible for cancellation and granted the application as a matter of discretion, holding that the positive aspects of his case outweighed the negative factors. The DHS appealed the decision to the BIA, which sustained the appeal, vacated the IJ\u2019s decision, and ordered Greene removed to Mexico. The Board concluded that Greene had not successfully demonstrated that the factors favorable to a discretionary grant of relief outweighed his \u201cserious criminal activity.\u201d Greene filed a petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>The government argues that we lack jurisdiction to hear Greene\u2019s claims because he is a criminal alien who seeks review of an order denying cancellation of removal in the exercise of discretion. Indeed, we generally do not have jurisdiction to review final orders of removal against aliens, like Greene, who are deemed removable because they were convicted of, inter alia, two crimes involving moral turpitude. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(C) [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C)] (precluding jurisdiction where alien removable pursuant to INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(ii) [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii)]). In addition, we lack jurisdiction to review purely discretionary decisions, <em>see </em>INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(B)(ii) [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii)], such as the \u201cmanner in which the BIA balanced the various positive and negative factors which typically inform the exercise of its discretion under\u201d INA \u00a7 240A [1229b(a)]. <em>CruzCamey v. Gonzales, </em>504 F.3d 28, 29 (1st Cir.2007). Despite these jurisdiction-stripping provisions, we may review \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law\u201d raised in a petition for review. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(D) [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D)]; <em>Papageorgiou v. Gonzales, </em>413 F.3d 356, 358 (3d Cir.2005). Thus, we may consider whether the Board, in exercising its discretion, violated a rule of law or a provision of the U.S. Constitution. <em>See Chen v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 329 (2d Cir.2006) (holding that a petition raises a question of law when it alleges a \u201cfact-finding which is flawed by an error of law\u201d or an \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d that is \u201cbased on a legally erroneous standard\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">In the present case, Greene argues that the BIA improperly engaged in its own independent factfinding, and failed to defer to the IJ\u2019s factual findings and review them for clear error. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(I) and (iv). In addition, Greene complains that the BIA ignored uncontested expert testimony concerning the likelihood that he would re-offend. To the extent that these allegations raise questions of law, we have jurisdiction. <em>See Wood v. Mukasey, </em>516 F.3d 564, 568 (7th Cir.2008) (holding allegation that BIA exceeded its appellate-review authority presented a legal question). We conclude, however, that Greene\u2019s claims are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">Under the regulations, \u201c[t]he Board will not engage in <em>de novo </em>review of findings of fact determined by an immigration judge,\u201d \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(I), and \u201cwill not engage in factfinding in the course of deciding appeals.\u201d \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(iv). The BIA\u2019s decision that Greene did not qualify for cancellation was based on his failure to show \u201csufficient rehabilitation.\u201d As support for this conclusion, the BIA cited Greene\u2019s \u201crecent convictions] within the span of 6 months for conduct involving extensive sexual contact with minors,\u201d his \u201cadmission to engaging in inappropriate and uncontrollable sexual activity\u201d with numerous \u201cinappropriate partners,\u201d and his solicitation of a 13 year-old while awaiting sentencing for his first conviction. Importantly, these are not facts that the BIA independently found or which ran contrary to the IJ\u2019s findings. Rather, they were all clearly set forth on the record in the IJ\u2019s decision. The BIA simply deferred to the IJ\u2019s factual determinations, including those favorable to Greene, and, after weighing the evidence, concluded that Greene did not warrant cancellation of removal. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(ii) (stating that the \u201cBoard may review questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of [IJs] <em>de novo.\u201d). </em>This analysis fully comports with the BIA regulations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Wallace v. Gon</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number><em>zales, </em>468 F.3d 135, 141 (2d Cir.2006) (\u201cAlthough any reversal by the BIA of an IJ\u2019s discretionary determination must involve consideration of the underlying facts, a review of the factual record by the BIA does not convert its discretionary determination as to whether a petitioner warrants [relief] into improper factfinding.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b239-12\">. Under this provision, the Attorney General may, in his discretion, cancel the removal of an alien who (1) has been lawfully admitted for permanent residence for not less than five years, (2) has continuously resided in the United States in any status for seven years, and (3) has not been convicted of an aggravated felony. Once these requirements are met, the IJ must review the record as a whole, and \"balance the adverse factors evidencing the alien\u2019s undesirability as a permanent resident with the social and humane considerations presented in his (or her) behalf to determine whether the granting of ... relief appears in the best interest of this country.\u201d <em>Matter of C-V-T, </em>22 I &amp; N Dec. 7, 11 (BIA 1998). (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b240-6\">. We note that Greene strenuously argues that the BIA ignored uncontested expert testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>mony concerning the likelihood that he would re-offend. Review of this claim, along with any direct challenge to the BIA\u2019s discretionary decision, is outside our jurisdiction and will be dismissed. <em>See Jarbough v. Attorney General, </em>483 F.3d 184, 189 (3d Cir.2007) (holding that \"arguments such as that an Immigration Judge ... failed to consider evidence ... are not questions of law under \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).\u201d); <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 329-30 (2d Cir.2006) (stating that judicial review may not be secured \"by using the rhetoric of a 'constitutional claim\u2019 or \u2018question of law\u2019 to disguise what is essentially a quarrel about fact-finding or the exercise of discretion.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
