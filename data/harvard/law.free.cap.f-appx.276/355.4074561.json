Because the Board affirmed under its streamlined procedure, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4) (2007), we review the decision of the immigration judge. <em>Dankam v. Gonzales, </em>495 F.3d 113, 119 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">Haile argues that the government of Ethiopia had mixed motives and that part of its motivation in its actions against her was to persecute her for the political opinions that the government imputed to her. However, we need not address that issue, for, in addition to its finding that the government was entitled to criminally prosecute Haile for her actions, the immigration judge found that Haile failed to corroborate her testimony regarding her experiences with the Ethiopian government. \u201c[E]ven for credible testimony, corroboration may be required when it is reasonable to expect such proof and there is no reasonable explanation for its absence.\u201d <em>LinJian v. Gonzales, </em>489 F.3d 182, 191-92 (4th Cir.2007). <em>See </em>8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(ii), 1252(b)(4) (West 2005) (concerning corroborating evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-11\">We have reviewed the administrative record and the immigration judge\u2019s decision and find that substantial evidence supports the ruling that Haile failed to submit sufficient corroboration to establish her claim of past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution, as necessary to establish eligibility for asylum. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2007) (stating that the burden of proof is on the alien to establish eligibility for asylum); <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (same). Moreover, as Haile cannot sustain her burden on the asylum claim, she cannot establish her entitlement to withholding of removal. <em>See Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004) (\u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum \u2014 even though the facts that must be proved are the same \u2014 an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3) [ (2000) ].\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-12\">We also find that substantial evidence supports the immigration judge\u2019s finding that Haile fails to meet the standard for relief under the Convention Against Torture. To obtain such relief, an applicant must establish that \u201cit is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2007). Upon reviewing the administrative record, we find that the immigration judge applied the proper standard to assess the evidence, and that Haile failed to make the requisite showing before the immigration court.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-13\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
