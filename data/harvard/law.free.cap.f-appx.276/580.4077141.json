We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review denials of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Cano-Merida v. INS, </em>311 F.3d 960, 964 (9th Cir.2002). We grant the petition for review and remand to the BIA for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">The BIA abused its discretion in denying Ajiboye\u2019s motion to reopen where its findings demonstrate that it failed to consider all the attached evidence. <em>See Mohammed v. Gonzales, </em>400 F.3d 785, 792 (9th Cir.2005) (BIA abused its discretion in denying motion by \u201cfailing to consider all the attached evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">The BIA found that Ajiboye did not establish changed circumstances in Nigeria that would \u201cdirect[ly] impact\u201d him, but he submitted evidence that his brother and father were tortured and killed for their religious conversion, which has direct bearing on his claim of fear of harm due to his own conversion. <em>See Malty v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 942, 945-46 (9th Cir.2004) (BIA abused its discretion in dismissing the new evidence, which included evidence of harm to the petitioner\u2019s family in Egypt, as a continuance of the previous circumstances).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-12\">The BIA further abused its discretion in finding that Ajiboye \u201cdid not provide any evidence to support\u201d his ineffective assistance of counsel claim, where he submitted evidence that prior counsel failed to timely file an application for former section 212(c) relief, was not prepared to proceed on Ajiboye\u2019s CAT claim before the immigration judge, and failed to file a brief before the BIA. <em>See Mohammed, </em>400 F.3d at 792; <em>Grigoryan v. Mukasey, </em>515 F.3d 999, 1003-1004 (9th Cir.2008) (applying presumption of prejudice where counsel filed boilerplate brief with BIA, depriving petitioner of meaningful appellate review).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-13\">The respondent\u2019s motion to strike evidence outside the administrative record submitted by Ajiboye to this court is granted. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(A); <em>see Yeghiazaryan v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 994, 997 n. 3 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-14\">In light of our disposition, we need not reach Ajiboye\u2019s additional contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-15\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b605-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
