On appeal, he raises the issue of whether his counsel was ineffective in failing to object to the admission of testimony and evidence from the mirror-image of a computer containing files that were previously downloaded from his company\u2019s computer. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Inyama contends that the act of downloading the files and their access by others could have caused alterations, and his counsel was constitutionally ineffective in failing to cross examine witnesses regarding the files and to object to them admission. We may address Inyama\u2019s contention on direct appeal only if his lawyer\u2019s ineffectiveness conclusively appears from the record. <em>See United States v. Baldovinos, </em>434 F.3d 233, 239 (4th Cir.2006). We have reviewed the record and find it does not conclusively show ineffective assistance. Accordingly, we conclude that Inyama\u2019s claim is unreviewable at this stage.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b376-9\"> Our conclusion that we may not review Inyama\u2019s ineffective assistance claim is not \"intended to prejudice, or prejudge, in any way [his] right to apply for relief in a [habeas corpus] proceeding, should he choose to invoke such remedy.\u201d <em>United States v. Mandello, </em>426 F.2d 1021, 1023 (4th Cir.1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
