The BIA determined that Charles\u2019s convictions of unlawful possession of marihuana in violation of N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 221.05 (McKinney 2003) and endangering the welfare of a child in violation of N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 260.10 (McKinney 2003) are aggravated felony convictions for which Charles is removable pursuant 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). The BIA concluded that Charles\u2019s convictions of unlawful possession of marihuana and the criminal sale of marihuana in the fourth degree in violation of N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 221.40 (McKinney 1988) are controlled substance offenses for which he is removable pursuant to \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)\u00ae. The BIA further determined that Charles\u2019s conviction of endangering the welfare of a child is a crime of domestic violence, stalking, or child abuse, neglect, or abandonment for which he is removable pursuant to \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E)\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">Charles argues that the BIA erred by finding that his convictions of possession of marihuana and endangering the welfare of a child are aggravated felony offenses. As amended by the REAL ID Act of 2005, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) and (D) generally prohibits judicial review of a final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), including a controlled substance offense, or an aggravated felony under \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(Hi), except as to \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law.\u201d \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), (D).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-14\">This court ordinarily would retain jurisdiction to review Charles\u2019s petition, because the question whether his conviction is an aggravated felony is a question of law. <em>See Rodriguez-Castro v. Gonzales, </em>427 F.3d 316, 319 (5th Cir.2005); \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), (D). But, his failure to challenge the BIA\u2019s finding of removability based on his controlled substance convictions \u201cindependently triggers\u201d the jurisdiction-stripping provision of \u00a7 1252 and deprives us of jurisdiction to review the petition for review. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), (D); <em>Flores-Garza v. INS, </em>328 F.3d 797, 802-03 (5th Cir.2003). We thus need not consider the merits of Charles\u2019s challenge to the BIA\u2019s finding of removability on the basis of an aggravated felony conviction. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b407-16\">Because Charles also fails to challenge the BIA\u2019s denial of his application for withholding of removal and relief under the CAT, he has waived any challenge to the finding of removability on those grounds. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003). The petition for review is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b407-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
