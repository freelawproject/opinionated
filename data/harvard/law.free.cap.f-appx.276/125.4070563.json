We will affirm the order because Tice has failed to show a miscarriage of justice sufficient to overcome the procedural default of his claim for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-16\">I. <em>Background and Procedural History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b150-17\">At a bench trial in the Court of Common Pleas of Erie County, Pennsylvania, Tice was convicted of two sets of charges, one related to acts of molestation occurring between May 13 and August 8, 1997 (case number 3207), and the second to such acts occurring from August 9 to 11, 1997 (case number 3206). The dates in question reflect instances in which Tice was alleged to have committed sexual acts with his niece when staying at his sister Karen\u2019s house while he was on approved leave from Hermitage House, the juvenile facility where he resided at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-18\">Of relevance to this appeal, in the present habeas petition, Tice raises ineffective assistance of counsel claims, which were not presented to the state courts. Tice argues that his trial counsel was ineffective in part for failing to obtain the records from Hermitage House concerning the dates on which Tice was released on home visits. These records indicate that Tice spent the weekend of August 9-11,1997, at his sister Judy\u2019s house, and the weekends of June 13-15, 1997, and July 25-27, 1997, at Karen\u2019s. As such, the Hermitage House records suggested that Tice could not have committed the crimes charged in case 3206 because he was not at Karen\u2019s on the weekend of August 9-11, 1997, when the molestation supposedly occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>Following an evidentiary hearing, at which both of Tice\u2019s sisters testified, and the preparation of a Report and Recommendation by the Magistrate Judge, the District Court granted Tice\u2019s habeas petition with respect to case 3206 but denied it as to case 3207.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District Court found that Tice\u2019s claims for relief had been procedurally defaulted because he had not brought those claims before the state court. The District Court then considered whether failure to review Tice\u2019s claims would result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice, such that his claims, although defaulted, could nonetheless be reviewed. The District Court concluded that no such miscarriage of justice would result with respect to Tice\u2019s claim for relief from his conviction in case 3207 because the Hermitage House records did not sufficiently establish Tice\u2019s innocence with respect to those charges.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Tice timely appealed the District Court\u2019s order. We granted a certificate of appeal-ability on the issue of whether Tice has established a miscarriage of justice with regard to case number 3207 (the charges related to May 13 through August 8, 1997) sufficient to overcome the procedural default of his ineffectiveness claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">II. <em>Jurisdiction and Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">We have jurisdiction over Tice\u2019s timely appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253. We exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s determination of the procedural default issue. <em>Hull v. Kyler, </em>190 F.3d 88, 97 (3d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-11\">The claims raised by Tice in his habeas petition that are of relevance to the issue on appeal were procedurally defaulted. A federal court generally will not review a procedurally defaulted constitutional claim raised in a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. <em>Hubbard v. Pinchak, </em>378 F.3d 333, 338 (3d Cir.2004) (citations omitted). There is an exception to this rule, however, where the petitioner \u201ccan show cause and prejudice for the procedural default or that a miscarriage of justice will occur absent review. An allegation of \u2018actual inno<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>cence,\u2019 if credible is one such \u2018miscarriage of justice\u2019 that enables courts to hear the merits of the habeas claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">In <em>Schlup v. Delo, </em>the Supreme Court held that, to overcome a procedural default based on a claim of actual innocence, a habeas petitioner must show that \u201ca constitutional violation has probably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent.\u201d 513 U.S. 298, 327, 115 S.Ct. 851, 130 L.Ed.2d 808 (1995). The petitioner must show that, in light of new evidence of innocence, \u201cit is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Tying the miscarriage of justice exception to the petitioner\u2019s innocence ensures that the exception will \u201cbe applied in the extraordinary case\u201d and \u201cextend relief to those who [are] truly deserving.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 321,115 S.Ct. 851.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">III. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">We agree with the District Court that, with respect to case number 3207, Tice has failed to show that, in light of the new evidence, it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him of the offenses charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">In case number 3207, Tice was charged regarding acts occurring between May and August 1997. The new evidence (in particular the Hermitage House reports) indicates that Tice was only at the victim\u2019s home on the weekends of June 13-15, 1997, and July 25-27,1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">This evidence, in view of the additional evidence presented at trial, does not establish a likelihood that no reasonable juror would have convicted Tice of the offenses charged in case number 3207. The dates on which Tice stayed at the victim\u2019s home, as shown by the new evidence, still fall within the time frame in which the charged activities occurred. The victim herself testified that Tice had assaulted her. We agree with the District Court that the fact that Tice had not visited her as often as she stated in her testimony would have been of little impeachment value, given that the jury was well aware she was an eleven-year-old girl testifying as to events that had occurred about two years earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">Nor does the new evidence render Dr. Schober\u2019s testimony as to the dates of the victim\u2019s injuries supportive of Tice\u2019s innocence. At trial, Dr. Schober testified that, during her September 1997 examination of the victim, she identified three injuries, one of which was \u201cprobably older than six months,\u201d one that was \u201cunder seventy-two hours ... or a few weeks old,\u201d and another that could not be dated. This testimony does not, even in light of the Hermitage House records, establish that no reasonable juror would likely have convicted Tice. Dr. Schober\u2019s testimony regarding the age of the injuries was admittedly and understandably imprecise. This testimony is not inconsistent with the new evidence regarding what dates Tice was at the victim\u2019s home and therefore could have committed the crimes charged, as testified to by the victim herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-11\">Tice has not shown that it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him even in light of the new evidence. As such, he failed to establish his actual innocence for purposes of the fundamental miscarriage of justice standard, and we cannot overlook his procedural default and reach the merits of his ineffective assistance of justice claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-12\">IV. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b152-13\">For the reasons set forth above, we will affirm the order of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b151-6\">. The District Court actually held two evidentiary hearings on Tice's claims. The First Report and Recommendation recommended that Tice\u2019s habeas petition be denied as to both charges. In his subsequent objections, Tice included affidavits from both of his sisters that bolstered the reliability of the Hermitage House records. The District Court then held a second evidentiary hearing, after which the Magistrate Judge issued a Second Report and Recommendation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b151-7\">. In so doing, the District Court rejected Tice's argument that the testimony of a pediatric urologist, Dr. Justine Schober, concerning the age of the various injuries to the victim supported his innocence. The District Court found that Dr. Schober\u2019s testimony about the age of those injuries was \"less than precise\u201d and that, because Dr. Schober testified that one injury was undated and, according to the Hermitage House records, Tice had been at the victim's house in June and July, an assault by Tice as charged in case 3207 was not precluded. The District Court accordingly rejected Tice's claim that Dr. Schober's testimony established that someone other than Tice had committed the crimes and noted that the fact that someone other than Tice could have assaulted the victim did not exonerate him.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-13\">The District Court also rejected Tice\u2019s assertion that he was entitled to relief because the Hermitage House records could have been used to impeach the victim\u2019s testimony. The victim testified that Tice had assaulted her over a period of eighteen months, whereas the records indicate that he could not have assaulted her over such a period. The District Court found that this information was \u201cnot sufficiently at odds with the eleven-year-old victim's testimony to offer any real impeachment value.\u201d The District Court also concluded that establishing the inaccuracy of the victim\u2019s memory regarding the time frame of the alleged abuse did not meet the \"fundamental miscarriage of justice\u201d standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
