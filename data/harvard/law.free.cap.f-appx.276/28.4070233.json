Aug. 24, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A73 561 074 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City May 16, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">When the BIA does not expressly \u201cadopt\u201d the IJ\u2019s decision, but its brief opinion \u201cclosely tracks the IJ\u2019s reasoning,\u201d we may consider both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions \u201cfor the sake of completeness\u201d if doing so does not affect our ultimate conclusion. Wang<em>chuck v. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>448 F.3d 524, 528 (2d Cir.2006). Moreover, when the BIA supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>Cf. Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Kaur v. BIA </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir. 2005) (per curiam). \u201cAn abuse of discretion may be found ... where the [BIA\u2019s] decision provides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-12\">The agency denied Zheng\u2019s motion to reopen primarily because it was filed over eleven years after the entry of the <em>in absentia </em>deportation order \u2014 and was therefore untimely \u2014 and because Zheng had offered no explanation as to the untimeliness of his motion. In his brief to this Court, Zheng argues that he did not receive adequate notice of his hearing before the IJ, acknowledging that this argument was not properly exhausted before the agency. In its brief, the Government raises Zheng\u2019s failure to exhaust his argument of inadequate notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-13\">In addition to the statutory requirement that petitioners exhaust the categories of relief they seek, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1), petitioners must also raise to the BIA the specific issues they later raise in this Court, <em>Foster v. INS, </em>376 F.3d 75, 78 (2d Cir.2004). While not jurisdictional, this judicially-imposed exhaustion requirement is mandatory. <em>See Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 122 (2d Cir.2007). As such, because Zheng failed to raise his alleged failure to receive adequate notice of his deportation hearing in any of his submissions before the agency, and because the Government has raised this failure to exhaust in its brief to this Court, we decline to consider this issue. <em>See id. </em>at 124 (describing the issue exhaustion requirement as \u201can affirmative defense subject to waiver\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>Because Zheng fails properly to raise any challenge to the agency's primary basis for denying his motion to reopen, i.e., its untimeliness, he has provided us with no reason to disturb the decisions below.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, Zheng\u2019s pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b54-16\">. We need not consider Zheng's argument challenging the IJ\u2019s application of <em>Qian Gao v. Gonzales, </em>481 F.3d 173 (2d Cir.2007), because the BIA expressly declined to reach that issue in its decision, instead relying on the IJ\u2019s finding that Zheng\u2019s motion was untimely. <em>Cf. Yan Chen, </em>417 F.3d at 271 (declining to review the IJ's adverse credibility determination where the BIA did not base its decision on that determination).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
