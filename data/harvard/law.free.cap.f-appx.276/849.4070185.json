R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is, therefore, submitted -without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-15\">Defendant Hugo Garcia-Gutierrez pled guilty to one count of illegal re-entry by a deported alien previously convicted of a felony, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) &amp; (b)(1). The district court sentenced him to eight months\u2019 imprisonment, followed by three years of supervised release. On appeal, Defendant\u2019s counsel has filed an <em>Anders </em>brief, arguing that there are no legally viable issues for appeal. <em>See Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Neither the government nor Defendant has filed a response. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we dismiss the appeal and grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-17\">After Defendant pled guilty, the presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) indicated that Defendant\u2019s base offense level was eight. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a). Defendant received a four-level enhancement because of a previous felony conviction for criminal trespass. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(D). He also received a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3El.l(a), which resulted in a total offense level of ten. In addition, because Defendant\u2019s prior conviction had resulted in a sentence of twenty-three months\u2019 imprisonment, the PSR assessed him three criminal history points. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 4Al.l(a). This produced a criminal history category of II, which, when combined with Defendant\u2019s total offense level of ten, resulted in a Guidelines range of eight to fourteen months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See id. </em>ch. 5, pt. A.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-18\">Defendant did not object to the calculations in the PSR. Rather, Defendant requested a sentence of eight months\u2019 imprisonment \u2014 the bottom of the Guidelines range. At the sentencing hearing, the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>trict court granted Defendant\u2019s request and imposed a sentence of eight months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">Defendant\u2019s counsel has now filed an <em>Anders </em>brief, arguing that there are no legally viable issues for appeal. Neither the government nor Defendant has filed a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">Under <em>Anders, </em>a court-appointed defense counsel who has \u201cconscientiously examine[d] a case\u201d and concluded \u201cthat any appeal would be wholly frivolous,\u201d may submit a brief to the client and the appellate court indicating any potential appealable issues based on the record. The client may then choose to submit arguments to the court. The Court must then conduct a full examination of the record to determine whether defendant\u2019s claims are wholly frivolous. If the court concludes after such an examination that the appeal is frivolous, it may grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and may dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-8\"><em>United States v. Calderon, </em>428 F.3d 928, 930 (10th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Anders, </em>386 U.S. at 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-9\">We agree with counsel that no potentially meritorious issues exist on appeal. There is no reason to believe that Defendant\u2019s plea was anything other than knowing and voluntary. <em>See Brady v. United States, </em>397 U.S. 742, 755-56, 90 S.Ct. 1463, 25 L.Ed.2d 747 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-10\">The record also indicates that Defendant\u2019s sentence was both procedurally and substantively reasonable. As the Supreme Court recently explained in <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 564, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), \u201c \u2018reasonableness\u2019 is the standard controlling appellate review of the sentences district courts impose.\u201d First, we review for procedural reasonableness, asking whether the district court committed a procedural error, \u201csuch as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We then review for substantive reasonableness \u201cunder an abuse-of-discretion standard,\u201d and, \u201c[wjhen conducting this review, [we] will, of course, take into account the totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id.; see also United States v. Smart, </em>518 F.3d 800, 804-10 (10th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-16\">Here, the district court correctly calculated the Guidelines range, and the district court considered the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Further, the district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Defendant to eight months\u2019 imprisonment, at the bottom of the Guidelines range. Defendant\u2019s sentence was procedurally and substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-17\">The appeal is DISMISSED, and counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b874-14\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
