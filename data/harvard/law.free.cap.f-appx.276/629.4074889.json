Santana argues that the district court erred by (1) failing to comply with Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(i)(3)(B); (2) denying him a minor role adjustment and downward departure for his alien status; (3) imposing an unreasonable sentence; (4) failing to specify a cap on the number of drug tests required under supervised release; and (5) requiring him to report to a probation officer within seventy-two hours of reentry into the country as a condition of supervised release. We affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Our sentencing review \u201cis to determine whether the sentence is reasonable; only a procedurally erroneous or substantively unreasonable sentence will be set aside.\u201d <em>United States v. Carty, </em>520 F.3d 984, 993 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc), <em>petition for cert filed, </em>No. 07-10482 (April 16, 2008). \u201c[W]e first consider whether the district court committed significant procedural error, [and] then we consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIt would be procedural error for a district court to fail to calculate \u2014 or to calculate incorrectly \u2014 the Guidelines range; to treat the Guidelines as mandatory instead of advisory; to fail to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors; to choose a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts; or to fail adequately to explain the sentence selected, including any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">1. Santana\u2019s first argument fits neatly within the parameters of procedural review: did the district court comply with Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(i)(3)(B) when it refused to find if the defendant knew for how much the methamphetamine at issue was being sold? We review de novo a district court\u2019s compliance with Rule 32. <em>United States v. Herrera-Rojas, </em>243 F.3d 1139, 1142 (9th Cir. 2001). Santana contends that the district court never addressed his claim that he was unaware of the purchase price in the methamphetamine transaction. The record contradicts Santana\u2019s argument. In its tentative ruling on sentencing, the district court explicitly stated that Santana\u2019s knowledge of the purchase price would \u201cnot affect sentencing.\u201d The district court committed no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">2. Denial of a minor or minimal role adjustment is also a question of procedural review which we review for clear error. <em>United States v. Pena-Gutierrez, </em>222 F.3d 1080, 1091 (9th Cir.2000). Santana argues that he is the least culpable participant in the methamphetamine transaction and therefore merits a role adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). However, \u201ca minimal or minor participant adjustment under \u00a7 3B1.2 is available only if the defendant was substantially less culpable than his or her co-participants.\u201d <em>United States v. Cantrell, </em>433 F.3d 1269, 1283 (9th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). Santana was not substantially less culpable than his eo-participants. He was an instrumental part of the deal, transporting the drugs and even providing filler for the drugs the evening before the transaction to ensure they weighed the correct amount. There was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>no clear error by the district court in its refusal to grant Santana a role adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">Santana also argues that the district court erred in refusing to depart downward for harsh conditions of confinement due to Santana\u2019s noncitizen status. We lack jurisdiction, however, to review a discretionary denial of a downward departure under the Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>387 F.3d 826, 832 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">3. Santana\u2019s third argument, that the district court \u201celevated the \u2018amount and purity of the drugs involved\u2019 ... above all other factors,\u201d is substantive in nature because it challenges the propriety of the sentence imposed, not the procedures used in arriving at that sentence. We review the ultimate sentence for reasonableness under a \u201cdeferential abuse of discretion standard.\u201d <em>Carty, </em>520 F.3d at 988. The district court calculated Santana\u2019s total offense level as thirty-three. Santana received no criminal history points, which put him in a criminal history category of I, resulting in a Guidelines range of 135 to 168 months. Santana\u2019s offense carried a ten-year statutory minimum sentence. The district court found that he was eligible for relief under the safety valve provision of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f). Nevertheless, the district court did not find that the facts of Santana\u2019s crime warranted a sentence below the mandatory minimum sentence and imposed a sentence of 120 months, which is notably lower than the advisory Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">\u201cFor a non-Guidelines sentence, we ... \u2018give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Carty, </em>520 F.3d at 993 (quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). Santana argues that the district court \u201cgave no weight to ... [the] mitigating and sympathetic aspects of Santana\u2019s offense, and his history and characteristics.\u201d Particularly, Santana refers to his familial circumstances, his lack of a criminal history, and his limited role in the offense as facts which render the sentence imposed unreasonable. But the fact that the district court imposed a sentence below the advisory range dispels Santana\u2019s argument that it impermissibly relied upon the drug quantity in determining his sentence. Moreover, the district court expressly recognized that its variance from the advisory Guidelines was due to \u201cthe special factors that [Santana] has pointed out to\u201d the court. The district court clearly considered and gave weight to the special facts surrounding Santana\u2019s case. Nevertheless, it felt that 120 months imprisonment was \u201csufficient deterrent without being extreme,\u201d consistent with its duty to \u201cimpose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary\u201d to fulfill the statutory sentencing goals. <em>Id. </em>at 991 (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)). The district court did not abuse its discretion, and the sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-10\">4. Santana argues that it was error for the district court to require him to submit to one drug test within fifteen days of release and to at least two periodic drug tests thereafter. Santana raises this argument for the first time on appeal, and we therefore review for plain error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Rodriguez, </em>441 F.3d 767, 772 (9th Cir.2006). This argument is foreclosed \u201cbecause any error or prejudice caused by the district court\u2019s decision to impose this condition did not seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>See United States v. Maciel-Vasquez, </em>458 F.3d 994, 996 (9th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2097, 167 L.Ed.2d 817 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>5. Also foreclosed is Santana\u2019s argument that his condition of supervised release requiring him to report to the probation officer within seventy-two hours of arriving in the United States violates his Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself. <em>See id. </em>at 996-97; <em>Rodriguez-Rodriguez, </em>441 F.3d at 772-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b655-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
