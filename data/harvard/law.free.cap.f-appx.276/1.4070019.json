R.App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C. Cir. R. 34(j). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b25-19\">ORDERED and ADJUDGED that the judgment of the district court be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-20\">More than 90 days after a hearing officer dismissed their claims under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), 20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1400 <em>et seq., </em>the appellants filed a civil complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. Because the IDEA, as amended by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act, grants parties only 90 days in which to bring such an action, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1415(i)(2)(B), the district court correctly dismissed the suit as untimely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-22\">In support of their contention that their civil complaint was timely, the appellants cite procedural rules that grant a party several additional days to act after service is made. Fed. R. Civ. P 6(e) (\u201cWhenever a party must or may act within a prescribed period after service ..., 3 days are added after the prescribed period would otherwise expire.... \u201d); D.C. Cir. R. 26(c) (same); D.C. Ct. App. R. 15(a) (granting 5 additional days from the date a decision is mailed). These provisions, however, all relate to filing periods that do not begin until after service or notice. By contrast, under the plain language of the IDEA, the 90-day period in which a party must file a civil action runs from the date of the hearing officer\u2019s decision, rather than from the date of service or notice. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(B) (\u201cThe party bringing the action shall have 90 days <em>from the date of the decision </em>of the hearing officer to bring such an action .... \u201d (emphasis added)). Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 6(e), D.C. Circuit Rule 26, and D.C. Court of Appeals Rule 15(a) therefore do not extend the 90-day period, which is mandatory. The appellants raise no other argument on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-23\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36(b), this decision will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold the issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after the disposition of any timely petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. RApp. P. 41(b); D.C. Cir. R. 41(a)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
