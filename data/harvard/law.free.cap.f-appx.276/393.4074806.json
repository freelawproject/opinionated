Esquibel (\u201cEsquibel\u201d), appealing the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Defendant Chase Manhattan Bank, U.S.A., N.A., (\u201cChase\u201d), raises a novel issue of statutory interpretation, <em>viz., </em>whether complained-of \u201cfinance charges\u201d may constitute \u201cbilling errors\u201d under the Fair Credit Billing Act (\u201cFCBA\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1666, <em>et seq. </em>Based on the relevant statutory language, we find they cannot. Thus, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-12\">Factual and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b418-13\">On July 4, 2004, Esquibel applied to open a credit card account with Chase. Chase approved the application and issued the credit card. On July 21, 2004, Esquibel placed the first charge on the card by transferring a credit balance of $3,687.46 to the account; consistent with the terms of the credit card agreement, Chase assessed a $50 transaction fee for the transfer. This fee appeared as a \u201cfinance charge\u201d on Esquibel\u2019s credit card statement dated August 12, 2004. In response, Esquibel submitted to Chase a payment of $75; this would be Esquibel\u2019s last payment on the account. During the next account period, Esquibel used her credit card to write herself a convenience check in the amount of $8,000. Again, consistent with the terms of the account, Chase charged Esquibel a $50 transaction fee for the convenience check, and this fee appeared as a \u201cfinance charge\u201d on Esquibel\u2019s September 14, 2004, statement. Esquibel made no payment on this statement. As a result, Chase assessed a late-payment fee of $35 on the account; this fee appeared on Esquibel\u2019s October 13, 2004, statement as a \u201clate fee.\u201d Again, Esquibel submitted no payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-14\">The following month, Chase sent Esquibel another regular statement, dated November 12, 2004. In response to this statement, Esquibel sent a form letter<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> styled \u201cFirst Notice of Billing Errors\u201d to Chase\u2019s dispute department. This letter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>alleged that Chase committed billing errors by imposing finance charges on Esquibel\u2019s account.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Chase received the letter on December 6, 2004, and responded on December 9, 2004, acknowledging Esquibel\u2019s letter, indicating that Chase had previously responded to a similar letter sent by Esquibel,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and notifying Esquibel that future inquiries voicing the same concerns would receive no response.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">During the following months, Esquibel sent Chase five more letters asserting billing errors in identical language; Esquibel also sent two other letters asserting that her billing dispute remained unresolved. Chase sent Esquibel various letters offering payment plans or other options for Esquibel to resolve her outstanding bill. Finally, in two letters sent in March and April of 2005, Chase notified Esquibel that her account balance was scheduled to be written off as bad debt that would be reported to all national credit reporting agencies. In May of 2005, a third-party collection service sent Esquibel a past-due notice, and Chase sent two additional letters seeking to set up payment arrangements.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Months later, Esquibel filed suit against Chase in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas. Esquibel alleged that Chase had failed to fulfill its FCBA statutory obligations to respond to her December 6 notice of a billing error, <em>see </em>15 U.S.C. 1666, <em>et seq.; </em>12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.13. Claiming that Chase had \u201ccommitted at least 342 violations of the [Truth in Lending Act] and the [FCBA],\u201d Esquibel requested over $342,000 in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">The matter was referred to a magistrate judge, and both Esquibel and Chase filed for summary judgment. The magistrate recommended granting Chase\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the grounds that Chase\u2019s FCBA duty was never triggered because Esquibel\u2019s letters, complaining only of finance charges, failed to state a billing error as defined by the FCBA. The district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s recommendations and entered final judgment in favor of Chase. Esquibel timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-11\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b419-12\">We review summary judgment rulings <em>de novo. See Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Lake Caroline, Inc., </em>515 F.3d 414, 418 (5th Cir.2008). A party is entitled to summary judgment only if \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). Here the parties agree that there are no disputed issues of material fact; the only dispute is whether Esquibel\u2019s correspondence triggered Chase\u2019s FCBA obligations. Thus, we review only whether the judgment below was correct as a matter of law. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b420-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>The FCBA provision at issue, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1666, <em>et seq., </em>\u201cprovides a procedure through which a debtor can dispute statements containing a billing error issued by a creditor.\u201d <em>Pinner v. Schmidt, </em>805 F.2d 1258, 1264 (5th Cir.1986). If a debtor sends a creditor a written billing-error notice in accordance with the FCBA\u2019s requirements and if the creditor receives this notice within sixty days of transmitting the challenged billing statement, the FCBA imposes two separate obligations upon the creditor: the creditor must send a written acknowledgment of the notice within thirty days and must investigate the matter and either correct the account or give written explanation of the disputed charge within ninety days. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1666; <em>American Exp. Co. v. Koerner, </em>452 U.S. 233, 236, 101 S.Ct. 2281, 68 L.Ed.2d 803 (1981); <em>Pinner, </em>805 F.2d at 1264. To trigger these obligations, a valid FCBA billing error notice must meet the following requirements: (1) the debtor identifies her name and account number, (2) the debtor \u201cindicates [her] belief that the statement contains a billing error and the amount of such billing error,\u201d and (3) the debtor explains her belief that the statement contains a billing error. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1666(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">The issue before us is whether Esquibel\u2019s billing error notice complied with the second of these FCBA requirements, <em>i.e., </em>whether it indicated a \u201cbelief that the statement contained] a <em>billing error.\u201d See id. </em>(emphasis added). The district court held that Esquibel\u2019s correspondence did not complain of a billing error as a matter of law because Esquibel complained only of finance charges that, according to the FCBA\u2019s statutory definition, do not constitute billing errors. We agree; thus we affirm the district court\u2019s holding for essentially the reasons stated by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">Esquibel\u2019s complaint alleges that the finance charges imposed on her account constitute billing errors under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1666(b)(2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This section defines a billing error as \u201ca reflection on a statement of an extension of credit for which the obligor requests additional clarification including documentary evidence thereof.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1666(b)(2). Thus, under this statutory definition, whether a finance charge constitutes a billing error turns upon whether a finance charge reflects \u201can extension of credit.\u201d <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">According to the statutory definition of \u201cfinance charge,\u201d it does not reflect an extension of credit. For purposes of the FCBA, \u201cfinance charge\u201d is defined as \u201cthe sum of all charges, payable directly or indirectly by the person to whom the credit is extended, and imposed directly or indirectly by the creditor as an <em>incident to the extension of credit.\u201d </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605(a) (emphasis added). Thus, the plain statutory language provides that a finance charge does not reflect an extension of credit but rather reflects a charge <em>incident to </em>an extension of credit.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>conclude otherwise would be to ignore Congress\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cincident to,\u201d and we may not so disregard statutory language. <em>Conn. Nat\u2019l Bank v. Germain, </em>503 U.S. 249, 253-54, 112 S.Ct. 1146, 117 L.Ed.2d 391 (1992) (\u201cWe have stated time and again that courts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.\u201d) (citing <em>United States v. Ron Pair Enters., Inc., </em>489 U.S. 235, 241-42, 109 5. Ct. 1026, 103 L.Ed.2d 290 (1989)); <em>Tesfamichael v. Gonzales, </em>411 F.3d 169, 173 (5th Cir.2005) (\u201cAbsent certain exceptional circumstances, <em>e.g., </em>an absurd result, we will not ignore the plain language of a statute\u201d); <em>see also Kelly v. Boeing Petroleum Servs., Inc., </em>61 F.3d 350, 362 (5th Cir.1995) (refusing to interpret a statute as to render a phrase \u201cmere surplusage.\u201d). Thus, the text of the FCBA forecloses Esquibel\u2019s argument that a finance charge is an extension of credit.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because a finance charge is not an extension of credit for purposes of the FCBA, the complained-of finance charges cannot constitute billing errors under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1666(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Esquibel contends that even if a finance charge is not a billing error under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1666(b)(2), her letter still complained of a billing error as alternately defined under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1666(b)(5); however, this argument is unavailing. Section 1666(b)(5) defines a billing error as \u201ca computation error or similar error of an accounting nature of the creditor on a statement,\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1666(b)(5), and no record evidence indicates that the finance charges assessed to Esquibel\u2019s account were computational or similar errors. To the extent that Esquibel argues that the minimum payment and total payment requested in her billing statement were computational errors because they included the finance charges, such an assertion also fails because it simply restates the claim, rejected above, that the finance charges constituted billing errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b421-11\">Esquibel\u2019s complained-of finance charges do not constitute billing errors as defined in 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1666(b)(2) or (5). Accordingly, Esquibel\u2019s claim fails as a matter of law, and the district court correctly granted summary judgment in favor of Chase. Thus, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s holding.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b418-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b418-11\">. Esquibel's letter, which was purchased via the internet from a debt elimination service, is identical to a number of other letters involved in similar suits. <em>See, e.g., Langenfeld v. Chase Bank USA, N.A., </em>537 F.Supp.2d 1181 (N.D.Okla.2008); <em>Wash. Mut. Bank v. Forgue, </em>No. 07-MC-6027, 2007 WL 4232708 (W.D.N.Y. Nov.7, 2007); <em>Eicken v. USAA Federal Savings Bank, </em>498 F.Supp.2d 954 (S.D.Tex.2007); <em>Gengo v. Target Nat. Bank, </em>513 F.Supp.2d 842 (S.D.Tex.2007); <em>Cunningham v. Bank One, </em>487 F.Supp.2d 1189, 1195 (W.D.Wash.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b419-7\">. The letter reads in relevant part as follows: Because I believe I should not have been charged finance charges or fees for tire history of this account, I dispute the accuracy of the following items on my statements which have been calculated based on the inclusion of those charges: the current balance, the amounts and payments due and all finance charges and other fees charged since the account was opened. The exact amount of all such previous finance charges and fees hereby disputed will be determined after you provide the documentary evidence requested below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b419-14\">. Esquibel sent Chase a letter dated September 30, 2004, complaining without explanation of an unspecified billing error; however, Esquibel does not rely on this September letter in the instant suit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b420-5\">. In her complaint Esquibel also asserted that her letters identified a billing error under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1666(b)(5), and Esquibel briefly reurges this argument on appeal. This claim is addressed below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b420-6\">. In other contexts, we have observed a similar distinction between extensions of credit and finance charges on the basis that finance charges serve as precursors to extensions of credit. <em>See, e.g., Berryhill v. Rich Plan of Pensacola, </em>578 F.2d 1092, 1098 (5th Cir.1978) (identifying a finance charge as a fee \"imposed as a condition <em>before </em>credit is extended\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>see also First Acadiana Bank v. FDIC, </em>833 F.2d 548, 550 (5th Cir.1987) (\"payment of the fees was 'incident to the extension of credit,' because the Bank would not extend credit otherwise\u201d) (citing <em>Benyhill, </em>578 F.2d at 1098); James Lockhart, <em>What Constitutes \"Finance Charge\u201d under \u00a7 106(a) of the Truth in Lending Act (15 </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number><em>U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1605(a)) or Applicable Regulations, </em>154 A.L.R. Fed. 431 \u00a7 2[a] &amp; n. 4 (\u201c[cjourts have held that the key question in determining whether a charge is \u2018incident to the extension of credit' is whether a creditor refuses to extend the credit unless the borrower agrees to the charge\u201d) (citing, <em>inter alia, Berryhill, </em>578 F.2d at 1098).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b421-8\">. Though Esquibel asserts a series of related arguments contrary to this holding, we must reject them all in light of the statutory language discussed above. For example, Esquibel urges that a finance charge is an extension of credit because (1) Chase allows debtors such as Esquibel to delay payment until the date that the minimum payment is due, (2) Chase allows finance charges to remain outstanding for subsequent billing cycles and assesses additional fees on the charges, and (3) Chase counts finance charges against available credit in a credit card account. However, all of these arguments ignore the statutory definition of \"finance charge\" that specifically distinguishes it from an extension of credit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
