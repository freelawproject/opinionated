On appeal, Newkirk argued that his sentence was unreasonable because he claimed it was greater than necessary to comply with the purposes of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2007). We concluded that Newkirk was not entitled to relief on this claim. In addition, Newkirk asserted that he was entitled to be resentenced because the district court failed to state in open court the reasons for the sentence as required by 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(c) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2007). However, Newkirk failed to raise this issue in the district court and we found that the court\u2019s omission did not affect Newkirk\u2019s substantial rights. Accordingly, we affirmed New-kirk\u2019s sentence. <em>United States v. Newkirk, </em>240 Fed.Appx. 591 (4th Cir.2007) (No. 06-4935). The United States Supreme Court subsequently granted Newkirk\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari, vacated our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>earlier opinion, and remanded the case to our court for further consideration in light of <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). <em>Newkirk v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 1071, 169 L.Ed.2d 804 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">We review a sentence for reasonableness, applying an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597; <em>see also United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473 (4th Cir.2007). This review entails a two-step process. First, the appellate court must ensure that the district court committed no procedural error, such as \u201cfailing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. If there are no procedural errors, the appellate court then considers the substantive reasonableness of the sentence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">It is undisputed that the sentencing court did not state the reasons for the sentence in open court, as required by 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(c) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2007). <em>Gall </em>provides that a district court\u2019s failure to adequately explain the sentence it chooses amounts to a \u201csignificant procedural error.\u201d 128 S.Ct. at 597. Because the district court did not have the benefit of <em>Gall, </em>we conclude that the proper course to follow is to vacate the sentence and remand the case to give the district court the opportunity to resentence in light of <em>Gall. </em>Accordingly, we vacate Newkirk\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
