The facts are known to the parties and need not be repeated here.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-21\">1. The district court did not err in excluding two defense rebuttal witnesses as a sanction for Gant\u2019s violation of a disclosure agreement. <em>See Taylor v. Illinois, </em>484 U.S. 400, 414-15, 108 S.Ct. 646, 98 L.Ed.2d 798 (1988). Gant has failed to show that the rebuttal witnesses\u2019 testimony would not be cumulative of evidence presented at trial. There was no plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-22\">2. After conducting an in camera inspection of Agent Dreeland\u2019s notes, we find that the district court did not clearly err by declining to order Agent Dreeland\u2019s notes be disclosed under <em>Brady.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b630-23\">3. A \u201cmere presence\u201d jury instruction was unnecessary because the government\u2019s case rested on more than just the defendant\u2019s presence alone and the jury was properly instructed on all of the elements of the crimes. <em>See United States v. Howell, </em>231 F.3d 615, 629 (9th Cir.2000). Moreover, the \u201cmere presence\u201d instruction was adequately covered by the instructions given on conspiracy, possession, and aiding and abetting. <em>See United States v. Govan, </em>152 F.3d 1088, 1093 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-24\">4. A <em>Pinkerton </em>vicarious liability instruction was properly given by the district court because a conspiracy was charged. <em>See United States v. Castaneda, </em>16 F.3d 1504, 1511 (9th Cir.1994). A unanimity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>instruction was unnecessary because jurors are not required to agree unanimously on alternative theories of criminal liability. <em>See United States v. Kim, </em>196 F.3d 1079, 1083 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">5. Gant\u2019s argument concerning whether the district court committed reversible error when it gave a preliminary instruction to the jury that weight was an element of the possession with intent to distribute offense is not persuasive because the district court properly instructed the jury during final jury instructions. <em>See Guam v. Ignacio, </em>852 F.2d 459, 461 (9th Cir. 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">6. The district court properly considered each of the required elements of an enhancement for obstruction of justice. <em>See United States v. Jimenez-Ortega, </em>472 F.3d 1102, 1103 (9th Cir.2007). On this issue, Gant\u2019s \u201cstinky feet\u201d defense was material to his defense of lack of knowledge. <em>See United States v. Morgan, </em>238 F.3d 1180, 1187 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">7. The district court did not err in denying Gant\u2019s motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence because counsel was not diligent and the proffered information was cumulative. <em>See United States v. Jackson, </em>209 F.3d 1103, 1106 (9th Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">8. The district court did not err in denying Gant\u2019s motion for a new trial based on prosecutorial misconduct because we do not discern any misconduct in the prosecutor\u2019s statements. <em>See United States v. Trevino, </em>419 F.3d 896, 901 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">For each of these reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b630-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
