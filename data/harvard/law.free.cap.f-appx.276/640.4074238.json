Nelson, an attorney employed by the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d), appeals pro se from the district court\u2019s summary judgment, in his federal action alleging race and disability discrimination in his employment. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Moore v. Glickman, </em>113 F.3d 988, 989 (9th Cir.1997), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-24\">The district court correctly granted summary judgment to defendant-appellee on Nelson\u2019s reasonable accommodation claim, because the IRS reasonably accommodated Nelson\u2019s vision impairment when it took actions consistent with the recommendations of Nelson\u2019s treating physician. <em>See Zivkovic v. S. Cal. Edison Co., </em>302 F.3d 1080, 1089 (9th Cir.2002) (\u201cAn employer is not obligated to provide an employee the accommodation he requests or prefers, the employer need only provide some reasonable accommodation.\u201d) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-25\">The district court correctly dismissed Nelson\u2019s remaining claims against defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>dant-appellee, because Nelson did not exhaust his administrative remedies for those claims by contacting an Equal Employment Opportunity (\u201cEEO\u201d) counselor within 45 days of the allegedly discriminatory actions. <em>See Cherosky v. Henderson, </em>330 F.3d 1243, 1245 (9th Cir.2003) (stating that failure to consult an EEO counselor within 45 days is \u201cfatal to a federal employee\u2019s discrimination claim\u201d) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.105(a)(1) (\u201cAn aggrieved person must initiate contact with a Counselor within 45 days of the date of the matter alleged to be discriminatory!;.]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">The district court correctly granted summary judgment to defendants named in their individual capacities, because Congress\u2019s provision of administrative remedies precluded Nelson from pursuing <em>Bivens </em>claims against those defendants. <em>See Moore, </em>113 F.3d at 994 (\u201cWe have held that administrative remedies preclude a <em>Bivens </em>action even when that relief is incomplete.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">To the extent that Nelson\u2019s remaining contentions have been developed, they are unpersuasive. <em>See United States v. Kimble, </em>107 F.3d 712, 715 n. 2 (9th Cir.1997) (\u201c[Bjecause this argument was not coherently developed in [the] briefs on appeal, we deem it to have been abandoned.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b664-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
