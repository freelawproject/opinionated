Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 &amp; n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-22\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that Elias-Cortez <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>failed to establish eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal, because he did not provide evidence indicating that he was or would be targeted on account of imputed political opinion. <em>See Ochoa v. Gonzales, </em>406 F.3d 1166, 1170-72 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Elias-Cortez contends that as a disc jockey he was persecuted on account of his membership in a particular social group, and unrelatedly, that he is eligible for CAT relief. However, Elias-Cortez failed to raise either contention to the BIA. Accordingly, we dismiss both contentions. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 677-78 (9th Cir.2004) (explaining that this court lacks jurisdiction to review contentions not raised before the agency).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b678-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
