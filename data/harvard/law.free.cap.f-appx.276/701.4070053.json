We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-10\">First, it was not plain error for the district court to admit Dr. Reynolds\u2019 testimony regarding William Gone\u2019s disfigurement. Dr. Reynolds did not opine that Jackson had the specific intent to maim or that he did not act in self defense. Nor did \u201cthe ultimate inference or conclusion\u201d of specific intent \u201cnecessarily follow from [Dr. Reynolds\u2019] testimony.\u201d <em>United States v. Younger, </em>398 F.3d 1179, 1189 (9th Cir. 2005) (quoting <em>United States v. Morales, </em>108 F.3d 1031, 1038 (9th Cir.1997) (en banc) (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-11\">Second, the district court did not err in denying Jackson\u2019s Fed.R.Crim.P. 29 motion for judgment of acquittal. Reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, a rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Jackson possessed the specific intent to maim or disfigure. <em>See United States v. Ruiz-Lopez, </em>234 F.3d 445, 448 (9th Cir.2001). The government presented photographs apparently showing that Gone\u2019s injuries were numerous and severe. Dr. Reynolds testified that large portions of Gone\u2019s nose and ear were missing and that one of his fingers had been bitten down to the bone. One government witness testified that the driver of the car and another passenger had difficulty pulling Jackson out of the car and away from Gone. Finally, the jury was instructed to consider Jackson\u2019s intoxication in determining whether he had the capacity to form specific intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-14\">Third, the district court imposed a reasonable sentence after consideration of the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Carty, </em>520 F.3d 984 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c). The district court stated that Jackson\u2019s \u201clong history of violent conduct, including multiple assaultive conduct and murder of another human being,\u201d and the \u201cabsolutely heinous\u201d nature of the crime itself showed that Jackson is \u201can extreme danger to the community\u201d and likely to re-offend. The district court at least implicitly considered Jackson\u2019s psychiatric problems when it reviewed the Presentence Report. Although the 120-month sentence is 33 months greater than the high end of the Guidelines range, the district court judge \u201cexplained] why he impose[d] a sentence outside the Guidelines.\u201d <em>Carty, </em>520 F.3d at 992. The sentence imposed was reasonable. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The sentencing judge did not abuse his discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b726-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
