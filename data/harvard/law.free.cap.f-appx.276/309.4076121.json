Targan and his wife filed separate motions to release the property from levy. The district court referred the case to a magistrate judge for discovery. Thereafter, the magistrate judge issued orders denying the Targans\u2019 motions and ordering the release to Merrill Lynch of certain funds in the Charles Schwab accounts. Targan now appeals from the magistrate judge\u2019s orders denying his motion to release property under levy and denying his Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) motion. We find that the magistrate judge lacked jurisdiction to enter a final order; therefore, we vacate the magistrate judge\u2019s orders and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-25\">A magistrate judge may only enter a final appealable judgment if the district court has properly referred the case to the magistrate judge and the parties consent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>to the magistrate judge entering a final judgment. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c)(1) (2000). Here, the magistrate judge was not directed to conduct any proceedings other than discovery, and the parties did not consent to final disposition by the magistrate judge as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c). Thus, the magistrate judge lacked jurisdiction to enter a final order. <em>See United States v. Bryson, </em>981 F.2d 720, 726 (4th Cir.1992); <em>see also Gomez v. United States, </em>490 U.S. 858, 870, 109 S.Ct. 2237, 104 L.Ed.2d 923 (1989). Accordingly, we vacate the orders entered by the magistrate judge and remand this case for further proceedings. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
