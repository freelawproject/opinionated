Following careful review, we conclude that the district court\u2019s section 4245 finding was supported by the unrefuted opinion of the mental health professionals at the United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Springfield, Missouri, and was not clearly erroneous, notwithstanding O\u2019Neal\u2019s denial of mental illness and the inability of defense counsel\u2019s separate examiner to offer a diagnostic impression. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4245(d) (determination of mental illness and treatment need, and burden of proof); <em>United States v. Bean, </em>373 F.3d 877, 879 (8th Cir.2004) (standard of review); <em>United States v. Eckerson, </em>299 F.3d 913, 914-15 (8th Cir. 2002) (per curiam) (upholding commitment order based on opinion of prison hospital staff, despite inmate\u2019s denial of mental illness).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-23\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court and grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw on condition that counsel inform appellant about the procedures for filing petitions for rehearing and for certiorari.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b568-19\">. The Honorable Richard E. Dorr, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri, adopting the report and recommendations of the Honorable James C. England, United States Magistrate Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
