R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b575-25\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-26\">Ruben Gonzalez-Lopez (\u201cGonzalez\u201d) appeals his conviction for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute, and to distribute methamphetamine under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846; possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A); carrying a firearm during a drug trafficking crime under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c); and possession of a firearm under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). This court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-27\">The parties are familiar with the facts and procedural background, so we do not recite them here. We affirm the conviction, vacate the sentence, and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>\n<em>I. Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">A conviction for conspiracy requires proof of at least a \u201cslight\u201d connection between the defendant and the conspiracy at issue. <em>United States v. Aichele, </em>941 F.2d 761, 763 (9th Cir.1991). Gonzalez\u2019s behavior does not suggest he was simply \u201cunwittingly associating with individuals involved in a drug conspiracy.\u201d <em>United States v. Bautista-Avila, </em>6 F.3d 1360, 1363 (9th Cir.1993). Gonzalez\u2019s conduct, along with his co-defendant\u2019s gestures toward him during the meeting with the government agent, could lead a rational trier of fact could conclude there was a sufficient connection.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Gonzalez also challenges his conviction for possession because he never had exclusive control of the drugs. Even without a finding of exclusive control, there is sufficient evidence to show that Gonzalez had possession either because he was connected to the conspiracy or because he aided and abetted the drug transaction. <em>See United States v. Sanchez-Mata, </em>925 F.2d 1166, 1168 (9th Cir.1991) (noting three theories of liability); <em>see also United States v. Reyes-Alvarado, </em>963 F.2d 1184 (9th Cir. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Finally, Gonzalez claims there was insufficient evidence that he knowingly used or carried a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime. The Supreme Court has held that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) applies to \u201ca person who knowingly possesses and conveys firearms in a vehicle, including in the locked glove compartment or trunk of a car, which the person accompanies.\u201d Musc<em>arello v. United States, </em>524 U.S. 125, 126-27, 118 S.Ct. 1911, 141 L.Ed.2d 111 (1998). The firearms conviction was sufficiently supported by such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">\n<em>II. Motion for a New Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">Gonzalez-Lopez also argues that the district court erred when it denied his motion for a new trial in light of a post-conviction statement made by his codefendant. This court has consistently held that such statements do not count as \u201cnewly discovered\u201d evidence for the purposes of granting a new trial. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Reyes-Alvarado, </em>963 F.2d 1184, 1188 (9th Cir.1992); <em>United States v. Lockett, </em>919 F.2d 585, 591 (9th Cir.1990); <em>United States v. Diggs, </em>649 F.2d 731, 740 (9th Cir.1981). Therefore, the district court did not err in refusing to grant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-10\">\n<em>III. Sentencing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b576-11\">The district court sentenced Gonzalez-Lopez to 300 months in prison. This represented 240 months for the gun and drug charges in Counts 1, 2, and 4, and a consecutive term of 60 months under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) for Count 3 (carrying the firearm during the drug trafficking crime).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-12\">A. <em>Apprendi/Booker</em></p>\n<p id=\"b576-13\">Gonzalez-Lopez argues that the district court improperly calculated its sentence based on a quantity of drugs higher than the quantity the jury found on its special verdict form. Other than a prior conviction, facts increasing the defendant\u2019s sentence beyond the maximum authorized by a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proven to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 244, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) (citing <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000)). Here, the jury\u2019s finding of \u201cover 500 grams\u201d would on its own expose the defendant to life imprisonment. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(viii). The district court\u2019s reliance on any higher quantity at sentencing did not violate Defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-14\">B. Proper Guidelines Calculation</p>\n<p id=\"b576-15\">Gonzalezr-Lopez also argues that the district court erred in its calculation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>Guidelines sentence for the drug sale. The district court found an offense level of 32, with a criminal history category of V. This was incorrect. Under the 2004 Guidelines, which both parties now agree applied, 2,694 grams of methamphetamine start at an offense level of 34. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(3), (c)(3). As the government concedes, the \u201cminor role\u201d adjustment would then require a total decrease of five levels to 29, not two levels as found by the district court. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(3) (decreasing base level 34 by three levels if the defendant receives an adjustment under \u00a7 3B1.2), 3B1.2(b) (decreasing two levels if the defendant was a \u201cminor participant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">The proper calculation of the minor role adjustment was not raised below, so we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Garro, </em>517 F.3d 1163, 1168 (9th Cir. 2008). The government contends the error did not affect substantial rights because the court indicated it was not following the Guidelines in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">We disagree. Though the district court did not have the benefit of it at the time, our sentencing jurisprudence now makes clear the following: \u201cAll sentencing proceedings are to begin by determining the applicable Guidelines range. The range must be calculated correctly. In this sense, the Guidelines are the starting point and the initial benchmark, and are to be kept in mind throughout the process.\u201d <em>United States v. Carty, </em>520 F.3d 984, 991-92 (9th Cir.2008) (citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">Here, the court went above what it believed was the proper Guidelines range and stated at various times that it would depart from the Guidelines. But the court made clear that the Guidelines served, as they should have, as a starting point for the sentence: So I\u2019ll find that under the 2004 version of the advisory guidelines that the proper offense level would be a 32, which carries 18[8] to 235 months under a criminal history category five. And I\u2019m going to sentence you, as I say, at 240 of those months, and then of course by law I have to add the 60 months for the 924(c) in Count 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">We are persuaded that the miscalculation substantially increased the sentence \u2014 perhaps by five years or more. Given an offense level of 29, the 2004 Guidelines range for a criminal history category five was 140-175 months, not the 188-235 calculated by the court. We may correct such an error on plain error review because it affects the fairness, integrity, and public reputation of the judicial proceedings. <em>See Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 466-67, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997). We therefore vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-10\">Accordingly, we need not consider Gonzales-Lopez\u2019 arguments that the district court did not adequately articulate its consideration of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and that the 25-year total sentence was substantively unreasonable. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors and reasonableness of the sentence should be considered anew on resentencing. <em>See Carty, </em>520 F.3d at 991-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-11\">Conviction AFFIRMED; sentence VACATED; REMANDED for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b575-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9 th Cir.
