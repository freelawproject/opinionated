For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-28\">In the prison context, we analyze First Amendment retaliation claims under the three-part test set forth in <em>Bennett v. Hendrix, </em>423 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2005). To prevail, a plaintiff must establish: (1) his speech or act was constitutionally protected; (2) defendant\u2019s retaliatory conduct adversely affected the protected speech; and (3) there is a causal connection between the retaliatory action and the adverse effect on speech. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b934-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Robinson, we conclude he has not stated a First Amendment claim. While he clearly had a right to ask the correctional officer about wearing warm gear, Robinson was not speaking on a matter of public concern when he did so. Thus, his speech is not entitled to First Amendment protection. In addition, after Boyd gave Robinson a direct instruction, Robinson did not have a First Amendment right to argue with Boyd, who was at that point constitutionally permitted to discipline Robinson for disobeying his order.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
