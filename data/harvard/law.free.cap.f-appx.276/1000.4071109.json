Because the World Bank is not an agency of the United States government and therefore is both outside the MSPB\u2019s jurisdiction and also not subject to the VEOA, this court affirms.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-13\">Mr. Sedgwick served on active duty with the armed forces of the United States from October 4, 1966 to May 7, 1969, and was honorably discharged. More recently, Mr. Sedgwick applied for several jobs with the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, commonly known as the World Bank, but to no avail. He also did not receive funding from the World Bank for a proposed overseas project.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-15\">Some time before December 19, 2006, Mr. Sedgwick filed a complaint with the Department of Labor, asserting that the World Bank had violated his rights as a preference-eligible veteran under the VEOA. The Department of Labor found no merit in Mr. Sedgwick\u2019s claim because the World Bank is not a federal agency and thus not required to give veterans preference. Mr. Sedgwick appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board. The Board sustained the dismissal of Mr. Sedgwick\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-16\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-17\">This court reviews the MSPB\u2019s jurisdictional judgments without deference. <em>Forest v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>47 F.3d 409, 410 (Fed.Cir.1995). Here, the issue is whether 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3330a, which governs administrative redress for preference-eligible individuals, applies to the World Bank. Subsections 3330a(a)(l) and 3330a(d) give the Board jurisdiction to consider claims that an \u201cagency\u201d has violated the rights of a preference-eligible veteran, but do not define \u201cagency.\u201d Nonetheless, this court has described 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3330a as \u201cpertain[ing] to employment in the federal government-wide civil service system\u201d and offering redress where an \u201cagency has violated [an] individual\u2019s rights under any statute or regulation relating to veterans\u2019 preference for employment with the United States government.\u201d Scar<em>nati v. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>344 F.3d 1246, 1247 (Fed.Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-18\">The World Bank is not part of the \u201cfederal government-wide civil service system,\u201d nor is it even part of the United States government. Instead, as its name suggests, the World Bank is an international organization. President Truman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>designated the Bank as such in 1946. Exec. Order No. 9751, 3 C.F.R. 558 (1943-1948 Comp.). Any passing references to the World Bank as a federal agency do not help Mr. Sedgwick\u2019s case. Likewise, the partial funding of the World Bank by the United States does not make the World Bank a \u201cde facto\u201d federal agency, or some \u201chybrid\u201d of an international organization and a federal agency. Indeed, our sister circuits have routinely recognized that the World Bank is an international organization, not a federal agency. <em>See, e.g., Defenders of Wildlife v. Hodel, </em>851 F.2d 1035, 1041 (8th Cir.1988) (\u201cSeveral of the projects were funded by the World Bank, which is not a federal agency.\u201d); <em>Mendaro v. World Bank, </em>717 F.2d 610, 611 (D.C.Cir. 1983) (\u201cThe International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, commonly referred to as the World Bank, is an international financial institution whose purposes include assisting the development of its member nations\u2019 territories, promoting and supplementing private foreign investment, and promoting long range balanced growth in international trade.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-4\">Because the World Bank is not a federal agency, the MSPB lacked jurisdiction to consider whether Mr. Sedgwick\u2019s asserted veterans\u2019 preference rights were violated. Moreover, the World Bank is not subject to the VEOA. The Board thus properly dismissed Mr. Sedgwick\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-6\">\n<em>COSTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-7\">Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
