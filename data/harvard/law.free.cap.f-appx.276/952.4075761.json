Because he filed his \u00a7 2255 motion after the effective date of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), Pub. L. No. 104-32, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996), the provisions of that act apply. We granted a certificate of appeal-ability on the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b977-16\">Whether the district court erred in finding that appellant\u2019s counsel at the sentencing hearing was not ineffective for failing to move for a continuance of the sentencing hearing until the U.S. Supreme Court issued <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b977-17\">On appeal, Bajorski argues that the district court erroneously found that his counsel\u2019s failure to request a continuance of his December 2004 sentencing hearing did not constitute ineffective assistance in light of the fact that the court indicated that it would have imposed a 72-month sentence if the Guidelines were not mandatory. Bajorski contends that he timely raised the certified issue because it relates back to his original \u2022\u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-19\">We review ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims <em>de novo. Chandler v. United States, </em>218 F.3d 1305, 1312 (11th Cir. 2000). We may affirm on any ground supported by the record, even if not addressed by the district court. <em>McCoy v. United States, </em>266 F.3d 1245, 1254 (11th Cir.2001). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>Also, we may address issues underlying the issue certified for appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 1248 n. 2. Although we liberally construe Bajorski\u2019s <em>pro se </em>filings, his counseled pleadings are not so construed. <em>See Espey v. Wainwright, </em>734 F.2d 748, 749-50 (11th Cir. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">A prisoner in federal custody may file a motion to vacate, set aside, or correct sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, \u201cclaiming the right to be released upon the ground that the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States, ... or is otherwise subject to collateral attack.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(a). A \u00a7 2255 motion must be filed within a one-year period of limitation. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">The United States Constitution provides that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defense.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. VI. A defendant is entitled to the effective assistance of counsel during sentencing. <em>Jones v. United States, </em>224 F.3d 1251, 1259 (11th Cir.2000). To make a successful claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show that: (1) his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient; and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced his defense. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). If the defendant cannot meet one of <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>prongs, we do not need to address the other prong. <em>Holladay v. Haley, </em>209 F.3d 1243, 1248 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-6\">In determining whether counsel gave adequate assistance, \u201ccounsel is strongly presumed to have rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 690, 104 S.Ct. at 2066. Counsel\u2019s performance is deficient only if it falls below the wide range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases. <em>Id. </em>at 689, 104 S.Ct. at 2065. The Supreme Court has defined prejudice as a \u201creasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-8\">Although requests for continuance are not specifically addressed, Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32 requires a district court to impose a sentence \u201cwithout unnecessary delay.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(b). We have considered an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in the context of a counsel\u2019s failure to request a continuance. In order to assert a claim on this basis, the defendant must establish an entitlement to the grant of the motion and prejudice from the failure to request the motion. <em>See Jones v. Smith, </em>772 F.2d 668, 674 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-9\">Nevertheless, we have held that counsel cannot be deemed ineffective for failing to anticipate a change in the law. <em>See Fun-chess v. Wainwright, </em>772 F.2d 683, 691 (11th Cir.1985). Even if a claim based upon an anticipated change in the law is reasonably available at the time counsel failed to raise it, such failure does not constitute ineffective assistance. <em>See Pitts v. Cook, </em>923 F.2d 1568, 1573-74 (11th Cir. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-10\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Bajorski properly raised the certified claim before the district court and that it was timely under AEDPA, we conclude that he failed to establish the deficiency and prejudice prongs required by <em>Strickland. </em>His counsel\u2019s performance was not deficient because he was not required to act in anticipation of <em>Booker. </em>Further, the district court stated that it would not have granted the motion if it had been made. Thus, a reasonable probability does not exist that a motion for continuance would have resulted in a hearing after <em>Booker </em>and the subsequent imposition of a lesser sentence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying Bajorski\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b977-14\">. The Supreme Court granted the petition for writ of <em>certiorari </em>on August 2, 2004. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>542 U.S. 956, 125 S.Ct. 11, 159 L.Ed.2d 838 (2004).
