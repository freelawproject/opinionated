Lamb, which pretermitted his application for asylum and denied his application for withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Steven, Roy </em>No. A96 427 057 (B.I.A. Aug. 10, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A96 427 057 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Nov. 30, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">When the BIA agrees with the IJ\u2019s conclusion that a petitioner is not credible and, without rejecting any of the IJ\u2019s grounds for decision, emphasizes particular aspects of that decision, this Court reviews both the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s opinions\u2014 or more precisely, the Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision including the portions not explicitly discussed by the BIA. <em>Yun-Zui Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 394 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Tian-Yong Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121, 129 (2d Cir.2004). We review de novo questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See, e.g., Secaida-Rosales v. I.N.S., </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">As a preliminary matter, we lack jurisdiction to review the pretermission of Steven\u2019s asylum application. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3). Although we retain jurisdiction to review constitutional claims and questions of law, Steven\u2019s argument that the IJ violated his due process rights by failing to consider the evidence he submitted is in fact a challenge to the IJ\u2019s factual finding. <em>See Saloum v. USCIS, </em>437 F.3d 238, 243-44 (2d Cir.2006)(finding a lack of jurisdiction to consider petitioner\u2019s argument, cloaked in \u201cconstitutional garb,\u201d that the IJ \u201c \u2018incorrectly weighed the evidence [and] failed to explicitly consider certain evidence\u2019 \u201d). Accordingly, we dismiss the petition for review to that extent. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3); <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 328-29 (2d Cir.2006). Moreover, because Steven failed to raise his CAT claim in his brief to this Court, we deem it abandoned. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 546 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005) (emphasizing that issues not sufficiently argued in the briefs are considered waived and ordinarily will not be addressed on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-10\">As to Steven\u2019s withholding of removal claim, we conclude that the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence. Steven does not dispute that the record contains numerous inconsistencies, including those regarding the date he was allegedly stabbed and the date of the alleged attacks on his house and church. Instead, he argues that these inconsistencies are minor. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>However, we have emphasized that where an applicant alleges an \u201cevent of major importance,\u201d a fact-finder \u201cmight reasonably expect him to have had a clear recollection\u201d of the date it occurred, and accordingly an inconsistency in dates may properly form the basis of an adverse credibility determination. <em>See Zhou Yun Zhang, </em>386 F.3d at 77 (finding that where an applicant testified inconsistently as to the date his wife was sterilized, the discrepancy was not \u201cminor\u201d and a reasonable fact-finder could have used it as a basis for an adverse credibility determination). Here, because the agency found inconsistencies in Steven\u2019s account of each of the major incidents upon which his past persecution claim was based, its adverse credibility determination was proper. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the record reasonably supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Steven\u2019s documentary evidence was insufficient to make up for deficiencies in his testimony where it did not resolve or diminish the noted discrepancies. <em>See Siewe v. Gonzales, </em>480 F.3d 160, 170 (2d Cir.2007) (holding that an asylum applicant\u2019s presentation of \u201ca single false document or a single instance of false testimony may (if attributable to the petitioner) infect the balance of the alien\u2019s uncorroborated or unauthenticated evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED in part and DISMISSED in part. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
