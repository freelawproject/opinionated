We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a). We review BIA denials of motions to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Franco-Rosendo v. Gonzales, </em>454 F.3d 965, 966 (9th Cir.2006). We conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion and accordingly deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-22\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying Garcia\u2019s motion on the grounds that she is statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 provides that an alien who \u201cfails voluntarily to depart\u201d during her voluntary departure period <em>\u201cshall </em>be ... ineligible, for a period of 10 years, to receive any further relief\u2019 including adjustment of status. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(d)(l)(B) (2000) (emphasis added). We have held that the BIA may properly deny motions to reopen that are filed after the expiration of the voluntary departure period. <em>See de Martinez v. Ashcroft, </em>374 F.3d 759, 763-64 (9th Cir. 2004) (denying relief where alien moved to reopen thirty days after the expiration of her voluntary departure period); <em>Barroso v. Gonzales, </em>429 F.3d 1195, 1202 (9th Cir. 2005) (\u201cWhere an alien files his motion <em>after </em>his voluntary departure period has expired, the law in this circuit is clear that the BIA may properly deny the motion on that basis.\u201d). In this case, Garcia failed to depart during her voluntary departure period, and she filed her motion to reopen forty-seven days after that period ended. She is therefore ineligible for adjustment of status.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>The BIA also did not abuse its discretion by denying Garcia\u2019s motion in spite of her alleged \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d because Congress specifically eliminated the \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d justification for failing to depart within a specified departure period. <em>See Serrano v. Gonzales, </em>469 F.3d 1317, 1318 (9th Cir.2006); <em>accord In re Zmijewska, </em>24 I <em>&amp; </em>N Dec. 87, 92 (BIA 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b578-25\"> xhiS disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
