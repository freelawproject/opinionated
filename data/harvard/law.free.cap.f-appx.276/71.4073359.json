Hladylowycz, which denied her applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Lin, Yan Yun, </em>No. A95 461 815 (B.I.A. Sept. 25, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A95 461 815 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Sept. 17, 2003). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-10\">Where the BIA issues an independent decision on remand from this Court and does not adopt the decision of the IJ, we review the decision of the BIA alone. <em>See Belortaja v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 619, 623 (2d Cir.2007). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Manzur v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>494 F.3d 281, 289 (2d Cir.2007). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>See Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law, including what quantum of evidence will suffice to discharge an applicant\u2019s burden of proof. <em>See, e.g., Islami v. Gonzales, </em>412 F.3d 391, 396 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir. 2003). Our review of the BIA\u2019s conclusions with respect to evidence of country conditions in China is highly deferential. As we have held, \u201c[fjact-finders in immigration cases command no lesser deference\u201d than other agencies acting in their expert capacity. <em>Hoxhallari v. Gonzales, </em>468 F.3d 179, 186 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-13\">Here, we need not reach the agency\u2019s findings made in reliance on its recent precedent decisions, nor Lin\u2019s challenges to that reliance, because we find no error in the BIA\u2019s independent finding that Lin failed to establish prima facie eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-14\">To establish asylum eligibility based on future persecution, an applicant must establish that her fear of persecution is objectively reasonable. <em>See Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 178 (2d Cir.2004). A fear is not objectively reasonable if it lacks \u201csolid support\u201d in the record and is merely \u201cspeculative at best.\u201d <em>Jian Xing Huang v. INS, </em>421 F.3d 125, 129 (2d Cir.2005). Based on the record here, we find no error in the BIA\u2019s denial of Lin\u2019s claims. The affidavits from John Aird in the record are insufficient because they were \u201cnot prepared specifically for petitioner and [were] not particularized as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>to [her] circumstances.\u201d <em>Wei Guang Wang v. BIA, </em>437 F.3d 270, 274 (2d Cir. 2006). <em>But see Zhi Yun Gao v. Mukasey, </em>508 F.3d 86, 88 (2d Cir.2007) (emphasizing that \u201ca document need not specifically name the petitioner to merit attention\u201d). Additionally, neither the 1996 Shanqian Village letter nor the 1991 Fujian Birth Planning Regulations in the record establish Lin\u2019s claims because she never indicated she was from Shanqian Village or would live there upon her return, and there is no evidence that Fujian regulations from 1991 would still be in force upon her return more than fifteen years later. <em>See Jian Xing Huang, </em>421 F.3d at 129. Moreover, even assuming their accuracy, the balance of Lin\u2019s evidence, all of which dates from 2001 or prior, fails to indicate that returning Chinese nationals with U.S.-born children have been and will be persecuted by the Chinese government. <em>See id. </em>Simply stated, we are not compelled to find in this case that the BIA ignored any of the evidence Lin submitted, <em>of. Zhi Yun Gao, </em>508 F.3d at 88, and we defer to the BIA\u2019s assessment of country conditions in China. <em>See Hoxhallari, </em>468 F.3d at 186-87; <em>see also Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 336-37 n. 17 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Additionally, we do not agree with Lin that the BIA failed to consider her argument that she faces economic persecution upon her return. To the contrary, the BIA specifically found that Lin failed to establish that any \u201csanctions\u201d she faced due to the birth of children in the U.S. would rise to the level of persecution. That finding was not in error because Lin\u2019s testimony that she would be fined was insufficient to establish that any economic harm she faced would constitute economic persecution. <em>See Guan Shan Liao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>293 F.3d 61, 67 (2d Cir.2002) (noting that to establish economic persecution, an applicant must show at least a \u201cdeliberate imposition of a substantial economic disadvantage\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">Accordingly, we will not disturb the agency\u2019s determination that Lin failed to carry her burden of proof. Because Lin was unable to show the objective likelihood of persecution needed to make out an asylum claim, she was necessarily unable to meet the higher standard required to succeed on her application for withholding of removal, where it was based on the same factual predicate. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148,156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b96-11\">. Because Lin failed to raise either her past persecution claim or CAT claim in her brief to this Court, we deem those claims waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 546 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005) (emphasizing that issues not sufficiently argued in the briefs are considered waived and ordinarily will not be addressed on appeal).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
