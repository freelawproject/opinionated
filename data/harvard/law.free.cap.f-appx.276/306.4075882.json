He was sentenced to 200 months of imprisonment each on the drug and firearm counts, to be served concurrently. His fifty-one-month sentence for violating supervised release was imposed to run consecutively for twelve months, so that his total sentence of imprisonment is 212 months. On appeal, counsel has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), alleging that there are no meritorious claims on appeal but raising the following issue: whether McCombs\u2019 sentence was greater than necessary under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2007). For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-24\">We do not find that the district court abused its discretion in sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>McCombs. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) (stating review standard); <em>United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473 (4th Cir.2007) (same). Our review of the record reveals no procedural or substantive error in McCombs\u2019 sentence, <em>Pauley, </em>511 F.3d at 473, and demonstrates that the district court carefully considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors before imposing sentence. <em>United States v. Davenport, </em>445 F.3d 366, 370 (4th Cir.2006). McCombs\u2019 assertion that he received an unwarranted disparate sentence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6) (2000), fads in light of his extensive criminal history and correct designation as a career offender under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4B1.1 (2006), which gave him a higher sentence than some of his co-defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">We have examined the entire record in this case in accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders, </em>and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
