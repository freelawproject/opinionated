In dismissing the complaint, the court instructed Patel to amend the complaint in one of his other pending actions, thereby apparently treating the instant complaint as duplicative and frivolous. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(a) (court shall review, before docketing or as soon as possible after docketing, civil complaint by prisoner filed against government entity or employee), (b)(1) (court shall dismiss complaint if it is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state claim upon which relief can be granted); <em>cf. Aziz v. Burrows, </em>976 F.2d 1158, 1158-59 (8th Cir.1992) (affirming 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915 dismissal on ground that \u201cdistrict courts may dismiss a duplicative complaint raising issues directly related to issues in another pending action brought by the same party\u201d); <em>Van Meter v. Morgan, </em>518 F.2d 366, 367-68 (8th Cir.1975) (per curiam) (affirming district court\u2019s \u00a7 1915 dismissal of complaint as frivolous where district court explained that petitioner had previously been permitted to file three complaints, one of which was against same defendant and appeared to be based on same conduct as in dismissed complaint).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-25\">Upon review, we conclude that, under the present circumstances, the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>court abused its discretion in dismissing Patel\u2019s complaint, because it appears from record information brought to our attention by Patel that his complaint differs significantly from the complaints in his other pending actions. <em>See Aziz, </em>976 F.2d at 1159 (dismissal of duplicative complaint reviewed for abuse of discretion); <em>Van Meter, </em>518 F.2d at 368 (same); <em>cf. I.A. Durbin, Inc. v. Jefferson Nat. Bank, </em>793 F.2d 1541, 1551 (11th Cir.1986) (general rule for determining duplicative litigation is whether parties, issues, and available relief do not significantly differ between two actions; finding actions not duplicative when parties and issues were substantially different); <em>Complaint of Bankers Trust Co. v. Chatterjee, </em>636 F.2d 37, 40 (3rd Cir.1980) (it is important that only truly duplicative litigation be avoided); <em>see also Miller v. Norris, </em>247 F.3d 736, 739 (8th Cir.2001) (pro se filings are to be liberally construed).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">Accordingly, we reverse the dismissal of Patel\u2019s complaint and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We also grant Patel\u2019s \u201cmotion for judicial notice.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
