We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253, and we affirm the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-22\">Jones raises two arguments on appeal. He first contends that the trial court violated his due process rights by admitting evidence that a prosecution witness feared that Jones would have him killed if he testified. However, <em>United States v. Abel </em>held that \u201c[pjroof of bias is almost always relevant\u201d and explained that \u201c[b]ias may be induced by a witness\u2019 like, dislike, or fear of a party, or by the witness\u2019 self-interest.\u201d 469 U.S. 45, 52, 105 S.Ct. 465, 83 L.Ed.2d 450 (1984). Because testimony about the witness\u2019 fear of Jones is relevant under <em>Abel, </em>we cannot agree with Jones\u2019s contention that the state court decision was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of\u201d Supreme Court precedent. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-23\">Jones also contends that the trial court erred by limiting his cross-examination of a prosecution witness and that that error was not harmless. We agree with the California Court of Appeal\u2019s decision that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>the limit on cross-examination violated Jones\u2019s rights under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. We also agree with the Court of Appeal\u2019s conclusion that, in light of the material evidence in the record supporting the jury\u2019s guilty verdict and the fact that the witness\u2019 testimony was not central to the prosecution\u2019s case, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 678-79, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986); <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b617-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
