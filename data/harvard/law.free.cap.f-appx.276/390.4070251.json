Guillen argues that the district court erred by enhancing his offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) (2006) based on the determination that his prior Texas conviction of burglary of a habitation was a crime of violence as defined by the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>As Guillen concedes, because he did not object to the district court\u2019s application of the enhancement, review is for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Gracia-Cantu, </em>302 F.3d 308, 310 (5th Cir.2002). Plain error exists when the district court committed a clear and obvious error that affected the substantial rights of the defendant. <em>See United States v. Marek, </em>238 F.3d 310, 315 (5th Cir.2001). This court will exercise its sound discretion to correct the error if it finds that the error \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">The record includes a judicial confession, admitted at the sentencing hearing below without objection, in which Guillen admitted to facts that establish that he committed the offense of burglary of a habitation in a manner that is equivalent to the enumerated offense of \u201cburglary of a dwelling.\u201d <em>See </em>Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 30.02(a)(1); <em>United States v. Garciar-Mendez, </em>420 F.3d 454, 456-57 (5th Cir.2005). A written judicial confession may be relied on \u201cin an effort to determine the nature of the Texas offense to which [the defendant] previously pleaded guilty.\u201d <em>United States v. Garcia-Arellano, </em>522 F.3d 477 (5th Cir.2008). In view of the judicial confession, the district court did not err, plainly or otherwise, in enhancing Guillen\u2019s offense level based on his Texas conviction of burglary of a habitation. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b414-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
