Bakos (collectively \u201cReuning\u201d) appeal a decision of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cPTO\u201d) Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences (\u201cBoard\u201d), which sustained-in-part the examiner\u2019s rejection of Reuning\u2019s patent application. In the decision, the Board reversed the examiner\u2019s rejection of claims 1-2 and sustained the examiner\u2019s rejection of claims 3-66 as obvious under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103 in light of certain prior art references. <em>In re Reuning, </em>No. 2006-0580 (B.P.A.I. Nov. 30, 2006) <em>{\u201cDecision\u201d). </em>For the reasons explained below, we <em>vacate-in-part </em>the Board\u2019s decision with respect to claims 3-66 and <em>remand </em>for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-6\">The patent application at issue is application serial number 09/911,024 (\u201cthe '024 application\u201d), filed July 24, 2001. Reuning\u2019s application describes a method of assembling advertisements and creating a targeted list of sales prospects that are selected to receive those advertisements. The '024 application contains sixty-six pending claims, twelve of which are independent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-7\">The examiner rejected all pending claims (claims 1-66) under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103(a) as obvious in light of two different combinations of the following four references: U.S. Patent No. 5,799,268 issued to Boguraev (\u201cBoguraev\u201d); U.S. Patent 5,321,604 issued to Peach et al. (\u201cPeach\u201d); U.S. Publication No.2002/0111958 to Hartman et al. (\u201cHartman\u201d); and Walter S. Mossberg, <em>Personal Technology: Threats to Privacy On-Line Become Worrisome, </em>Wall Street Journal, Oct. 24, 1996, at B1 (\u201cMossberg\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-10\">Reuning appealed the examiner\u2019s rejection to the Board. In the appeal brief, Reuning listed all pending claims in the \u201cStatus of Claims\u201d and \u201cIssues Presented\u201d sections, but identified only claim 1 in the \u201cSummary of the Invention\u201d section.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Then, for each of the four cited references, Reuning argued why that reference cannot be used in a combination under \u00a7 103. In these sections, Reuning asserted that Hartman, Boguraev, and Peach teach an expectation of failure and/or lack a suggestion to combine; that Boguraev is non-analogous art; and that Mossberg does not enable the claim limitations and was antedated by a declaration under 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.131. Throughout these reference-based sections, Reuning consistently referred to only claim 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-11\">The examiner\u2019s response to the appeal brief both restated the grounds for the \u00a7 103 rejections (as previously articulated in the examiner\u2019s office actions) and responded to the arguments presented in Reuning\u2019s appeal brief. The examiner also clearly identified the two rejection groupings to be considered by the Board: (1) Group I contained claims 1-25, 33-58, and 66, rejected as obvious in light of the Hartman-Mossberg-Boguraev combination and (2) Group II contained claims 26-32 and 59-65, rejected as obvious in light of the Hartman-Mossberg-Peach combination. Reuning agreed to these groupings. <em>See </em>37 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.192(c)(7) (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-12\">Two years later, the Board issued a cursory decision addressing Reuning\u2019s ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>peal. <em>Decision. </em>The Board\u2019s decision initially recognizes that \u201c[t]his is an appeal from the final rejection of claims 1 through 66\u201d and lists the specific rejections and their corresponding claims. <em>Decision, </em>slip op. at 1-2. Turning to the merits of the appeal, the Board reversed the rejection of claim 1 (and its only dependent claim\u2014 claim 2) because it found that the cited references fail to teach or suggest \u201cthe steps of \u2018Searching the Internet\u2019 and \u2018Identifying web pages and Internet postings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Decision, </em>slip op. at 3-4. However, the Board sustained the obviousness rejections of the remaining sixty-four claims (claims 3-66) because it found that \u201cthe appellants have not presented any patentability arguments for these claims.\u201d The Board\u2019s decision, notably, provides no analysis of the merits of Reuning\u2019s reference-specific arguments and offers no explanation for why reversing the rejection of claim 1 did not automatically result in reversal of the rejections for all claims in Group I.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">In response, Reuning filed a Request for Rehearing in which Reuning argued that \u201cappellants did in fact present both evidence and argument showing patentability of claims 3 to 66\u201d and pointed to the reference-specific arguments set forth in Reuning\u2019s appeal brief to the Board. While the Board granted Reuning\u2019s Request for Rehearing, the Board declined to modify its original decision because it concluded that Reuning \u201cnever explained how the limitations of the noted claims are patentable over the combined teachings of the applied references.\u201d The Board explained, \u201cArguments pointing out the individual shortcomings in each of the applied references are not effective in overcoming a prima facie ease of obviousness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-8\">Having exhausted administrative remedies, Reuning timely appealed to this court. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(4)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-10\">On appeal, Reuning asks this court to find error in the Board\u2019s affirmance of the examiner\u2019s rejection of claims 3-66 and to render a decision reversing the examiner\u2019s rejection of these claims. Reuning provides two grounds for reversing the examiner\u2019s rejection on the merits. First, Reuning characterizes the Board\u2019s decision as concluding that the prior art fails to teach or suggest three claim limitations: \u201csearching the internet,\u201d \u201cidentifying web pages and postings,\u201d and \u201cweb pages containing profile data.\u201d After asserting that these three limitations are \u201callowable,\u201d Reuning points to twenty-eight other claims that Reuning asserts are non-obvious because they each contain at least one of these \u201callowable\u201d limitations. Second, Reuning asserts that the cited prior art references cannot properly be combined because \u201cboth Hartman and Boguraev discourage the combination with Mossberg.\u201d Accordingly, Reuning asserts that the examiner failed to establish a prima facie case of obviousness and, therefore, the examiner\u2019s rejections should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-11\">With regard to the first ground for reversal advanced by Reuning, the Solicitor (on behalf of the PTO) asserts that Reuning\u2019s arguments \u201care based on a misinterpretation of the Board\u2019s decision.\u201d The Solicitor argues that, while the Board found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>that the prior art did not teach the first two limitations of claim 1, \u201c[t]he Board did not make any findings that compel the reversal of the rejections of all 64 claims on appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\">We agree that Reuning appears to misapprehend the Board\u2019s decision. In its decision, the Board apparently determined that the cited references fail to teach or suggest \u201cthe steps of \u2018Searching the Internet\u2019 and \u2018Identifying web pages and Internet postings\u2019 as set forth in claim 1 on appeal.\u201d Appellant\u2019s App. 48. None of Reuning\u2019s other claims contain these two limitations (with the arguable exception of claim 34). In fact, none of the other claims contain either limitation as it is specifically recited in the Board\u2019s decision. (Whether different but similar language in other claims also encompasses non-obviousness subject matter is a factual determination yet to be made by the Board.) Moreover, Reuning\u2019s previous statements contradict the proffered ground for reversal. In the appeal brief to the Board, Reuning admitted that \u201ceach one of [the elements of claim 1] is <em>known in the art.\u201d </em>Appellant\u2019s App. 5 (emphasis added). Having acknowledged that certain claimed elements are taught by the prior art, Reuning cannot now defeat an obviousness rejection by asserting that the cited references fail to teach or suggest these elements. <em>See Constant v. Advanced Micro-Devices, Inc., </em>848 F.2d 1560, 1570 (Fed. Cir.1988) (\u201cA statement in a patent that something is in the prior art is binding on the applicant and patentee for determinations of anticipation and obviousness.\u201d); <em>In re Nomiya, </em>509 F.2d 566, 571 n. 5 (CCPA 1975) (It is a \u201cbasic proposition that a statement by an applicant, whether in the application or in other papers submitted during prosecution, that certain matter is \u2018prior art\u2019 to him, is an admission that that matter is prior art for all purposes.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-5\">Reuning\u2019s argument is also premised on a mistaken assignment of burden between the PTO and an applicant-appellant. On appeal, Reuning argues that \u201cappellants do not need to \u2018present patentability arguments\u2019 \u201d because \u201cthe Patent Office must present a prima facie explanation of non-patentability.\u201d Reuning thus concludes that the Board was required to explain how each and every element of the rejected claims is taught by the cited references, rather than sustaining the examiner\u2019s rejection simply because \u201cappellants have not presented any patentability arguments.\u201d We disagree with Reuning\u2019s analysis. Through the examiner\u2019s office actions and response to Reuning\u2019s appeal brief, the PTO appears to have established a prima facie case of obviousness. It is then the responsibility of an applicant-appellant to either rebut the prima facie case or provide some argument or evidence to show that a prima facie case of obviousness has not been established. <em>See </em>37 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.192(a) (2004) (\u201cThe brief ... must set forth the authorities and arguments on which appellant will rely to maintain the appeal.\u201d); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1.192(c)(8)(iv) (specifying guidelines for appealing a rejection under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103 and requiring an appellant to \u201cspecify the errors in the rejection\u201d and explain why those errors render the claims patentable over the cited art). We find that the Board did not err by declining to restate the examiner\u2019s grounds for rejection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-6\">On the other hand, the Solicitor takes the position that we should vacate and remand the decision so that the Board may consider the merits of Reuning\u2019s arguments and the examiner\u2019s obviousness rejections in the first instance. As noted above, the Board\u2019s decision sustained the examiner\u2019s rejections of claims 3-66 on procedural grounds. According to the Solicitor, \u201cContrary to Reuning\u2019s analysis, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>is precisely because the Board did not address with specificity the rejections of claims 3-66 that this Court should remand this appeal to the Board.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">We agree with the Solicitor. The Board is charged with deciding factual issues in the first instance, such as whether an examiner\u2019s rejection for obviousness should be reversed. <em>See KSR Int\u2019l, </em>127 S.Ct. at 1745-46 (obviousness is a legal question based on underlying fact findings); <em>ParaOrdnance Mfg., Inc. v. SGS Imps. Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>73 F.3d 1085, 1088 (Fed.Cir.1995) (\u201cWhat the prior art teaches,\u201d the \u201cdifferences between the prior art and the claimed invention,\u201d and \u201cwhether [the pri- or art] teaches toward or away from the claimed invention\u201d are questions of fact.). In its opinions, \u201cthe Board is required to set forth ... specific findings of fact and conclusions of law adequate to form a basis for our review.\u201d <em>Gechter v. Davidson, </em>116 F.3d 1454, 1460 (Fed.Cir.1997). When an agency (such as the Board) fails to explain its findings of fact and conclusions of law or fails to consider all relevant factors, \u201cthe proper course, except in rare circumstances, is to remand to the agency for additional investigation or explanation.\u201d <em>Fla. Power &amp; Light Co. v. Larion, </em>470 U.S. 729, 744, 105 S.Ct. 1598, 84 L.Ed.2d 643 (1985) (explaining that \u201c[t]he reviewing court is not generally empowered to conduct a <em>de novo </em>inquiry\u201d in these cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-6\">Reuning does not respond to the Solicitor\u2019s request to vacate and remand and provides no persuasive argument against the Solicitor\u2019s suggested course of action. Thus, finding no \u201crare circumstances\u201d to be present in this case, we decline to address the examiner\u2019s rejection on the merits and, instead, follow the \u201cproper course\u201d and remand claims 3-66 to the Board \u201cfor additional investigation [and] explanation.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1011-10\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-11\">Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1008-8\">. While Reuning only identified claim 1 in the \"Summary of the Invention,\u201d the applicable regulation at that time required the Summary of the Invention to contain \"[a] concise explanation of the invention defined <em>in the claims involved in the appeal ....\" </em>37 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.192(c)(5) (2004) (emphasis added). Thus, Reuning's failure to identify other independent claims in this section of the appeal brief would seem to suggest that those other claims are not \"involved in the appeal.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1009-6\">. The regulations in effect when Reuning filed the appeal brief provided that \u201cthe Board shall select a single claim from [each] group and shall decide the appeal as to the ground of rejection on the basis of that claim alone.\u201d 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.192(c)(7) (2004). Contrary to this regulation, the Board reversed the rejection of claim 1 (and its dependent claim\u2014 claim 2), but, without explanation, sustained the rejection of the remaining claims in Group I (i.e., claims 3-25, 33-58, and 66).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1011-7\">. The Solicitor\u2019s pending motion to remand (renewed in the Appellee's Brief) is rendered moot by our decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1011-12\">LINN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A_Z\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-13\">I am pleased to join the opinion of the court. I write separately to express my disappointment over the delays experienced in this case and my concern that the circumstances that led up to this appeal may be more symptomatic of certain failures of the patent system than merely reflective of the peculiar facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-14\">Reuning filed the '024 application nearly seven years ago, on July 24, 2001. Reuning successfully petitioned to make special, and the application proceeded through a typical first office action and response, ultimately resulting in a final rejection on December 30, 2003. On January 26, 2004, Reuning filed an appeal from the final rejection with the Board. On November 30, 2006 \u2014 almost three years later \u2014 the Board issued the decision that is now on appeal. As the majority observes, the Board\u2019s decision is cursory, with the entire text of the \u201copinion\u201d spelled out in only two pages. In a single sentence, the Board disposed of claims 3-66 on procedural grounds, finding that Reuning \u201cha[d] not presented any patentability arguments for th[o]se claims.\u201d <em>In re Reuning, </em>No.2006-0580, slip. op. at 4 (B.P.A.I. Nov. 30, 2006). Reuning duly filed a request for rehearing, disputing that he did not present arguments and evidence in support of the claims in question. On June 25, 2007, the Board denied Reuning\u2019s request for rehearing, steadfastly reiterating that Reuning had failed to advance patentabili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>ty arguments for claims 3-66. <em>In re Reuning, </em>No.2006-0580, slip. op. at 2 (B.P.A.I. June 25, 2007) (\u201c[Reuning] never explained how the limitations of the noted claims are patentable over the combined teachings of the applied references.\u201d). Reuning timely appealed the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">Following Reuning\u2019s appeal, the Director of the PTO (\u201cthe Director\u201d) moved to remand. The Director argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1012-5\">Since this appeal has been filed, the Board has further considered its decision to sustain the rejection of claims 3-66 on purely procedural grounds. The Board has informed the Solicitor that if this Court remands this appeal to the Board, the Board will withdraw its Initial Decision and will consider the substantive arguments raised by Reuning in his brief filed with the Board.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1012-6\">Resp\u2019t\u2019s App. at 19. The motions panel denied the motion and instructed the Director to address the issue to the merits panel. Subsequently, before the merits panel, the Director renewed the motion and argued primarily that the case should be remanded. Resp\u2019t\u2019s Br. at 1 (\u201cThe threshold issue before the Court is whether this appeal should be remanded to the Board for consideration of the merits of the examiner\u2019s rejections in the first instance. Because the Board\u2019s decision does not include a specific review of the merits of the examiner\u2019s rejections of the appealed claims, the USPTO again moves that this appeal be remanded to the Board.\u201d). We heard oral argument, and today \u2014 not surprisingly \u2014 we remand so that the merits of the rejection of claims 3-66 finally can be addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-7\">After twice denying Reuning a substantive review of claims 3-66 \u2014 and taking over three years in the process \u2014 the Board, via the Director, now requests that we remand so that the Board can do what it should have done in the first place; namely, substantively review the examiner\u2019s rejection of claims 3-66. By taking nearly three years to decline to adjudicate the merits of claims 3-66 on a procedural technicality, and by forcing Reuning to appeal before recognizing the superficial nature of its actions, the Board squandered judicial resources and needlessly frustrated Reuning\u2019s interests. This is not a reflection of the Board\u2019s finest work.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-9\">Although I assign the lion\u2019s share of the blame to the Board for this case\u2019s current posture, I wish to make clear that Reuning also is not without fault. He compounded the problem, and in a sense, invited the Board\u2019s error, by unduly focusing on claim 1 in his appeal briefs and relying on happenstance for the Board to fill in the gaps. Although not technically improper, Reuning\u2019s appeal brief to the Board was less than comprehensive and demonstrates the adverse consequences that may flow from arguments that are in some measure left to inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-10\">The end result is that as to claims 3-66, the parties are now back to where they started, albeit without the time and money it took them to get there. This wasteful course of proceedings does not promote the fair and efficient administration of justice and is inconsistent with the PTO\u2019s mission \u201cto ensure that the intellectual property system contributes to a strong global economy, encourages investment in innovation, and fosters entrepreneurial spirit.\u201d United States Patent <em>&amp; </em>Trademark Office, Introduction, http://www. uspto.gov/web/menu/intro.html (last visited Apr. 21, 2008). I have the utmost respect for the members of the Board, the leadership of the PTO, and the members of the patent bar, and while I would like to believe that this case represents an aberration from the standards of practice I have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>long admired and have come to expect, I am concerned that it does not.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
