He received an enhanced sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(e) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2007). Pressley timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-25\">Pressley asserts that the ACCA enhancement violated his Sixth Amendment rights because his prior convictions, upon which the court based the enhancement, were not submitted to a jury, proved beyond a reasonable doubt, or admitted by him. However, as Pressley recognizes, this court rejected the same argument in <em>United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349, 352-54 (4th Cir.2005); <em>see also United States v. Thompson, </em>421 F.3d 278, 283 (4th Cir. 2005). A panel of this court may not overrule a prior published decision of the court. <em>United States v. Ruhe, </em>191 F.3d 376, 388 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-26\">Accordingly, we affirm Pressley\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>fore the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
