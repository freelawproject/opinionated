We will deny the petition because substantial evidence in the record supports the Id\u2019s adverse credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-17\">I. <em>Background and Procedural History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b279-18\">Poghosyan is a native of Armenia. The crux of his asylum, withholding, and Convention Against Torture claims is that he was persecuted because of his imputed political opinion, namely his perceived affiliation with former Minister of Internal Affairs and Mayor of Yerevan, Vano Syryaderyan, and accordingly with former President Ter-Petrossian\u2019s policies toward the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region. Poghosyan argues that, because of his imputed political opinion, he suffered beatings and harassment and twice failed the police exam. He claims that he stopped working at the Ministry of Internal Affairs and hid at a family vacation home because he feared he would be lulled.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-19\">Poghosyan submitted documentation in support of his claim, including hospital records, a letter from a psychologist in Armenia, and an article from a publication entitled <em>Ashtanak. </em>The <em>Ashtanak </em>article accused Poghosyan specifically of being a \u201ctrue embodiment! ] of the terror years\u201d and \u201cstill practicing] the same cruel and unjust methods as [under Ter-Petrossian].\u201d An in-country consular investigation determined that because <em>Ashtanak </em>purported to be the \u201cCity\u2019s Independent Newspaper,\u201d \u201cRegistration Number 1165,\u201d the consulate would expect <em>Ashtanak </em>to be published by the only publishing house in Yerevan at which all newspapers are reg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>istered and printed and which is the only facility with the capacity to print a paper for mass distribution. However, <em>Ashtanak </em>was not registered, and the printing-house manager had never heard of it. The hospital records were examined by the Forensic Document Laboratory, which could not authenticate them.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">The Immigration Judge denied Poghosyan\u2019s claims. She found that Poghosyan was not credible because 1) he submitted a \u201cfake\u201d newspaper article, 2) there were inconsistencies between his testimony and his own documents (including with respect to when he stopped working and when he sought psychological treatment), 8) he failed to provide corroborating documents, such as medical reports, and 4) he failed to call a witness (his mother) who lived in Philadelphia to corroborate his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision and order, finding no clear error in the adverse credibility finding. The BIA concluded that the IJ identified a number of discrepancies between Poghosyan\u2019s submitted evidence, application for relief, and testimony, which were central to his claim and which Poghosyan had failed to explain convincingly. The BIA stated in particular that 1) the record was equivocal as to when Poghosyan worked for the Ministry of Internal Affairs and when he left his position, 2) the IJ reasonably determined that the integrity of Poghosyan\u2019s claim was compromised because the consular report indicated that the <em>Ashtanak </em>article was not what it purported to be, and 8) the IJ noted the \u201cincongruous nature\u201d of Poghosyan\u2019s claim that he was threatened and mistreated but was apparently also promoted after his</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">\u201cimputed political enemy rose to power.\u201d Poghosyan petitioned for review of the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">II. <em>Jurisdiction and Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">We have jurisdiction over Poghosyan\u2019s appeal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1). Where, as here, the BIA defers to the decision of an IJ, we must review the IJ\u2019s decision \u201cto assess whether the BIA\u2019s decision to defer was appropriate.\u201d <em>Abdulai v. Ashcroft, </em>239 F.3d 542, 549 n. 2 (3d Cir. 2001). Adverse credibility determinations are reviewed for substantial evidence and are upheld if they are \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Gao v. Ashcroft, </em>299 F.3d 266, 272 (3d Cir.2002). We must uphold an adverse credibility determination \u201cunless \u2018any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">An asylum applicant need not provide evidence corroborating his testimony unless it would be \u201creasonable\u201d to expect him to do so. <em>Zheng v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 379, 382 (3d Cir.2005) (citing <em>Abdulai v. Ashcroft, </em>239 F.3d at 551). However, \u201c \u2018if it would be reasonable to expect corroboration, then an applicant who neither introduces such evidence nor offers a satisfactory explanation as to why he ... cannot do so may be found to have failed to meet his ... burden of proof.\u2019 \u201d <em>Zheng, </em>417 F.3d at 382 (quoting <em>Abdulai, </em>239 F.3d at 551). Under the REAL ID Act, \u201c \u2018[n]o court shall reverse a determination made by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>trier of fact with respect to the availability of corroborating evidence ... unless the court finds ... that a reasonable trier of fact is compelled to conclude that such corroborating evidence is unavailable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Zheng, </em>417 F.3d at 383 n. 2 (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">III. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">A. Poghosyan\u2019s Asylum Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">The Attorney General has the discretion to grant asylum to an alien who meets the definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b). An individual qualifies as a \u201crefugee\u201d if he is \u201cunable or unwilling\u201d to return to her country of origin \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1101(a)(42). To establish eligibility for asylum, an alien must demonstrate past persecution by substantial evidence or a well-founded fear of persecution that is both subjectively and objectively reasonable. <em>Butt v. Gonzales, </em>429 F.3d 430, 433 (3d Cir.2005). An alien seeking asylum \u201cha[s] the burden of supporting [his] asylum claim[] through credible testimony.\u201d <em>Gao, </em>299 F.3d at 272. In some cases, the alien may be required to provide documentary evidence to meet his burden of proof. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">We are satisfied that the adverse credibility determination in this case, which was affirmed by the BIA, was supported by substantial evidence. We have set out this evidence above. Moreover, in light of the shortcomings in Poghosyan\u2019s case, the IJ did not err in questioning the lack of corroboration for Poghosyan\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">B. Poghosyan\u2019s Withholding of Removal and Convention Against Torture Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">Poghosyan\u2019s claims for withholding of removal and withholding under the Convention Against Torture are based on the same evidence as his asylum claim. Our conclusion that the adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence applies with equal force to his withholding of removal and Convention Against Torture claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-11\">IV. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b281-12\">For the reasons set forth above, we will deny Poghosyan\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b280-6\">. Poghosyan argues that the IJ\u2019s findings are not entitled to deference, asserting that her analysis was either insufficient or based on an inaccurate understanding of the record. <em>See Balasubramanrim v. INS, </em>143 F.3d 157, 162 (3d Cir.1998) (\u201d[D]eference is not due where findings and conclusions are based on inferenees or presumptions that are not reasonably grounded in the record viewed as a whole.\u201d) While particular statements in the IJ's decision (rendered orally) might have been more precise, her adverse credibility finding appears to be reasonably grounded in the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
