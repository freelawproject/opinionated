His counsel has moved to withdraw, and has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing that Martinez\u2019s sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-18\">We conclude that Martinez\u2019s within-Guidelines-range sentence is not unreasonable, because nothing in the record indicates the court overlooked a relevant factor, gave significant weight to an improper factor, or made a clear error of judgment in weighing appropriate factors. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-68, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (allowing appellate presumption of reasonableness); <em>United States v. Haack, </em>403 F.3d 997, 1003-04 (8th Cir.2005) (reasonableness factors).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-22\">After reviewing the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we grant counsel leave to withdraw, and we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b571-34\">. The Honorable Lyle E. Strom, United States District Judge for the District of Nebraska.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
