R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b731-21\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-22\">Catherine Sumardi, a native and citizen of Indonesia, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 order summarily affirming an immigration judge\u2019s (\u201cU\u201d) decision denying her application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>see Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1016 (9th Cir.2003), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-23\">The record does not compel the conclusion that Sumardi\u2019s untimely filing of her asylum application should be excused due to extraordinary circumstances. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.4(a)(5). Accordingly, we deny the petition as to her asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-24\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Sumardi did not establish that she suffered past persecution. <em>See Nagoulko, </em>333 F.3d at 1016-17. In addition, the record does not compel a finding that it is more likely than not that Sumardi will be persecuted on account of her religion or ethnicity if she return to Indonesia. <em>See Hakeem v. INS, </em>273 F.3d 812, 816-17 (9th Cir.2001); <em>see also Lolong v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 1173, 1179-81 (9th Cir.2007) (en banc). Therefore, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s denial of withholding of removal. <em>See Hakeem, </em>273 F.3d at 817.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>Substantial evidence further supports the denial of CAT relief because Sumardi did not show it is more likely than not that she will be tortured if she returns to Indonesia. <em>See Singh v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 1100, 1113 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">Lastly, we conclude that the IJ adequately considered the record evidence. <em>See Don v. Gonzales, </em>476 F.3d 738, 744 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b731-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
