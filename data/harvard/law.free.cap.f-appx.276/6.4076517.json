Crosby, </em>397 F.3d 103, 113 (2d Cir.2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and the record of prior proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">Pink contends on appeal that his prison sentence is both procedurally and substantively unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 26 (2d Cir.2006) (noting that in the wake of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), our \u201creview involves consideration not only of the sentence itself, but also of the procedures employed in arriving at the sentence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">Pink\u2019s procedural challenge advances a species of the claim that the district judge\u2019s decision in response to our <em>Crosby </em>remand, adhering to its within-Guidelines sentence, was not detailed \u201cenough to satisfy [us] that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Pink makes this argument, in part, by detaching the district court\u2019s statement of reasons following our <em>Crosby </em>remand from the more lengthy remarks made by the district court at the time of the original sentence \u2014 which was within the Guidelines, but not at the bottom of the range, indicating the district court was fully aware of its discretion to impose a lower sentence at the time of sentencing, yet decided not to exercise it.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-11\">Upon review of the record, we conclude that Pink\u2019s sentence was more than \u201cadequately explained] ... to allow for meaningful appellate review and to promote the perception of fair sentencing.\u201d <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The district court pointed to several grounds supporting its decision to maintain its sentence, not least Pink\u2019s extensive \u201cpast criminal history,\u201d which included numerous \u201ccases ... too old for calculation on the Criminal History Category\u201d and, as such, not reflected in the Guidelines range for the offense. We have stated more than once that neither \u201cspecific verbal formulations,\u201d <em>United States v. Fleming, </em>397 F.3d 95, 100 (2d Cir.2005), nor \u201crobotic incantations,\u201d <em>Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d at 30 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), are necessary to demonstrate the requisite consideration of \u00a7 3553(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This is all the more true where the sentencing judge has \u201cdecidefd] simply to apply the Guidelines to a particular case\u201d because \u201cdoing so will not necessarily require lengthy explanation.\u201d <em>See Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2468.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-14\">Pink effectively acknowledges these points, but contends that an explanation with more nuance was in order here because he was sentenced under the \u201ccareer offender\u201d provisions of the Guidelines, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, which he argues \u201care often based on fine distinctions in the offense or criminal history that become magnified in the Guidelines calculations.\u201d We need not consider now whether this holds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>true in the abstract, because we find that in the instant case, the district court\u2019s lengthy remarks at the time of the original sentence, along with its oral decision following remand, carefully engaged with the arguments presented to it and expressed a reasoned basis to reject them. When the district court imposes a Guidelines sentence, \u201cit may not need to offer a lengthy explanation.\u201d <em>Villafuerte, </em>502 F.3d at 211; <em>see also Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d at 34 (concluding that \u201cthe sentencing judge need not address on the record ... each argument that a defendant makes with reference to [\u00a7 3553(a)], in order to comply with her obligation to consider [those] factors\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">Alternatively, Pink argues that a remand is necessary because his two prior violent felony offenses should be deemed \u201crelated\u201d offenses under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2, in which case he would not be a \u201ccareer offender.\u201d His brief concedes, however, that this is not an open issue under our precedents, which \u201cclearly establish that we do not consider cases to have been consolidated (functionally or otherwise) for sentencing simply because a defendant received concurrent sentences that were imposed on the same day.\u201d <em>United States v. Mapp, </em>170 F.3d 328, 338 (2d Cir.1999); <em>see also United States v. Keller, </em>58 F.3d 884, 895 (2d Cir.1995) (\u201cSimply because the same court imposes concurrent sentences at the same time does not establish that two or more otherwise unrelated cases were \u2018consolidated for sentencing,\u2019 and therefore \u2018related.\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted). We see no basis on these facts to reconsider our case law in this area, even if we were willing to look past the defendant\u2019s failure to press this issue below.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">Finally, Pink argues that even assuming it was procedurally sound, his 168-month prison sentence was simply too long to be reasonable. We review the substantive \u201creasonableness\u201d of sentences under an abuse-of-discretion standard, ever mindful of the Supreme Court\u2019s repeated admonition that the \u201c\u2018sentencing judge has access to, and greater familiarity with, the individual case and the individual defendant before him than ... [an] appeals court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597-98 (quoting <em>Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2469); <em>see also United States v. Williams, </em>475 F.3d 468, 474 (2d Cir.2007) (applying the same standard reviewing a decision after a <em>Crosby </em>remand). The question now before us, in other words, is not whether we would have imposed the identical sentence, but whether the sentence actually imposed was \u201creasonable\u201d given the totality of the circumstances. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597-98. Although the \u201clength of a sentence can exceed the bounds of \u2018reasonableness,\u2019 we anticipate encountering such circumstances infrequently.\u201d <em>Fleming, </em>397 F.3d at 100. Moreover, \u201cin the overwhelming majority of cases, a Guidelines sentence will fall comfortably within the broad range of sentences that would be reasonable in the particular circumstances.\u201d <em>Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d at 27. This is because where the sentencing \u201cjudge and [Sentencing] Commission <em>both </em>determine that the Guidelines sentence[ ] is an appropriate sentence for the case at hand, that sentence likely reflects the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2467. Given the serious nature of the instant offense (bank robbery) and the defendant\u2019s extensive criminal record, we conclude that a within-Guidelines prison sentence of 168 months was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">We have considered the appellant\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. The judgment of the district court is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b31-9\">. Pink's table of authorities does not indicate a claim based on \u00a7 3553(c), a provision that was discussed extensively in <em>Rita </em>(and not at all in his sentencing). Were we to construe his reply brief's citation to <em>Rita </em>as embracing such a claim, we would find that while \"the district court did not recite its thoughts on each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors,\u201d it provided an explanation sufficient to satisfy its requirements. <em>See United States v. Villafuerte, </em>502 F.3d 204, 212 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
