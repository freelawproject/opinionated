United States, </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). In <em>United States v. Nelson, </em>237 Fed.Appx. 819 (4th Cir. 2007), <em>vacated, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 1124, 169 L.Ed.2d 946 (2008), we affirmed Lawrence W. Nelson\u2019s 360-month sentence imposed by the district court after a jury convicted Nelson of conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute more than fifty grams of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (2000). After reviewing Nelson\u2019s appeal in light of <em>Rita, </em>we affirm.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b356-20\">In <em>Rita, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201ca court of appeals may apply a presumption of reasonableness to a district court sentence that reflects a proper application of the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d 127 S.Ct. at 2462. The Court stressed \u201cthat the presumption ... is an <em>appellate </em>court presumption.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2465. Importantly, \u201cthe sentencing court does not enjoy the benefit of a legal presumption that the Guidelines sentence should apply.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b356-21\">In sentencing a defendant after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a district court must engage in a multi-step process. First, the court must correctly calculate the appropriate advisory guidelines range. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) (citing <em>Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2465). The court then must consider that range in conjunc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>tion with the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2007). <em>Id. </em>The court \u201cmay not presume that the Guidelines range is reasonable\u201d but, rather, \u201cmust make an individualized assessment based on the facts presented\u201d in determining an appropriate sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 596-97. The district court also must \u201cadequately explain the chosen sentence to allow for meaningful appellate review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Appellate review of a district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence is for abuse of discretion. <em>Id.; see also United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473 (4th Cir.2007). The appellate court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-6\">must first ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence\u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range. Assuming that the district court\u2019s sentencing decision is procedurally sound, the appellate court should then consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard. When conducting this review, the court will, of course, take into account the totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-7\"><em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">Here, Nelson asserts that the district court applied the guidelines in a mandatory fashion. He relies on the district court\u2019s statement at sentencing \u201cthat \u2018the guidelines are advisory but under the case law of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ... the Guidelines are considered presumptively reasonable.... That means that unless there\u2019s a good reason in the factors that I just reviewed with you, the Guideline sentence is the reasonable sentence ....\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">Although Nelson asserts that the district court treated the guidelines as mandatory, we find, taking the district court\u2019s comments at sentencing as a whole, the court did not do so. <em>See United States v. Go, </em>517 F.3d 216, 218-20 (4th Cir.2008). As in <em>Go, </em>the district court in Nelson\u2019s case understood that the guidelines were advisory and that it could impose a sentence outside of the guidelines range. For example, the district court considered the arguments from Nelson and his witnesses, the advisory guideline range, and the factors in \u00a7 3553(a), noting that Nelson was convicted of a crack offense, was a leader in the offense, possessed a firearm, had a significant criminal history, and had made laudable efforts at self-rehabilitation. Given the circumstances of Nelson\u2019s case, however, the district court exercised its discretion not to vary from the advisory guideline range and decided to impose a sentence at the bottom of the range. We therefore find that the district court did not procedurally err in sentencing Nelson. <em>See Go, </em>517 F.3d at 218-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-11\">Accordingly, we affirm the 360-month sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b356-12\"> In the prior appeal, Nelson also challenged his conviction on several grounds. We reinstate our prior opinion affirming his conviction. <em>See Nelson, </em>237 Fed.Appx. at 820-21.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
