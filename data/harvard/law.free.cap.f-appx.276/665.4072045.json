Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Where, as here, the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as if it were the opinion of the BIA. <em>Singh-Kaur v. INS, </em>183 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1999). We review the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility findings for substantial evidence, <em>Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1042 (9th Cir.2001), and we dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">We lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s determination that Jin\u2019s asylum application is untimely and thus statutorily ineligible for asylum, because the IJ\u2019s determination is based on Jin\u2019s failure to credibly establish her arrival date, a disputed fact. <em>Cf Ramadan v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 646, 656-657 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination because it is based upon Jin\u2019s unresponsive testimonial demeanor, <em>see Singh-Kaur, </em>183 F.3d at 1151, and Jin\u2019s failure to establish that she was a Christian, a finding that goes to the heart of Jin\u2019s claim that she was persecuted for practicing Christianity. <em>See Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 1139, 1143 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">Because the record does not compel the conclusion that Jin\u2019s testimony was credible, she has not established eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-11\">Jin\u2019s CAT claim also fails because she did not show that it is more likely than not she will be tortured if removed to China. <em>See Kumar v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 1043, 1055-56 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part, DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b690-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
