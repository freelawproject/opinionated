He appeals both his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">Briseno maintains the district court erred by imposing a 16-level, crime-of-violence increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii), based on his prior Texas conviction for burglary of a habitation. Although <em>post-Booker, </em>the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory only, and an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the guideline-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, its application of the guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-13\">Briseno asserts the definition of habitation under Texas law is broader than the generic, contemporary meaning of dwelling as used in the enumerated offense of burglary of a dwelling in the Sentencing Guidelines. Although he acknowledges this court\u2019s precedent to the contrary, Briseno asserts it has been overruled by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>James v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 1599-1600, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007). This contention is without merit; <em>James </em>did not involve an enumerated offense. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Guerra, </em>485 F.3d 301, 303 &amp; n. 1 (5th Cir.2007). As a result, the district court did not err in determining that Briseno\u2019s prior conviction was a crime of violence. <em>See United States v. Valdez-Maltos, </em>443 F.3d 910, 911 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 265, 166 L.Ed.2d 205 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-22\">In the light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Briseno challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors, rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 872, 169 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b393-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
