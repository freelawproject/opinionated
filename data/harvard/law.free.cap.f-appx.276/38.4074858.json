Horn, denying his applications for asylum, with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>holding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture. <em>In re Ling Xiao Zheng, </em>No. A95 687 582 (B.I.A. Aug. 22, 2006) <em>aff'g </em>No. A95 687 582 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City May 10, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">When, as here, the BIA affirms the IJ\u2019s decision in all respects but one, this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as modified by the BIA decision, in other words, \u201cminus the single argument for denying relief that was rejected by the BIA.\u201d <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude the contrary.\u201d <em>See Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 n. 7 (2d Cir.2004). A determination \u201cbased on flawed reasoning,\u201d however, \u201cwill not satisfy the substantial evidence standard,\u201d and the agency\u2019s use of \u201can inappropriately stringent standard when evaluating an applicant\u2019s testimony constitutes <em>legal, </em>not factual error.\u201d <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 400 (2d Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Id. </em>at 406.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">We conclude that a reasonable fact-finder would not be compelled to reverse the agency\u2019s decision in this case. Regarding past persecution, Zheng admitted that the Chinese government never arrested, detained, or mistreated him. And his claim that he experienced mental anguish and economic harm rising to the level of persecution finds no support in the record. As for his claim of a well-founded fear of future persecution, it is based entirely on his belief that the police in China are still looking for him and will punish him for an imputed Falun Gong affiliation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As the BIA noted, however, the evidence in the record casts doubt on Zheng\u2019s assertion that Chinese authorities continued looking for him after he arrived in the U.S. Notably, while a letter from Zheng\u2019s mother states that policeman had once come to her house looking for Zheng, it does not indicate any <em>ongoing </em>inquiry into Zheng\u2019s whereabouts. Further, as the IJ observed, Zheng was able to leave China, using his own passport, without incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b63-7\">. We note that Zheng does not claim to be a Falun Gong practitioner.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
