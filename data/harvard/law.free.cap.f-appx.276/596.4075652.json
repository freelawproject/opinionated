Restani, Chief Judge, United States Court of International Trade, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b621-19\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>***</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-20\">In September 2001, the University of Nevada Las Vegas (\u201cUNLV\u201d) Police Department referred allegations to the Nevada Attorney General\u2019s Office (\u201cAG\u201d) that Officer William Mason, Sr., and Sergeant Brian Dias (\u201cAppellants\u201d) had falsified police logbook time entries during their employment at UNLV. The AG conducted an investigation and charged Appellants under Nev.Rev.Stat. 197.160 (West 2001) with presenting false claims to a state officer.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellants\u2019 employment with the University and Community College System of Nevada (\u201cUCCSN\u201d) was terminated shortly thereafter.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>In the course of the criminal proceedings, Appellants appeared in a probable cause hearing before Justice Reed of the Justice Court of Las Vegas, who concluded that there was no question that the evidence was sufficient to establish probable cause and referred the charges to state district court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Hr\u2019g Tr. at 165:11-12, 168:12-13, <em>State v. Dias, </em>No. 02F09998X (Justice Ct. Las Vegas Aug. 30, 2002). After a jury found Appellants not guilty of the charges, Appellants filed suit against Appellees in Nevada court, raising claims under state law for malicious prosecution and negligent supervision and claims for malicious prosecution and other constitutional infringements under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Appellees removed the case to federal court. On June 17, 2005, Judge Hunt of the United States District Court for the District of Nevada dismissed Appellants\u2019 claims, finding that prior proceedings established that Appellees had probable cause to investigate Appellants, and that the existence of probable cause was dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">This panel previously heard the appeals of summary judgment orders granted in favor of Appellees in a related claim for wrongful termination brought by Appellants before Chief Judge Philip M. Pro of the United States District Court for the District of Nevada. <em>See Dias, </em>436 F.3d at 1125; <em>see also Mason v. Univ. &amp; Cmty. Coll. Sys. of Nev., </em>265 Fed.Appx. 585 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">\n<em>JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">The district court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343 (2000) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367 (2000). We have jurisdiction to review a final order of the district court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">We exercise <em>de novo </em>review over the district court\u2019s dismissal of Appellants\u2019 complaint under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). <em>Allwaste, Inc. v. Hecht, </em>65 F.3d 1523, 1527 (9th Cir.1995). The availability of issue preclusion is reviewed <em>de novo, </em>and the district court\u2019s application of issue preclusion is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Dias, </em>436 F.3d at 1128. A court may \u201ctake judicial notice of matters of public record outside the pleadings\u201d and consider them for purposes of a motion to dismiss. <em>Mir v. Little Co. of Many Hosp., </em>844 F.2d 646, 649 (9th Cir.1988) (quotations omitted). We are not obligated to accept as true allegations raised in the complaint that are contradicted by prior proceedings of which judicial notice is properly taken. <em>See Sprewell v. Golden State Warriors, </em>266 F.3d 979, 988 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b622-11\">I. Appellants\u2019 Malicious Prosecution Claims Are Issue Precluded</p>\n<p id=\"b622-12\">In order to succeed on a claim for malicious prosecution under Nevada law or 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, plaintiff must show that defendants lacked probable cause to pursue the action in question. <em>Awabdy v. City of Adelanto, </em>368 F.3d 1062, 1066 (9th Cir.2004); <em>Jordan v. Bailey, </em>113 Nev. 1038, 944 P.2d 828, 834 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-13\">Taking judicial notice of prior proceedings, Judge Hunt found that Appellants\u2019 allegations of malicious prosecution were \u201cdirectly controverted\u201d by existing factual findings, and that further consideration of the element of probable cause was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>therefore precluded. <em>Mason, </em>No. CV-05-00368-RLH, slip op. at 11-12. Although Judge Hunt referred in part to the findings of a Nevada State Department of Personnel administrator, which we found insufficient to preclude further litigation in <em>Dias, </em>436 F.3d at 1133,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we find that Justice Reed\u2019s determination is sufficient to establish that Appellees had probable cause to investigate. <em>See Haupt v. Dillard, </em>17 F.3d 285, 289-90 (9th Cir.1994) (holding that a Nevada court\u2019s finding of probable cause is prima facie evidence of probable cause in a subsequent claim for malicious prosecution).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Although prima facie evidence of probable cause may be rebutted by showing that \u201cthe criminal prosecution was induced by fraud, corruption, perjury, fabricated evidence, or ... bad faith,\u201d <em>Awabdy, </em>368 F.3d at 1067, or that the defendant chose not to fully contest the issue of probable cause at the preliminary hearing for \u201ctactical reasons,\u201d <em>Haupt, </em>17 F.3d at 289, Appellants make no such assertions in them Amended Complaint or in their brief on appeal. Because Appellants\u2019 claims require a showing that Appellees lacked probable cause to investigate, it is clear that Appellants can prove no set of facts that would entitle them to relief. Accordingly, Judge Hunt properly dismissed Appellants\u2019 malicious prosecution claims pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">II. Appellants\u2019 Negligent Supervision Claims Are Issue Precluded</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">Under Nevada law, a claim for negligent supervision requires a showing that \u201ca third party is harmed by an employee and ... had an employer exercised reasonable care in training or supervising an employee, the injury would not have occurred.\u201d <em>Jespersen v. Harrah\u2019s Operating Co., </em>280 F.Supp.2d 1189, 1195 (D.Nev.2002), aff<em>'d, </em>444 F.3d 1104 (9th Cir.2006) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">Appellants\u2019 claim for negligent supervision alleges a failure to supervise in the investigation and prosecution of Appellants, resulting in the alleged harms of \u201cnegligent[ ], wilful[ ], careless! ] and reckless!] termination]\u201d of Appellants\u2019 employment and \u201cwrongful prosecution ... without cause, reason or foundation.\u201d (Am. Compl. HIT 21 \u2014 22.) In <em>Mason, </em>265 Fed.Appx. 585, we affirmed Chief Judge Pro\u2019s determination that there was no evidence supporting Appellants\u2019 claims of negligent supervision and wrongful termination against UCCSN. <em>Id. </em>at 588-90. In addition, Justice Reed\u2019s factual finding that Appellees had probable cause to investigate and charge Appellants precludes further claims that the investigation caused the alleged harm of wrongful prosecution. Accordingly, we find that the district court properly dismissed Appellants\u2019 negligent supervision claims on the basis of issue preclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-11\">III. Appellants\u2019 Other Constitutional Claims Were Properly Dismissed</p>\n<p id=\"b623-12\">Finally, Appellants allege violations of their due process and Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth amendment rights based on the investigation and criminal charges filed against them \u201cwithout foundation or probable cause\u201d and the \u201cwrongful termination of their employment.\u201d (Am. Compl. HH 12, 9.) Because we find that further consideration of probable cause is precluded by Justice Reed\u2019s findings, and further consideration of Appellants\u2019 wrongful termination allegations is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>precluded by prior determinations of Chief Judge Pro, we conclude that Appellants\u2019 additional constitutional claims are also without basis and were properly dismissed by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">In accordance with the reasoning above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b621-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b621-21\">. Under Nev.Rev.Stat. 228.175(2) (2000), the AG is responsible for investigating allegations of wrongdoing by public officers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b621-22\">. The facts relevant to Appellants\u2019 dismissal and subsequent wrongful termination lawsuit are set forth in our prior opinion, <em>Dias v.

In the hearing, all parties were represented by counsel, called witnesses and had the opportunity for cross-examination. There is no indication that appellants appealed the Justice's findings. <em>See Mason v. State of Nevada, </em>No. CV-05-0368-RLH, slip op. at 4 (D. Nev.
