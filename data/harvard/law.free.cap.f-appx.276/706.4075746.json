We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. <em>Fenandez-Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>468 F.3d 1159, 1163 (9th Cir.2006). Reviewing for abuse of discretion, <em>Socop-Gonzalez v.

As counsel did not withdraw from representing Soto-Gonzalez before or during his October 8, 2002 hearing, the notice provided to counsel of that hearing was adequate to notify Soto-Gonzalez, and satisfied due process. <em>See Garcia v.
