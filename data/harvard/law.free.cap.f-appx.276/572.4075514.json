Mercado argues that his conviction falls within the so-called \u201cpetty offense\u201d exception for crimes where \u201cthe maximum penalty possible for the crime of which the alien was convicted ... did not exceed imprisonment for one year and ... the alien was not sentenced to a term of imprisonment in excess of 6 months,\u201d and therefore does not render him ineligible for cancellation of removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-23\">Mercado was convicted of third-degree sodomy, a Class C felony under Oregon law. Or. Rev. St. \u00a7 163.385. By statute, \u201c[t]he maximum term of an indeterminate sentence of imprisonment for a ... Class C felony\u201d is 5 years. Or. Rev. St. \u00a7 161.605. Nevertheless, Mercado argues that to determine the maximum penalty possible for his crime we should, instead, look to the maximum sentence that he could have received under the Oregon Sentencing Guidelines, which he contends is 180 days, in light of his criminal history and the facts found in his case. Our precedent forecloses this argument. <em>See United States v. Parry, </em>479 F.3d 722, 726 (9th Cir.2007) (\u201c[F]or purposes of prosecution under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(l)[] the maxi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>mum sentence is the statutory maximum sentence for the offense [as supplied by Or. Rev. St. \u00a7 161.605], not the maximum sentence available in the particular case under the sentencing guidelines.\u201d) (quoting <em>United States v. Murillo, </em>422 F.3d 1152, 1154 (9th Cir.2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b596-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
