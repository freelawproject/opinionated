Anspach v. City of Philadelphia, </em>503 F.3d 256, 260 (3d Cir.2007). Grabiak was once employed as a municipal police officer. He enlisted in the Pennsylvania State Police Academy on November 3, 2003. On April <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>23, 2004, Grabiak was promoted to trooper and assigned to serve a one year probationary period. On his first day of this assignment, a sergeant told Grabiak and another new trooper with municipal police experience that he believed that such experience \u201cwas, and would be, a hindrance to success as a PSP trooper.\u201d App. at 22 If 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">Grabiak contends that he thereafter received unequal work assignments and was harassed by his direct supervisor, but he \u201csuccessfully responded to many more calls than other probationary troopers.\u201d App. at 22 1\u00cd16. He received a negative performance evaluation, but did not challenge it after his supervisor told him that \u201che would be placing, and tightening, a noose around his neck if he did so.\u201d App. at 22 1114. Grabiak received other \u201cborderline\u201d evaluations but his final evaluation during the probationary period was satisfactory. App. at 22 If 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">The general investigative report compiled toward the end of Grabiak\u2019s probationary period was \u201clargely favorable,\u201d with seventeen PSP personnel recommending Grabiak\u2019s retention and two others (a lieutenant and a sergeant) opposing it. App. at 22 1118. Captain Steven McDaniel, the commanding officer, directed that Grabiak be terminated, and Grabiak received notice of termination by a letter dated April 7, 2005. Grabiak believes that he and the other probationary trooper with municipal police experience were the only probationary troopers terminated from their troop.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Grabiak filed a complaint against the Pennsylvania State Police and three individual defendants, alleging that the termination violated his First and Fourteenth Amendment rights, as well as his rights under state law. The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint, and the District Court granted their motion on August 14, 2006. Grabiak appeals. We exercise plenary review over a district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss. <em>Anspach, </em>503 F.3d at 260.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">Grabiak\u2019s claim that he was entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard, procedural due process rights protected by the Fourteenth Amendment, before the state could terminate him depends on whether Grabiak had a property interest in his employment. <em>See United States v. James Daniel Good Real Prop., </em>510 U.S. 43, 48-49, 114 S.Ct. 492, 126 L.Ed.2d 490 (1993). He argues that he had a protected property interest in employment as a Pennsylvania state trooper. Property interests are not defined by the Constitution but by state law. <em>Bd. of Regents v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 577, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972). We therefore look to Pennsylvania law.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">Employment in Pennsylvania, including government employment, is generally at-will unless otherwise provided by contract or statute. <em>Pipkin v. Pa. State Police, </em>548 Pa. 1, 693 A.2d 190, 191 (Pa. 1997) (explaining at-will employment to mean that employees \u201cmay be terminated at any time, for any reason or for no reason\u201d) (citation and internal quotations omitted). In <em>Pipkin, </em>the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that a state trooper on probationary status does not have a property right in continued employment. <em>Id. </em>at 194.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-11\">The relevant statute, \u00a7 205(f) of the Administrative Code, codified at 71 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 65(f), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-12\">All new cadets and troopers shall serve a probationary period of eighteen months from date of original enlistment, during which time they may be dismissed by the Commissioner for viola<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>tions of rules and regulations, incompetency, and inefficiency without action of a court martial board or the right of appeal to a civil court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">In <em>Pipkin, </em>the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that the Pennsylvania legislature did not intend to provide a trooper on probation with the expectation of continued employment and concluded that \u201c[i]f no review of the decision to discharge an employee is permitted, then there is an indication that the decision to discharge has been committed to the discretion of the employer.... \u201d 693 A.2d at 193. The court contrasted \u00a7 205(f) with \u00a7 205(e), codified at 71 Pa. Cons.Stat. \u00a7 65(e), which applies to non-probationary troopers and requires court martial board action at the recommendation of the Governor and Pennsylvania State Police Commissioner prior to dismissal or reduction in rank. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, the Court concluded that probationary troopers do not have a protected property interest in continued employment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Even before <em>Pipkin, </em>this court held that \u201c\u00a7 205(f) was intended not to confer rights on probationary troopers, but rather to make it clear that probationary troopers were not to have the expectation of continued employment that non-probationary troopers enjoy.\u201d <em>Blanding v. Pa. State Police, </em>12 F.3d 1303, 1307 (3d Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">Grabiak seeks to distinguish his case from others that have upheld dismissal of probationary troopers because he claims that he did not violate any rules or regulations or perform incompetently or inefficiently, as specified by \u00a7 205(f). The Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court has held that \u00a7 205(f) \u201cdoes not limit the grounds upon which a cadet can be dismissed. Rather, the reasons stated are only grounds upon which a cadet <em>may </em>be dismissed.\u201d <em>Graham v. Pa. State Police, </em>160 Pa.Cmwlth. 377, 634 A.2d 849, 851 (1993) (emphasis in original); <em>see also Gehring v. Pa. Labor Relations Bd., </em>850 A.2d 805, 809 (2004) (stating that \u00a7 205(f) is a specific grant of discretion to the Commissioner to dismiss probationary troopers). We are bound by Pennsylvania law and conclude that Grabiak did not have a property interest in continued employment as a state trooper. It follows that the District Court did not err in dismissing Grabiak\u2019s procedural due process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">Grabiak also claims that his substantive due process right was violated because \u201cthe government deliberately and arbitrarily abused its power.\u201d <em>Nicholas v. Pa. State Univ., </em>227 F.3d 133, 139 (3d Cir.2000) (citations and internal quotations omitted). According to substantive due process rights, a protected interest may not be taken away by state action that \u201cshocks the conscience.\u201d <em>United Artists Theatre Circuit, Inc. v. Twp. of Warring-ton, </em>316 F.3d 392, 399-400 (3d Cir.2003). As a threshold matter, a plaintiff must demonstrate that he possessed an interest protected by the due process clause. <em>Nicholas, </em>227 F.3d at 139-40. We have already concluded that Grabiak\u2019s probationary employment was not subject to procedural due process protections. Even if we had concluded otherwise, Grabiak would still have to demonstrate that his property interest is \u201cfundamental\u201d under the United States Constitution. <em>Id. </em>at 140. This, however, is foreclosed by our decision in <em>Nicholas, </em>where we held that a tenured faculty member of a state-affiliated university did not have a fundamental property interest in his employment and was therefore not entitled to substantive due process protection. <em>Id. </em>at 142. Because Grabiak was a probationary, rather than a permanent or tenured, state em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>ployee, his termination did not violate his substantive due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Finally, Grabiak claims that his prior employment as a municipal police officer was expressive association protected by the First Amendment. The Supreme Court \u201c \u2018has recognized a right to associate for the purpose of engaging in those activities protected by the First Amendment \u2014 speech, assembly, petition for the redress of grievances, and the exercise of religion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pi Lambda Phi Fraternity, Inc. v. Univ. of Pittsburgh, </em>229 F.3d 435, 441 (3d Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Roberts v. U.S. Jaycees, </em>468 U.S. 609, 618, 104 S.Ct. 3244, 82 L.Ed.2d 462 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Grabiak contends that he has a First Amendment right to be employed as a municipal police officer and to associate with other officers without future discrimination based on this employment. Grabiak has provided no authority that the First Amendment precludes a current employer from considering prior employment in deciding whether to retain an at-will employee. We cannot disagree with the District Court that it would be a \u201cgiant leap\u201d to extend Grabiak\u2019s First Amendment associational right to his prior police employment. App. at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">For the above reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s order dismissing Grabiak\u2019s complaint.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
