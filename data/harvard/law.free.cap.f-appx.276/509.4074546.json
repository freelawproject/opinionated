The facts underlying the cocaine charge are set out in a separate opinion. <em>See United States v. Soto-Piedra, </em>525 F.3d 527 (7th Cir.2008). As for the methamphetamine charge, Camarena\u2019s role in that conspiracy ended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>when police in Indianapolis, Indiana, stopped his car and found 262 grams of methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">Camarena was sentenced in both eases in December 2006. In the methamphetamine case the parties stipulated to a base offense level of 34 and a recommendation for a prison sentence at the bottom of the guidelines range. But Camarena did not have a plea agreement in the cocaine case. The probation officer calculated Camarena\u2019s total offense level for the combined cases as 40, which included a base offense level of 38 (after converting both the cocaine and methamphetamine to the equivalent of 311,048 kilograms of marijuana). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l). The probation officer added four levels for Camarena\u2019s role as a leader or organizer, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3Bl.l(a), and subtracted two levels for acceptance of responsibility, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3E1.1. The resulting imprisonment range was 292 to 365 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">At sentencing Camarena acknowledged that he had reviewed the presentence report with his attorney, who is fluent in Spanish. Camarena told the district court that he did not dispute the probation officer\u2019s guidelines calculations and had nothing he wanted to bring to the court\u2019s attention. Counsel then focused his allocution on Camarena\u2019s wasted life and remorse. The district court sentenced Camarena to 292 months\u2019 imprisonment in each case, the terms to run concurrently. The court imposed these sentences after considering the factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), including the nature and circumstances of the offense, Camarena\u2019s history and characteristics, the need to promote respect for the law, and the need to provide just punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Camarena has appealed both judgments, but his appointed lawyer is unable to discern a nonfrivolous basis for either appeal and moves to withdraw. <em>See Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Camarena has not accepted our invitation to comment on counsel\u2019s submission. <em>See </em>Cir. R. 51(b). Our review is limited to the potential issues identified in counsel\u2019s facially adequate brief. <em>See United States v. Schuh, </em>289 F.3d 968, 973-74 (7th Cir.2002). Because both of the potential issues counsel identifies would be frivolous, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and dismiss Camarena\u2019s appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">Counsel first considers whether Camarena could challenge the drug quantity used in assigning his base offense level since, according to counsel, the district court failed to make an explicit finding about the amount of cocaine for which Camarena was responsible. Counsel correctly notes, however, that Camarena waived this potential argument by expressly declining to challenge the probation officer\u2019s calculations when the sentencing court invited objections. \u201c \u2018Waiver occurs when a eiiminal defendant intentionally relinquishes a known right.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Brodie, </em>507 F.3d 527, 530 (7th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>United States v. Haddad, </em>462 F.3d 783, 793 (7th Cir.2006)). And even if Camarena had objected, it would not have helped him. The probation officer calculated a conversion in the presentence report that the district court adopted. We have noted many times that when a district court adopts a presentence report it discharges its obligation to make factual findings. <em>United States v. Brumfield, </em>301 F.3d 724, 735 (7th Cir.2002) (collecting cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">The only other possible argument identified by counsel is whether Camarena\u2019s prison sentences are unreasonable in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Camarena was sentenced at the bottom of the guidelines range in both cases. We review sentences for reasonableness, <em>see United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number><em>Dale, </em>498 F.3d 604, 608 (7th Cir.2007), and will presume that any sentence within a properly calculated guidelines range is reasonable. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Mykytiuk, </em>415 F.3d 606, 608 (7th Cir.2005). Here, the guidelines range was properly calculated, and counsel is unable to identify anything in this ease that might rebut that presumption. Therefore any potential challenge to the reasonableness of the sentences would be frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">We therefore GRANT counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and DISMISS Camarena\u2019s appeals.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
