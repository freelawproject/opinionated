He appeals the district court\u2019s <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> judgment denying his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition. The issue is whether the Iowa Court of Appeals rendered a decision that was not contrary to, or involved no unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) (concerning habeas claims adjudicated in state court); Iowa Code Ann. \u00a7 702.18 (West 2003) (defining serious injury); <em>Jeffery v. Iowa, </em>No. 04-0351, 2005 WL 67591, at *1-2 (Iowa Ct. App. Jan. 13, 2005) (affirming denial of petition for postconviction relief); <em>Morales v. Ault, </em>476 F.3d 545, 549-50 &amp; n. 3 (8th Cir.) (when state prisoner files federal habeas petition, court of appeals, like district court, undertakes limited and deferential review of state court decisions adjudicating his claims; to establish ineffective assistance, movant must demonstrate that his attorney\u2019s performance was deficient and that he suffered prejudice as result), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 177, 169 L.Ed.2d 120 (2007); <em>Rodriguez v. United States, </em>17 F.3d 225, 226 (8th Cir.1994) (per curiam) (counsel not ineffective for failing to raise meritless challenge).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">Because Jeffery has not made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2), we decline to expand the certificate of appeal-ability granted by the district court to include Jeffery\u2019s pro se arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-14\">We affirm the judgment of the district court. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B. Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is granted, and Jeffery\u2019s motion to appoint new counsel is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b553-11\">. The Honorable Ronald E.
