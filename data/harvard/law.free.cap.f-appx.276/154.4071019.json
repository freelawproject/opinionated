In the Complaint, they alleged violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78\u00a1j(b), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated under the Act, 17 CFR \u00a7 240.10b-5, by defendants, Discovery Laboratories, Inc. (\u201cDiscovery\u201d), Robert Capetola, President and Chief Executive Officer of Discovery, and Christopher Schaber, former Chief Operating Officer of Discovery. The District Court considered the claims in the Complaint in a lengthy opinion and ultimately dismissed each claim for failure to sufficiently plead materiality and/or scienter under the heightened pleading standards of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. The plaintiffs appeal the dismissal of the majority of their claims, but have abandoned or waived others.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">We find the District Court\u2019s opinion well-reasoned and do not find that any of the issues before us constitutes grounds for disturbing or varying from its analysis. Accordingly, we will affirm the dismissal of the complaint for the reasons set forth therein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b179-11\">. In particular, we note that appellants appeal the dismissal of their allegations relating to statements made regarding the likelihood of approval by the European Medicines Evaluation Agency only on the basis of materiality. The District Court, however, dismissed those allegations based on insufficient pleading of scienter as well, and appellants do not challenge that determination on appeal. Thus, a ruling in their favor on the materiality issue would be unavailing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
