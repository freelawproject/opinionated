Paul argues that the BIA erred by: (1) adopting and affirming the Immigration Judge\u2019s finding that Paul was not credible; (2) denying Paul\u2019s applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d); and (3) denying Paul due process of law. For the following reasons, we deny Paul\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-24\">Paul is a native and citizen of Haiti. The central facts in this case \u2014 many of which are disputed \u2014 involve Paul\u2019s assertion that prior to entering the United States, she was raped in Haiti for political reasons. Because of this alleged rape, Paul claims that she fears persecution and torture should she return to Haiti.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-25\">Shortly after entering the United States, Paul filed an application for asylum and withholding of removal on September 8, 2004. Her application stated that she was seeking asylum based on her political opinion. But in response to questions 3.A. and 3.B. of the application, Paul indicated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>she had not been associated with any political organizations in Haiti.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">In an attachment to her application, Paul provided that as a high school student, she had supported President Aristide and was attacked several times during the last few days of his presidency. She also noted that \u201cthings got worse\u201d after Aristide departed and that she had to hide to avoid being raped and killed, \u201cfor that was how [those opposing Aristide\u2019s Lavalas party (\u201cthe opposition\u201d) ] were treating [Ljavalas supporters.\u201d Paul further provided that on July 18, 2004, she came out of hiding to attend church. On her way back, opposition supporters circled her and her cousin, and inquired about condoms. Paul stated that \u201cwe started to cry and I ran away from them and ended up into the house of some people I didn\u2019t even know, so they called my parents to come rescue me. But, they raped my cousin and said that they will do worse to me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">On November 23, 2004, Paul met with an asylum officer to review and amend her asylum application. The asylum officer made notations on Paul\u2019s original application and typed up her notes summarizing the interview. The asylum officer placed check marks next to answers that were consistent with Paul\u2019s original written application. Check marks appear next to questions 3.A. and 3.B., again indicating that Paul had not participated in any political organizations.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">The asylum officer also indicated inconsistencies with Paul\u2019s original written application. With regard to the incident following church, the notes provide that: \u201cHer cousin ran and got into a house asking for help and the people came and nothing happened to her.\u201d The asylum officer therefore bracketed the portion of Paul\u2019s original attached declaration indicating that her cousin had been raped, drew a line through the entire declaration, and wrote \u201ccontradicts oral testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">In the oral interview, Paul also described a previous incident apparently occurring on November 23, 2003 in which, while en route from her school to her home, Paul was approached by four men who told her to stay home and hit her. Finally, in the oral interview, Paul indicated that she had left Haiti, and did not wish to return there, because of her \u201cpolitical problems\u201d with the opposition, which \u201cwas killing people.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">Paul explained to the asylum officer that her original written application conflicted with her account during the oral interview because her application was filled out by another person and because she did \u201cnot speak or read English.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">At Paul\u2019s removal proceedings before the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d), Paul testified that she was a member and secretary of a pro-Lavalas student group supporting Aristide. She further testified that she formally joined Lavalas in March 2003 and submitted a Lavalas membership card and letter documenting her membership. Paul again described an incident in which a group of young opposition men confronted her on her way home from school and told her to stay home because school was closed, evidently as a result of Aristide\u2019s departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-11\">Paul also described the July 18, 2004 event in which she walked home from church with her cousin. Paul again noted that she and her cousin were surrounded by a group of men who asked for condoms. But Paul testified that after her cousin escaped, Paul herself was raped by two men who told her that they wanted to humiliate her so that she would not support Aristide.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-12\">On cross-examination, regarding the inconsistencies in her story, Paul explained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>that she had told officials in the asylum office that she was a Lavalas member and that she herself had been raped, but that her form had been incorrectly filled out. Her counsel also argued that her testimony was not inconsistent with the asylum officer\u2019s notation that \u201cnothing happened to <em>her </em>\u201d \u2014 which only indicated that Paul\u2019s cousin had not been raped.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Paul\u2019s sister and brother-in-law testified on Paul\u2019s behalf. Paul\u2019s sister, Mary Beausejour, indicated that she had been told by her brother that Paul had been raped, but suggested that this incident had occurred when Paul returned home from school (as opposed to church).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Paul\u2019s brother-in-law, Dominique Beausejour, testified that he was a secret assistant secretary of an organization associated with Lavalas, that he had heard from his brother-in-law that Paul had been raped, and that he had told the brother-in-law not to go to the hospital or report the rape because Paul might be killed. He also suggested that the rapes were politically motivated because Paul\u2019s political activities were well known.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">The IJ found that Paul was not credible and denied her applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Regarding Paul\u2019s credibility, the IJ found that Paul\u2019s story \u201chas varied massively from her original asylum application to her interview before the Asylum Officer, to her testimony in Court.\u201d Noting the thoroughness of the asylum officer\u2019s notes, the IJ concluded that Paul had told the officer that she did not belong to a political organization and that it \u201cis fairly clear that [Paul gave] false testimony.\u201d The IJ also explained that while the Lavalas identification card and letter may have been authentic, they might also have been procured through her brother-in-law\u2019s Lavalas connections.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-13\">With respect to the rape allegation, the IJ described the differences between Paul\u2019s original written asylum application (providing that <em>her cousin </em>was raped), her oral interview (suggesting <em>no rape </em>had occurred), and her testimony before the IJ (in which she first asserted that <em>she </em>had been raped). The IJ also rejected Paul\u2019s counsel\u2019s interpretation of the interview notes as \u201cinfring[ing] on preposterous\u201d and found that \u201cthere\u2019s no question that the Asylum Officer found, based on [Paul\u2019s testimony] that she had not been raped, and in fact, nobody was raped as a result of that incident.\u201d The IJ further noted that Paul\u2019s answers were often evasive; that her description of the rape was \u201camazingly lacking in emphasis and emotion[;]\u201d that Paul\u2019s sister conflated the two incidents that Paul had described; and that while Paul\u2019s sister described the alleged rape of Paul, both sisters were \u201csmiling rather inappropriately like they were making up a story, and they thought it was sort of humorous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-14\">Finding Paul \u201ccompletely utterly lacking in credibility,\u201d the IJ explained that \u201c[although parts of her story could be true,\u201d it would not speculate as to \u201cwhich parts they are.\u201d It also noted that while the incident involving men inquiring about condoms had been consistently portrayed, \u201cthere\u2019s no reason to believe that it had any political connection,\u201d and \u201c[t]here isn\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>any reason to believe that [Paul] was active in Lavalas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">While recognizing the general dangers in Haiti associated with a \u201clawless society,\u201d the IJ explained that \u201cnone of that implicates any of the factors for which asylum and withholding of removal can be granted.\u201d Accordingly, the IJ denied Paul\u2019s applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief and ordered her removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">The BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision. It specifically concluded that the IJ\u2019s credibility determination was not clearly erroneous, noting, <em>inter alia, </em>that Paul\u2019s allegations of rape were inconsistent, and that her original application and the oral interview notes suggested that she was not a member of Lavalas.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">Although we review the decision of the BIA, <em>Anssari-Gharachedaghy v. INS, </em>246 F.3d 512, 513 (6th Cir.2000), \u201c[w]here the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, the court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision directly to determine whether the decision of the BIA should be upheld on appeal,\u201d <em>Gilaj v. Gonzales, </em>408 F.3d 275, 282-83 (6th Cir.2005). Here, although the BIA provided additional comments explaining its conclusion that the IJ\u2019s credibility determination was not clearly erroneous, it also expressly adopted the IJ\u2019s decision. \u201cWe therefore directly review the decision of the IJ while considering the additional comment[s] made by the BIA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 283.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">We review the BIA\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo, </em>but defer to \u201cthe BIA\u2019s reasonable interpretations of the INA.\u201d <em>Patel v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 685, 692 (6th Cir.2005). The IJ\u2019s (and where applicable, the BIA\u2019s) findings of fact are \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). Thus, the IJ\u2019s determination should be upheld unless evidence \u201cnot only supports a contrary conclusion, but indeed <em>compels </em>it.\u201d <em>Ouda v. INS, </em>324 F.3d 445, 451 (6th Cir.2003) (internal citation omitted). This standard equates with the substantial evidence test. <em>Yu v. Ashcroft, </em>364 F.3d 700, 702 (6th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">Facts relevant to credibility determinations, denial of asylum applications, withholding of removal, and CAT are all reviewed under this same standard. <em>Sylla v. INS, </em>388 F.3d 924, 925 (6th Cir.2004) (credibility determinations are findings of fact reviewed under the substantial evidence standard); <em>Ouda, </em>324 F.3d at 451(applying \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) standard of review to decision denying asylum); <em>Almuhtaseb v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 743, 749 (6th Cir.2006) (applying \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) to decision on request for withholding of removal and request for CAT relief).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-12\">Paul first contends that the BIA erred in affirming and adopting the IJ\u2019s credibility determination. As discussed more fully below, this adverse credibility determination effectively caused the IJ to deny Paul\u2019s applications for asylum and withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-13\">An adverse credibility determination must be (1) \u201csupported by specific reasons,\u201d and (2) \u201cbased on issues that go to the heart of the claim.\u201d <em>Sylla, </em>388 F.3d at 926 (internal citations omitted). A discrepancy may bear on the heart of the claim if it appears to be an \u201cattempt[ ] by the applicant to enhance his claim of persecution.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Bah v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 637, 641-42 (6th Cir.2006) (upholding adverse credibility determinations where the discrepancies involved the alien\u2019s alleged involvement in a political organization and treatment by the government of Guinea).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>In this case, both the IJ and BIA provided specific reasons for their conclusions that Paul was not credible. First, both the IJ and BIA identified the inconsistencies between Paul\u2019s original asylum application, the oral interview notes, and Paul\u2019s in-court testimony regarding the alleged rape. Second, the IJ and BIA noted that Paul\u2019s in-court testimony regarding her membership in a political organization was inconsistent with both her original application and the oral interview notes. In addition, the IJ noted that Paul\u2019s evasive answers, \u201camazingly\u201d emotionless description of the rape, and her inappropriate smiling all suggested that Paul was not credible. Given that the IJ was in a unique position to observe Paul\u2019s demean- or, these additional observations are entitled to substantial deference. <em>See Toe v. Gonzales, </em>212 Fed.Appx. 467, 471 (6th Cir. 2007) (citing <em>Paramasamy v. Ashcroft, </em>295 F.3d 1047,1050 (9th Cir.2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">As discussed more fully below, the substance of these discrepancies also goes to the heart of Paul\u2019s claims. Paul\u2019s political activity and whether any such activity caused her to be persecuted are central elements of her asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Paul is correct that her sister\u2019s testimony, her identification card, and the Lavalas letter support the conclusion that she was a Lavalas member. But given Paul\u2019s initial two failures to mention her Lavalas membership this evidence hardly <em>compels </em>a conclusion that she belonged to Lavalas or that she was credible overall.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">Paul also notes the IJ\u2019s acknowledgment that \u201cthe tale about the five men asking for condoms,\u201d was consistent, and she suggests that the IJ in fact found that Paul was raped. But, as the BIA found, the IJ only noted that the story about men inquiring about condoms had been consistent; the IJ did not find that Paul had been raped. To be sure, the IJ also did not make an explicit finding that Paul had <em>not </em>been raped. Instead, the IJ explained that the Asylum Officer found, based on respondent\u2019s testimony, that Paul had not been raped. Overall, it appears that the IJ found that: Paul had not been a member of a political organization; it was doubtful whether she had been raped;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and, in any event, because she was not a member of a political organization, she was not raped for political reasons. Given the overall discrepancies in Paul\u2019s story, the evidence does not compel a conclusion contrary to any of these findings or that Paul was credible overall.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-11\">Paul also strains to argue with the IJ\u2019s interpretation of the asylum officer\u2019s notation: \u201cHer cousin ran and got into a house asking for help and the people came and nothing happened to her.\u201d The IJ concluded that this notation indicated that the asylum officer was under the impression that nobody was raped during the incident. Paul suggests that these notes only indicated that Paul\u2019s <em>cousin </em>was not raped but does not speak to whether <em>Paul </em>was raped. Paul is correct that the \u201cher\u201d could refer to Paul\u2019s cousin as a matter of grammar. But as a matter of common sense, if Paul was trying to assert that <em>she had been raped, </em>presumably the asylum officer\u2019s notes would have included some reference to this very relevant assertion. Yet neither the original asylum application nor the asylum officer\u2019s notes provide any indication that Paul was raped. Moreover, whether we accept the IJ\u2019s interpretation of the note (no one was raped) or Paul\u2019s interpretation (Paul\u2019s cousin was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>raped), both interpretations are inconsistent with the information Paul previously provided \u2014 that her cousin <em>ivas </em>raped.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Finally, Paul argues that cultural norms, post-traumatic stress, language barriers, and the adversarial nature of the hearings before a male IJ, translator, and counsel explain her demeanor before the IJ. Even if we accept this explanation, these factors do not explain Paul\u2019s failure to mention her alleged rape to the female asylum officer during their non-adversarial meeting. In any event, none of these potential explanations <em>compel </em>the conclusion that Paul was telling the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Overall, because the evidence does not compel the conclusion that Paul was credible and substantial evidence suggests that she was not credible, the BIA did not err in affirming the adverse credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">Paul next argues that the BIA erred by affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of Paul\u2019s applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">We first address the denial of Paul\u2019s applications for asylum and withholding of removal. \u201cThe IJ, acting for the Attorney General, has discretion to grant asylum to any alien who qualifies as a \u2018refugee.\u2019 \u201d <em>Yu, </em>364 F.3d at 702 (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a), (b)). A \u201crefugee\u201d is defined by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) as any alien unwilling to return to her home country \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d Thus, an IJ\u2019s asylum determination \u201cinvolves a two-step inquiry: (1) whether the applicant qualifies as a \u2018refugee\u2019 as defined in \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A), and (2) whether the applicant merits a favorable exercise of discretion by the [IJ].\u201d <em>Yu, </em>364 F.3d at 702 (quoting <em>Ouda, </em>324 F.3d at 451). The applicant bears the burden of demonstrating she is a refugee, which she can establish \u2014 without corroboration \u2014 through her own' credible testimony. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13. While an applicant could theoretically establish this burden of proof through corroboration as opposed to her own credible testimony, an adverse credibility determination is generally fatal to an application for asylum, withholding of removal, or CAT relief. <em>See Hassan v. Gonzales, </em>403 F.3d 429, 435 (6th Cir.2005); <em>see also Dieye v. Gonzales, </em>242 Fed.Appx. 282, 287 (6th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-11\">An alien is entitled to withholding of removal if her \u201clife or freedom would be threatened in that country because of the alien\u2019s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). To show this, an applicant \u201cmust demonstrate that there is a clear probability that he would be subject to persecution\u201d upon return to his home country. <em>Mikhailevitch v. INS, </em>146 F.3d 384, 391 (6th Cir. 1998). The applicant bears the burden of proving this, which she may establish\u2014 without corroboration \u2014 through her credible testimony. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b). Because this burden is higher than the burden required to demonstrate asylum eligibility, \u201can alien who fails to qualify for asylum necessarily does not qualify for withholding of removal.\u201d <em>Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>398 F.3d 396, 401 (6th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Pilica v. Ashcroft, </em>388 F.3d 941, 955 (6th Cir.2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-12\">Here, the IJ found that Paul did not meet either burden because whatever fears Paul had of returning to Haiti did not \u201cimplicate[] any of the factors for which asylum and withholding of removal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>can be granted.\u201d Based upon its adverse credibility finding, the IJ doubted whether Paul had been persecuted (by being raped), and found that even if she was raped, \u201cthere\u2019s no reason to believe it had any political connection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Paul has not shown that the evidence compelled the conclusion that she met her burden of showing that any fear of persecution was \u201con account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion,\u201d pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). Given that Paul was found to be incredible, her own testimony did not establish that she had been persecuted for political reasons or had a well-founded fear of any such persecution. As discussed above, although Paul offered some evidence to support her assertion that she was a Lavalas member and testimony corroborating her allegation of rape, the evidence does not compel a conclusion that she was raped for political reasons. Yet substantial evidence, including Paul\u2019s original application and the asylum officer\u2019s notes, support the IJ\u2019s determination that Paul did not belong to a political organization. Substantial evidence, including the original application and the asylum officer\u2019s notes (neither of which mention Paul\u2019s rape), also supports the conclusion that Paul was not persecuted. Because Paul was unable to meet her burden of establishing her eligibility for asylum, she necessarily does not qualify for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">Next we address Paul\u2019s CAT claim. An applicant seeking relief under the CAT has the burden of proving that it is more likely than not that she will be tortured if removed to the proposed country. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2); <em>Berri v. Gonzales, </em>468 F.3d 390, 397-98 (6th Cir.2006). \u201cTorture\u201d is defined in relevant part as: any act by which severe pain or suffering ... is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as ... intimidating or coercing him or her ... for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.18(a)(1). In turn \u201c \u2018acquiescence\u2019 requires that the public official have awareness of such activity and thereafter breach his legal responsibility to intervene to prevent such activity.\u201d <em>Ali v. Reno, </em>237 F.3d 591, 597 (6th Cir.2001) (quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(7)). This definition encompasses situations in which a public official has \u201cactual knowledge\u201d or is \u201cwillful[ly] blind\u201d to such activities. <em>Id.; see also Amir v. Gonzales, </em>467 F.3d 921, 927 (6th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">Here, the IJ found that \u201cwhoever these people that threatened to rape [Paul] were, they were not acting on behalf of the Haitian Government.\u201d Paul asserts, however, that the Haitian Government is unable or unwilling to control the group that raped her \u2014 evidently suggesting \u201cacquiescence.\u201d Putting aside the issue of whether Paul was raped for discriminatory reasons, Paul offered no evidence to suggest that the Haitian government had actual knowledge of these events or willfully avoided such knowledge. Paul has not shown that torture was more likely than not to occur if she returned to Haiti. Therefore the IJ and BIA did not err in denying this application.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-11\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-12\">Finally, Paul alleges that the IJ and BIA denied her due process of law by refusing to continue the hearing to obtain clarification from the asylum officer as to the meaning of her notes. Again, the asy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>him officer\u2019s notes provide: \u201c[Paul\u2019s] cousin ran and got into a house asking for help and the people came and nothing happened to her.\u201d The IJ determined that this notation conflicted with Paul\u2019s original declaration that \u201cthey raped my cousin.\u201d Paul contends that there is no conflict because the asylum officer\u2019s notation only indicates that <em>Paul\u2019s cousin </em>was not raped \u2014 not that <em>Paul </em>was not raped. Paul argues that the IJ\u2019s failure to seek clarification from the asylum officer violated her right to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">Because Paul did not make any meaningful due process argument before the BIA, however, this claim was not preserved for our review. Title 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) prevents this court from reviewing issues not raised before the BIA. <em>Ramani v. Ashcroft, </em>878 F.3d 554, 559-60 (6th Cir.2004). The \u00a7 1252(d)(1) exhaustion requirement ensures that the BIA has had ample opportunity to consider a petitioner\u2019s claims, its processes are not interfered with prematurely, and that it can compile a record for review. <em>Id. </em>at 559. Although due process challenges generally do not require exhaustion, \u201c[an] alien must raise correctable procedural errors to the BIA.\u201d <em>Sterkaj v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 273, 279 (6th Cir.2006) (requiring exhaustion where due process claim was based on BIA\u2019s review of inaccurate and incomplete record which the BIA could have cured). Exhaustion is not achieved by vague allusions and undeveloped arguments before the BIA. <em>Id. </em>(alien failed to exhaust argument that the IJ misused certain evidence where he only alluded to the unreliability of the evidence in the context of his claim that the IJ was biased).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">Paul contends that she raised her due process argument before the BIA. But Paul\u2019s brief to the BIA only argued that the IJ erred in: (1) its credibility determination; (2) denying her requests for asylum and withholding of removal; and (3) denying her CAT relief. Paul\u2019s single statement within her credibility argument that the IJ \u201ccould have continued the Hearing to clarify [the asylum officer\u2019s notes],\u201d and observation from our case law that \u201c[a]sylum applicants are entitled to the due process of law[,]\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> did not meaningfully raise a due process issue for BIA review. <em>Ramani, </em>378 F.3d at 559. Accordingly, this issue was not preserved.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">In any event, Paul\u2019s argument is essentially that the IJ abused its discretion in refusing to continue the matter. <em>See Abu-Khaliel v. Gonzales, </em>436 F.3d 627, 634 (6th Cir.2006) (noting abuse of discretion standard for IJ\u2019s denial of a continuance). To the extent that Paul preserved this claim through the same single statement in her credibility argument, the IJ did not abuse its discretion in refusing to continue the matter. The IJ explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-10\">If I thought there was the slightest bit of doubt as to what the Asylum Officer found in this case, I would continue the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>case and arrange to have her testify ... to clarify the matter, but I do not believe there is any need for clarification. It\u2019s very clear that [Paul] receded from her claim that anyone was raped.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">As the IJ noted, the asylum officer was very thorough overall. Thus, had Paul provided any indication at the oral interview that she had been raped, presumably the asylum officer\u2019s notes would have included some notation to indicate this. Given the absence of any such notation, Paul\u2019s failure to mention any such rape in her original application, and the other inconsistencies in Paul\u2019s story, we conclude that the IJ did not abuse its discretion by not seeking clarification.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we deny Paul\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b455-8\">. Paul's sister testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-9\">Q: What bad thing did they do with her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-10\">A: Things between men and women.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-11\">Q: What things between men and women?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-15\">A: When \u2014 when the men hold the women and then do bad \u2014 something bad \u2014 something really bad with her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-16\">Q: All right. And that happened when she was leaving school?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-17\">A: Yes. When she came from school.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b457-8\">. The IJ also noted that, in contrast to Paul, the asylum officer had \"no incentive whatsoever to lie.\u201d Although this does not amount to a finding that Paul was not raped, it provides further indication that the IJ seriously doubted that she had been raped.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b460-5\">. The quotation was from <em>Alexandrov v. Gonzales, </em>442 F.3d 395, 405 (6th Cir.2006), in which the court observed that \u201cexcessive deference to the government or a shallow evaluation of the evidence by the immigration court would be unwarranted.\u201d Neither of these factors are present here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b460-6\">. Even if we were to reach this issue, any such due process argument would fail. Paul does not explain how the IJ's failure to grant a continuance amounted to a deprivation of liberty, and this court has summarily rejected similar arguments. <em>See Abu-Khaliel, </em>436 F.3d at 634-35 (rejecting argument that IJ\u2019s denial of continuance amounted to due process violation); <em>Huicochea-Gomez v. INS, </em>237 F.3d 696, 700 (6th Cir.2001) (\"The failure to be granted discretionary relief does not amount to a deprivation of a liberty interest.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
