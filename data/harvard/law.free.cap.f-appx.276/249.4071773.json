For the reasons that follow, we will deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">Petitioner, a Christian and native and citizen of Indonesia, entered the United States on June 11, 2000, as a B-2 non-immigrant visitor and was authorized to remain temporarily within the United States until December 10, 2000. On June 17, 2003, Petitioner was issued a Notice to Appear, which alleged that he was in the country without authorization. In response, he applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">In denying his claims on August 11, 2005, the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) concluded that Petitioner\u2019s asylum application was untimely. The IJ further found that Petitioner had not satisfied the requirements for withholding of removal pursuant to \u00a7 241(b)(3)(A) or under the CAT. On March 16, 2007, BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision. Thereafter, Petitioner filed a timely motion for reconsideration of the BIA\u2019s decision. The BIA denied Petitioner\u2019s motion for reconsideration on May 31, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Our review is limited to the BIA\u2019s decision denying Petitioner\u2019s motion for reconsideration. <em>See Nocon v. I.N.S., </em>789 F.2d 1028, 1032-33 (3d Cir.1986) (explaining that final deportation orders and orders denying motions to reconsider are independently reviewable and a timely petition for review must be filed with respect to the specific order sought to be reviewed); <em>see also Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995) (holding that a motion for reconsideration does not toll the time to file a petition for review of a final deportation order). We review the denial of a motion for reconsideration for an abuse of discretion. <em>Nocon, </em>789 F.2d at 1033. Under the abuse of discretion standard, the BIA\u2019s decision may be reversed only if it is \u201carbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law.\u201d <em>Sevoian v. Ashcroft, </em>290 F.3d 166, 174 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">A motion for reconsideration is a \u201crequest that the Board re-examine its decision in light of additional legal arguments, a change of law, or perhaps an argument or aspect of the case which was overlooked.\u201d <em>In re Ramos, </em>23 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 336, 338 (BIA 2002). Petitioner\u2019s motion before the BIA sought reconsideration of the BIA\u2019s March 16, 2007 order, arguing that the BIA improperly relied on <em>Lie v. Ashcroft, </em>396 F.3d 530 (3d Cir.2005), failing to distinguish it from <em>In re O-Z &amp; IZ-, </em>22 I. &amp; N. Dec. 23 (BIA 1998). The BIA concluded that Petitioner failed to present any error in decision or argument that would support a different outcome. We agree. The March 16, 2007 order stated that the IJ properly analyzed Petitioner\u2019s application under <em>Lie </em>and sufficiently distinguished it from <em>In re O-Z &amp; I-Z-. </em>Petitioner\u2019s motion for reconsideration failed to present any legal argument, change of law, or aspect of the case which would require reconsideration of the BIA\u2019s March 16, 2007 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">Furthermore, contrary to Petitioner\u2019s assertion, the BIA did not engage in improper fact finding. The BIA\u2019s May 31, 2007 order clarified its earlier statement regarding Petitioner\u2019s failure to report certain incidents to the police by explaining that its March 16, 2007 order referred only to the incidents, which occurred in 1998, that were the subject of Petitioner\u2019s testimony. Additionally, based upon our review of the record, the BIA\u2019s characterization that Petitioner \u201cdid not suffer serious injury\u201d was neither arbitrary, irrational, nor contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>deny Petitioner\u2019s petition for review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b275-17\">. We note that, in his brief, Petitioner argues that the BIA failed to adequately consider certain cases cited in his original appeal before the BIA and that the BIA should have granted his motion for reconsideration in light of our decision in <em>Sukwanputra v. Gonzales, </em>434 F.3d 627 (3d Cir.2006). Petitioner, however, failed to present either issue in his motion for reconsideration before the BIA. Accordingly, we will not consider the merits of either argument. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
