ANDERSON, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b760-21\">After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-22\">Defendant and appellant Emerson Boyd Austin pled guilty, pursuant to a Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). He was sentenced to seventy-seven months\u2019 imprisonment. Austin challenges his sentence, which we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">The following facts are taken from the plea agreement and statement of facts relevant to sentencing, later incorporated into the presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d), to which neither party objected. On September 4, 2004, Austin was involved in an altercation with another individual at Sky Ute Downs in Ignacio, Colorado. When law enforcement authorities arrived, they confiscated a .22 caliber revolver from Austin. Following his arrest, Austin admitted that he had bought the revolver. A subsequent review of his criminal history revealed that he had been previously convicted in June 2001 of aggravated assault against a household member in New Mexico, as well as of burglary and larceny, both of which were punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year and are therefore felonies. Austin had also been convicted in March 2001 of auto burglary, which is punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year (another felony). He was therefore indicted on March 10, 2005, for possession of a firearm by a prohibited person \u2014 i.e., a felon.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">On April 25, 2005, Austin was arrested and charged with kidnapping, aggravated sexual assault, and sexual abuse of a minor in Arizona. Following a jury trial, Austin was found guilty of the aggravated assault and the sexual abuse charges. He was sentenced to 600 months\u2019 imprisonment for the assault charge and a concurrent term of 180 months\u2019 on the sexual abuse charge, followed by a life term of supervised release. As of the date the briefs were filed in this appeal, that case was pending on appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. <em>See United States v. Austin, </em>No. 07-10198 (9th Cir., filed Apr. 17, 2007).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b761-10\">In preparation for sentencing on the instant conviction, the United States Probation Office prepared a PSR, which calculated Austin\u2019s total offense level at 21 which, with a criminal history category of VI, yielded an advisory sentencing range under the United States Sentencing Commission, <em>Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d), of seventy-seven to ninety-six months\u2019 imprisonment. The criminal history category of VI was calculated on the basis that Austin had fifteen criminal history points, three of which were for the Arizona assault/abuse convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-11\">Austin objected to the PSR on several grounds, one of which involved the three criminal history points assessed for the Arizona conviction. Specifically, Austin argued that \u201c[i]f this court computes a longer sentence of imprisonment based on a conviction and sentence that are eventually overturned, the time for [him] to seek correction of this sentence will have lapsed, and he will be without an avenue of relief.\u201d Defendant\u2019s Objections to the PSR at <em>2.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b762-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>In response, the district court stated, \u201cFirst of all, I don\u2019t think the question is ripe. Secondly, it would be an advisory opinion in any event, and ... I think I\u2019ll not answer the question.\u201d Tr. of Sentencing at 3, R. Vol. II. Furthermore, the district court observed that USSG \u00a7 4A1.2, comment. (n.l) specifically states \u201cthat a sentence imposed after Defendant\u2019s commencement of the instant offense, but prior to sentencing for the instant offense, is a prior sentence if it was for conduct other than conduct that was part of the instant offense,\u201d and then noted that \u201c[t]his case would seem to fit that application note.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4. The district court accordingly overruled Austin\u2019s objection to the inclusion of the three criminal history points based on the Arizona conviction. Austin appeals that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">When reviewing federal sentences, \u201cas a matter of procedural regularity, the \u2018starting point and the initial benchmark\u2019 for any sentencing decision must be a correctly calculated Guidelines sentencing range.\u201d <em>United States v. Todd, </em>515 F.3d 1128, 1134 (10th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>-U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). Thus, on appellate review of a sentence, \u201cour first task remains to \u2018ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range ... [or] selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1134-35 (quoting <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">Austin concedes that USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(Z) provides that, in calculating criminal history, \u201c[p]rior sentences under appeal are counted except as expressly provided below.\u201d He further concedes that none of the express exceptions apply. He nonetheless argues that due process prevents his Arizona conviction from being counted because he claims there is no clear avenue for relief if that conviction is overturned on appeal, after it was used to increase his criminal history, and therefore his sentence, on the instant conviction. As the government points out, however, a number of courts, including our own, have recognized that there is an avenue for relief. We have stated that \u201c[i]f a defendant successfully attacks state sentences, he may then apply for reopening of any federal sentence enhanced by the state sentences.\u201d <em>United States v. Cox, </em>83 F.3d 336, 339 (10th Cir.1996). We have observed that \u201c[i]n reopening defendant\u2019s sentence, the district court must determine the basis for the expungement or dismissal of the prior offenses and whether they may be included in calculating defendant\u2019s criminal history score.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 339. Thus, \u201c[c]onvictions reversed or vacated for reasons related to constitutional invalidity, innocence, or errors of law are expunged for purposes of the Guidelines and therefore cannot be included in criminal history calculations,\u201d while \u201cconvictions ... set aside for reasons other than innocence or errors of law ... are counted for criminal history purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 339-40. While we are dealing here with a prior federal conviction, not a state one, we cannot see any reason to reach a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">Accordingly, Austin is not necessarily left without a remedy even if his conviction in Arizona is overturned on appeal. We note that neither party has provided current information on the status of the appeal pending before the Ninth Circuit, nor on any grounds for which an appeal in that court could be or is based. Austin\u2019s argument to us is, of course, moot if his appeal before the Ninth Circuit is dismissed or otherwise fails to provide him with any relief. Furthermore, as indicated above, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>the degree to which relief would be available to Austin may depend on the basis for which the appeal is successful.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b760-8\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b761-8\">. The government asserts that the Ninth Circuit's docket shows that, on February 12, 2008, Austin's counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), indicating counsel\u2019s belief that there were no nonfrivolous issues upon which to base an appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b761-12\">. At the sentencing hearing, Austin's counsel explained his concern as follows: \u201cit becomes a moot point if he\u2019s successful on the appeal in Arizona; but if he's successful on appeal, he just wants to make sure he hasn\u2019t spent the last two and a half years in vain on that case and that he has an avenue of relief.\u2019\u2019 Tr. of Sentencing at 3, R. Vol. II.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
