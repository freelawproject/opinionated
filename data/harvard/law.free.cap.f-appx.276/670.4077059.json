R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b694-22\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b694-23\">Varazdat Movsesian, a native and citizen of Armenia, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order summarily affirming an immigration judge\u2019s (\u201cI J\u201d) denial of his application for asylum, withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Where, as here, the BIA affirms without opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency action. <em>See Mansour v. Ashcroft, </em>390 F.3d 667, 671 (9th Cir.2004). We review the IJ\u2019s decision for substantial evidence. <em>Id. </em>We dismiss in part, and deny in part, the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-24\">Because the IJ did not make an explicit adverse credibility determination, we accept Movsesian\u2019s testimony as true. <em>See id. </em>at 671-672.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-25\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that the harms Movsesian experienced were not sufficiently severe enough to rise to the level of persecution. <em>See Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1016-1017 (9th Cir.2003); <em>see also Prasad v. INS, </em>47 F.3d 336, 340-341 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-26\">Substantial evidence also supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Movsesian does not have a well-founded fear of future persecution based on his or his father\u2019s political activities, because Movsesian did not establish that the Armenian government showed any interest in him personally, nor is there evidence that Armenian authorities have imputed to Movsesian his father\u2019s political views. <em>See Belayneh v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 488, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>491 (9th Cir.2000); <em>see also Sangha v. INS, </em>103 F.3d 1482, 1490-1491 (9th Cir. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Because Movsesian fails to establish eligibility for asylum, he necessarily fails to satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Mansour, </em>390 F.3d at 673.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">In his opening brief, Movsesian failed to raise, and therefore has waived, any challenges to the IJ\u2019s denial of relief under CAT. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">Finally, this court does not have jurisdiction to review Movsesian\u2019s claim that the IJ exhibited bias and prejudice with regard to his eligibility for military service and his shaved head because Movsesian did not exhaust this claim before the BIA. <em>Sanchez-Cruz v. INS, </em>255 F.3d 775, 780 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part, and DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b694-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b695-9\">Circuit Judge BERZON,</author>\n<p id=\"AA2\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-10\">I dissent. I do not believe that our case law supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Movsesian failed to establish past persecution. Therefore, I would grant the petition for review in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
