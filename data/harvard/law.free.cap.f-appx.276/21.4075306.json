Page, finding the petitioner to be an arriving alien who was inadmissible based on a conviction for a crime of moral turpitude and denying his application for asylum and withholding of removal, and from the July 29, 2005, order of the BIA denying his motion for reconsideration. <em>In re Abiodun Oduko, </em>No. A47 118 824 (B.I.A. May 25, 2005 and July 29, 2005), <em>aff'g </em>No. A47 118 824 (Immig.Ct.N.Y.City, Jan. 11, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">Although generally we lack jurisdiction to review final orders of removal against certain criminal aliens, we retain jurisdiction to review constitutional claims or questions of law. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(A)(2)(d); <em>Canada v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 560, 563 (2d Cir.2006). Oduko\u2019s claims are renewable because he raises questions of law regarding: (1) his status as an arriving alien; (2) whether his offense fell within the petty offense exception; (3) the petitioner\u2019s burden of proof on his asylum and withholding of removal claims when credibility is assumed; and (4) the necessity of corroborating evidence. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 324-30 (2d Cir.2006). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See Hong Ying Gao v. Gonzales, </em>440 F.3d 62, 65 (2d Cir.2006). Because the BIA did not expressly \u201cadopt\u201d the IJ\u2019s decision, but its brief opinion closely tracks the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we consider both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions for the sake of completeness, as doing so does not affect our ultimate conclusion. <em>See Jigme Wangchuck v. DHS, </em>448 F.3d 524, 528 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-12\">\n<em>Arriving Alien and Petty Offense Exception</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b47-13\">When Oduko returned from a trip to Nigeria, he was paroled into the United States (rather than admitted as a lawful permanent resident) because he had been indicted for criminal possession of stolen property. \u201cAn alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the United States shall not be regarded as seeking an admission into the United States ... unless the alien ... has committed an offense identified in [Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d)] section 212(a)(2).\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C). Section 212(a)(2) identifies crimes involving moral turpitude as grounds for inadmissibility. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I). Oduko does not dispute that his crime was one of moral turpitude. <em>See Michel v. INS, </em>206 F.3d 253, 263-66 (2d Cir.2000) (finding criminal possession of stolen property under New York law is a crime of moral turpitude). At issue is whether, at the time of his at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>tempted reentry, he \u201ccommitted\u201d that offense as the term is used in INA \u00a7 101(a)(13)(C). Oduko argues that the term \u201ccommitted\u201d requires a judgment of conviction. He thus contends that because he had not yet been convicted of the offense when he returned to the United States, he should not have been treated as an arriving alien.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">We defer to the BIA\u2019s reading \u201cwhen interpreting ... provisions of the [INA], as long as those interpretations are reasonable,\u201d <em>Michel, </em>206 F.3d at 260, and will reject the agency\u2019s interpretation only if it is unreasonable or contrary to clear congressional intent, <em>see INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 447-48, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). Here, the BIA\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 101(a)(13)(C) is reasonable as Congress selected the term \u201ccommitted\u201d rather than the term \u201cconvicted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 432,107 S.Ct. 1207 (holding that where Congress \u201cincludes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section ..., it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally, and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\u201d (internal quotations and citations omitted)). Because Oduko committed the offense involving moral turpitude prior to his attempted reentry, he came under the exception in INA \u00a7 101(a)(13)(C) and was properly treated as an arriving alien.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">The BIA also properly found that Oduko was ineligible for the petty offense exception for crimes of moral turpitude. The exception provides that an alien will not be deemed inadmissible based on a crime of moral turpitude where \u201cthe maximum penalty possible for the crime ... did not exceed imprisonment for one year <em>and, </em>if the alien was convicted of such crime, the alien was not sentenced to a term of imprisonment in excess of 6 months.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(ii)(II) (emphasis added). Since Oduko was sentenced to only six months\u2019 imprisonment, he satisfies the second part of this exception. However, he fails to satisfy the first part of the exception because he was convicted of criminal possession of stolen property in the fourth degree in violation of New York Penal Law \u00a7 165.45(2), which carries a maximum possible sentence of four years. <em>See </em>N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 70.00(2)(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">\n<em>Asylum and Withholding of Removal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">Oduko seeks asylum and withholding of removal on the ground that he has a well-founded fear of persecution arising out of alleged threats and attacks against him and his family by his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s Muslim relatives who oppose her engagement to a Christian, and the refusal of the Lagos law enforcement authorities to prosecute these crimes because they involve a religious dispute subject to Shari\u2019a law.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">After denying Oduko\u2019s eligibility for asylum, the IJ made an alternate and independent ruling that he would deny Oduko\u2019s application as a matter of discretion because of Oduko\u2019s conviction and his failure to take responsibility for his criminal conduct. The BIA affirmed this alternate holding. Because Oduko is a criminal alien, this Court lacks jurisdiction to review such discretionary determinations by the IJ and the BIA. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2). Oduko has not identified a question of law restoring jurisdiction over the discretionary denial of relief. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen, </em>471 F.3d at 329 (renewable question of law would arise if a discretionary decision \u201cwas made without rational justification or based on a legally erroneous standard\u201d). Moreover, even if we were to assume jurisdiction to review this discretionary decision, we would find no abuse of discretion; the IJ denied relief only after properly weighing all of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>appropriate factors \u2014 both favorable and adverse \u2014 including Oduko\u2019s family ties, criminal record, and the danger of persecution. <em>See Wu Zheng Huang v. I.N.S., </em>436 F.3d 89, 98 (2d Cir.2006). Accordingly, Oduko\u2019s asylum claim must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">His withholding claim is not subject to discretionary denial. It is, however, subject to a higher standard of proof than his asylum claim. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006). And having examined with care the record in this case, and conscious of the fact that we review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>416 F.3d 184, 191 (2d Cir.2005), we conclude that the agency\u2019s decision that Oduko has not met this higher burden must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">The BIA did not err as a matter of law in denying Oduko\u2019s motion to reopen/reconsider. Oduko failed to proffer any new evidence that was not previously available, <em>see Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 90 (2d Cir.2001), and failed to raise any errors of fact or law in the BIA\u2019s prior decision, <em>see Jin Ming Liu v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 109, 111 (2d Cir.2006) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
