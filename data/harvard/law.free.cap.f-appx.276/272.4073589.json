Williams\u2019 counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), in which he asserts that there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but asks this court to review whether Williams was erroneously charged and convicted. Williams was given an opportunity to file a pro se supplemental brief, but has not done so. Upon review of this case, we asked the Government to address whether the district court\u2019s instructions to the jury constituted a constructive amendment of Count One of the indictment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Upon consideration of the Government\u2019s brief and the record in this case, we find no error and affirm Williams\u2019 convictions and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Under Count One of the indictment, the Government was required to prove Williams used or carried a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime or possessed a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime. <em>See United States v. Lipford, </em>203 F.3d 259, 265-66 (4th Cir. 2000). Proof of the underlying crime is necessary to convict under \u00a7 924(c). <em>United States v. Hopkins, </em>310 F.3d 145, 153 (4th Cir.2002). In this case, the indictment identified the predicate drug trafficking crime as \u201cconspiring to distribute and possession with the intent to distribute a substance containing cocaine base.\u201d This language bears some similarity to the conspiracy charge under Count Four of the indictment, which charged Williams with conspiracy to \u201cdistribute and possess with intent to distribute\u201d five grams or more of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(B), 846 (West 1999 &amp; Supp. 2007). However, at the close of the Government\u2019s evidence, the district court dismissed Count Four due to insufficient evidence of a conspiracy. The district court subsequently instructed the jury that to convict Williams of violating \u00a7 924(c), the Government was required to prove that Williams \u201cpossessed cocaine base with the intent to distribute,\u201d and that during and in relation to that crime, he used or carried a firearm. The district court further identified Count Five as a drug trafficking crime for purposes of \u00a7 924(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">If Count Four was the only offense specified as the predicate drug trafficking crime for purposes of Count One, the district court\u2019s dismissal of that count and subsequent identification of Count Five as the predicate crime would constitute a fatal variance of the indictment. <em>See United States v. Schnabel, </em>939 F.2d 197, 203 (4th Cir.1991) (fatal variance \u201cchange[s] the elements of the offense charged, such that the defendant is actually convicted of a crime other than that chai\u2019ged in the indictment.\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the indictment, however, the use of the term \u201cpossession\u201d rather than \u201cpossess\u201d indicates that Count One charged two predicate crimes, both the conspiracy charge of Count Four and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>possession charge of Count Five. While the phrasing employed in the indictment is not a model of daiity, it was nonetheless sufficient to put Williams on notice that two predicate offenses were being alleged in regard to the \u00a7 924(c) charge. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>152 F.3d 294, 298 (4th Cir.1998) (court liberally construes indictment if claim is raised for the first time on appeal). Therefore, because the \u00a7 924(c) charge listed both Count Four and Count Five as predicate offenses, we find that no fatal variance occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">In Williams\u2019 <em>Anders </em>brief, counsel asks this court to review whether Williams was erroneously charged or convicted, but concedes that the indictment sufficiently appraised Williams of the charges against him and that his conviction and sentence were supported by the evidence. The record reveals that the indictment alleged each material element of the offenses charged and fairly informed Williams of the charges against him. <em>See United States v. Wicks, </em>187 F.3d 426, 427 (4th Cir.1999). Furthermore, there was sufficient evidence to uphold Williams\u2019 convictions for possession of a firearm during a drug trafficking crime, possession of a firearm while being an unlawful user of controlled substances, and possession with intent to distribute more than five grams of cocaine. Finally, Williams raised no objections at sentencing and received the minimum sentence required by statute. Therefore, we conclude there was no error in regal\u2019d to Williams\u2019 convictions or sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Williams\u2019 convictions and sentence. This court requires counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b297-6\">. A constructive amendment of an indictment occurs when either the Government or the court expands the \u201cpossible bases for conviction beyond those presented by the grand jury.\u201d <em>United States v. Floresca, </em>38 F.3d 706, 710 (4th Cir. 1994). While Williams failed to raise any objection to the district court\u2019s instructions and does not address this matter on appeal, constructive amendment of a federal indictment constitutes error per se, and, under <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993), must be corrected on appeal even when not preserved by objection. <em>See Floresca, </em>38 F.3d at 714.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b297-11\">.
