We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and deny in part, and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-18\">We first conclude that, contrary to Garcia-Garcia\u2019s contention, his adjustment to lawful permanent resident status under the special agricultural worker (\u201cSAW\u201d) provision codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1160(a)(2) did not preclude the Immigration and Naturalization Service from instituting deportation proceedings against him on the basis of his pre-adjustment firearms conviction. <em>See Perez-Enriquez v. Gonzales, </em>463 F.3d 1007, 1010-11 (9th Cir.2006) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-19\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-20\">Garcia-Garcia further contends that, because permanent residents who adjust under the general adjustment provisions codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255 may not be found removable on the basis of their pre-adjustment firearms offenses, <em>see Matter of Rainford, </em>20 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 598, 602 (BIA 1992), allowing permanent residents who adjust under SAW to be found deportable on the basis of the same offenses violates Garcia-Garcia\u2019s Equal Protection rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-21\">Garcia-Garcia overlooks the qualitative differences between \u00a7 1255 adjustment and adjustment under the SAW provisions. In <em>Matter of Jimenez-Lopez, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 738, 741-42 (BIA 1993) the BIA noted that, unlike \u00a7 1255 permanent residents, SAW permanent residents adjust status automatically \u201con the basis of a fixed schedule, without regard for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>alien\u2019s admissibility at that time.\u201d The differences between the two forms of adjustment constitute a rational basis for distinguishing between the permanent residents who adjust under SAW and permanent residents who adjust under \u00a7 1255. Accordingly, we conclude that Garcia-Garcia did not suffer an Equal Protection violation as a result of this disparate treatment and affirm the BIA\u2019s holding that Garcia-Garcia\u2019s pre-adjustment firearms conviction rendered him deportable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">We have jurisdiction to review GarciaGareia\u2019s contention that the BIA erred by failing to consider his eligibility for repapering. <em>See Kaganovich v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d 894, 897 (9th Cir.2006) (raising claim in notice of appeal sufficient despite failing to elaborate on argument in brief to BIA).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">Because he was \u201cpotentially eligible for repapering at the time the BIA considered the [Immigration Judgej\u2019s decision\u201d we remand the case to the BIA to consider in the first instance whether or not Gareia-Garcia is indeed eligible for repapering relief. <em>See Alcaraz v. INS, </em>384 F.3d 1150, 1162 (9th Cir.2004) (remanding where the BIA failed to consider a deportable immigrant\u2019s eligibility for repapering); <em>see also INS v. Orlando Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">Accordingly, Garcia-Garcia\u2019s petition is DENIED in part and REMANDED in part with instructions to the BIA to exercise its discretion regarding whether to administratively close the case for repapering.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b625-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
