On appeal, Mil-Ion states only a single claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The Government has moved to dismiss Millon\u2019s appeal based upon a waiver of appellate rights in his plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-24\">We deny the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss. We have reviewed Millon\u2019s claim and conclude that it does not \u201cconclusively appear! ]\u201d on the record that counsel was ineffective. <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999) (internal quotation marks omitted). Mill\u00f3n may raise his ineffective assistance claim in proceedings under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000). We therefore affirm Millon\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
