HARTZ, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b766-19\">Following a jury trial in April 2000, Victor Theodore Martinez was convicted in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado of being a felon in possession of a firearm and was sentenced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment. We affirmed his conviction and sentence in <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>30 Fed.Appx. 900 (10th Cir.2002). Mr. Martinez then filed a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 to set aside his sentence. The district court denied the motion, prompting the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">This court has issued a certificate of appealability (COA) to review whether Mr. Martinez received ineffective assistance of trial counsel and whether the district court should have conducted an evidentiary hearing to resolve the \u00a7 2255 motion. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253(a), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">We take the following background facts from this court\u2019s order and judgment in Mr. Martinez\u2019s direct criminal appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-8\">On November 16, 1999, at approximately 4:00 p.m., Isadore Romero reported to police that Mr. Martinez had been at Mr. Romero\u2019s house driving a black sport utility vehicle. Mr. Romero observed Mr. Martinez talking to Mr. Romero\u2019s son, Ray Romero. Isadore Romero advised Colorado Springs Police Officer Jeff Jensen that Mr. Martinez and Ray Romero appeared to be having an argument, and that he (Isadore Romero) observed Mr. Martinez seated in the driver\u2019s position with a black pistol in his lap.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-9\">Approximately thirty minutes earlier, Officer Jensen had observed Mr. Martinez driving a black Isuzu Trooper (a type of sport utility vehicle) in the vicinity of a liquor store in the Colorado Springs area, had run a computer check, and had learned that Mr. Martinez\u2019s license was suspended. Officer Jensen was also aware that Mr. Martinez was a convicted felon and prohibited from possessing a firearm. Officer Jensen had also recognized another gentleman, Jerome Ambers, in the passenger seat of the vehicle. At the time, Officer Jensen was distracted by a higher priority call and was unable to attempt to approach Mr. Martinez. However, around 5:00 p.m. that same day, after receiving the report from Mr. Romero, Officer Jensen obtained the cellular telephone number for Mr. Ambers and called Mr. Ambers to see if Mr. Ambers was still with Mr. Martinez. Mr. Ambers confirmed that he was still with Mr. Martinez, and provided Officer Jensen with the location. Officer Jensen requested other units be dispatched to this area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-11\">At approximately 6:00 p.m., Officer Jackson Andrews observed the black Isuzu Trooper and recognized Mr. Martinez as the driver. Officer Andrews knew of Isadore Romero\u2019s report and also knew of Mr. Martinez\u2019s status as a convicted felon. Officer Andrews radioed that he had located Mr. Martinez. Officer Andrews then activated his emergency lights and approached the Isuzu Trooper. Officer Andrews observed the Isuzu accelerate quickly in reverse, striking the police car. The Isuzu then accelerated forward and began traveling west.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-12\">Officer Michael Roy, who was nearby, followed Officer Andrews in a brief pursuit of Mr. Martinez. Mr. Martinez soon stopped his vehicle. The officers removed Mr. Martinez from the vehicle and placed him under arrest. Officer Roy put Mr. Martinez in the back of Officer Roy\u2019s police car and returned to the Isuzu. Officer Roy glanced into the vehicle and observed a black handgun toward the rear compartment area. Officer Roy secured the weapon for placement into evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-13\"><em>Martinez, </em>30 Fed.Appx. at 902-03.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-14\">Mr. Martinez was indicted for being a felon in possession of a firearm. <em>See </em>18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). The government offered a plea agreement contemplating a sentence of 92-115 months. At the time, Mr. Martinez was represented by the Federal Public Defenders Office. Mr. Martinez later retained attorney Shaun Kaufman, who allegedly failed to \u201caddress the pending proposed plea agreement with [Mr. Martinez].\u201d ApltApp. at 160 (Memorandum in support of 2255 motion).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">Trial began in April 2000. Kaufman attempted to portray the firearm as belonging to Ambers. In pursuit of this theory, Kaufman elicited several hearsay statements from Officer Jensen during cross-examination, including that Ambers admitted \u201cthat he [Ambers] had touched the pistol twice.\u201d Tr. of Proceedings at 82. According to Officer Jensen, Ambers stated that he had twice attempted to take the gun from Mr. Martinez, and that in doing so he may have left his fingerprints on it. Kaufman also elicited from Officer Jensen that during police questioning, Mr. Martinez said that Ambers \u201chad the gun.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 93. But not all of Kaufman\u2019s cross-examination supported his theory, as he elicited from Officer Jensen that Ambers had said that he had seen Mr. Martinez insert a live round into the gun. On redirect, Officer Jensen repeated both Ambers\u2019s description of the live-round incident and Mr. Martinez\u2019s claim that Ambers had the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">Kaufman later explained to the trial judge that he had not objected to the government\u2019s questioning of Officer Jensen about Ambers\u2019s statements because he (Kaufman) \u201cthought [he had] kind of opened the door\u201d and \u201cthought [the prosecutor] was just completing what [he] had opened.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 163. Kaufman also explained that he had spoken with Ambers\u2019s attorney and decided not to call Ambers as a witness because he (Kaufman) believed Ambers would invoke his privilege against self-incrimination. He did, however, propose calling Detective Dan Lake to testify (1) that in November 1998 he had arranged to purchase a \u201cmachine pistol\u201d from Javon Crawford, who said that he had received the gun from Ambers, <em>id. </em>at 161-62, and (2) that he (Lake) \u201csaw Crawford and Ambers in the same parking lot where this transaction occurred,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 162. The district court took the proposal under consideration. For reasons that are not in the record, Kaufman apparently decided not to pursue Lake\u2019s testimony, although the court indicated, after the case was submitted to the jury, that it would have admitted Lake\u2019s testimony if Ambers had testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-9\">After this court affirmed Mr. Martinez\u2019s conviction and sentence on direct appeal, he filed his \u00a7 2255 motion. Among other things, he argued that Kaufman had provided ineffective assistance at trial because he (1) suffered from bipolar disorder and a methamphetamine addiction;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (2) failed to address the proposed plea agreement with Mr. Martinez; (3) failed to call Ambers and Detective Lake as witnesses; and (4) failed to object to the government\u2019s introduction of hearsay evidence. The district court denied Mr. Martinez\u2019s motion and accompanying request for an evidentiary hearing. He now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-10\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"Ag_\">A. Standards of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b768-11\">\u201c[W]e review the district court\u2019s legal rulings on a \u00a7 2255 motion de novo and its findings of fact for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Pearce, </em>146 F.3d 771, 774 (10th Cir.1998). \u201cWe review the district court\u2019s refusal to hold an evidentiary hearing for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Harms, </em>371 F.3d 1208, 1210 (10th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">B. Assistance of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">\u201c[C]riminal defendants have a Sixth Amendment right to \u2018reasonably effective\u2019 legal assistance.\u201d <em>Roe v. Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. 470, 476, 120 S.Ct. 1029, 145 L.Ed.2d 985 (2000) (quoting <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984)). This right is violated when (1) counsel\u2019s representation falls \u201cbelow an objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, and (2) \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 694,104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">1. Counsel\u2019s Mental Illness and Drug Addiction</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">Mr. Martinez argues that Kaufman\u2019s bipolar disorder and methamphetamine addiction \u201cinterfered with his effective representation.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 16. But as there is no claim that Kaufman\u2019s illness and addiction rendered him constructively absent and per se ineffective, <em>see United States v. Cronic, </em>466 U.S. 648, 659-62, 104 S.Ct. 2039, 80 L.Ed.2d 657 (1984), we must examine his actual performance during the trial, <em>see Bonin v. Calderon, </em>59 F.3d 815, 838 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">2. The Proposed Plea Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b769-10\">The district court assumed that Kaufman performed deficiently regarding the proposed plea agreement, but ruled that Mr. Martinez failed to show prejudice. We perceive no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-11\">Mr. Martinez contends that Kaufman \u201cwas ineffective in failing to at least proffer the existence of the plea agreement to his client and determine if Mr. Martinez would have accepted the agreement.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 21. \u201c[Effective assistance of counsel includes counsel\u2019s informed opinion as to what pleas should be entered.\u201d <em>United States v. Carter, </em>130 F.3d 1432, 1442 (10th Cir.1997). A defendant is prejudiced by counsel\u2019s deficient performance in regard to plea bargaining if there is \u201ca reasonable probability that but for incompetent counsel [the] defendant would have accepted the plea offer and pleaded guilty.\u201d <em>Carter, </em>130 F.3d at 1442.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-13\">Mr. Martinez, however, has not alleged that the attorney who negotiated the agreement failed to advise him about it, and Mr. Martinez\u2019s present counsel did not contest below that Mr. Martinez \u201cmay have seen [the proposed] plea agreement when represented by [the prior attorney].\u201d <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>No. CV-03WM-0409, Doc. 114 at 1 (Resp. in support of \u00a7 2255 motion). Moreover, at sentencing, Mr. Martinez indicated that he had entered guilty pleas in other cases, but adamantly insisted that he was innocent of the crime for which he was being sentenced. Although Mr. Martinez\u2019s attorney asserted in one of the \u00a7 2255 pleadings that Mr. Martinez would have accepted the plea agreement, this bald assertion is hardly sufficient to justify an evidentiary hearing, much less relief. The standard for obtaining an evidentiary hearing \u201cis higher than notice pleading.\u201d <em>United States v. Cervini, </em>379 F.3d 987, 994 (10th Cir.2004). \u201cDistrict courts are not required to hold evidentiary hearings in collateral attacks without a firm idea of what the testimony will encompass and how it will support a movant\u2019s claim.\u201d <em>Id.; see also United States v. Aiello, </em>814 F.2d 109, 113-14 (2d Cir.1987) (\u201cAiry generalities, conclusory assertions and hearsay statements\u201d do not warrant an evidentiary hearing). Mr. Martinez has failed to provide sufficient support for his claim that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>was prejudiced by any failure of Kaufman to consult with him about a plea agreement. The district court properly rejected this claim without conducting an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">3. Witnesses</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Mr. Martinez next argues that Kaufman\u2019s failure to call Ambers and Detective Lake as witnesses left the jury \u201cwith one impression[,] that it was Mr. Martinez who possessed the firearm.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 22. The district court found that Kaufman did not perform deficiently and, that even if he had, Mr. Martinez was not prejudiced \u201cgiven the state of the record.\u201d Aplt.App. at 184. We conclude that there has been no showing of deficient performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">Kaufman decided against calling Ambers as a witness because he believed that Ambers \u201cwould have claimed the Fifth Amendment on the stand.\u201d Tr. of Proceedings at 276. The prosecutor agreed, and aptly noted that \u201c \u2018neither the prosecution nor the defense may call a witness knowing that the witness will assert his Fifth Amendment privilege against self incrimination.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 276-77 (quoting <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>707 F.2d 447, 449 (10th Cir.1983)). Further, even if Ambers would not have asserted the privilege, the value of his testimony would likely have been limited. Although he admitted to Officer Jensen that his fingerprints may have been on the gun, he explained that he had attempted to disarm Mr. Martinez on two occasions. And if for some reason he would have claimed exclusive possession, the government could have impeached his testimony with his contrary statements to Officer Jensen.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">As for Kaufman\u2019s failure to call Detective Lake, we cannot discern how his testimony would have been beneficial. We agree with the government\u2019s characterization of the testimony: \u201c[T]he gist of the testimony from Detective Lake would have been that an unrelated suspect (Crawford), in an unrelated transaction [which occurred one year before the incident leading to Mr. Martinez\u2019s arrest] ... made a hearsay declaration that another suspect who also was not on trial (Ambers) had supplied a weapon that was not at issue \u2014 \u201d Aplee. Br. at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-9\">Therefore, we conclude that Kaufman did not perform deficiently in not calling Ambers or Detective Lake as a witness. An evidentiary hearing was unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-10\">4. Hearsay Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b770-11\">Mr. Martinez faults Kaufman for not objecting when Officer Jensen testified regarding statements made by Ambers \u201cto the effect that Martinez possessed the firearm.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 22 (internal quotation marks omitted). It appears that Mr. Martinez is referring to Officer Jensen\u2019s redirect testimony about Ambers\u2019s description of the live-round incident. The district court rejected Mr. Martinez\u2019s argument because of the absence of prejudice, stating that Mr. Romero testified that he saw Mr. Martinez in possession of a firearm and that there was evidence that the gun was found inside Mr. Martinez\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-12\">Neither party to this appeal has provided this court with the cited testimony. Nevertheless, we determine that Kaufman did not perform deficiently. As Kaufman explained to the district court, he did not object because he had opened the door to Ambers\u2019s statements while cross-examining Officer Jensen. Kaufman apparently pursued that strategy because there was no other way to put Ambers\u2019s self-incriminating statements before the jury. And Kaufman\u2019s strategy was partially successful, in that Officer Jensen relayed Ambers\u2019s admission that his fingerprints might be on the gun, thereby suggesting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>that Ambers possessed the gun. Significantly, Mr. Martinez does not fault Kaufman for eliciting the hearsay testimony about Ambers that was helpful to his defense. There is likewise no complaint in regard to Kaufman\u2019s failure to object to Officer Jensen\u2019s redirect hearsay testimony that Mr. Martinez said that Ambers \u201chad the gun.\u201d Tr. of Proceedings at 94. Although Kaufman may have inadvertently brought up the damaging live-round incident on cross-examination, Mr. Martinez makes no issue of it on appeal. The problem faced by Kaufman was that the evidence strongly favored guilt. To obtain any favorable evidence, he needed to elicit hearsay, even though this effort would likely lead to the introduction of additional unfavorable evidence. We conclude that Kaufman\u2019s failure to object when Officer Jensen provided damaging hearsay testimony was a necessary consequence of a trial strategy designed to utilize helpful hearsay testimony. <em>See Snow v. Sirmons, </em>474 F.3d 693, 721 (10th Cir.2007) (observing that when \u201c[t]he failure to object appears to be trial strategy!,] ... it cannot be a ground [] for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel\u201d). Again, no purpose would have been served by an evidentiary heaiing.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b766-9\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to grant the parties' request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b768-6\">. In 2003 Kaufman was suspended from the practice of law for various acts of misconduct, some of which occurred contemporaneously with Mr. Martinez\u2019s trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b771-8\">. To the extent that this court's grant of a COA could be read as including the argument that Kaufman was ineffective for failing to assert a selective-prosecution defense, we note that Mr. Martinez\u2019s appellate arguments are couched in terms of his failed motion for discovery to support that defense. But this court specifically excluded from the COA any issues concerning discovery. Consequently, Kaufman\u2019s handling of the selective-prosecution issue is not before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
