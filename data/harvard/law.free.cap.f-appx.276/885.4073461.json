On appeal, Vazquez-Restrepo asserts that the district court erred by denying a minor-role reduction, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). More specifically, Vazquez-Restrepo contends that his role in the conspiracy was minor when compared to his relevant conduct and the role of the other participants in the overall conspiracy because: (1) his only job was to count bales of cocaine; (2) he was not to share in the proceeds from the drugs; (3) he did not own or prepare the drugs; and (4) he did not plan the operation. After thorough review of the record and careful consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-12\">We review a district court\u2019s factual findings regarding a defendant\u2019s role in the offense for clear error. <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir. 1999) <em>(en </em>banc). \u201cSo long as the basis of the trial court\u2019s decision is supported by the record <em>and </em>does not involve a misapplication of a rule of law, we believe that it will be rare for an appellate court to conclude that the sentencing court\u2019s determination is clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 945. The defendant, as the proponent of the downward adjustment, bears the burden of proving the mitigating role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 939. A district court, however, \u201cis not required to make any specific findings other than the ultimate determination of the defendant\u2019s role in the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 940.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-13\">The Sentencing Guidelines permit a court to decrease a defendant\u2019s offense level by two points if it finds that the defendant was a \u201cminor participant\u201d in the criminal activity. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). A minor participant is a defendant \u201cwho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment. (n.5). In determining whether a minor-role reduction is warranted, a district court \u201cshould be informed by two principles discerned from the Guidelines.\u201d <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 940. Under the first prong, which may be dispositive in many cases, \u201cthe district court must measure the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>fendant\u2019s role against the relevant conduct for which [he] was held accountable at sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 945. Relevant conduct is the \u201cconduct attributed to the defendant in calculating [his] base offense level.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 941. \u201c[W]here the relevant conduct attributed to a defendant is identical to [his] actual conduct, [he] cannot prove that [he] is entitled to a minor role adjustment simply by pointing to some broader criminal scheme in which [he] was a minor participant but for which [he] was not held accountable.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">Under the second prong, \u201cthe district court may also measure the defendant\u2019s role against the other participants, to the extent that they are discernable, in that relevant conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 945. A defendant, however, \u201cis not automatically entitled to a minor role adjustment merely because [he] was somewhat less culpable than the other discernable participants. Rather, the district court must determine that the defendant was less culpable than <em>most other participants </em>in [the] relevant conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 944 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">Here, Vazquez-Restrepo did not satisfy his burden on the first <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>prong because the relevant conduct for which the district court held him accountable \u2014 possession of the 1,590 kilograms of cocaine found on the vessel \u2014 was identical to his actual conduct in the conspiracy. Moreover, the sheer quantity of drugs is evidence that a minor-role reduction was not warranted. <em>See De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 943 (noting that the \u201camount of drugs is a relevant factor and recognizing] that under some circumstances it may be dispositive\u201d). In short, the district court only held the defendant accountable for the drugs involved in the portion of the conspiracy in which he personally participated, and not for the broader conspiracy. Therefore, the first principle of <em>De Varon </em>precludes a minor role reduction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b911-9\">\u201cSo long as the basis of the trial court\u2019s decision is supported by the record <em>and </em>does not involve a misapplication of a rule of law, we believe that it will be rare for an appellate court to conclude that the sentencing court\u2019s determination is clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 945 (emphasis in original). Here, we cannot find clear error in the district court\u2019s conclusion that Vazquez-Restrepo played an integral role in the charged offenses and, accordingly, was not entitled to a minor-role reduction, pursuant to our decision in <em>De Var\u00f3n.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b911-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b911-7\">. Given Vazquez-Restrepo's failure to carry his burden on the first prong, we need not reach the second <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>prong, but we nevertheless observe that this second principle would also defeat the award of a minor-role reduction here. The only participants who may be considered are those involved in the relevant conduct attributed to VazquezRestrepo, specifically, the other crewmembers. <em>See Id. </em>Vazquez-Restrepo\u2019s conduct appears to have been equal to that of the other crew members and the conduct of others who were involved in the overall scheme of transporting and selling cocaine. In fact, based on the government's evidence that Vazquez \u2014 Restrepo possessed a gun, the record indicates that he may have had the more substantial role \u2014 when compared to other crew members without guns \u2014 of guarding the cocaine. To the extent Vazquez-Restrepo highlights that, unlike other members of the broader conspiracy, he did not have an equity interest in the drugs, the conduct of others who were involved in the broader conspiracy \u2014 the organizers or recruiters or those with an equity interest in the cocaine \u2014 is irrelevant to the assessment of a Vazquez-Restrepo\u2019s role, because he was not charged with a larger conspiracy to import or distribute drugs, and, in any event, the other individuals are not identifiable from the evidence. <em>See De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 944.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
