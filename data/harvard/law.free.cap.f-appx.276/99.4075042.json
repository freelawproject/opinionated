Rattoballi, </em>452 F.3d 127 (2d Cir. 2006) <em>(\u201cRattoballi I </em>\u201d). Rattoballi pleaded guilty to two counts: (1) conspiracy to rig bids in violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1; and (2) conspiracy to commit mail fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. Originally, he was sentenced to one year of home confinement and five years\u2019 probation and was ordered to pay $155,000 in restitution. <em>Rattoballi I, </em>452 F.3d at 128. This Court held that Rattoballi\u2019s sentence was unreasonable and remanded the case to the district court for resentencing. <em>Id. </em>at 128-29. On remand, the district court sentenced Rattoballi to eighteen months\u2019 imprisonment and two years\u2019 supervised release. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-25\">Rattoballi argues that his present sentence is unreasonable for two reasons. First, he contends that it violates the parsimony clause of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) because it is \u201cgreater than necessary\u201d to serve the purposes of sentencing. Second, he asserts that the district court erroneously read this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Rattoballi I </em>to require it to impose a term of imprisonment. As to the first argument, Rattoballi proffers no evidence that the district court concluded that the original noncustodial sentence it imposed would be equally effective to serve the purposes of sentencing as the eighteen-month sentence it later imposed upon resentencing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have said that \u201cif a district court were explicitly to conclude that two sentences equally served the statutory purpose of \u00a7 3553, it could not, consistent with the parsimony clause, impose the higher.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number><em>United States v. Ministro-Tapia, </em>470 F.3d 137, 142 (2d Cir.2006). As in <em>Ministro-Tapia, </em>there has been no showing here that the district court viewed the two sentences as equally effective to serve the purposes of \u00a7 3553, and thus, Rattoballi\u2019s parsimony clause argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">Rattoballi\u2019s second argument is that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court erroneously interpreted this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Rattoballi I </em>to require the district court to impose a term of imprisonment. Although the district court stated that \u201cI think it is virtually impossible to comply with the Court of Appeals opinion without a prison sentence,\u201d in imposing the sentence, the district court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-5\">I am not simply blindly following some dictate of the Court of Appeals.... But my point is not only do I feel bound to impose a prison sentence ... I am now persuaded in my own mind as a matter of my own discretion that such a thing is right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">It is clear that the district court reconsidered its earlier sentence and decided that a sentence of imprisonment would be appropriate. There was no error in its exercise of discretion to impose an eighteen-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">We have considered all of Rattoballi\u2019s other arguments and find them to be without merit. For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b123-22\">. Although Judge Griesa did state that he had \u201cno regrets\" about the \"very substantial break\u201d that he gave Rattoballi in the original sentencing, we do not read this statement as concluding that the original sentence would have been equally effective to serve the purposes of sentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
