Kus appeals the district court\u2019s ruling affirming the ALJ\u2019s determination that Kus, who is severely disabled due to lumbar spine degenerative joint disease and obesity, was not entitled to disability benefits for the period from May 1, 2001 to July 16, 2003. Because the parties are familiar with the facts, we do not recite them here except as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-18\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s decision affirming the ALJ, and will uphold a denial of benefits if the ALJ \u201capplied the correct legal standards and substantial evidence supports the decision.\u201d <em>See Stout v. Comm\u2019r, </em>454 F.3d 1050, 1052 (9th Cir.2006). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-19\">Kus\u2019s argument that the ALJ failed to give appropriate weight to the records of his chiropractor, Dr. Martin, is not persuasive. As with other witnesses, the ALJ was required to take into account evidence from Kus\u2019s chiropractor \u201cunless he or she expressly determine[d] to disregard such testimony\u201d and gave reasons for doing so. <em>See Lewis v. Apfel, </em>236 F.3d 503, 511 (9th Cir.2001). While the ALJ did not explicitly discuss Dr. Martin\u2019s records, an ALJ is not required to address <em>\u201cevery </em>piece of evidence,\u201d and it is not clear that the ALJ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>rejected the evidence such that an explanation was necessary. <em>See Howard ex rel. Wolff v. Barnhart, </em>341 F.3d 1006, 1012 (9th Cir.2003) (emphasis added; citation omitted). Indeed, the ALJ stated that \u201c[c]onsideration has also been given [to] the reports of ... other treating, examining and non-examining medical sources,\u201d a group that would include Dr. Martin. Moreover, nothing in Dr. Martin\u2019s records contradicts the ALJ\u2019s conclusions as those records do not describe the degree of Kus\u2019s pain or any resulting functional limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">We also are not persuaded by Kus\u2019s argument that the ALJ did not properly consider his testimony regarding his symptoms and limitations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Kus produced evidence of an underlying impairment that \u201c \u2018could reasonably expected to produce pain or other symptoms,\u2019 \u201d thus the ALJ could only reject his testimony about the \u201cseverity of [his] symptoms with \u2018specific findings stating clear and convincing reasons for doing so.\u2019\u201d <em>Batson v. Comm\u2019r, </em>359 F.3d 1190, 1196 (9th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Smolen v. Chater, </em>80 F.3d 1273, 1281-82, 1284 (9th Cir.1996)). Moreover, a \u201cfinding that a claimant lacks credibility cannot be premised wholly on a lack of medical support for the severity of his pain.\u201d <em>Light v. SSA, </em>119 F.3d 789, 792 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">Here, the ALJ identified facts in the record, in addition to the lack of medical support, to support his conclusion that Kus\u2019s testimony as to the severity of his symptoms was not \u201cfully convincing.\u201d The ALJ noted that Kus\u2019s treatment had been conservative, and that Kus had not undertaken any treatment identified with significant low back pain. <em>See Macri v. Chater, </em>93 F.3d 540, 544 (9th Cir.1996); <em>Johnson v. Shalala, </em>60 F.3d 1428, 1434 (9th Cir.1995). This basis alone is sufficient to support the ALJ\u2019s assessment of Kus\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">In light of our determination that the ALJ properly disregarded Kus\u2019s subjective allegations regarding his symptoms and limitations, we also conclude that substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s findings as to Kus\u2019s residual functional capacity. The ALJ\u2019s determination that Kus was capable of light work with postural restrictions during the relevant time period was consistent with the assessment performed by Dr. Hoskins, and Dr. Hoskins\u2019 findings about Kus\u2019s abilities to lift, sit, stand, and walk were confirmed by Dr. Quint. No other medical reports in the record expressly discussed Kus\u2019s functional limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">Finally, the ALJ\u2019s conclusion as to Kus\u2019s ability to obtain work was supported by substantial evidence, specifically, the vocational expert\u2019s testimony that someone with Kus\u2019s profile and limitations could perform work that existed in significant numbers in the national economy, including the jobs of an assembler of small products, a toy assembler, or a ticket teller. In his hypothetical, the ALJ properly included those limitations he \u201cfound credible and supported by substantial evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Bayliss v. Barnhart, </em>427 F.3d 1211, 1217 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-11\">For these reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b580-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b581-7\">. It is somewhat puzzling that the ALJ stated, in his findings at the conclusion of his opinion, that \u201d[t]he claimant\u2019s assertions concerning his ability to work are credible,\u201d a finding that perhaps was related to the conclusion that Kus was disabled as of July 17, 2003. In any case, the ALJ\u2019s fairly extensive discussion of why he did not find Kus\u2019s testimony \"fully convincing\u201d is sufficient to resolve any ambiguity as to whether or not the ALJ found Kus credible.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
