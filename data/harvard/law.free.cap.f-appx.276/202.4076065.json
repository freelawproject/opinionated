We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-17\">Because we write exclusively for the parties, who are familiar with the facts and proceedings below, we will not revisit them here. The Supreme Court has squarely held that a federal prosecution is not barred under the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Double Jeopardy Clause by a prior state prosecution for the same act. <em>See Abbate v. United States, </em>359 U.S. 187, 79 S.Ct. 666, 3 L.Ed.2d 729 (1959); <em>see also Bartkus v. Illinois, </em>359 U.S. 121, 79 S.Ct. 676, 3 L.Ed.2d 684 (1959). Morris does not dispute that <em>Abbate </em>and <em>Baitkus </em>are fatal to his appeal, but rather argues that the rationale of those precedents was undermined by the Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent decision in <em>Benton v. Maryland, </em>395 U.S. 784, 89 S.Ct. 2056, 23 L.Ed.2d 707 (1969), in which the Supreme Court held that the Double Jeopardy Clause applies to the states.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-19\">Regardless of the merits of this argument, it is assuredly not our place to overturn Supreme Court precedent. <em>See Agostini v. Felton, </em>521 U.S. 203, 237, 117 S.Ct. 1997, 138 L.Ed.2d 391 (1997); <em>see also United States v. Extreme Associates, Inc., </em>431 F.3d 150, 155-156 (3d Cir.2005). And as Morris candidly admits, even the members of this Court who have questioned the continued viability of <em>Abbate </em>and <em>Bartkus </em>have acknowledged that this is a matter for the Supreme Court. <em>See United States v. Wilson, </em>413 F.3d 382, 394 (3d Cir.2005) (Aldisert, J., dissenting) (\u201cThe time has come for the Supreme Court to revisit the issue.\u201d); <em>United States v. Grimes, </em>641 F.2d 96, 104 (3d Cir.1981) (\u201c[W]e do not believe we are the proper forum to overturn a legal directive from the Supreme Court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-20\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
