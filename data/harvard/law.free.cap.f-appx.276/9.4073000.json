Straus\u2019s denial of her application for cancellation of removal under INA \u00a7 240A(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-18\">Bernard argues that: (1) her children will suffer exceptional and extremely unusual hardship if she is removed to El Salvador; (2) the factors that resulted in temporary protected status (\u201cTPS\u201d) being extended to Salvadorian citizens should be considered in relation to her cancellation of removal claim; and (3) she can establish the ten-year period of domestic physical presence required for cancellation of removal under INA \u00a7 240A(b)(1)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-19\">As we find no \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s discretionary determination that Bernard was ineligible for cancellation of removal because she failed to establish exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying relative. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(B)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) (\u201c[N]o court shall have jurisdiction to review ... any judgment regarding the granting of relief under section ... 1229b [cancellation of removal] of this title.\u201d); <em>Barco-Sandoval v. Gonzales, </em>516 F.3d 35, 36 (2d Cir.2008) (where petitioner raises no constitutional claims or questions of law, we lack jurisdiction to review such discretionary determinations as \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d) (reaffirming <em>De La Vega v. Gonzales, </em>436 F.3d 141 (2d Cir.2006)). Accordingly, we cannot consider Bernard\u2019s first argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-20\">We will not consider Bernard\u2019s TPS argument, which she did not make before the BIA. Section 242(d)(1) of the INA provides that \u201c[a] court may review a final order only if \u2014 (1) the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right[.]\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Jus</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number><em>tice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 107 n. 1, 123 (2d Cir.2007) (court not obliged to consider an issue not presented to the BIA).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">Finally, Bernard\u2019s physical presence argument is irrelevant because the BIA\u2019s hardship determination was dispositive of Bernard\u2019s cancellation claim. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l) (applicant for cancellation of removal must establish continuous physical presence, good moral character, and hardship). The BIA never reached the physical presence issue in light of Bernard\u2019s failed hardship claim and, as a result, it is not properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
