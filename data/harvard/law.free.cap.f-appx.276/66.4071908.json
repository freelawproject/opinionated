Apr. 3, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">As a preliminary matter, because Chen failed to raise before the BIA his claim that he has a well-founded fear of persecution in China because he has two U.S. citizen children, we lack jurisdiction to consider that claim and dismiss the petition for review to that extent. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Karaj v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 113, 119 (2d Cir.2006). Additionally, because Chen failed to challenge the BIA\u2019s denial of his claim based on his partner\u2019s forced abortion, we deem any such argument to have been waived. <em>Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-11\">When the BIA issues its own opinion, \u201cthe opinion becomes the basis for judicial review.\u201d <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See, e.g., Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Manzur v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>494 F.3d 281, 289 (2d Cir.2007). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Tian-Yong Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121, 129 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-13\">We find that the BIA erred in concluding that there is \u201cno evidence\u201d that Chen resisted China\u2019s coercive population control program. <em>See Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 n. 7 (2d Cir.2004) <em>ovemiled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007) (en banc). Indeed, Chen testified that when his \u201cwife\u201d did not appear for her scheduled abortion, \u201cbirth control officers brought some people to go to [his] mother-in-law\u2019s home\u201d in order to try to arrest her. When Chen heard an argument and went to see what was happening, he saw people he did not recognize trying to take his mother-in-law\u2019s television, radio, and furniture. He testified, however, that he thought at least one of these individuals was a \u201cbirth control officer.\u201d During this incident, Chen pushed that individual to the ground. As a result, he was beaten \u201cfor a long time,\u201d and threatened that \u201cif [he did] not bring [his] wife out ... they [were] going to ask the public security to arrest [him] and put [him] in prison.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-14\">Based on Chen\u2019s testimony, it is unclear why the BIA held that there was \u201cno <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>evidence\u201d that the incident at Chen\u2019s mother-in-law\u2019s house was related to Chen\u2019s resistance to China\u2019s coercive family planning policy. <em>See Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005). Thus, the record was not \u201cadequately developed\u201d with respect to Chen\u2019s other resistance claim. <em>See Gui Yin Liu v. INS, </em>508 F.3d 716, 723 (2d Cir.2007) (remanding to the BIA in order for the petitioner\u2019s claim to be \u201cadequately developed\u201d); <em>see also Matter of S-L-L-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 1, 10 (BIA 2006) (en banc). On remand, the agency should provide a more reasoned analysis of whether the incident Chen described is sufficient evidence of his \u201cresistance,\u201d and whether, assuming such resistance, Chen suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of persecution on account of that resistance. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is GRANTED in part and DISMISSED in part, the BIA\u2019s decision is VACATED in part, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this order. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
