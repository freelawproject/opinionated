Kravitz, of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b124-25\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b124-26\">Waldheim-Toron (\u201cAppellant\u201d) appeals from the December 27, 2006 judgment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>the district court convicting him of one count of conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine and imposing a sentence of ninety-six months\u2019 incarceration, three years\u2019 supervised release, and a special assessment of $100. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and proceedings in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">We review sentencing decisions for reasonableness, asking \u201cwhether the sentencing judge exceeded the bounds of allowable discretion, committed an error of law in the course of exercising discretion, or made a clearly erroneous finding of fact.\u201d <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 27 (2d Cir.2006) (alterations, internal quotation marks, and citation omitted). Appellant argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable in light of the factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), his lack of a criminal history, the non-violent nature of the offense, and his acceptance of responsibility. He claims that a 60-month sentence would fulfill the goals of sentencing and constitute an adequate deterrent for himself and others.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">We find Appellant\u2019s challenges unpersuasive. Appellant presented these arguments in a submission to the district court, and at sentencing the district court stated that it had reviewed that submission. The district court clearly considered Appellant\u2019s lack of a criminal history and the non-violent nature of his offense when it applied the \u201csafety-valve\u201d provision, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f), to avoid the imposition of a mandatory minimum sentence. It also considered the \u201cmitigating circumstances\u201d presented by Appellant when deciding upon the sentence it eventually imposed. At the same time, the district court noted the seriousness of Appellant\u2019s offense and tile fact that Appellant had engaged in illegal activity over a substantial period of time. Having considered these factors and Appellant\u2019s arguments, the district court found that a sentence of 96 months was \u201csufficient but not greater than necessary to promote the proper objects of sentencing.\u201d Appellant may disagree with that conclusion, but it is not unreasonable. <em>Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d at 27 (\u201cReasonableness review does not entail the substitution of our judgment for that of the sentencing judge.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">We have considered all of Appellant\u2019s other arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
