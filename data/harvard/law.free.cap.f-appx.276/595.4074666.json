Nevada, </em>No. CV-05-00368-RLH/LRL (D.Nev. Sept. 21, 2005). The essential facts of this ease are stated in a related appeal, <em>Dias v. Elique, </em>No. 05-16440 (9th Cir. May -, 2008), issued today. The district court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343 (2000) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367 (2000). We have jurisdiction to review the final order of the district court granting attorneys\u2019 fees under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. An award of attorneys\u2019 fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Karam v. City of Burbank, </em>352 F.3d 1188, 1192 (9th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-26\">A prevailing defendant in an action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 may be awarded attorneys\u2019 fees if the suit in question was \u201cfrivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation.\u201d <em>Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, </em>434 U.S. 412, 421, 98 S.Ct. 694, 54 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>L.Ed.2d 648 (1978). Although we find that Appellants\u2019 malicious prosecution claim was precluded by factual determinations issued by Justice Reed in a prior proceeding, the preclusive effect of the prior determination was unclear at the time Appellants\u2019 claims were filed. In addition, the district court\u2019s determination that Appellants\u2019 negligent supervision and other constitutional claims were frivolous also relied on the fact that, \u201cafter a judgment was entered against them in the state administrative proceeding and by Chief Judge Pro, Plaintiffs again brought an action against UCCSN and State Defendants based on the same claims previously decided.\u201d <em>Mason v. Nevada, </em>No. CV-05-00368-RLH/LRL, slip op. at 5. This finding was called into question by our decision reversing Chief Judge Pro\u2019s grant of summary judgment based on the issue preclusive effect of the state administrative hearing. <em>See Dias v. Elique, </em>436 F.3d 1125, 1133 (9th Cir.2006). For these reasons, we find that Appellants\u2019 claims were not frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation, and that the district court\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees therefore constitutes an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">Accordingly, we REVERSE the district court\u2019s decision awarding attorneys\u2019 fees to Appellees.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b619-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
