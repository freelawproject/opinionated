While employed there, he enrolled in the Munich American Reassurance Company Group Long Term Disability Insurance Plan (\u201cMARC Plan\u201d), which is insured and administered by Reliance. The plan promised him benefits if he was totally disabled throughout the \u201celimination period,\u201d which is defined as 180 consecutive days from the time he claimed to be disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-13\">On January 7, 2000, Tippitt resigned from his job. Three days later he applied for disability benefits under the MARC Plan, claiming that he suffered from \u201cprogressively increasing symptoms of joint pain, cluster headaches, and fatigue.\u201d Tippitt\u2019s doctors later diagnosed him as having Sjogren\u2019s syndrome, an autoimmune disease affecting moisture-producing cells, and undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy, an inflammatory joint disease similar to arthritis. Reliance denied his claim on the grounds that he was not totally disabled because he was still capable of performing the majority of his job\u2019s material duties. Tippitt administratively appealed this decision, and Reliance, after further consideration, upheld its original denial. Tippitt asked for yet another review, and, although not obligated to do so, Reliance considered Tippitt\u2019s claim yet again and denied it yet again. This time it concluded that Tippitt was not fully disabled because he could still perform at least one of his material duties. Tippitt asked for yet another review of his claim, but Reliance informed him that its decision was final.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-14\">Tippitt sued under ERISA. The district court conducted a bench trial and found that Reliance had correctly denied coverage because Tippitt \u201ccould perform <em>some </em>of the duties of [his job] during the three hours of sedentary work ... that [he] could complete.\u201d Tippitt appealed, and we reversed. <em>Tippitt v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co., </em>457 F.3d 1227 (11th Cir. 2006). We did so after concluding that \u201cwe cannot accept the legal [premise] which is that anyone who can perform some of his duties during some of the work day is partially disabled and therefore not totally disabled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1287. We explained that if Tippitt, during the elimination period, could perform all of his duties either during the three-hour period or some other substantial fraction of the work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>day, he would be only partially disabled and therefore not totally disabled. <em>Id. </em>The case was remanded to permit the district court to make the necessary factfindings.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">On remand, the district court made findings and again entered judgment for the defendants. In this appeal, Tippitt contends the district court erred by: (1) misinterpreting the term \u201cpart-time\u201d in Tippitt\u2019s MARC Plan policy; (2) finding that Tippitt could perform all of his job duties for a three-hour period each day; (3) considering the reasons for denying his claim that Reliance offered in litigation rather than those articulated in the letter denying his claim; and (4) finding that Reliance\u2019s denial of Tippitt\u2019s claim was not arbitrary and capricious. We address these contentions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-6\">Tippitt first contends that the district court erred by misinterpreting the term \u201cpart time\u201d in his insurance policy. He argues that the term \u201cpari time\u201d in the definition of partial disability is ambiguous and, as such, should be construed against Reliance as the drafting party. <em>See Lee v. Blue Cross/Blue Shield, </em>10 F.3d 1547, 1551 (11th Cir.1994) (\u201cHaving determined that the plan is ambiguous, we hold that application of the rule of contra proferentem is appropriate in resolving ambiguities in insurance contracts regulated by ERISA.\u201d). The MARC Plan policy states that an insured is partially disabled when an injury or sickness renders him \u201ccapable of performing the material duties of his/her regular occupation on a part-time basis or some of the material duties on a full-time basis.\u201d Because \u201cfull-time\u201d means working \u201ca minimum of 30 hours during a person\u2019s regular work week,\u201d Tippitt reasons that \u201cpart-time\u201d should mean being able to work a substantial number of hours but less than 30 a week. The district court concluded that during the elimination period Tippitt could perform all of his work duties for only three hours per day, a total of a fifteen hours each work week. It follows, Tippitt says, that because he was unable to work a substantial number of hours he could not meet the part-time requirement, and he must be considered to have been completely disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-8\">In Tippitt\u2019s first appeal we concluded that an insured was not totally disabled if he could \u201cperform all of the duties of [his] occupation \u2018on a part-time basis,\u2019 \u201d which means carrying out those duties for \u201ca substantial part of the work day.\u201d <em>Tippitt, </em>457 F.3d at 1237. We went on to say that a three-hour period is a substantial part of the work day. <em>Id. </em>Under the law of the case doctrine, we are not free to revisit that holding. <em>See Alphamed, Inc. v. B. Braun Med., Inc., </em>367 F.3d 1280, 1286 (11th Cir.2004). Therefore, the district court did not err in determining that if Tippitt could perform all of his duties for a three-hour period each day he was only partially disabled, not fully disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-10\">Tippitt next contends that, even under the definition of \u201cpart-time\u201d applied by the district court, it erred when it found that he could work part time. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a) provides that a district court\u2019s findings of fact in actions tried without a jury may not be reversed unless clearly erroneous. This requires us to give \u201cdue regard ... to the opportunity of the trial court to judge of the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a). \u201cIf the district court\u2019s findings of fact are \u2018plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety,\u2019 the court of appeals must accept them even if it is \u2018convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of fact, it would have weighed the evidence different<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>ly.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Fidelity Capital Corp., </em>920 F.2d 827, 836 n. 36 (11th Cir. 1991) (quoting <em>Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 574, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 1511, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">Tippitt argues that nothing in the record contradicts the evidence that he was totally disabled throughout the elimination period. We disagree. Four of his own physicians who evaluated him stated that he could work three hours per day. While other doctors believed he could only work one hour per day, the choice of which to believe is left to the district court. <em>United States v. Ramirez-Chilel, </em>289 F.3d 744, 749 (11th Cir.2002) (\u201cCredibility determinations are typically the province of the fact finder because the fact finder personally observes the testimony and is thus in a better position than a reviewing court to assess the credibility of witnesses.\u201d). There is also evidence \u2014 Tippitt\u2019s own self-evaluation \u2014 that his pain was \u201cmild\u201d and \u201cmoderate\u201d at various points during the elimination period, rather than debilitating. The trial court had sufficient evidence upon which to base its conclusion that Tippitt was not totally disabled throughout the elimination period; it did not clearly err in its predicate findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">Tippitt next argues that the district court failed to take into account the effects of his pain medication when determining whether he was disabled. This is the first time he has made this point. As an appellate court, we do not consider \u201ca legal issue or theory raised for the first time on appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. S. Fabricating Co., </em>764 F.2d 780, 781 (11th Cir.1985). Therefore, we will not reach the merits of this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-8\">Tippitt also contends that a district court should only consider the rationale for denying the insured\u2019s claim benefits that the insurer articulates when it informs the insured of its decision. In support of this proposition, Tippitt cites our decision in <em>Marecek v. BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc., </em>49 F.3d 702 (11th Cir.1995), in which we stated that an employer\u2019s \u201cfactual findings and <em>post hoc </em>explanations [were] without merit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 706. He also relies on a Sixth Circuit opinion, <em>University Hospitals v. Emerson Electric Co., </em>202 F.3d 839 (6th Cir.2000), which says that, when determining whether an insurer met its obligations under a policy, a court should not consider evidence in the record that is simply a post-hoc explanation of an administrative decision. <em>Id. </em>at 849 n. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-10\">Assuming that the district court did consider reasons for Reliance\u2019s denial of Tippit\u2019s claim that Reliance gave after the fact, doing so was not error. Tippitt\u2019s reliance on <em>Marecek </em>is misplaced. The fact that the post-hoc explanations in that case were not convincing does not mean that a court cannot consider post-hoc explanations about why an insurer denied the plaintiffs claim; to the contrary, <em>Marecek </em>specifically considered and examined those post-hoc explanations. <em>Marecek, </em>49 F.3d at 706. A district court may choose not to accord self-serving post-hoc explanations much weight for the reasons underlying Tippitt\u2019s argument, but it is not error to consider them. <em>See generally Univ. Hasps., </em>202 F.3d at 849 n. 7 (explaining why the court chose not to consider insurers\u2019 post-hoc justifications of denials of coverage).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-11\">y.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-12\">Finally, Tippitt contends that the district court\u2019s finding that Reliance\u2019s denial of benefits was not arbitrary and capricious because the district court improperly found that Reliance\u2019s decision was not tainted by self-interest. However, this de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>termination only affects the third step of the five-step analysis for ERISA claims. <em>See Tippitt, </em>457 F.3d at 1231-32 (laying out the five steps). The district court found that Tippitt\u2019s claim failed at the second step. It only went on to the third to announce an alternative holding. Therefore, even if Tippitt were correct, it would not affect the outcome of his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
