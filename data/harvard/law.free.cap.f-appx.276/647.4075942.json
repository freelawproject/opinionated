We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-25\">Where, as here, the BIA adopts and affirms the IJ\u2019s findings and reasoning, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as if it were that of the BIA. <em>See Abebe v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 1037, 1039 (9th Cir.2005). We review for substantial evidence, reversing only if the evidence compels the result. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We grant the petition for review and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-26\">The inconsistencies, assuming they exist, between Singh\u2019s application and his hearing testimony regarding the police\u2019s statement to his father, and the amount of time he lived in Bombay, either do not enhance his claims, or are minor and do not go to the heart of his claims. <em>See Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>341 F.3d 1015, 1021-22 (9th Cir. 2003). The IJ\u2019s doubts about the note from Singh\u2019s doctor were purely conjeetur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>al, and the IJ failed to address Singh\u2019s explanation for the note\u2019s grammatical errors and misspellings. <em>See Kaur v. Ashcroft, </em>379 F.3d 876, 886-87 (9th Cir.2004). Therefore, substantial evidence does not support the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">We grant the petition for review and remand for the agency to consider whether, taking Singh\u2019s testimony as true, he has shown eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the CAT. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-18, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b671-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
