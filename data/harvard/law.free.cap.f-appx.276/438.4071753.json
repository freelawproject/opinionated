The district court granted summary judgment to the defendants on several independent grounds, including an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>absence of proximate cause. Reviewing de novo and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Leasure, <em>Holloway v. Brush, </em>220 F.3d 767, 772 (6th Cir.2000), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">In June 1999, defendant Coleman American entered into a contract to purchase several moving and storage businesses owned by Leasure. Shortly thereafter, Coleman American discovered that a number of the businesses\u2019 accounts receivable were uncollectible. Coleman American brought suit against Leasure in the Circuit Court of Christian County, Kentucky, arguing that Leasure misrepresented his businesses\u2019 accounts receivable. Coleman American prevailed on fraud and breach of contract claims. Leasure then brought this civil RICO suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">To sustain a civil RICO action, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964(c), the plaintiff must show that \u201cthe alleged violation led directly to the plaintiffs injuries.\u201d <em>Anza v. Ideal Steel Supply Corp., </em>547 U.S. 451, 461, 126 S.Ct. 1991, 164 L.Ed.2d 720 (2006). Leasure asserts that he was injured because the defendants acquired his businesses by fraud. He also alleges that defendant Coleman American brought a fraudulent lawsuit against him in state court and argues, somewhat inconsistently, that (1) Coleman American\u2019s lawsuit was based on records falsified by Coleman American, and (2) that Coleman American knew that Leasure had miscalculated the accounts receivable before it purchased the businesses, but purchased the businesses anyway so that it could exact a large money judgment from Leasure.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">The only record evidence that Leasure cites to support this theory is a statement made by Richard Cundith, Coleman American\u2019s accountant. During the state court proceeding, Cundith testified that he advised Coleman American against purchasing Leasure\u2019s businesses because the businesses had no formal set of records. Though this might show that the defendants were aware that some of Leasure\u2019s representations might have been inaccurate, it does not support an inference that the defendants knew that some of Leasure\u2019s accounts receivable would be uncollectible.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">Leasure also suggests that the short time frame between the sale and the filing of Coleman American\u2019s state lawsuit shows that the defendants knew about the inaccuracies in Leasure\u2019s disclosures before the sale. Nothing supports this inference. To the contrary, the record shows that Coleman American only discovered the inaccuracies after it purchased Leasure\u2019s businesses and unsuccessfully attempted to collect on certain accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
