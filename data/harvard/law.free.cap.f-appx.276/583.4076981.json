We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen. <em>See Bhasin v. Gonzales, </em>423 F.3d 977, 984 (9th Cir.2005). We deny the petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-24\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Singh\u2019s first motion to reopen as untimely because he filed it 20 months after the BIA\u2019s final decision. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Singh also failed to demonstrate that he qualified for the changed country conditions exception to the 90-day time limit. <em>See id.; see also Malty v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 942, 945 (9th Cir.2004) (\u201cThe critical question is ... whether circumstances have changed sufficiently that a petitioner who did not have a legitimate claim for asylum now has a well-founded fear of future persecution.\u201d). The BIA\u2019s denial of Singh\u2019s first motion to reopen was not \u201carbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law.\u201d <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>295 F.3d 1037, 1039 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-25\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in concluding that Singh\u2019s second motion to reopen was numerically barred. <em>See </em>8 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2) (generally permitting one motion to reopen to be filed).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">PETITIONS FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b607-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
