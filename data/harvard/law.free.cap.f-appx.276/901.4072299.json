The 1-130 petition was purportedly filed on her behalf by her sister, who is a United States citizen. In her appeal to us, Lindsay appears to argue that approval of the 1-130 petition was not required to preserve her eligibility to apply for adjustment of status under \u00a7 1255(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">As indicated above, Lindsay moved the IJ to \u201cterminate\u201d the removal proceedings. We construe her motion as a motion for a continuance under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.29. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.29 (permitting the IJ to grant a continuance if good cause is shown). We review the denial of a motion for the continuance of a removal proceeding for an abuse of discretion. <em>Zafar v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>461 F.3d 1357, 1362 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">Under the LIFE Act, certain aliens may apply to the Attorney General for adjustment of status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i)(l). To be eligible to apply, the alien must be a beneficiary of either a petition for classification or an application for a labor certification filed before April 30, 2001. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i)(l)(B). A petition for classification includes an 1-130 Petition for an Alien Relative filed on behalf of a sibling. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1154(a)(l)(A)(i), <em>cross referencing </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153(a)(4); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 204.1(a)(1), 204.2(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-8\">In addition to filing the petition for classification or application for a labor certification before April 30, 2001, to be eligible to apply for adjustment of status, the alien must meet the definition of a \u201cgrandfathered alien.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.10(b). A \u201cgrandfathered alien\u201d includes a beneficiary of a petition or application that was properly filed before April 30, 2001, and was \u201capprovable when filed.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.10(a)(l)(i)(A). \u201cApprovable when filed\u201d means that the petition \u201cwas properly filed, meritorious in fact, and non-frivolous.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.10(a)(3). Furthermore, a beneficiary of a petition that was filed after January 4, 1998, must also have been physically present in the United States by December 21, 2000. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i)(l)(C); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.10(a)(l)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-14\">Once the Attorney General has received an application for adjustment of status, he may adjust the alien\u2019s status if: \u201c(A) the alien is eligible to receive an immigrant visa and is admissible to the United States for permanent residence; and (B) an immigrant visa is immediately available to the alien at the time the application is filed.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i)(2)(A)-(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-15\">In <em>Zafar v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>we addressed adjustment of status relief under \u00a7 1255(i) in the labor context. 461 F.3d at 1362. There we held that the IJ committed no abuse of discretion by denying the petitioners\u2019 motion to continue the removal proceeding where the petitioners did not yet have approved labor certifications and had not filed visa applications or applications for adjustment of status under \u00a7 1255(i). <em>Id. </em>This holding was based on the fact that the petitioners failed to satisfy the statutory criteria for adjustment of status under \u00a7 1255(i)(2), namely, eligibility to receive an immigrant visa and the immediate availability of such a visa. <em>Id. </em>at 1363-64. In <em>Merchant v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>461 F.3d 1375, 1377-80 (11th Cm. 2006), we found an abuse of discretion in the IJ\u2019s denial of a continuance where the petitioner had an approved labor certification and had filed both a visa application and an application for adjustment of status. Even though he did not have the visa in hand, the petitioner met the statutory criteria. <em>Id. </em>at 1378-79. We distinguished <em>Merchant </em>from <em>Zafar, </em>as <em>Mer</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number><em>chant </em>\u201cexpressly left open issues involving stages of this process beyond the mere filing of the application for labor certification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1380. In <em>Haswanee v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>471 F.3d 1212, 1216-17 (11th Cir.2006), after similarly distinguishing <em>Zafar, </em>we applied <em>Merchant </em>and held that the IJ abused his discretion by denying a motion for continuance where the petitioner had an approved labor certification, had filed a visa petition, but had not filed an application for adjustment of status under \u00a7 1255(i). This holding was again based on the fact that the petitioner had satisfied the statutory criteria for adjustment of status under \u00a7 1255(i)(2). <em>Id. </em>at 1217-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">In the present case, to continue the removal proceeding, Lindsay was required by our precedent to demonstrate that she was eligible for adjustment-of-status-relief under \u00a7 1255(i)(2). She failed to do so. The BIA did not abuse its discretion in dismissing her appeal. Her petition is therefore due to be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b925-15\">. Legal Immigration Family Equity Act (\"LIFE\u201d), Pub. L. No. 106-553, 114 Stat. 2762A-142 through 2762A-149 (2000); LIFE Act Amendments of 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-554, 114 Stat. 2763A-324 through 2763A-326. The case began with a Notice to Appear charging petitioner and her husband, Desmond Ewart Lindsay, with removability under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B) on the ground that they had remained in the United States beyond the period of authorization. They conceded removability, but applied for asylum, withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act and the Convention Against Torture. They subsequently abandoned their application, leaving the LIFE <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>Act issue presented here as the sole issue ' remaining in the case.
