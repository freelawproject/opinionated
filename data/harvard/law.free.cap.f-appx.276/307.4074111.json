He was sentenced as a career offender to a term of 262 months imprisonment. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4B1.1 (2005). Foote appealed his sentence, arguing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>he was improperly sentenced as a career offender, that this court\u2019s standard of review for criminal sentences is an unconstitutional return to mandatory guideline sentencing, and that the district court erroneously believed that it lacked authority to impose a sentence below the guideline range based in part on the disparity in sentences for crack and cocaine offenses. We affirmed his sentence; however, the Supreme Court subsequently vacated the judgment and remanded the case for reconsideration in light of <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). <em>See United States v. Foote, </em>249 Fed.Appx. 967 (4th Cir.2007), vacated, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 1133, 169 L.Ed.2d 946 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">In <em>Kimbrough, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201cit would not be an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when sentencing a particular defendant that the crack/powder disparity yields a sentence \u2018greater than necessary1 to achieve \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s purposes, even in a mine-run case.\u201d <em>Kimbrough, </em>128 S.Ct. at 575. <em>Kimbrough </em>has thus abrogated <em>United States v. Eura, </em>440 F.3d 625 (4th Cir.2006) (holding that sentencing court may not vary from guideline range solely because of 100:1 ratio for crack/coeaine offenses), <em>vacated</em>, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 853, \u2014 L.Ed.2d --- (2008). The district court did not have the benefit of <em>Kimbrough </em>when it determined Foote\u2019s sentence. To give the district court the opportunity to reconsider the sentence in light of <em>Kimbrough, </em>we conclude that resentencing is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-12\">We therefore vacate the sentence imposed by the district court and remand for resentencing.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-16\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b332-13\"> On remand, Foote will be resentenced under the revised guidelines for crack offenses that took effect on November 1, 2007.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
