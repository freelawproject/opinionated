No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996). We granted Golf\u00edn a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on one issue only:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-18\">Whether the district court erred by dismissing appellant\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition as time-barred where appellant filed a petition for discretionary review with the Florida Supreme Court but the district court found that 28 U.S.C. [\u00a7 2244(d)\u2019s] limitation period began to run 90 days after the District Court of Appeal affirmed appellant\u2019s conviction and sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b932-19\">Golf\u00edn argues only that he is entitled to equitable tolling for the time he filed for discretionary review with the Florida Supreme Court. The State responds that we should affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of his habeas corpus petition because Golf\u00edn did not address the issue raised in COA and therefore abandoned the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-20\">Under our well-established procedural rules, we consider issues not clearly raised on appeal abandoned. <em>Jones v. Campbell, </em>436 F.3d 1285, 1303 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 619, 166 L.Ed.2d 428 (2006). Under the AEDPA, \u201cappellate review is limited to the issues specified in the COA.\u201d <em>Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1250-51 (11th Cir. 1998), <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We liberally construe the pleadings of a <em>pro se </em>petitioner. <em>Gomez-Diaz v. United States, </em>433 F.3d 788, 791 (11th Cir.2005). Nevertheless, we will not act as <em>de facto </em>counsel for a <em>pro se </em>litigant. <em>GJR Invs., Inc. v. County of Escambia, Fla., </em>132 F.3d 1359, 1369 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-22\">Golf\u00edn did not address the issue raised by the COA; rather he argued that he was entitled to equitable tolling. Thus, he abandoned the issue on which we granted a COA. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
