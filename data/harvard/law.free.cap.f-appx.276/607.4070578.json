Cal-kins pleaded guilty to storing hazardous waste without a permit in violation of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (\u201cRCRA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6928(d)(2)(A), and was sentenced to five years of probation subject to the condition that he pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>$182,631.82 in restitution to the owner of the building he contaminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">Calkins entered into a plea agreement in which he agreed to the entry of restitution to compensate for the victims\u2019 losses. He also expressly agreed to restitution compensating for the costs of any clean up that was conducted. He has thus waived any argument that the district court abused its discretion in ordering restitution. He has not, however, waived his contention that the district court lacked legal authority to impose restitution as a condition of probation, <em>see United States v. Phillips, </em>174 F.3d 1074, 1076 (9th Cir.1999), but that contention lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (\u201cSRA\u201d) gives the district court discretion to require the defendant to pay \u201crestitution to the victim of the offense\u201d as a \u201ccondition[ ] of the sentence of probation.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3563; <em>see also United States v. Angelica, </em>859 F.2d 1390, 1392 (9th Cir. 1988) (explaining that the predecessor statute to the SRA authorized a district court to impose restitution as a condition of a defendant\u2019s probation). The district court thus had legal authority to impose restitution as a condition of Calkins\u2019 probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Calkins also contends that, under the Sixth Amendment, the facts supporting any restitution order must be found by a jury rather than a judge. We have already rejected this argument. The Sixth Amendment does not require a jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt the facts necessary to impose restitution; instead, a judge can find those facts by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See United States v. Bussell, </em>414 F.3d 1048, 1060 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">The district court\u2019s restitution order is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b631-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
