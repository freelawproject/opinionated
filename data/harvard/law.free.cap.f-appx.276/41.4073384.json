Jul. 23, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A72 214 313 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City, Apr. 14, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-10\">In addition to the statutory requirement that petitioners exhaust each category of relief, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1), this Court generally will not consider arguments regarding individual issues that were not exhausted before the agency. <em>Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 107 n. 1, 122-123 (2d Cir.2007). While not jurisdictional, this judicially-imposed issue exhaustion requirement is mandatory. <em>Id. </em>at 119-120. In particular, a petitioner must challenge all findings that are dispositive of his claims, and the failure to do so is fatal to his petition for review. <em>See Steevenez v. Gonzales, </em>476 F.3d 114, 117-118 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-14\">In his appeal to the BIA, Lin failed to exhaust any challenge to the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility and burden of proof findings. He argued that the IJ had failed to consider the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d in her \u201cdiscretionary denial\u201d of his asylum application,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and erroneously denied his withholding and CAT claims on the same discretionary basis. In fact, the IJ did not render a discretionary denial of relief, a decision that would have required her to perform a \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d analysis, <em>see Wu Zheng Huang v. INS, </em>436 F.3d 89, 98 (2d Cir.2006); rather, she found that Lin did not establish his statutory eligibility for that relief because he had not suffered past persecution and had not provided credible evidence of a well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-15\">Furthermore, while the BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility and burden of proof findings, its mere mention of those findings does not excuse Lin\u2019s failure to offer any meaningful challenge before the BIA of the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>Cf. Waldron v. INS, </em>17 F.3d 511, 515 n. 7 (2d Cir.1994); <em>Xian Tuan Ye v. DHS, </em>446 F.3d 289, 296-97 (2d Cir.2006). Considering Lin\u2019s newly-minted arguments regarding credibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>and burden of proof would defeat the purpose of the issue exhaustion requirement \u2014 to allow the agency to review its own decisions for error after having the opportunity to consider petitioner\u2019s arguments. <em>See Theodoropoulos v. I.N.S., </em>358 F.3d 162, 171 (2d Cir.2004) (\u201cat least one of the purposes served by the exhaustion requirement contained in \u00a7 1252(d) is to ensure that the INS, as the agency responsible for construing and applying the immigration laws and implementing regulations, has had a full opportunity to consider a petitioner\u2019s claims before they are submitted for review by a federal court.\u201d); <em>see generally Lin Zhong, </em>480 F.3d at 123, 124 n. 24; <em>see also United States v. Copeland, </em>376 F.3d 61, 67 (2d Cir.2004); <em>Weinberger v. Salfi, </em>422 U.S. 749, 765, 95 S.Ct. 2457, 45 L.Ed.2d 522 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Thus, because we find that Lin failed to exhaust any challenge to the agency\u2019s adverse credibility and burden of proof findings, and because those findings were dispositive of Lin\u2019s application for relief, <em>see Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77 (2d Cir.2005), we deny the petition for review, <em>see Steevenez, </em>476 F.3d at 117-118. Even if we were to reach the merits of the agency\u2019s decision, we would find that it was supported by substantial evidence. As the IJ found, Lin engaged in a \u201cflagrant pattern of lies\u201d beginning with his submission of a fraudulent asylum application. <em>See Siewe v. Gonzales, </em>480 F.3d 160, 170 (2d Cir.2007) (relying on the maxim of <em>falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus </em>(false in one thing, false in everything) to find that once an IJ concludes that a documents false, he or she is free to deem suspect other documents (and to disbelieve other testimony) that depend for probative weight upon [the applicant\u2019s] veracity).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b66-11\">. A \u201cdiscretionary denial\u201d of asylum refers to the agency\u2019s authority to deny asylum, eligibility notwithstanding, under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(D), based on a weighing for the \u201ctotality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>See Matter of H-, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 337, 348 (BIA 1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
