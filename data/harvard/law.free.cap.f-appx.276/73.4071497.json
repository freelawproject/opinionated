A 98 642 647/648 (B.I.A. May 15, 2007), <em>rev\u2019g </em>Nos. A 98 642 647/648 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City July 27, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-24\">Ke asserts that her due process rights were violated because the record before the BIA did not contain \u201cthe vast majority\u201d of the background evidence she submitted before the IJ.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>due process claim fails because she does not argue or demonstrate what the documents would have shown or how the BIA\u2019s decision would have been impacted by the purportedly missing documents. <em>See Li Hua Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t. of Justice, </em>453 F.3d 99, 104-05 (2d Cir.2006); <em>cf. Augustin v. Sava, </em>735 F.2d 32, 37 (2d Cir.1984). Indeed, she did not even submit the purportedly missing documents to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Additionally, Ke argues that the BIA applied the incorrect standard in its review of the IJ\u2019s decision. It is undisputed that the BIA no longer has authority to engage in factfinding (except for taking administrative notice of commonly known facts), or to review <em>de novo </em>an IJ\u2019s findings of fact. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(i) &amp; (iv), 1003.3(f); <em>Xian Tuan Ye v. DHS, </em>446 F.3d 289, 296 (2d Cir.2006). Nonetheless, the BIA \u201cmay review questions of law, discretion, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of immigration judges de novo.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">The BIA did not state the standard of review that it applied in reaching its conclusion, contrary to that of the IJ, that Ke failed to establish a well-founded fear of persecution. However, there is no indication that it gave any deference to the IJ\u2019s findings where it did not identify any errors in those findings and conducted its own review of the evidence. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (stating that the BIA may only review the IJ\u2019s factual findings to determine whether they are \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d); <em>Fen Yong Chen v. BCIS, </em>470 F.3d 509, 514 (2d Cir.2006). The BIA appears to have simply substituted its own judgment for that of the IJ based on its own evaluation of the evidence, which is \u201cclassie de novo review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the question before us is whether the BIA engaged in improper <em>de novo </em>review of the IJ\u2019s factual findings, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(i), or permissible <em>de novo </em>review of the legal question of Ke\u2019s eligibility for relief, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">We conclude that the BIA\u2019s <em>de novo </em>review of the legal issue of whether Ke met her burden of proof in establishing a well-founded fear of persecution was appropriate. The BIA\u2019s determination that Ke failed to offer sufficient evidence to satisfy her burden of proof constitutes an appropriate exercise of its authority to review the IJ\u2019s conclusions of law de novo. <em>Cf. Lin Zhong v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 117 (2d Cir.2007) (\u201cQuestions of law, including what quantum of evidence will suffice to discharge an applicant\u2019s burden of proof, are reviewed <em>de novo.\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">Because Ke\u2019s only argument before this Court is that the BIA applied an improper standard of review, she has waived any challenge to the BIA\u2019s finding that she failed to establish a well-founded fear of persecution. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005). Because Ke also fails to challenge the denial of her application for withholding of removal and CAT relief before this Court, we deem any such claims waived. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b99-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b98-17\">. The government's assertion that Ke failed to exhaust her due process claim before the BIA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>lacks merit. Ke bases her claim on the Certified Administrative Record produced by the agency only after she filed her petition for review in this Court. Although the government cites evidence indicating that Ke might have been provided with a copy of the transcript before the BIA issued its decision, it has not pointed to any evidence indicating that she could have known that the background materials were missing until she received the Certified Administrative Record.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
