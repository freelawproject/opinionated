HARTZ, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b806-22\">Phillip A. Espinoza, an inmate in the custody of the Colorado Department of Corrections, requests a certificate of appealability (COA) to challenge the denial by the United States District Court for the District of Colorado of his application for relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Because Mr. Espinoza has failed to make a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right, as required by 28 U.S.C. 2253(c)(2), we deny his request for a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-23\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b806-24\">Mr. Espinoza was convicted by a jury on January 14, 1994, of distribution of a controlled substance and of conspiracy to distribute a controlled, substance. He re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>ceived a life sentence with the possibility of parole after 40 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">The key evidence at trial against Mr. Espinoza was a tape recording made by a confidential informant of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). The informant, Norma Jean Lopez, was unavailable to testify because she was murdered a few days after the recording was made. The DEA, which had been investigating a man named Eugene Velarde, arranged for Lopez to engage in a controlled purchase of heroin from Velarde through Mr. Espinoza. Agents fitted Lopez with a radio transmitter and a tape recorder and dropped her off near Mr. Espinoza\u2019s apartment. Mr. Espinoza\u2019s girlfriend, Kathleen Bugarin, answered the door, and Lopez asked for Mr. Espinoza, referring to him by his nickname, \u201cLipe.\u201d Bugarin told Lopez that he was there and that he had just awakened. Lopez then said, \u201cGet up, lazy.... I need to cop [get some drugs].\u201d A man responded, asking Lopez how much money she had and what quantity of drugs she wanted. The man then spoke with someone over the phone and told Lopez that it would take about 45 minutes for his supplier to deliver the drugs. While they waited, Lopez audibly counted out the money that she had been given by the DEA to purchase the drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">According to Lopez\u2019s voice on the recording, when a van owned by Velarde pulled into the apartment\u2019s parking lot, the man called Lipe had grabbed the money from Lopez\u2019s hand. DEA agents observed Mr. Espinoza exiting the apartment, followed by Lopez. The agents then lost sight of Mr. Espinoza but shortly thereafter saw him returning to the apartment, meeting Lopez on the stairs to the apartment. As they entered the apartment, Lopez insisted that she had wanted to see \u201cGene.\u201d The man said that Gene was in a hurry and would call her later. Lopez then left the apartment and turned over heroin to the DEA agents. Bugarin later testified at trial that Lopez had visited the apartment that day, that Mr. Espinoza had been there, that he had made a phone call in Lopez\u2019s presence, and that both he and Lopez had left and returned to the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">After the jury convicted him, Mr. Espinoza appealed to the Colorado Court of Appeals, which affirmed his conviction. <em>People v. Espinoza, </em>No. 94CA0453 (Colo. Ct.App., Feb. 15, 1996) <em>(Espinoza I), cert. denied, </em>No. 96SC158 (Colo., Sept. 3, 1996). Mr. Espinoza, assisted by counsel, then moved for postconviction relief under Colorado Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(c). This motion was denied, and the denial was affirmed by the Colorado Court of Appeals, <em>People v. Espinoza, </em>No. 01CA1909, 2002 WL 31684827 (Colo.Ct. App., Nov. 29, 2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>2003 WL 1958679 (Colo., Apr. 28, 2003). Mr. Espinoza, acting pro se, then filed a second motion for postconviction relief, whose denial was also affirmed by the Colorado Court of Appeals, <em>People v. Espinoza, </em>No. 03CA1588, 2004 WL 2822401 (Colo.Ct. App., Dec. 9, 1994). The Colorado Supreme Court denied certiorari on April 18, 2005. <em>Espinoza v. People, </em>2005 WL 878591 (Colo., Apr. 18, 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-9\">On June 6, 2005, Mr. Espinoza timely commenced an application for relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, asserting 12 grounds for relief. The magistrate judge to whom the case was referred recommended that seven of the claims be denied as proeedurally defaulted and that the other claims be denied as without merit. Mr. Espinoza filed objections to the report and recommendation. The district court rejected Mr. Espinoza\u2019s arguments and denied the application. The court also denied (1) Mr. Espinoza\u2019s motion to stay the \u00a7 2254 proceedings so that he could exhaust certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>of his claims before the state courts, and (2) his motion for the appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">Mr. Espinoza\u2019s application requests a COA on seven issues. He argues that the district court (1) should have appointed counsel to represent him in his \u00a7 2254 application, (2) should have stayed his \u00a7 2254 proceedings to give him an opportunity to exhaust certain of his claims in state court, (8) should have granted him relief on his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim regarding his trial counsel, (4) should have granted him relief on his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim regarding his postconviction counsel, (5) should have granted him relief on his objections to the admission at trial of the taped conversations with Norma Jean Lopez, (6) should have granted him relief on his objections to evidence at trial of prior drug deals, and (7) should have granted him relief on his claim that there was insufficient evidence to convict him.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">A COA may issue \u201conly if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). This \u201csubstantial showing\u201d requires that the applicant demonstrate that \u201creasonable jurists could debate whether ... the petition should have been resolved [by the district court] in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">A. Appointment of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">We lack jurisdiction under \u00a7 2254 to grant a COA on Mr. Espinoza\u2019s argument that the district court should have appointed counsel for him. It is true that a district court has discretion to appoint counsel, <em>see id., </em>and that an applicant has a federal statutory right to counsel if an evidentiary hearing is required, <em>see </em>Rule 8(c) of the Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases. But, as Mr. Espinoza acknowledges, there is no <em>constitutional </em>right to assistance of counsel in pursuit of habeas relief. <em>See Swazo v. Wyo. Dept. of Corrs. State Penitentiary Warden, </em>23 F.3d 332, 333 (10th Cir.1994). And \u00a7 2253(c)(2) restricts the issuance of COAs to violations of the federal constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-10\">B. Stay of Application</p>\n<p id=\"b808-11\">Mr. Espinoza next argues that the district court should have granted his request to stay his \u00a7 2254 proceedings so that he could return to state court to present certain claims that may not have been exhausted. The court denied this motion on the ground that Mr. Espinoza\u2019s unexhausted claims were then time-barred in Colorado courts, so a stay would be futile. In Colorado, postconviction challenges with respect to felonies (other than class 1 felonies) must be brought within three years after the conclusion of the direct appeal, a date long since passed in Mr. Espinoza\u2019s case. <em>See </em>Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 16-5-402; <em>People v. Hampton, </em>876 P.2d 1236, 1241 (Colo.1994). Mr. Espinoza contends that a recent Colorado Supreme Court decision, <em>Silva v. People, </em>156 P.3d 1164 (Colo. 2007) (en banc), permits him to raise his unexhausted claims in state court even though the statutory time period for post-conviction challenges has expired. We agree with the district court that <em>Silva </em>offers Mr. Espinoza no such opportunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-12\">In <em>Silva </em>the Colorado Court of Appeals had affirmed the denial of Silva\u2019s first posteonviction motion three weeks after the statutory time period for filing post-conviction challenges had expired. 156 P.3d at 1166-67. Two weeks after that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>affirmance Silva brought a second postconviction motion, raising, among others, a claim of ineffective assistance of postconviction counsel. <em>Id. </em>at 1166. The Colorado Court of Appeals held that this claim was not time-barred because Silva could establish \u201cjustifiable excuse or excusable neglect\u201d for raising the issue after the statutory time period, as the issue of post-conviction ineffective assistance of counsel could not have been raised before the court\u2019s order in Silva\u2019s first postconviction motion. <em>Id. </em>at 1166-67. Nevertheless, the court held that Silva\u2019s claim failed because there was no right to effective assistance of postconviction counsel. <em>Id. </em>The Colorado Supreme Court reversed the court of appeals on this last issue, holding that there is a limited statutory right to counsel in state postconviction proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 1167.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">Mr. Espinoza claims that <em>Silva </em>permits him to present new issues now because his failure to present them earlier was a result of his postconviction counsel\u2019s refusal to do so. He is allowed to bring these claims, he argues, if he alleges ineffective assistance of postconviction counsel. But even if we assume that Colorado\u2019s limited statutory right to postconviction counsel extends to Mr. Espinoza, nothing in <em>Silva </em>suggests that the Colorado courts would be willing to hear his new claims today. Mr. Espinoza already raised the issue of ineffective assistance of postconviction counsel before the Colorado courts, in his second postconviction proceeding. The court of appeals affirmed the denial of this claim because it was conclusory, <em>not </em>because it was time-barred or because Mr. Espinoza had no right to postconviction counsel. <em>Silva </em>hardly indicates that the Colorado courts will entertain a late motion on an issue already decided. It was therefore reasonable for the district court to decline to stay Mr. Espinoza\u2019s \u00a7 2254 proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">C. Ineffective Assistance of Trial Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">In his \u00a7 2254 application Mr. Espinoza claims that \u201cnone\u201d of his counsel challenged his arrest and indictment for lack of probable cause. R. Doc. 5 at 6e. To the extent that this claim refers to his trial counsel, the district court found that this claim was unexhausted, because Mr. Espinoza, in his first state postconviction petition, had challenged his trial counsel\u2019s performance only on grounds unrelated to his current claims. Even if Mr. Espinoza could show cause for not exhausting the issue, the court held, he could not show prejudice because the claim had no merit. In his request for a COA Mr. Espinoza does not attempt to refute the district court\u2019s conclusion that the claim is unexhausted and concedes that he cannot show prejudice regarding his claims of unlawful arrest and detention. He does argue that he was prejudiced by trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the admission of the tape recording on the ground that it violated Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. But Mr. Espinoza did not present this argument to the district court, so we will not consider it here. <em>See Walker v. Mather (In re Walker), </em>959 F.2d 894, 896 (10th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">D. Ineffective Assistance <em>of </em>Postconviction Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b809-9\">The Supreme Court has held that there is no constitutional right to counsel in state postconviction proceedings. <em>Pennsylvania v. Finley, </em>481 U.S. 551, 555, 107 S.Ct. 1990, 95 L.Ed.2d 539, (1987). In <em>Finley </em>the Court stated: \u201cOur cases establish that the right to appointed counsel extends to the first appeal of right, and no further.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Mr. Espinoza argued in district court that a claim in a postconviction proceeding of ineffective assistance of trial counsel should be viewed as an appeal of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>right, because the postconviction proceeding is the first opportunity in Colorado to argue ineffective assistance of trial counsel. Given that there is a constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel on an appeal of right, <em>see Evitts v. Lucey, </em>469 U.S. 387, 396, 105 S.Ct. 830, 83 L.Ed.2d 821 (1985), he argues that there is a constitutional right to postconviction counsel, at least for the limited purpose of arguing the ineffective assistance of trial counsel. And in his COA application Mr. Espinoza further argues that a limited state right to effective assistance of post-conviction counsel, as in Colorado, creates an interest that cannot be denied without violating the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. We are not at liberty to consider these arguments, however, because \u00a7 2254(i) expressly provides that \u201c[t]he ineffectiveness or incompetence of counsel during Federal or State collateral post-conviction proceedings shall not be a ground for relief.\u201d Mr. Espinoza\u2019s challenge clearly falls within the prohibition of the statute, and he has not challenged the constitutionality of \u00a7 2254\u00ae</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">E. Residual Hearsay</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">On direct appeal Mr. Espinoza asserted that his rights under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment were violated by the admission of hearsay statements on the tape recording. The Colorado Court of Appeals rejected this argument, holding that the statements were sufficiently reliable that they did not violate Mr. Espinoza\u2019s rights under the Confrontation Clause. <em>See Espinoza I, </em>at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">Under \u00a7 2254, relief may not be granted with respect to any issue adjudicated on the merits in state court unless that adjudication \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\u201d or \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(l)-(2). A habeas court considers the state of constitutional law at the time that the applicant\u2019s conviction became final. <em>See Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 380, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). The Colorado Supreme Court denied certiorari on Mr. Espinoza\u2019s direct appeal on September 3,1996, so his conviction became final when his time to seek certiorari from the United States Supreme Court expired 90 days later. <em>See Allen v. Reed, </em>427 F.3d 767, 774 (10th Cir.2005). At that time the admission of hearsay testimony did not violate the Confrontation Clause if the statement fell within a \u201c \u2018firmly rooted\u2019 \u201d hearsay exception, or if the statement was supported by \u201c \u2018particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u2019\u201d <em>Stevens v. Ortiz, </em>465 F.3d 1229, 1236 (10th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 66, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">In this case the Colorado Court of Appeals relied upon \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u201d to conclude that the hearsay statements did not violate Mr. Espinoza\u2019s rights under the Confrontation Clause. Specifically, the court found that if Lopez\u2019s assertions \u2014 for instance, that the person she was talking to was \u201cLipe,\u201d that she was counting out $300 for the purchase, or that the man on the recording snatched the money from her hand \u2014 had been inaccurate, other people present were in a position to correct her and likely would have done so. The Supreme Court stated in <em>Idaho v. Wright, </em>497 U.S. 805, 822, 110 S.Ct. 3139, 111 L.Ed.2d 638 (1990), that \u201ccourts have considerable leeway in their consideration of appropriate factors\u201d in determining whether a statement bears the necessary guar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>antees of trustworthiness. We agree with the district court that the Colorado court\u2019s reliance on the presence of others likely to contradict Lopez was not contrary to and did not involve an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law, and Mr. Espinoza has not pointed to any specific hearsay statement not supported by this rationale. Nor is this determination of trustworthiness undermined, as Mr. Espinoza argues, by any personal interest that Lopez may have had in making the tapes appear to reflect a successful drug transaction; as the Colorado Court of Appeals stated, <em>see Espinoza I, </em>at 9, the likelihood that other persons would correct Lopez is unrelated to Lopez\u2019s motives for cooperating with the DEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">F. Statement about Prior Drug Transactions</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">At trial Mr. Espinoza objected to the introduction of a statement by a DEA agent that Lopez had told them that she had bought heroin from Mr. Espinoza in the past. The trial court admitted the testimony for the purpose of explaining what had prompted the investigation, and it instructed the jury to consider the statement for that purpose only, not for the truth of the assertion. On direct appeal the Colorado Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s ruling. <em>See id. </em>at 10-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">Mr. Espinoza argues that the admission of the statement was in error because (1) it was hearsay and (2) it was more prejudicial than probative. Although the statement would have been hearsay had it been admitted for the truth of the matter asserted, the trial court did not admit the statement for that purpose and gave the jury a limiting instruction to that effect. Whether evidence was incorrectly admitted as a matter of state law is \u201cno part of a federal court\u2019s habeas review of a state conviction.\u201d <em>Estelle v. McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 67, 112 S.Ct. 475, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991). Instead, we review only whether, \u201cconsidered in light of the entire record, its admission resulted in a fundamentally unfair trial.\u201d <em>Knighton v. Mullin, </em>293 F.3d 1165, 1171 (10th Cir.2002). Mr. Espinoza has not made this showing. We presume that a jury will follow a limiting instruction, <em>see United States v. Eads, </em>191 F.3d 1206, 1209 (10th Cir.1999), and Mr. Espinoza has not explained how that presumption was rebutted here, merely asserting that after the statement about pri- or drug transactions, it was \u201ca foregone conclusion\u201d that the jury would convict him. No reasonable jurist would debate the district court\u2019s ruling that the statement did not deny Mr. Espinoza a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">G. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b811-9\">Mr. Espinoza challenged the sufficiency of the evidence on direct appeal, arguing that the identity of the voice on the tape was never established and that the rest of the evidence was circumstantial. The Colorado Court of Appeals concluded that the evidence was sufficient to establish that the voice was that of Mr. Espinoza and that reasonable jurors could draw inferences to establish all the elements of the crime. <em>See Espinoza I, </em>at 11-12. The standard for whether evidence supporting a conviction is constitutionally sufficient is \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). Given the contents of the recording (e.g., Lopez asking for \u201cLipe\u201d and being told he was at home), Bugarin\u2019s testimony that a conversation between Mr. Espinoza and Lopez took place that morning, and the testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>from DEA agents that they saw Mr. Espinoza leaving from and returning to the apartment during the tape recording, it is clear that the decision of the Colorado Court of Appeals was not \u201ccontrary to, [nor did it] involve[ ] an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d nor was it \u201cbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1)\u00ae).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">Mr. Espinoza has not made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right because \u201creasonable jurists\u201d could not \u201cfind the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong.\u201d <em>Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595. We therefore DENY his application for a COA. His request to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>is GRANTED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
