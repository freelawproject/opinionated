Morefield contends that his two prior Texas convictions for possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver should not have been regarded as \u201ccontrolled substance offense[s]\u201d for purposes of applying the career-offender Guideline. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a) &amp; (b). He contends that the Guideline defining the term \u201ccontrolled substance offense,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b), does not use the term \u201cdeliver\u201d in describing this category of offenses. We recently rejected this argument in <em>United States v. Ford, </em>509 F.3d 714, 714-17 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">Morefield argues that \u201c[tjhere is insufficient detail in the Presentence Report to make a factual determination that ... [Morefield] pled to conduct that falls within the definition of a controlled substance offense\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2. Because this contention has been raised for the first time on appeal, our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Ochoa-Cruz, </em>442 F.3d 865, 866-67 (5th Cir.2006). Morefield does not dispute that his prior convictions were for possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance, an offense that we determined in <em>Ford </em>was equivalent to the offense of possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute. <em>See Ford, </em>509 F.3d at 717. For that reason, he has not shown that his substantial rights were affected. <em>See Ochoa-Cruz, </em>442 F.3d at 867. The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b395-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
