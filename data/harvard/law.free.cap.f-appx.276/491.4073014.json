Unbeknownst to him, though, one of his many customers was a confidential informant. After the informant bought 83.5 grams of crack cocaine from Williams, law enforcement officers obtained a warrant and searched Williams\u2019s home, where they found another 906.77 grams of crack as well as 183.8 grams of powder cocaine. A federal indictment charged Williams with one count of possession with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of crack. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Williams pleaded guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-15\">At sentencing the district court assigned Williams a base offense level of 36 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(2) given that all of the drugs seized amounted to the equivalent of roughly 21,748.92 kilograms of marijuana. The district court reduced the offense level by five in light of Williams\u2019s acceptance of responsibility, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, and his cooperation with law enforcement officers, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. Williams\u2019s total offense level of 31, when coupled with his criminal history category of V, yielded a guidelines range of 168 to 210 months. Williams asked the court to consider the disparity between crack and powder cocaine sentences under the guidelines \u2014 the so-called \u201c100:1 ratio\u201d \u2014 when determining his sentence, but the court felt that it did not have the authority to do so. After contemplating the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), the court concluded that a sentence of 189 months was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-16\">Williams appeals with a single argument, that the district court erred in concluding that it could not consider the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>parity between guidelines sentences for like amounts of crack and powder cocaine. Up until a few months ago, this argument would have had little prospect of success. Our circuit precedents did not permit a sentencing judge to deviate from the 100:1 ratio when calculating the correct guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Taylor, </em>520 F.3d 746, 747 (7th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Jointer, </em>457 F.3d 682, 686-88 (7th Cir.2006). Still, a judge could consider the disparity created by the 100:1 ratio when determining the appropriate <em>actual </em>sentence in light of the sentencing factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), but only to the extent that the disparity uniquely affected the individual defendant. <em>See Jointer, </em>457 F.3d at 686-88. All of that changed with the advent of <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 564, 575, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), which permits a judge, even in a typical case, to \u201cconsider the disparity between the Guidelines\u2019 treatment of crack and powder cocaine offenses\u201d when determining whether a within-guidelines sentence is greater than necessary to achieve the goals of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">We recognize that this is a somewhat unusual case with respect to <em>Kimbrough </em>because the district court determined Williams\u2019s base offense level using the drug equivalency tables found in Application Note 10 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. Yet, at the time of Williams\u2019s sentencing in early 2007, those tables included a 100:1 ratio of their own: each gram of crack amounted to 20,000 grams of marijuana while each gram of powder cocaine amounted to 200 grams of marijuana.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 Application Note 10 (2006). Williams possessed both substances, of course, but it was his crack quantity that drove his base offense level. A similar offender caught with 1.17 kilograms (the total quantity of all of Williams\u2019s drugs) of powder cocaine would have received a significantly lower base offense level of 26, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(7) (2006), so we see no impediment to Williams\u2019s argument on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">The district court could not appreciate powers it did not know it possessed. Accordingly, we VACATE Williams\u2019s sentence and REMAND for resentencing in light of <em>Kimbrough.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b517-8\">. The latest edition of the guidelines includes a new method for determining drug equivalency. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D 1.1 Application Note 10 (2007). Although each gram of powder cocaine still amounts to 200 grams of marijuana, each gram of crack now equals anywhere from 5,000 to 16,000 grams of marijuana depending on the quantity of crack involved in the offense. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
