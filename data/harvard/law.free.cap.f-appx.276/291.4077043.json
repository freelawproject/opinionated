Hernandez argues that he was entitled to a jury trial on that charge. This contention, however, is foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s holdings in <em>Blanton v. City of North Las Vegas, </em>489 U.S. 538, 541, 109 S.Ct. 1289, 103 L.Ed.2d 550 (1989) and <em>United States v. Nachtigal, </em>507 U.S. 1, 6, 113 S.Ct. 1072, 122 L.Ed.2d 374 (1993), which make clear that there is no right to a jury trial for petty offenses, and specifically, no right to a jury trial for alleged violations of 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.23(a)(1). Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">Around 1 a.m. on October 1, 2006, Hernandez was traveling northbound on the George Washington Memorial Parkway in his Jaguar when United States Park Police Officer Evan McKinney clocked his speed at approximately seventy-five miles per hour in a properly posted fifty mile-per-hour zone. After observmg Hernandez cross the center line twice, Officer McKinney initiated a traffic stop. As he approached Hernandez\u2019s car, Officer McKMney detected the smell of alcohol coming from Hernandez. Officer McKinney then admmistered standard field sobriety tests, which Hernandez did not complete successfully. Hernandez was arrested, and a chemical analysis of his blood sample confirmed that his blood alcohol level was .13g/100mL.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">On November 16, 2006, Hernandez was charged with various drivmg related offenses, mcluding possession of a Schedule IV controlled substance in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844 (amended by the supercedmg criminal information as a violation of 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.35(b)(2)) (count one); and DWI in violation of 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.23(a)(2) (count two). The DWI offense, as charged under 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.23(a)(2), carries a maximum penalty of six months\u2019 incarceration, a $5000.00 fine, and a $10.00 special assessment. 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.3(a); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3571(b)(6) and (e) (2000). As an alternative to imprisonment for a violation of 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.23(a)(1), the sentencmg court may impose a term of probation not to exceed five years. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3561(a)(3). The sentencing court has discretion to attach various conditions to the probationary term. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3563(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">Hernandez filed a motion for jury trial on the DWI offense. He argued that because this would be his third DWI conviction in five years and could potentially lead to penalties beyond the maximum six months\u2019 incarceration under the C.F.R., the charge was serious enough to warrant a Sixth Amendment right to jury trial. Relying upon the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions M <em>Blanton </em>and <em>Naehtigal, </em>the district court deMed Hernandez\u2019s motion. Specifically, the district court stated that because DWI under 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.23(a)(1) carries a maximum term of imprisonment of six months, it is presumptively a \u201cpetty\u201d offense which does not carry a right to trial by jury under the Sixth Amendment. Moreover, the district court rejected Hernandez\u2019s argument that additional penalties under either 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.23(a)(1) or under Virginia recidivism statutes transformed DWI into a \u201cserious\u201d offense for purposes of the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-11\">On March 14, 2007, Hernandez entered a guilty plea to counts one and two with a reservation of his right to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for a jury trial on the DWI offense. For count one, Hernandez was sentenced to two years\u2019 supervised probation with the special condition that he serve ten days\u2019 mcarcera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>tion, a $5000.00 f\u00edne, and a $10.00 special assessment. For count two, the DWI, Hernandez was sentenced to three years\u2019 supervised probation with the special condition that he serve sixty days\u2019 incarceration, a $1,000.00 fine, and a $10.00 special assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">Hernandez timely appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Hernandez maintains that he has a Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial on the DWI charge. In order to determine whether a right to jury trial attaches to a particular offense, courts must examine \u201cobjective indications of the seriousness with which society regards the offense.\u201d <em>Blanton, </em>489 U.S. at 541, 109 S.Ct. 1289. \u201cThe best indicator of society\u2019s views is the maximum penalty set by the legislature,\u201d with the primary emphasis being upon \u201cthe maximum authorized period of incarceration.\u201d <em>Nachtigal, </em>507 U.S. at 3, 113 S.Ct. 1072. Where a maximum prison term for an offense is no higher than six months, the offense is presumed to be \u201cpetty,\u201d even if accompanied by additional penalties, and thus no right to jury trial attaches. <em>Blanton, </em>489 U.S. at 543, 109 S.Ct. 1289. While this presumption can be overcome by a showing that such additional penalties \u201cviewed in conjunction with the maximum authorized period of incarceration ... are so severe that they clearly reflect a legislative determination that the offense in question is a \u2018serious\u2019 one,\u201d <em>id,., </em>the Supreme Court has held that the additional penalties for DWI set forth in 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.23(a)(2) do not render that offense \u201cserious\u201d for purposes of the Sixth Amendment. <em>Nachtigal, </em>507 U.S. at 5-6, 113 S.Ct. 1072.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">In the face of this directly controlling Supreme Court precedent, Hernandez nonetheless contends that his DWI is \u201cserious\u201d for Sixth Amendment purposes because of (1) \u201cadditional statutory penalties\u201d found in Virginia recidivism statutes; (2) the unique circumstances of his particular DWI offense; and (3) evolving societal views of driving while intoxicated. We address each of these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">Hernandez contends that \u201cadditional statutory penalties\u201d found in Virginia recidivism statutes \u2014 statutes under which he was not charged \u2014 render his DWI offense a \u201cserious\u201d one for Sixth Amendment purposes. Specifically, Hernandez points out that, although he was charged with DWI under 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.23(a)(2), this court should consider that had he been charged under the relevant Virginia DWI statutes, he would have been subject to a mandatory minimum prison term of six months and a minimum five year license suspension. Va.Code. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-270, - 271, 46.2-391 (2005). Hernandez also claims that the penalties contained in 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.23(a)(1) do not truly reflect a \u201clegislative\u201d judgment regarding the seriousness of the DWI offense because the relevant regulation was created by the Secretary of the Interior.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-11\">These arguments are all foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Nachtigal. </em>As to the Virginia recidivism statutes, Hernandez points to no case indicating that we should look to penalties prescribed by statutes under which he was not even charged to determine whether his crime entitles him to a jury trial. In fact, the Supreme Court expressly instructs that laws passed by different legislatures are \u201cirrelevant to the question whether a particular legislature deemed a particular offense \u2018serious.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nachtigal, </em>507 U.S. at 4, 113 S.Ct. 1072 (citing <em>Blanton, </em>489 U.S. at 545, n. 11, 109 S.Ct. 1289). Here, Hernandez faced only those penalties associated with a DWI offense charged under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>C.F.R. It is therefore the legislative judgment contained in 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.23(a)(1) and the Supreme Court\u2019s holding that \u00a7 4.23(a)(1) is a petty offense that guides our analysis and requires us to reject Hernandez\u2019s argument that \u201cadditional statutory penalties\u201d render his DWI offense \u201cserious\u201d for purposes of the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">As to the role of the Secretary of the Interior, the Supreme Court expressly held that 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.23(a)(1) is not \u201cstripped of its \u2018legislative\u2019 character merely because the Secretary [of the Interior] has final authority to decide, within the limits given by Congress, what the maximum prison sentence will be for a violation of a given regulation.\u201d <em>Nachtigal, </em>507 U.S. at 4, 113 S.Ct. 1072.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">Hernandez next contends that the unique circumstances of his particular DWI offense render it \u201cserious\u201d for purposes of the Sixth Amendment. Hernandez argues that additional penalties he potentially faced as third-time DWI offender (beyond the possibility of six months of incarceration under 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.23(a)(1)) render his particular DWI \u201cserious.\u201d Specifically, Hernandez maintains that because he faced both the possible aggregation of penalties on his two separate petty offenses and the collateral consequence of license revocation under Virginia law, he was entitled to a jury trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">Hernandez\u2019s first argument \u2014 that the potential aggregation of penalties for two separate petty offenses renders his DWI \u201cserious\u201d for Sixth Amendment purposes \u2014 is also foreclosed by Supreme Court precedent. The Supreme Court has made clear that being \u201ccharged with two counts of a petty offense does not revise the legislative judgment as to the gravity of [a] particular offense, nor does it transform the petty offense into a serious one.\u201d <em>Lewis v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 322, 327, 116 S.Ct. 2163, 135 L.Ed.2d 590 (1996). Moreover, the district court did not even impose an aggregate sentence of more than six months incarceration on the two petty offenses for which Hernandez was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-11\">Supreme Court precedent also forecloses Hernandez\u2019s argument that the loss of driving privileges he potentially faces under Virginia law for a third DWI conviction render his DWI offense \u201cserious\u201d for Sixth Amendment purposes. In <em>Nachtigal, </em>the Supreme Court held that the regulatory revocation of the defendant\u2019s license was not \u201cconstitutionally significant\u201d in regard to the right to a trial by jury. 507 U.S. at 4, 113 S.Ct. 1072. We therefore reject Hernandez\u2019s argument that the circumstances of his case render his DWI conviction uniquely \u201cserious\u201d under the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-12\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-13\">Finally, Hernandez argues that we should revisit the standard for defining the \u201cseriousness\u201d of an offense set forth by the Supreme Court in <em>Blanton </em>and find that a DWI is indeed a \u201cserious\u201d offense for purposes of the Sixth Amendment. In particular, Hernandez contends that the devel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>opment of Virginia\u2019s drunk driving laws and of society\u2019s views regarding the seriousness of drunk driving offenses demonstrate that \u201cthe line between serious and petty under the Sixth Amendment evolves.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">It goes without saying that the decisions of the Supreme Court bind the circuit courts of appeals. We accordingly shall not adopt Hernandez\u2019s proposed common-law methodology for determining whether an offense is \u201cserious\u201d for purposes of the Sixth Amendment \u2014 a methodology the Supreme Court explicitly rejected in favor of the objective, statutory-maximum-penalty analysis we applied above. <em>See, e.g., Lewis, </em>518 U.S. at 326-27, 116 S.Ct. 2163.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b319-9\">. Hernandez also argues that the mandatory minimum sentence of incarceration for a third DWI under Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-270, which might have been (but was not) imposed upon him pursuant to Virginia's comity policy, renders his DWI offense \"dramatically more serious than other six month offenses under the CFR.\u201d We again decline Hernandez\u2019s invitation to make a determination regarding the seriousness of his DWI offense based upon a survey of penalties contained in statutes under which he was neither charged nor sentenced. <em>See Nachtigal, </em>507 U.S. at 4, 113 S.Ct. 1072.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
