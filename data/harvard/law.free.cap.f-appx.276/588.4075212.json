We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 962 (9th Cir.2004), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-20\">The IJ found Shamon not credible, in part because although Shamon testified that he had been detained and severely beaten in Iraq, his asylum application omitted any mention of that occurrence. Because this omission is material and goes to the heart of Shamon\u2019s claim, the IJ\u2019s finding is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b612-21\">Because Shamon did not meet his burden to demonstrate eligibility for asylum, he necessarily fails to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See id. </em>at 964.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-22\">In the opening brief, Shamon failed to raise, and therefore has waived, any challenge to the IJ\u2019s determination that he is ineligible for CAT relief. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-23\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b612-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
