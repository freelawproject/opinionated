Having previously granted a certificate of appealability, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c) (2000), we now find the district court erred in dismissing the petition. Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand for its reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-24\">In his \u00a7 2254 petition, Preston alleged that his term of incarceration was extended because he refused to participate in a state sex offender treatment program requiring him to admit past offending behavior in violation of his Fifth Amendment right to be free from compelled self-incrimination. <em>See McKune v. Lile, </em>536 U.S. 24, 122 S.Ct. 2017, 153 L.Ed.2d 47 (2002). The district court construed Preston\u2019s petition as \u201cmerely seeking] to assert a constitutional violation stemming from his not receiving the classification level he wanted.\u201d The court further ruled Preston\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of the state program was properly brought in an action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000), not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>under \u00a7 2254. The court did not analyze Preston\u2019s claim under <em>McKune </em>but dismissed the petition after finding he had no liberty interest in his classification level.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">In his informal brief on appeal, Preston contended that the extension of his confinement as a result of his refusal to participate in the state program constituted unconstitutional compulsion under <em>McKune, </em>and the district court erred in ruling his challenge to the program was only properly brought in an action under \u00a7 1983. After granting a certificate of appealability on the issue of whether the district court erred in dismissing Preston\u2019s Fifth Amendment compelled self-incrimination claim, we directed that the Appellee file a responsive brief pursuant to 4th Cir. R. 22(a)(1)(B). In the brief, the Appellee notes that Preston\u2019s lack of a liberty interest in being placed in a particular good conduct classification level does not answer the question as to whether he can be compelled to discuss possible criminal wrongs as a condition of receiving a statutory benefit, and the framework to address this question is contained in the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>McKune.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">The Appellee asserts that because Preston challenged an alleged extension of his term of incarceration, and thus the \u201cfact or duration\u201d of his confinement, \u201chis claim must be brought as a habeas corpus action, subject to the exhaustion requirement.\u201d Because Preston acknowledged in his \u00a7 2254 petition that he did not present his claim in state court, the Appellee contends his petition should be dismissed without prejudice for failure to exhaust his state court remedies. In his reply brief, Preston responds that he must only exhaust those administrative and state court remedies that are actually available, and he asserts there were no adequate or effective state court remedies in his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">As contended by both parties on appeal, we find that Preston\u2019s claim challenging the alleged extension of his term of confinement as a violation of his Fifth Amendment right to be free from compelled self-incrimination is cognizable in a habeas action and therefore subject to the exhaustion requirement under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b). <em>See Wilkinson v. Dotson, </em>544 U.S. 74, 125 S.Ct. 1242, 161 L.Ed.2d 253 (2005); <em>Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973); <em>Todd v. Baskerville, </em>712 F.2d 70 (4th Cir.1983). We thus conclude the district court erred in dismissing Preston\u2019s petition under Rule 4 after ruling he had no liberty interest in his classification level and his claim was only properly brought in an action under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">Accordingly, we remand this case to the district court for reconsideration of Preston\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
