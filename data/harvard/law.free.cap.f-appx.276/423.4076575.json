We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">In July 2002, an Ohio court entered a consent agreement between Sarah Kirby and Charles Combs concerning the custody of their ten-month-old son, Tyler. The agreement gave Combs custody of Tyler from Sunday at 6:00 p.m. to Friday at 6:00 p.m., and it gave Kirby custody from Friday at 6:00 p.m. to Sunday at 6:00 p.m. All exchanges of Tyler, the agreement said, would \u201ctake place at [the] Franklin police department.\u201d JA 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">On at least two occasions, Combs failed to bring Tyler to the police department on Friday evening, prompting Kirby to file a motion to hold Combs in contempt of court for violating the consent agreement. On August 16, when Combs again failed to bring Tyler to the station, Kirby told the police that she \u201chad filed for contempt of court\u201d against Combs, that Combs \u201cwas supposed to bring Tyler to the station\u201d and \u201cthat there was a warrant for [Combs].\u201d JA 201. The officers responded by going to Combs\u2019 apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-12\">Combs answered the officers\u2019 knock on his door, and, after a brief discussion, the officers arrested him for violating the consent agreement. The arrest, according to all parties, occurred outside Combs\u2019 apartment. Ladawnya Carpenter, Combs\u2019 sister, who (along with Combs\u2019 mother and girlfriend) was visiting Combs at the time, told the officers that she had temporary custody papers at her house that would exonerate her brother. The officers told Carpenter to get the papers.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-13\">When Carpenter returned without the custody papers, she called Combs\u2019 attorney to determine whether the officers could arrest him without a warrant. After Carpenter handed him the phone, Officer Russell Whitman spoke to Combs\u2019 attorney, who informed him that the consent agreement had not been modified. Whitman also spoke with a representative of the Warren County Children\u2019s Services, who told him that Kirby \u201chad the right to take the child.\u201d JA 79. Whitman then took Tyler from Carpenter, carried him out of the apartment and gave him to Kirby, who was waiting in the parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-14\">According to at least one of the officers, Carpenter \u201cwas screaming profanities\u201d and \u201cthrowing objects about in the apartment\u201d as \u201cthe officers were leaving the apartment with the child.\u201d JA 62. Carpenter denies these allegations. JA 125. Carpenter followed the officers into the parking lot and ultimately was arrested for disorderly conduct, a charge later dismissed, as was the charge against Combs.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-15\">In August 2003, Combs, Tyler and Carpenter filed a \u00a7 1983 action against the City of Franklin, Kirby and Officers Bowling, Whitman and Diekman in Ohio state court. The defendants removed the action to federal court, and the officers moved for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>summary judgment on qualified-immunity grounds. The district court granted the motion with respect to the unlawful-arrest claim, holding that the officers had probable cause to arrest Combs. It denied the motion with respect to the unlawful-entry claim, reasoning in part that exigent circumstances did not justify the entry. And it denied the motion with respect to the excessive-force claim, reasoning that disputes of material fact remained over Carpenter\u2019s conduct and the officers\u2019 explanations for using force. Officers Bowling, Whitman and Diekman filed this interlocutory appeal. <em>See Mitchell v. Forsyth, </em>472 U.S. 511, 530, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">To overcome a defendant\u2019s claim of qualified immunity, a plaintiff must establish (1) that the defendant violated a \u201cconstitutional right\u201d and (2) that the right \u201cwas clearly established.\u201d <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001). We must decide the first question, the Supreme Court has instructed, before we reach the second one. <em>Id. </em>at 200-01,121 S.Ct. 2151.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">The officers start, oddly enough, by arguing that \u201c[t]he trial court erred by not granting the officers qualified immunity for the warrantless arrest claim of Charles Combs.\u201d Br. at 1. That is odd because, as we have just explained, the district court <em>granted </em>summary judgment <em>for the officers </em>on this claim. Since the officers cannot appeal a victory and since Combs has not appealed this loss, that is the end of the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">The officers next challenge the district court\u2019s conclusion that a triable issue of fact exists over Combs\u2019 unlawful-entry claim. We reject that challenge. While the officers say that Combs consented to their waiting in his apartment after his arrest and while consent is an acceptable basis for entering a person\u2019s home without a warrant, <em>see Illinois v. Rodriguez, </em>497 U.S. 177, 181, 110 S.Ct. 2793, 111 L.Ed.2d 148 (1990), the summary-judgment record establishes a dispute over whether the officers indeed had consent to enter the home. Carpenter\u2019s and Combs\u2019 affidavits, for example, both say that the officers \u201cforced their way into the apartment.\u201d JA 165, 184. Even though it remains unclear what cognizable harm Combs suffered as a result of the officers\u2019 entry \u2014 as he did not appeal the district court\u2019s conclusions that his arrest and the seizure of Tyler were lawful and as the entry seemingly benefited him by allowing his sister time to contest his arrest \u2014 we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of the officers\u2019 claim for summary judgment on Combs\u2019 unlawful-entry claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-12\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-13\">The officers next contest the district court\u2019s excessive-force ruling, arguing that the court should have rejected Carpenter\u2019s claim as a matter of law. Under the Fourth (and Fourteenth) Amendment, individuals have a right to be free of excessive force when police arrest or seize them. <em>See Lyons v. City of Xenia, </em>417 F.3d 565, 575 (6th Cir.2005). Whether excessive force exists turns on the objective reasonableness of the officer\u2019s conduct in view of the circumstances facing the officer, an inquiry that accounts for \u201c[1] the severity of the crime at issue, [2] whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others, and [3] whether [the suspect] is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>omitted and alterations in original); <em>see also Graham v. Connor, </em>490 U.S. 386, 394-96, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">When we construe the facts in Carpenter\u2019s favor, as we must, here is what happened: After the officers removed Tyler from the apartment and gave him to Kirby, Carpenter waited a moment, then went outside. Upon emerging from the building, Carpenter saw Kirby 30 to 40 feet away and shouted, \u201cremember, Sunday at 6:00,\u201d reminding Kirby of her obligation to return Tyler to Combs on Sunday evening. JA 126. Carpenter insists she never cursed at Kirby and \u201cwasn\u2019t threatening [her].\u201d JA 128.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">\u201cBefore [Carpenter] could even get [her] breath back [from shouting at Kirby], Officer Bowling had ahold of [her], screaming that he had had it with [her and] was sick of [her].\u201d <em>Id. </em>After grabbing Carpenter from behind by both arms, Bowling \u201cproceeded to shove [her] down the sidewalk,\u201d JA 129, and \u201cbody slammed [her] into a van parked in front of the apartments,\u201d JA 181. All the while, Carpenter was telling Bowling that he did not \u201chave to do this\u201d because she would voluntarily \u201cturn around and let [him] arrest [her].\u201d JA 129. After pinning Carpenter against the van, Bowling \u201cjerk[ed] hard on [her] arms,\u201d JA 132, and Officer Diekman \u201cstuck his knee in [Carpenter\u2019s] back\u201d and \u201cgrabbed [Carpenter\u2019s] other shoulder,\u201d JA 131. The officers then \u201crepeatedly crushed [Carpenter] against the van while pulling back on both [of her] arms,\u201d making \u201ca dent in the van.\u201d JA 186. \u201c[N]ot sure what [the officers were] doing\u201d \u2014 trying to handcuff her or injure her \u2014 Carpenter told them that \u201cthey were hurting [her]\u201d and \u201ccontinuously sa[id] please don\u2019t do this. I will stand up. I will let you handcuff me. I will let you arrest me. You don\u2019t have to do this to me.\u201d JA 131-32. Carpenter thus \u201cwasn\u2019t fighting [the officers]\u201d and \u201cwasn\u2019t resisting arrest,\u201d though she admits that she lifted her head several times to plead for mercy. JA 132. Carpenter felt her \u201cshoulder pop[ ]\u201d while the officers jerked her arms, JA 131, and suffered injuries to her arms and shoulders during the arrest, requiring an emergency-room visit on the day after the arrest and periodic medical treatment and physical therapy since then.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">As measured by the three factors identified in <em>Lyons </em>and <em>Graham, </em>these record-supported allegations create a triable issue of fact over whether the officers used excessive force. <em>First, </em>the charge at issue was disorderly conduct, and \u201c[t]he crime of disorderly conduct\u201d generally \u201cis not a violent or serious crime, and this fact weighs in favor of using less force in arresting [someone for such conduct].\u201d <em>Thacker v. Lawrence County, </em>182 Fed.Appx. 464, 472 (6th Cir.2006). <em>Second, </em>nothing suggests that Carpenter posed a threat to the officers, and although Carpenter raised her voice at Kirby (who was 30 or 40 feet away) she \u201cwasn\u2019t threatening her,\u201d never cursed at her, was \u201cnot angry\u201d with her and never made a move toward Kirby. JA 126, 128. <em>Third, </em>nothing suggests that Carpenter posed a risk of flight. \u201cAt all times,\u201d Carpenter \u201ctold Bowling that [she] was not going to resist him,\u201d and yet he still \u201cwas hurting [her].\u201d JA 186. In view of the non-threatening nature of Carpenter\u2019s offense, the absence of any resistance by Carpenter and the absence of any threat to anyone, a jury crediting these fact-supported allegations could find that the officers used constitutionally excessive force.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">The district court also correctly determined that case law clearly established this constitutional claim. <em>See St. John v. Hickey, </em>411 F.3d 762, 772, 774 (6th Cir. 2005) (\u201c[W]e conclude the right of a nonviolent [and non-resistant] arrestee to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>free from unnecessary pain knowingly inflicted during an arrest [for disorderly conduct] was clearly established as of November 9, 2000.\u201d); <em>see also Minchella v. Bauman, </em>72 Fed.Appx. 405, 408-09 (6th Cir.2003) (denying summary judgment to officers on an excessive-force claim \u2014 relating to an arrest in 1999 \u2014 because the plaintiffs \u201ccrime was not severe,\u201d the plaintiff \u201cposed no threat to the Officers or the community\u201d and the evidence was \u201cinconclusive as to whether [the plaintiff] was \u2018slammed\u2019 into the car, and ... as to whether [the plaintiff] physically resisted the arrest\u201d); <em>Davis v. Yovella, </em>No. 95-5415, 1997 WL 159363, at *5-6 (6th Cir. Apr. 2, 1997) (denying qualified immunity to an officer on an excessive-force claim because \u201cthe charges against [the plaintiff] ... were not serious,\u201d \u201cthere [was] no evidence that [the plaintiff] posed a risk to the officers or anyone present,\u201d \u201cthe record show[ed] that he did not resist arrest\u201d and the plaintiff \u201csought medical attention for pain in his neck and back\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">The officers complain that this conclusion fails to appreciate the risk of escalation they faced \u2014 as Carpenter was visibly upset about the situation with her brother, had voiced her frustrations to the officers and had previously been accused of harassing Kirby (several months earlier). Yet virtually any arrest of an individual by the police poses a risk of resistance and escalation. The question is whether that risk was real at the time the officers used force and, more pertinently, whether a triable issue of fact exists over that risk. Carpenter was 30 or 40 feet from Kirby and claims not to have done anything more than remind Kirby to return Tyler on Sunday. A jury could thus reasonably conclude, if it credited these factual allegations, that the police had no basis for immediately grabbing, shoving, body slamming and repeatedly crushing Carpenter against a van to prevent the situation from escalating. Even if we were to grant the officers\u2019 premise that they had a reasonable basis for fearing that the situation might escalate, moreover, that would not necessarily justify repeatedly crushing Carpenter against a van while jerking back hard on her arms \u2014 all in the context of arresting her for a relatively minor and non-threatening crime, one for which she \u201c[a]t all times\u201d did not resist the officers (save for raising her head to ask them to stop).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">The officers also contend that the district court should have ruled for them as a matter of law because Carpenter\u2019s injuries were either <em>de minimis </em>(temporary scrapes and red marks) or pre-existing (her alleged shoulder injuries). But the record does not unequivocally establish either point. Carpenter went to the emergency room on the day after her arrest, complaining of shoulder pain and bruising, and she has \u201cactively receiv[ed] medical treatment for the injuries caused by the Franklin police officers.\u201d JA 186. While Carpenter previously had surgery on her left shoulder, that shoulder was \u201cback to normal\u201d by 1995 or 1996, well before her arrest. JA 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">The officers add that Sergeant Whitman played no role in the arrest and indeed that Carpenter did not even allege that he participated in Carpenter\u2019s arrest. Both contentions fail to account for Whitman\u2019s affidavit, in which he admitted that he \u201cassisted Officer Bowling [in] handcuffing] Carpenter\u201d and in which he \u201cdenied] Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that [he] pushed or slammed Carpenter into a van.\u201d JA 80. The second amended complaint, as well as other evidence in the record, shows that Carpenter did implicate Whitman in her claim. <em>See </em>JA 14 (alleging that \u201cBowling, <em>Whitman </em>[and] Diekman\u201d arrested Carpenter \u201cwith unreasonable and excessive force\u201d) (emphasis added); JA 186 (Carpen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>ter\u2019s affidavit indicating that \u201cOfficer Bowling and the <em>two </em>other Franklin Police officers forcibly pushed [her] into the side of a van parked in the parking lot and made a dent in the van with [her] body\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">The resolution of Carpenter\u2019s excessive-force claim in the end turns on several genuine issues of material fact, including at a minimum these: Was Carpenter walking toward, cursing at or otherwise threatening Kirby at the time of her arrest? Did the officers repeatedly body slam or crush Carpenter against the van and jerk back unreasonably hard on her arms? And did Carpenter resist the arrest or the officers\u2019 attempt to handcuff her? \u201c[W]hen the legal question of immunity is completely dependent upon which view of the facts is accepted by the jury, the jury becomes the final arbiter of a claim of immunity.\u201d <em>Bouggess v. Mattingly, </em>482 F.3d 886, 888 (6th Cir.2007) (internal quotation mai\u2019ks and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">For these reasons, we affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
