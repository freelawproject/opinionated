First, he contends that the District Court failed to rule on his request for a variance based upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>the unwarranted sentencing disparity between penalties for crack cocaine and powder cocaine offenses. Second, he contends that the District Court\u2019s imposition of a $2,000 fine, without evaluating his ability to pay the fine, was error. We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">At sentencing, Barney sought a variance based upon the significantly greater sentences recommended in the Guidelines for offenses involving crack cocaine, as compared to those for offenses involving powder cocaine. Barney contends that the District Court did not make \u201ca definitive ruling\u201d on this request. (Appellant\u2019s Br. 11.) Barney notes, however, that the District Court specifically recognized that it was appropriate for the Court to consider the disparity as a factor under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a) in deciding whether a sentence below the advisory Guidelines would be appropriate. Barney faults the District Court, however, for failing to \u201cfulfill its responsibility to exercise its discretion in determining whether a variance was appropriate in this particular case.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Br. 11.)</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Barney is apparently relying upon our case law in <em>United States v. Gunter, </em>462 F.3d 237 (3d Cir.2006), and <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>467 F.3d 834 (3rd Cir.2006). However, in those cases, the relevant language is that the courts ought \u201cto exercise their discretion by considering the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors in setting the sentence they impose regardless whether it varies from the sentence calculated under the Guidelines.\u201d <em>Gunter, </em>462 F.3d at 247 (internal quotation marks, brackets, and citations omitted); <em>Jackson, </em>467 F.3d at 837 <em>(iquoting </em>Gunter). We find no requirement in our case law for the District Court to do more than it did here, where, as Barney acknowledges, it considered the disparity as a factor in its analysis under \u00a7 3553(a). Accordingly, we find no error in the District Court\u2019s analysis or resulting sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">With respect to the proof required in order for the District Court to impose a fine, Barney acknowledges that the burden of proving inability to pay the fine is on the defendant. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5E1.2(a); <em>see also United States v. Carr, </em>25 F.3d 1194, 1211 (3d Cir.1994) (\u201cImposing a fine based solely on future ability to pay is permissible.\u201d). We note that we review this ruling for plain error, as no objection was lodged before the District Court. In imposing the $2,000 fine, the District Court ordered that any portion of the fine that remained unpaid prior to the commencement of Barney\u2019s 4-year term of supervised release would be payable in monthly installments of $43.00 during supervised release. (App.6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">The Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) concluded that although Barney could not pay a fine within the Guidelines range of $15,000 to $2,000,000, he could begin paying a smaller fine through the Inmate Financial Responsibility Program if incarcerated. (PSR 111162, 73.) It is clear from the PSR that Barney was in good health, had graduated from high school, had earned (then lost) a scholarship to play football at Temple University, and had been employed in the past in a variety of capacities, earning as much as $10 per hour and $100 per day. (PSR UU 53, 57-60.) In its Statement of Reasons, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>Court adopted the PSR \u201cwithout change.\u201d <em>See United States v. Torres, </em>209 F.3d 308, 314 (3d Cir.2000) (\u201c[T]his Court\u2019s requirement of specific findings will be satisfied if the District Court adopts a PSR which contains adequate factual findings with reference to an ability to pay such that there can be effective appellate review.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">In light of Barney\u2019s failure to argue or demonstrate that he was unable to pay a relatively small ($2,000) fine, especially in monthly installments, the District Court\u2019s decision to impose the fine was not error, let alone plain error. <em>See Torres, </em>209 F.3d at 313 (\u201c[Wjhere ... a defendant, whose burden it was to prove his or her inability to pay by a preponderance of the evidence, made utterly no showing in that regard and took no issue with facts of record showing an ability to pay, error sufficient to warrant relief must be very plain, indeed.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">In light of the foregoing, the Judgment and Commitment Order of the District Court will be AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b229-7\">. Our decision is rendered without prejudice to any right Barney may have to pursue a reduced sentence in the District Court, pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based upon the Sentencing Commission\u2019s authorization of sentence reductions for defendants whose Guidelines ranges were lowered by the November 1, 2007 amendment to the crack cocaine sentencing ranges. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 (Nov. 1, 2007); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 (Mar. 3, 2008); 73 Fed.Reg. 217-01 (Jan. 2, 2008); <em>United States v. Wise, </em>515 F.3d 207, 221 (3d Cir. 2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
