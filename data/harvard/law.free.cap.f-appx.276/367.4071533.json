Krezdorn contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress his March 12, 2003 sworn confession because law enforcement failed to inform him of his rights under <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 479, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). He alternatively argues that his confession was not voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>\u201cWe have long pitched the standard of review for a motion to suppress based on live testimony at a suppression hearing at a high level.\u201d <em>United States v. Randall, </em>887 F.2d 1262, 1265 (5th Cir.1989). \u201cIn reviewing the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, we review the district court\u2019s factual findings, including its credibility choices, for clear error, and its legal conclusions <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Solis, </em>299 F.3d 420, 435 (5th Cir.2002). \u201cA factual finding is not clearly erroneous as long as it is plausible in light of the record as a whole.\u201d <em>United States v. Jacquinot, 258 </em>F.3d 423, 427 (5th Cir.2001). Suppression hearing evidence must be \u201cviewed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">A person subject to interrogation by government agents need be Mirandized \u201conly where there has been such a restriction on a person\u2019s freedom as to render him in custody.\u201d <em>Oregon v. Mathiason, </em>429 U.S. 492, 495, 97 S.Ct. 711, 50 L.Ed.2d 714 (1977). A person not formally arrested is deemed to be in custody \u201cwhen a reasonable person in the suspect\u2019s position would have understood the situation to constitute a restraint on freedom of movement of the degree which the law associates with formal arrest.\u201d <em>United States v. Courtney, </em>463 F.3d 333, 337 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">\u201cA confession is voluntary if, under the totality of the circumstances, the statement is the product of the accused\u2019s free and rational choice.\u201d <em>United States v. Bell, </em>367 F.3d 452, 461 (5th Cir.2004) (citation omitted). The Government bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a challenged confession was voluntary. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Although signed at the United States Customs Office, Krezdorn\u2019s affidavit states that his confession was given voluntarily and that he understood that he was not in custody. At the hearing, agents testified that they told Krezdorn that he was free to leave at any time. The agents also testified that that they were neither armed nor in uniform when they met with Krezdorn, that they neither threatened him nor promised him leniency, that they neither frisked nor handcuffed him, that he did not ask to speak to a lawyer or stop the interview at any point, and that he contributed to and reviewed the affidavit prior to signing. Although Krezdorn contradicted most of the agent\u2019s assertions, the district court did not find him credible, and he makes no showing that the court\u2019s credibility determination was clearly erroneous. Under these circumstances, the district court did not err in denying the motion to suppress. <em>See Courtney, </em>463 F.3d at 337 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Bell, </em>367 F.3d at 461.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b391-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
