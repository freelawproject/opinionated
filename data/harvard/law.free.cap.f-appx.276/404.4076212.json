Morales argues that the district court erred in denying her request for a reduction based on a minor or minimal role under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-28\">Whether a defendant is a minor or minimal participant is a factual determination reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 &amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>n. 9 (5th Cir.2005). The defendant\u2019s role is not evaluated in reference to the entire criminal enterprise but in relation to the conduct for which he is held accountable. <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>242 F.3d 593, 598 (5th Cir.2001). Given that Morales knew drugs were being transported in the vehicle and allowed the vehicle to be purchased in her name in exchange for compensation, the district court did not clearly err in concluding that a \u00a7 3B1.2 adjustment was not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Morales also argues that her within guidelines sentence is unreasonable because the district court failed to account for her mental disabilities and gave significant weight to the fact that she was to receive compensation for her role in the offense. Morales did not object in the district court to the reasonableness of her sentence; thus, review if for plain error. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 392 (5th Cir.2007). Because Morales was sentenced within a properly calculated guidelines range, her sentence is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 553-54 (5th Cir.2006). In reviewing a sentence for reasonableness, this court examines whether the district court\u2019s sentence failed to \u201caccount for a factor that should have received significant weight,\u201d gave \u201csignificant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor,\u201d or represented \u201ca clear error of judgment in balancing the sentencing factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Nikonova, </em>480 F.3d 371, 376 (5th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 163, 169 L.Ed.2d 112 (2007). A review of the record results in the finding that Morales\u2019s sentence does not fall \u201cso far afoul\u201d of one of these standards as to represent a clear abuse of the court\u2019s broad sentencing discretion. <em>See Nikonova, </em>480 F.3d at 376-77. The district court did not commit plain error. <em>See Peltier, </em>505 F.3d at 392. Morales further contends that her sentence is unreasonable because this court\u2019s rulings after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), have effectively reinstated the mandatory guidelines regime condemned in <em>Booker. </em>Morales concedes that this argument is foreclosed under circuit precedent but seeks to preserve it for further review in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s grant of certiorari in <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2933, 168 L.Ed.2d 261 (2007), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>- U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2933, 168 L.Ed.2d 261 (2007). Both <em>Kimbrough </em>and <em>Gall </em>have now been decided, and these decisions do not impact this court\u2019s review of the reasonableness of Morales\u2019s sentence. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-16\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b428-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
