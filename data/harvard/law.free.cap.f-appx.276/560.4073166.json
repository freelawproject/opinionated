In his motion, which the BIA construed as a motion to reconsider, petitioner renewed his argument that his long-term permanent resident parents and his two United States citizen children would experience exceptional and extremely unusual hardship. We dismiss the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-24\">The argument that petitioner presented in his motion to reconsider concerned the same basic hardship grounds as his application for cancellation of removal, and we therefore lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s discretionary determination that the evidence was insufficient to establish a prima facie case of hardship. <em>See Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 601-03 (9th Cir.2006). We lack jurisdiction to consider petitioner\u2019s challenge to the underlying removal order because the petition for review is not timely as to that order. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b584-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
