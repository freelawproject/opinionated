POOLER, Circuit Judges, DENISE COTE,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> District Judge.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b122-12\"> The Honorable Denise Cote, United States District Judge for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b122-9\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">Anthony Ortiz appeals from the district court\u2019s March 30, 2005 summary-judgment dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, proceedings below, and specification of issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-11\">\u201cDefendants may be held liable under \u00a7 1983 if they ... exhibited deliberate indifference to a known injury, a known risk, or a specific duty, and their failure to perform the duty or act to ameliorate the risk or injury was a proximate cause of plaintiffs deprivation of rights under the Constitution.\u201d <em>Doe v. New York City Dep\u2019t of Social Servs., </em>649 F.2d 134, 145 (2d Cir.1981). Deliberate indifference is found in the Eighth Amendment context when a prison supervisor \u201cknows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety.... Whether one puts it in terms of duty or deliberate indifference, prison officials who act reasonably cannot be found liable under the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause.\u201d <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 837, 844-45, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-15\">Ortiz challenges the district court\u2019s decision only with respect to defendant Lacey. Construing all evidence in the manner most favorable to Ortiz, as nonmoving party, we find that he has not established a genuine issue of material fact with respect to the reasonableness of Lacey\u2019s actions in response to allegations of defendant Gar-rant\u2019s misconduct at Bare Hill Correctional Facility. The record shows that Lacey initiated and cooperated with an assiduous investigation of Garrant by the Inspector General\u2019s Office. While relocating Garrant to another prison would have prevented his assault of Ortiz, it would have risked warning Garrant he was being investigated and would not have stopped him from preying on other inmates. Moreover, although the Inspector General\u2019s investigation of Garrant did not substantiate inmates\u2019 allegations of Garrant\u2019s misconduct until Garrant assaulted Ortiz, there is no evidence in the record that the investigation was \u201cinadequate or incompetent.\u201d <em>Cecere v. New York, </em>967 F.2d 826, 829 (2d Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-16\">We, therefore, affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
