Agha appeals pro se from the district court\u2019s judgment for defendants after a bench trial in his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action alleging that defendants violated his Fourth Amendment rights by using excessive force when arresting him. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review for clear error factual conclusions and review de novo legal conclusions. <em>Friends of Yosemite Valley v. Norton, </em>348 F.3d 789, 793 (9th Cir.2003). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">The district court did not clearly err when it concluded that the officer did not use excessive force when arresting Agha. <em>See Saman v. Robbins, </em>173 F.3d 1150, 1155-56 (9th Cir.1999). Further, because Agha failed to prove his excessive force claim, his related state and federal claims fail. <em>See id. </em>at 1157 n. 6 (\u201cA prima facie case for battery is not established under California law unless the plaintiff proves that an officer used unreasonable force against him to make a lawful arrest or detention.\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 1157 (stating that the question of whether the City had a policy authorizing or condoning the use of excessive force is moot if plaintiff cannot show a constitutional deprivation). Similarly, the district court properly granted summary judgment on Agha\u2019s false arrest claim because it is undisputed that Agha refused to sign the notice to appear. <em>See </em>Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 853.5(a) (stating that the failure to sign the notice to appear permits arrest and detention); <em>Henry v. County of Shasta, </em>132 F.3d 512, 522 n. 17 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Agha contends that he did not receive a fair trial. The district court did not abuse its discretion in conducting Agha\u2019s bench trial. <em>See Navellier v. Sletten, </em>262 F.3d 923, 941 (9th Cir.2001) (stating trial courts have broad authority to impose reasonable time limits). Agha\u2019s claim of judicial bias, raised for the first time on appeal, is not supported by the record. <em>See King v. U.S. Dist. Court, </em>16 F.3d 992, 993 (9th Cir. 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">Agha\u2019s remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b604-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
