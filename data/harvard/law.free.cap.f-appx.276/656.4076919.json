Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-23\">Alvarez Estrada contends that the immigration judge erred in concluding that she failed to establish a prima facie case of eligibility for relief under the Convention. The generalized evidence attached to her motion did not meet the CAT standard. <em>See Nuru v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 1207, 1216 (9th Cir.2005) (holding that CAT applicant must establish that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if removed to his native country); <em>Ordonez v. INS, </em>345 F.3d 777, 785 (9th Cir.2003) (holding that motion to reopen must establish prima facie case demonstrating reasonable likelihood that requirements for relief have been satisfied).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-24\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b680-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
