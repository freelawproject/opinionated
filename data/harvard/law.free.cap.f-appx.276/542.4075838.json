After careful de novo review, <em>see Stalley ex rel. United States v. Catholic Health Initiatives, </em>509 F.3d 517, 521 (8th Cir.2007); <em>Westcott v. City of Omaha, </em>901 F.2d 1486, 1488 (8th Cir.1990), we conclude that dismissal of the federal claims was proper. We also conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying appointment of counsel, <em>see Phillips v. Jasper County Jail, </em>437 F.3d 791, 794 (8th Cir.2006) (standard of review), or preliminary injunctive relief, <em>see Blue Moon Entm\u2019t, LLC v. City of Bates City, Mo., </em>441 F.3d 561, 564 (8th Cir.2006) (standard of review). Finally, the court also did not abuse its discretion in declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Smith\u2019s state law claims, which the court properly dismissed without prejudice. <em>See Labickas v. Ark. State Univ., </em>78 F.3d 333, 334-35 (8th Cir.1996) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-21\">The judgment is affirmed. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b566-17\">.
