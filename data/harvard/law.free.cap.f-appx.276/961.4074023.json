He contends the BIA erred by denying his motion in light of new, previously unavailable affidavits from his brothers, stating that guerillas believed he was a political activist. He asserts these new affidavits establish he will be persecuted for his imputed political opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-10\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for an abuse of discretion. <em>Li v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>488 F.3d 1371, 1374 (11th Cir.2007). In this area, the BIA\u2019s discretion is \u201cquite broad.\u201d <em>Anin v. Reno, </em>188 F.3d 1273, 1276 (11th Cir.1999). The BIA \u201cshould have the right to be restrictive\u201d in granting motions to reopen because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AP\">[granting such motions too freely will permit endless delay of deportation by aliens creative and fertile enough to continuously produce new and material facts sufficient to establish a prima facie case. It will also waste the time and efforts of immigration judges called upon to preside at hearings automatically required by the prima facie allegations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b986-12\"><em>INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 108 S.Ct. 904, 913, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b986-13\">An alien who has been ordered removed may file one motion to reopen proceedings, in which he must set forth the new facts to be proved at a reopened proceeding, supported by evidentiary material. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A), (B). The BIA has the authority to reopen any case upon which it has rendered a decision if it finds the \u201cevidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1). The BIA may deny a motion to reopen \u201cfor at least three reasons: (1) failure to establish a prima facie case of eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal; (2) failure to introduce evidence that was material and previously unavailable; and (3) a determination that despite the alien\u2019s statutory eligibility for relief, he or she is not entitled to a favorable exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>Li, </em>488 F.3d at 1374-75.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-14\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Restrepo\u2019s motion to reopen his removal proceedings. The BIA found Restrepo\u2019s brothers\u2019 affidavits contradicted both (1) Restrepo\u2019s prior characterization of his political activity as limited, and (2) Restrepo\u2019s written statement, which made no reference to any political activity. While Restrepo argues his brothers\u2019 statements demonstrated the FARC imputed a political opinion upon him, the BIA reasonably found that neither the brothers\u2019 affidavits, nor any other evidence in the record, explained why anyone would consider him a political activist, much less the best one in his department. These shortcom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>ings warranted the BIA\u2019s decision to deny the motion on the bases that (1) Restrepo failed to establish a prima facie ease of eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal; and (2) even had he demonstrated eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal, he was not entitled to a favorable exercise of discretion. <em>See Li </em>488 F.3d at 1374-75. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
