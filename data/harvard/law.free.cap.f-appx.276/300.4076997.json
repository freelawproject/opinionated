Because the Board affirmed the immigration judge\u2019s ruling without opinion, we review the immigration judge\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>Lin-Jian v. Gonzales, </em>489 F.3d 182, 187 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Kamga challenges the immigration judge\u2019s finding that his testimony was not credible and that he otherwise failed to meet his burden of proving his eligibility for asylum. We will reverse this decision only if the evidence \u201cwas so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution,\u201d <em>Rush v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted), and we uphold a negative credibility determination if it is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Tewabe v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 533, 538 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">We have reviewed the administrative record and the immigration judge\u2019s decision. We find that substantial evidence supports the immigration judge\u2019s adverse credibility finding and the ruling that Kamga failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution, as necessary to establish eligibility for asylum. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2007) (stating that the burden of proof is on the alien to establish eligibility for asylum); <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (same). Moreover, as Kamga cannot sustain his burden on the asylum claim, he cannot establish his entitlement to withholding of removal. <em>See Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004) (\u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum \u2014 even though the facts that must be proved are the same \u2014 an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.A.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3) [ (West 2005) ].\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">We also find that substantial evidence supports the finding that Kamga is not entitled to relief under the Convention Against Torture. To obtain such relief, an applicant must establish \u201cit is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2007). We find the immigration judge applied the proper standard to assess the evidence, and Kamga failed to make the requisite showing before the immigration court.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
