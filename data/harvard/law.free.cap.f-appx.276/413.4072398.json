Hampton, attorney-at-law appearing <em>pro se, </em>appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Defendant-Appellee Remigio Segura, individually and in his official capacity as a certified court reporter. As Hampton has failed to establish genuine issues of material fact regarding her 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim, we affirm the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">In 2004, Hampton was retained by Walter Coburn to represent him in a dispute over his election as sheriff of Winston County, Mississippi.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Coburn and Hampton appeared at the Winston County Courthouse on April 26, 2004, for an initial hearing on the election-related matter, but Winston County Circuit Judge Vernon Cotton postponed this hearing (apparently because of that court\u2019s observance of Confederate Memorial Day) until August 27, 2004. Judge Cotton wrote two letters to Hampton informing her of the change of date, but Hampton did not appear at the August 2004 hearing, and did not respond to repeated phone calls from Judge Cotton on the date of the hearing requesting her presence in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">In September 2004, Judge Cotton found Hampton in criminal contempt for her failure to appear at the August 2004 hearing. Segura served as the court reporter during this contempt proceeding, at which Hampton was present, and prepared a transcript for the purpose of an appeal by Hampton to the Mississippi Supreme Court. In January 2006, that court affirmed Judge Cotton\u2019s contempt ruling against Hampton.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">By the time of the Mississippi Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, Hampton had filed two suits in federal court related to Judge Cotton\u2019s decision to hold her in criminal contempt. The first of these suits involved claims by Hampton against a Winston County prosecutor and a justice court judge for, <em>inter alia, </em>refusing to pursue criminal charges against Judge Cotton and Segura. In September 2006, the district court dismissed that suit on summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">In the instant suit, Hampton has asserted claims directly against Segura alleging that, while acting under color of state law as a court reporter, he deprived her of liberty, due process, and a fair trial by inserting altered and false written statements into the transcript of the September 2004 contempt hearing. The district court held that Hampton had failed to establish genuine issues of fact regarding any material alteration of the transcript that might support a finding that Segura had violated Hampton\u2019s constitutional rights, and granted Segura\u2019s motion for summary judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c). Hampton timely filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b438-10\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>A motion for summary judgment should be granted only when there is no genuine issue of material fact.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In determining whether there is a genuine issue of material fact, we view all facts and draw all inferences therefrom in favor of the non-moving party.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But \u201c[wjhere the non-moving party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>fails to establish \u2018the existence of an element essential to that party\u2019s ease, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial,\u2019 no genuine issue of material fact can exist.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Hampton has failed to establish genuine issues of fact regarding any material alterations to the transcript of her September 2004 contempt proceeding in support of her constitutional claims. As we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment on this basis, we need not address whether Hampton\u2019s claims are precluded or barred by (1) the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (2) <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel, or (3) absolute or qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">Hampton has offered evidence in the form of affidavits from witnesses present during the September 2004 contempt proceeding, as well as excerpts from her own arguments during this proceeding, in an effort to support her contention that inaccuracies in the trial transcript generated by Segura violated her constitutional rights. We do not dispute that Segura\u2019s work as a court reporter at Hampton\u2019s September 2004 contempt trial was less than perfect. Hampton does not, however, have a constitutional right to a \u201ctotally accurate transcript.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Even though Hampton has successfully disputed the accuracy of the transcript produced by Segura, she has failed to explain how the inaccuracies <em>materially </em>altered the transcript such that her constitutional rights were violated. When the subject transcript was reviewed by an independent court reporter at Hampton\u2019s request, that reporter found that the \u201cchanges that were necessary ... to the submitted transcript <em>... do not in any way materially alter the testimony and evidence </em>____\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The district court, after conducting its own review of Segura\u2019s transcript and Hampton\u2019s exhibits, came to the same conclusion. Similarly, although we can see the flaws in Segura\u2019s transcript highlighted by Hampton, we are unable to find any material alterations to the transcript that suggest Segura\u2019s inaccurate reporting somehow violated Hampton\u2019s constitutional rights. Hampton deems the inaccuracies in the transcript to be conclusive proof that Seguara violated her constitutional rights, but Segura\u2019s negligence in transcription, by itself, is insufficient to support Hampton\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-16\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b439-17\">Hampton has provided affidavits and witness statements sufficient to impugn the accuracy <em>vel non </em>of Segura\u2019s trial transcript, but she has provided no evidence sufficient to establish genuine issues of fact regarding material alterations to the transcript of her September 2004 contempt proceeding such that these inaccuracies violated her constitutional rights. The district court\u2019s summary judgment dismissing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>Hampton\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim against Segura is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b437-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
