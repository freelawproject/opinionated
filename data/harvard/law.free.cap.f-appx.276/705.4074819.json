We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>\u00a7 1252. Reviewing de novo, <em>SandovalLua v. Gonzales, </em>499 F.3d 1121, 1126 (9th Cir.2007), we grant the petition and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">The BIA erred in concluding that Gomez-Gomez was convicted of two crimes involving moral turpitude. With respect to the 1997 offense, \u201c[w]e have before us a record of conviction that is inconclusive,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1132, regarding whether the charge resulted in a \u201ccite and release.\u201d Gomez-Gomez has therefore met his burden of showing that he was not convicted of two crimes involving moral turpitude. <em>Id. </em>We remand for reconsideration of his application for cancellation of removal and, if necessary, his eligibility for voluntary departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b729-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
