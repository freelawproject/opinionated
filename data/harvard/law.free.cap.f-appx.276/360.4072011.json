Although the parties dispute some of the surrounding events, they agree that Vollbraeht punched Berry multiple times after Berry approached Vollbraeht, causing serious injury, and that Berry never hit Vollbraeht. Vollbraeht was eventually tried and convicted of simple assault in Mississippi state court, Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 97-3-7 (2001), his self-defense argument failing. Berry sued Vollbraeht for civil assault, obtaining a default judgment that was later set aside. Partially as the result of that judgment, Vollbraeht filed for bankruptcy. Berry filed an adversary complaint, seeking a ruling that any judgment stemming from the altercation would be non-dischargeable under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(6), which renders non-dis-chargeable debts arising from \u201cwillful and malicious injury by the debtor to another entity or to the property of another entity.\u201d The bankruptcy court found the debt dischargeable. The district court affirmed, and Berry appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-15\">In <em>Kawaauhau v. Geiger,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Supreme Court held that a doctor\u2019s negligent prescription of oral penicillin instead of IV penicillin was not \u201cwillful and malicious\u201d conduct under \u00a7 523(a)(6). The Court explained that, for a debt to be non-dis-chargeable under \u00a7 523(a)(6), there must be \u201ca deliberate or intentional <em>injury, </em>not merely a deliberate or intentional <em>act </em>that leads to injury.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In explaining <em>Kawaauhau </em>and discussing the dilemma of proving a defendant\u2019s subjective motive, we have restated the current test as follows: \u201cThe test for willful and malicious injury under \u00a7 523(a)(6), thus, is condensed into a single inquiry of whether there exists \u2018either an objective substantial certainty of harm or a subjective motive to cause harm\u2019 on the part of the debtor.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because debtors generally deny that they had a subjective motive to cause harm, most cases that hold debts to be non-dischargeable do so by determining whether \u201c[the debtor\u2019s] actions were at least substantially certain to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>result in injury.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">Although the bankruptcy and district courts cited the above cases and the central subjective/objective test, the bankruptcy court, summarily affirmed by the district court, applied only the subjective test, finding that Vollbraeht \u201cdid not intend the consequences of the seriousness of the blow that he inflicted.\u201d But the subjective test requires only that Vollbraeht intended some harm, not just serious harm.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Here, Vollbraeht obviously intended some harm. Moreover, the courts seemingly did not apply the objective test.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> To the extent they did \u2014 concluding, as a matter of law, that Vollbracht\u2019s intentional<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> punches were not objectively, substantially certain to cause harm \u2014 we disagree. Vollbracht\u2019s haymakers, like most garden-variety punches to the face, are objectively very likely to cause harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">However, the transcript reveals that the lower courts were concerned mainly that Vollbracht\u2019s punches were delivered in self-defense, or at least that Vollbraeht was less culpable given Berry\u2019s actions. We similarly recognize that an injury levied as a legitimate response to someone else\u2019s actions is usually the result of a \u201csubjective motive to cause harm\u201d and actions that can have an \u201cobjective substantial certainty\u201d of causing harm. Yet such an injury cannot be \u201cwillful and malicious\u201d under \u00a7 523(a)(6). Consequently, we hold that our two-part test must countenance the actions of the injured party. That is, for an injury to be \u201cwillful and malicious\u201d it must satisfy our two-part test and not be sufficiently justified under the circumstances to render it not \u201cwillful and malicious.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-12\">In applying an objective test for willful and malicious behavior, the district court is not estopped from reconsidering question of self-defense.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We address the narrower issue of collateral estoppel (issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>preclusion<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>) and the broader principle of res judicata (claim preclusion<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>) together here, asking whether the bankruptcy court on remand must adopt the state court judgment \u2014 which found that Vollbracht did not act in self-defense \u2014 when determining whether Vollbraeht\u2019s conduct was \u201cwillful and malicious.\u201d We have noted the difference between these two principles in <em>Shuler, </em>another bankruptcy case, stating that while \u201c \u2018res judicata forecloses all that which might have been litigated previously, collateral estoppel treats as final only those questions actually and necessarily decided in a prior suit ....\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> yet we have also recognized the modern tendency to address the two issues under the broader term of \u201cres judicata.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In the Fifth Circuit, we generally apply collateral estoppel when \u201c(i) the issue to be precluded [is] identical to that involved in the prior action, (ii) in the prior action the issue [was] actually litigated, and (iii) the determination made of the issue in the prior action [was] necessary to the resulting judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> For res judicata, we require that \u201c(1) The parties be identical in both suits, (2) a court of competent jurisdiction rendered the prior judgment, (3) There was a final judgment on the merits in the previous decision, and (4) The plaintiff raises the same cause of action or claim in both suits.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> To determine whether the plaintiff has raised the same claim in two suits, \u201cthe critical issue is not the relief requested or the theory asserted but whether plaintiff bases the two actions on [the] same nucleus of operative facts.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In bankruptcy cases, however, we have agreed with the Supreme Court and other circuits \u201cthat a bankruptcy court faced with a claim of non-dischargeability ... presented with a state court judgment evidencing a debt is not bound by the judgment and is not barred by res judicata or collateral estoppel from conducting its own inquiry into the character and, ultimately, the dischargeability of the debt.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We do allow a bankruptcy court to adopt state holdings, however, where the state court judgments were consent judgments with \u201cdetailed recitations of the findings upon which they were based, findings which closely paralleled the language of ... the Bankruptcy Act.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">The Supreme Court has also found that res judicata does not apply to state court decisions on dischargeability, both before and after the changes to the law governing the powers of bankruptcy courts.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number><em>Brown v. Felsen, </em>the petitioner argued that a debt was non-dischargeable because it was the result of fraud, deceit, and malicious conversion, and the respondent argued that the state court proceedings below found no fraud and therefore barred the issue on appeal.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The Supreme Court determined that res judicata did not require a bankruptcy court to follow a state court\u2019s prior decision in a case, finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A34F\">[T]he bankruptcy court is not confined to a review of the judgment and record in the prior state-court proceedings when considering the dischargeability of respondent\u2019s debt. Adopting the rule respondent urges would take ... issues out of bankruptcy courts well suited to adjudicate them, and force those issues onto state courts concerned with other matters, all for the sake of a repose the bankrupt has long since abandoned. This we decline to do.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJr\">Later, the Supreme Court in <em>Grogan v. Garner </em>affirmed that \u201c[sjince 1970 ... the issue of non-dischargeability has been a matter of federal law governed by the terms of the Bankruptcy Code.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In that case, where the federal question of nondischargeability rested on \u201cactual fraud,\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> a creditor succeeded in a state court judgment for fraud, where the court required proof of fraud by a preponderance of the evidence. The creditor later sought \u201cto minimize additional litigation by invoking collateral estoppel.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The Court found that if non-dischargeability were also governed by a preponderance of the evidence standard, then the bankruptcy court could apply collateral estoppel. But where nondischargeability requires clear and convincing evidence, collateral estoppel would be inappropriate and the issue should be relitigated.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In other words, where the state court had decided the crucial element to non-dischargeability in the case below and had followed the same evidentiary standard, relitigation was unnecessary. But with differing evidentiary standards, the court need not defer to the state court decision. Just as a court need not defer to a state court decision that relied a different evidentiary standard, a bankruptcy court need not adopt a criminal assault finding of no self-defense \u2014 despite that finding\u2019s reliance on the strictest of evidentiary standards \u2014 that did not address the dischargeability issue of willful and malicious conduct. As we found in <em>Winters v. Diamond Shamrock Chem. Co., </em>the first condition that \u201cmust be met before collateral estoppel may be applied to bar relitigation of an issue previously decided by a court\u201d is that \u201c \u2018the issue under consideration is identical to that litigated in the prior action.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Self-defense as litigated in a state criminal trial is not directly transferable to, and certainly not identical, to the question of self-defense in the context of willful and malicious behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">We have stated: \u201c[T]he mere fact that a creditor previously reduced her claim to a judgment does not preclude the bankruptcy court from inquiring into the <em>tme </em>na<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>ture of the debt \u2014 and ruling contrary to the first court\u2019s judgment, if necessary....\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The Ninth Circuit has also held that a bankruptcy court need not apply collateral estoppel to an earlier state court judgment in a case, although the state court\u2019s ruling may establish a prima facie case of non-dischargeability.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Applying collateral estoppel in this case would not uphold the purposes of that doctrine. We would not protect a party\u2019s \u201cadversaries from the expense and vexation attending multiple lawsuits,\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> nor would we \u201cconserve! ] judicial resources,\u201d <footnotemark>29</footnotemark> since the bankruptcy court will be deciding the issue of willful and malicious injury regardless of our determination of collateral estoppel on the narrower issue of self-defense. Additionally, if the district court were to find that Vollbracht did not act willfully and maliciously, this would not necessarily be inconsistent with the state court\u2019s finding that Vollbracht did not act in self-defense. Although self-defense may be one component of a -willful and malicious finding, a court could find willful and malicious injury or lack thereof based on the weight of other evidence not related to self-defense considered by the court. Finally, we decline to reach the broad conclusion that issues litigated in state courts should, through collateral estoppel or res judicata, prevent a bankruptcy court from re-considering those issues in making an independent determination of dischargeability. The bankruptcy court (and the district court, in reviewing the bankruptcy court\u2019s findings) needs the ability to consider all relevant issues in making an accurate determination of dischargeability, and one of the cases upon which the dissent relies has indicated that \u201ceven where it arguably meets a technical muster, \u2018the rule [of collateral estoppel] is neither mandatory nor mechanically applied.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Creating a new standard that broadly militates for collateral estoppel would invent an unnecessary rule in this circuit that impedes the ability of bankruptcy judges to reach accurate and fair results. We REVERSE and REMAND to the bankruptcy court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Berry\u2019s outstanding motion to strike a portion of Vollbracht\u2019s brief is DENIED AS MOOT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b385-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

The bankruptcy court found, and Vollbraeht concedes on appeal, that he intended to punch Berry.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b386-10\">. Berry also argues that Vollbracht's Mississippi conviction establishes that he acted willfully and maliciously. The lower courts held, and we agree, that collateral estoppel does not apply to the Mississippi assault conviction, for various reasons. For one, the Mississippi assault statute at issue includes <em>\u201cnegligently </em>injuring the body of another.\u201d Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 97-3-7 (2001). If a jury found that Vollbraeht acted negligently, the assault conviction would not require finding that Vollbracht\u2019s actions were willful and malicious under \u00a7 523(a)(6). We recognize that Vollbracht\u2019s self-defense argument failed at his criminal trial, hence Berry could argue that the narrow issue of self-defense is foreclosed. However, we do not equate the required showing to establish self-defense at a criminal trial, under Mississippi or any other law, with the showing required to render an injury not \"willful and malicious.\u201d Self-defense is a technical doctrine of criminal law; our \u201cexception\u201d requires only that an injury otherwise falling under our two-part test is sufficiently justified to render it not \"willful and malicious.\u201d Even if the criminal self-defense issue were precluded (which it is not), other of Vollbracht's actions may negate a finding of willful and malicious injuiy. We describe our reasoning in further detail in tire text.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b387-5\">. <em>See, e.g., White v. World.

Geiger, </em>523 U.S. 57, 118 S.Ct. 974, 140 L.Ed.2d 90 (1998) and (2) not be sufficiently justified under the circumstances. As to the first prong, I strongly agree with the majority\u2019s finding that Vollbracht\u2019s \u201chaymakers\u201d on Berry easily satisfy Kawaauhau\u2019s subjective/objective test.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">As to the second prong, however, I reject the majority\u2019s holding that Vollbracht be allowed to present evidence of self-defense on remand as justification for his actions against Berry. I consider Vollbracht to be collaterally estopped from again asserting the claim of self-defense, because it was previously litigated, rejected, and essential to his conviction in his state criminal trial for assault. <em>See, e.g., Raju v. Rhodes, </em>7 F.3d 1210, 1214-15 (5th Cir.1993) (applying Mississippi law and stating that parties are precluded from relitigating a specific issue when it has actually been litigated, determined by, and essential to the judgment in the prior action); <em>Norman v. Bucklew, </em>684 So.2d 1246, 1253 (Miss.1996); <em>see also In re Granoff, </em>No. 05-33028, 2006 WL 1997408, at *8 (Bankr.E.D.Pa. June 6, 2006) (holding that a criminal conviction for assault is preclusive on the issue of self-defense as a justification for debtor\u2019s conduct, because \u201c[t]he state court must have considered the debt- or\u2019s claim of self-defense and found the claim not to be credible, or the debtor could not have been convicted of simple assault\u201d). Moreover, even though Vollbracht bore the initial burden of production on self-defense, his success in doing so then required the prosecution to bear the burden of persuasion in proving the absence of self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Harris v. State, </em>937 So.2d 474, 481 (Miss.App.2006) (citing <em>Heidel v. State, </em>587 So.2d 835, 843 (Miss.1991)). As the level of proof required in the civil action is the much lower preponderance-of-the-evidence standard, the factual rejection of self-defense in the prior criminal trial supports the application of collateral estoppel in the subsequent civil action. Accordingly, Vollbracht should not receive a second bite at the \u201cself-defense\u201d apple, as the majority would allow. Without this defense, Vollbracht\u2019s \u201chaymakers\u201d on Berry would undoubtedly have been considered \u201cwillful and malicious\u201d and his debt would not have been discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">The majority recognizes that the bankruptcy court could preclude the \u201cnarrow\u201d issue of self-defense on remand. Nevertheless, the majority goes on to state that Vollbracht could present facts that would support his self-defense claim, <em>ie., </em>evidence as to Berry\u2019s actions and reasons as to why Vollbracht would be less culpable. Thus, under the majority\u2019s rationale, Vollbracht would essentially be able to present all of the facts related to his self-defense claim, even if the bankruptcy court precluded the issue of self-defense. I do not see the distinction that the majority draws, cannot agree with its reasoning, and therefore respectfully dissent. I would have rendered judgment in favor of Berry and not discharged Vollbracht\u2019s debt.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
