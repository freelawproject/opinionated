We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d). We review the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>decision to retroactively lift the stay for an abuse of discretion, <em>National Envtl. Waste Corp. v. City of Riverside (In re National Envtl. Waste Corp.), </em>129 F.3d 1052, 1054 (9th Cir.1997), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">The bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in granting retroactive relief under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(d), based on factual findings that appellees were not aware of the bankruptcy petition when they filed for judgment in state court and that Olson filed his bankruptcy petition in bad faith. <em>See id. </em>at 1055 (explaining that relief under \u00a7 362(d) is not an abuse of discretion where bankruptcy court properly weighs the equities, including the creditor\u2019s knowledge of the bankruptcy and the debtor\u2019s conduct in bringing the bankruptcy proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">The bankruptcy court did not clearly err in determining that appellees were not aware of the bankruptcy petition when they filed for judgment, despite Olson\u2019s testimony to the contrary, because the finding is supported by witness testimony and undisputed evidence that notice of the bankruptcy was mailed to appellees on the same day they filed for judgment. <em>See Rifino v. United States (In re Rifino), </em>245 F.3d 1083, 1086-87 (9th Cir.2001) (reviewing the bankruptcy court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and stating \u201c[wjhere there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder\u2019s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous\u201d (internal citation and quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Contrary to his contention on appeal, Olson could not have used a witness\u2019s indictment for bankruptcy fraud as impeachment evidence because Fed.R.Evid. 609(a) only permits evidence that a witness \u201chas been convicted of a crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b665-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
