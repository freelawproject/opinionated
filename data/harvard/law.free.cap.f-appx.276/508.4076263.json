Rios appealed and we appointed counsel, but then granted counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw under <em>An</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number><em>ders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), when counsel was unable to discern a nonfrivolous basis for the appeal. <em>See United States v. Rios, </em>224 Fed.Appx. 529 (7th Cir.2007). The Supreme Court granted Rios\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari, vacated our order, and remanded the case to us for reconsideration in light of <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), which held that sentencing courts are free to consider the disparity in guidelines sentences between offenses involving crack and powder cocaine. <em>See Rios v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 876, 169 L.Ed.2d 717 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">Rios did not suggest at sentencing that the 100:1 crack-to-powder ratio resulted in an unreasonably high sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), but he did challenge the government\u2019s contention that the drugs involved were crack. Because there is no logical reason to dispute the identity of the drugs apart from avoiding the higher guidelines range for crack offenses, Rios\u2019s challenge is sufficient to preserve the issue of whether the district court could consider the 100:1 ratio at sentencing. <em>See United States v. Padilla, </em>520 F.3d 766, 774 (7th Cir.2008). The district court said nothing on the issue and we cannot infer from its silence that it would have imposed the same sentence had it known the ratio was not mandatory. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">We therefore VACATE Rios\u2019s sentence and REMAND the case to the district court for resentencing in light of <em>Kimbrough.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
