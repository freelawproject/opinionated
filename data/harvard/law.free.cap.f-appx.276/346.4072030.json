Because Wright\u2019s motion did not assert a defect in the collateral review process itself, but rather reargued the merits of his \u00a7 2255 motion based on new case law, the motion should have been characterized as a successive \u00a7 2255 motion under <em>United States v. Winestock, </em>340 F.3d 200, 207 (4th Cir.2003). Moreover, to appeal an order denying a motion seeking reconsideration in a habeas action, Wright must establish entitlement to a certificate of appealability. <em>See Reid v. Angelone, </em>369 F.3d 363, 368-69 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-20\">A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Wright has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">To the extent that Wright\u2019s notice of appeal and informal brief could be construed as a motion for authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, we deny such authorization. <em>See Winestock, </em>340 F.3d at 208. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
