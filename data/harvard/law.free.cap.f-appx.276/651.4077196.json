Ameline, </em>409 F.3d 1073, 1084-85 (9th Cir.2005) (en banc), that it would not have imposed a different sentence had it known that the Sentencing Guidelines were advisory. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>Turbiville contends that her due process rights were violated when the district court did not allow her to present new evidence during the <em>Ameline </em>remand. This contention is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Combs, </em>470 F.3d 1294, 1296-97 (9th Cir.2006). Turbiville also contends that the district court failed to comply with this court\u2019s re-sentencing order. Her contention is belied by the record. During the initial appeal this court did not ultimately remand for a full re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">We also conclude that the district court did not clearly err in making its drug quantity approximation. <em>See United States v. Kilby, </em>443 F.3d 1135, 1141 (9th Cir.2006). The district court was entitled to rely on the admissions of Turbiville\u2019s coconspirator regarding the amount of methamphetamine he produced. <em>See id. </em>(\u201c[T]he information which supports an approximation must possess sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.\u201d). Based on the record on a whole, Turbiville could reasonably foresee the manufacture of at least 50 grams of methamphetamine. <em>See United States v. Ortiz, </em>362 F.3d 1274, 1275 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b675-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
