No. 5,749,673 (\u201cthe \u2019673 patent\u201d) to mean \u201ca rounded protuberance capable of being gripped by an entire hand since the width of the rounded protuberance must be greater than the width of a shaft with sufficient length to permit all of the fingers of an average adult hand to be wrapped thereabout.\u201d This construction was error. As the district court noted, \u201cthe purpose of the knob is primarily to prevent a user\u2019s hand from slipping off of the end of the shaft.\u201d \u2019673 patent col. 4, 11. 11-12. This does not mean that the knob must be large enough such that an average adult hand can be wrapped around the knob. All that is required is that the knob be large enough to keep a user\u2019s hand from slipping off the end of the shaft. However, the district court\u2019s erroneous claim construction does not affect its judgment of noninfringement.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
