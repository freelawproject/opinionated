West contended that \u2014 under the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act (\u201cMVRA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3664, 3572 \u2014 only the district court had authority to set a payment schedule; and as part of his sentence, the court had ordered him to pay restitution of $500 a month, not to begin until after he was released from prison. The order did not, West posited, give the BOP authority to collect money from him under the IFRP while he was in prison. The magistrate judge determined that the BOP was not executing improperly West\u2019s sentence based on the plain language of the district court\u2019s sentencing order and recommended denying the section 2241 petition. Over West\u2019s objections, the district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation and dismissed the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">On appeal, West repeats his argument that the BOP unlawfully deducted money from him and devised a payment schedule, through the IFRP, in contravention of both the district court\u2019s sentencing order and the MVRA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The availability of habeas relief under section 2241 is a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Dohrmann v. United States, </em>442 F.3d 1279, 1280 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">We conclude that the district court committed no error in dismissing West\u2019s petition. The district court\u2019s sentencing order stated that West was to pay a special monetary assessment of $2000 and restitution in the amount of $25,517,666.46, both due \u201cimmediately.\u201d The order noted that the penalties \u201cshall be due during the period of imprisonment,\u201d and payment of the assessment and restitution made while West was incarcerated would be made through the IFRP, with the remaining balance to be paid in monthly installments of not less than $500 during his supervised release to begin three months after his release. So, contrary to West\u2019s contentions, the sentencing order stated that restitution was due immediately \u2014 not after his release from prison \u2014 -and authorized the BOP to deduct appropriate sums from his account in accordance with its rules and regulations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b954-9\">West relies on <em>United States v. Prouty, </em>303 F.3d 1249 (11th Cir.2002), for his claim that the BOP violated the MVRA. In <em>Prouty, </em>we concluded that a district court could not delegate its function to set a restitution payment schedule under the MVRA. <em>Id. </em>at 1254-55. But here, the district court ordered immediate payment of restitution and provided the manner and schedule in which it was to be paid: both while West was incarcerated and when he was released. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(f)(2) (the court shall specify in the restitution order \u201cthe manner in which, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>and the schedule according to which, the restitution is to be paid\u201d). Thus, the district court did not improperly delegate its duties to the BOP.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">In a collateral attack, for an alleged error of law to merit relief, it must be shown that the claimed error constituted a fundamental defect which inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice. <em>See United States v. Addonizio, </em>442 U.S. 178, 99 S.Ct. 2235, 2240, 60 L.Ed.2d 805 (1979) (in the context of a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate) (quotation and citation omitted). The BOP\u2019s acts in using its regulations to deduct money from West that he owed in restitution as directed by the district court\u2019s sentencing order fall far short of a complete miscarriage of justice.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b953-17\">. West does not need a certificate of appealability to proceed in this appeal. <em>See Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1364 n. 3 (11th Cir. 2003) (concluding that a federal prisoner proceeding under section 2241 does not need a certificate of appealability to appeal).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b954-6\">. West also argues that the BOP unlawfully used the IFRP to deduct money from his account that was given to him from outside sources. But West did not raise this claim before the district court, and we need not address it now. <em>See Walker v. Jones, </em>10 F.3d 1569, 1572 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b954-7\">. To the extent West raised a challenge to the validity of the IFRP, we conclude that it is meritless. BOP regulations provide that, when an inmate has a financial obligation, including the special assessment and restitution imposed at sentencing, BOP staff \"shall help that inmate develop a financial plan and shall monitor the inmate's progress in meeting that obligation.\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 545.11. Participating in the program is voluntary; but loss of certain privileges will result if an inmate chooses not to participate in it. 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 545.11(d). We conclude that the IFRP is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests and, thus, valid. <em>See Turner v. Safley, </em>482 U.S. 78, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 2261, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b955-8\">. In addition, <em>Prouty </em>was decided in the context of a direct appeal; and here, West has not challenged the district court's restitution order via a direct appeal. <em>See Dohrmann, </em>442 F.3d at 1281 (concluding that a prisoner could not challenge for the first time, in his section 2241 petition, the district court\u2019s initial calculation of restitution because he had not demonstrated exceptional circumstances for his failure to challenge it at sentencing or on direct appeal).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b955-9\">. We reject West's argument that the district court violated Fed.R.App.P. 32.1 and 11th Cir. R. 36-2 by not providing him with a copy of an unpublished opinion cited in the magistrate's report and recommendation. These rules apply to appellate proceedings where a party, not the court, cites an unpublished case. <em>See </em>Fed.R.App.P. 32.1(b) (a \"party\u201d that cites an unpublished opinion that is not available in a publicly accessible electronic database must include a copy of it with the brief in which it is cited); 11th Cir. R. 36-2 (same). We also reject his argument that lack of access to the unpublished opinion deprived him of his constitutional right to access to courts because he has not established an actual injury; West has pursued his underlying claim against the BOP both in the district court and, now, on appeal. <em>See Wilson v. Blankenship, </em>163 F.3d 1284, 1291 (11th Cir. 1998) (a prisoner cannot demonstrate actual injury where he was able to litigate his underlying claims in the district court and on appeal).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
