For the following reasons, we will grant the petition for review and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-16\">In July 2003, Camara was admitted to the United States with authorization to remain for six months. He overstayed his admission period and, in March 2004, was charged with removability pursuant to Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 237(a)(1)(B) [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B) ]. Camara conceded his removability but applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). He claimed that he was persecuted because he belongs to the Mandingo ethnic group and because of his affiliation with the political opposition party Rally of the People of Guinea (\u201cRPG\u201d). In particular, Camara, a doctor, asserted that he was falsely accused of refusing to treat supporters of the Guinean government. In 2000, he was arrested by the military and taken to prison, where he was denied food, burned with cigarettes, and deprived of medical treatment for a broken arm suffered during the arrest. After nine days in custody, Camara was transferred to a hospital. Although he was supposed to return to prison, Camara escaped with the help of friends. After spending more than three years in Dakar, Senegal, Camara traveled to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-17\">The Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) denied relief. Citing inconsistencies, improbabilities, and lack of corroboration in the record, the IJ found that Camara was not credible. In August 2006, the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision \u2014 with the exception of certain portions of the IJ\u2019s credibility finding \u2014 and dismissed the appeal. Camara petitioned for review of the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-18\">We exercise jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s final order of removal under INA \u00a7 242(a) [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)].<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>the BIA adopted the findings of the IJ and also commented on the sufficiency of the IJ\u2019s determinations, this Court reviews the decisions of both the BIA and the IJ. <em>See Xie v. Ashcroft, </em>359 F.3d 239, 242 (3d Cir.2004). Our review of these decisions is for substantial evidence, considering whether they are \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Balasubramanrim v. INS, </em>143 F.3d 157, 161 (3d Cir.1998). The decisions must be affirmed \u201cunless the evidence not only supports a contrary conclusion, but compels it.\u201d <em>Zubeda v. Ashcroft, </em>333 F.3d 463, 471 (3d Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Abdille v. Ashcroft, </em>242 F.3d 477, 484 (3d Cir.2001)). Adverse credibility determinations must be based on \u201cspecific, cogent reasons,\u201d not on \u201cspeculation, conjecture, ... and otherwise unsupported personal opinion,\u201d <em>Dia v. Ashcroft, </em>353 F.3d 228, 249-50 (3d Cir.2003) (en banc), or minor inconsistences that do not go to the \u201cheart of the asylum claim.\u201d <em>Gao v. Ashcroft, </em>299 F.3d 266, 272 (3d Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Ceballos-Castillo v. INS, </em>904 F.2d 519, 520 (9th Cir.1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">The first inconsistency identified by the BIA involved Camara\u2019s explanation of why he was arrested. In his asylum application, Camara stated that he was charged with using \u201cstate medical facilities to treat opposition partisans.\u201d Camara testified that he was arrested as a result of his refusal to treat government sympathizers. When asked about this discrepancy, Camara claimed that it must have resulted from a translation error in his written application because \u201cI have always sa[id] that I was accused for not providing medical care.\u201d The IJ rejected this explanation because the application was filed with the assistance of counsel, because it was submitted \u201cplenty of time after\u201d Camara arrived in the United States, and because Camara had the opportunity to read it over and make sure that it was accurate. But, while Camara\u2019s attorney did submit a supplemental asylum application, the application itself was prepared by a third party who translated Camara\u2019s statements into English.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because Camara testified that \u201cI don\u2019t understand English in order to be able to read again my application and make any correction,\u201d the length of time he had to prepare and review his application becomes less relevant. <em>Cf. Gui Cun Liu v. Ashcroft, </em>372 F.3d 529, 534 (3d Cir.2004) (noting presumption that applicant was aware of signed application\u2019s contents can be rebutted). Under these circumstances, it was improper to base the adverse credibility finding on the discrepancy between Camara\u2019s asylum application and his testimony concerning the reason for his arrest.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Alvarez-Santos v. INS, </em>332 F.3d 1245, 1254 (9th Cir.2003) (\u201cInconsistencies due to an unscrupulous preparer, without other evidence of dishonesty ... do not provide a specific and cogent basis for an adverse credibility finding.\u201d) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>The BIA and IJ also questioned the authenticity of a letter Camara submitted to establish his membership in the RPG. Camara testified that he joined the RPG on May 20, 1998. The letter, which appears to be dated May 20, 1998, stated that Camara \u201cis an official of our party since 1998 ... [and] is also Secretary General of the Youth Win[g] of the ... District of Dixinn.\u201d The IJ questioned whether the letter was \u201cgenuine at all\u201d because it suggested that Camara \u201cinstantly became\u201d a Secretary General on the date that he joined the RPG. Camara reasonably explained, however, that he was active in the RPG before May 20, 1998, and was simply \u201crecognized officially [as] a member of the party\u201d on that date. The IJ also found a \u201cwhole other problem\u201d in that the letter was signed by a \u201cmember\u201d rather than an \u201cofficial\u201d of the RPG. Although the BIA did not find that there was enough evidence to support the IJ\u2019s suggestion that the letter was fraudulent, the Board found it \u201creasonable to question the document\u2019s authenticity.\u201d This conclusion amounts to impermissible speculation, as nothing in the record indicates that Camara could not have become a General Secretary on the day he joined the RPG or that an RPG attestation letter is valid only if signed by a party official. <em>See Jishiashvili v. Attorney General, </em>402 F.3d 386, 393 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The BIA did not comment on several additional adverse credibility determinations made by the IJ. However, because the BIA \u201cadopt[ed] and affirm[ed]\u201d the IJ\u2019s decision, we must review, with the exception of the credibility determinations which the Board specifically declined to adopt, the IJ\u2019s independent conclusions as well. <em>See Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005) (holding that when BIA affirms IJ\u2019s decision in all respects but one, review is of the IJ\u2019s decision as modified by the BIA decision, \u201cminus the single argument for denying relief that was rejected by the BIA\u201d). Here, the portions of the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination that were adopted without comment by the BIA are not supported by substantial evidence. Therefore, the BIA\u2019s decision to defer to them was error. <em>See Abdulai v. Ashcroft, </em>239 F.3d 542, 549 n. 2 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">The IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was based in part on Camara\u2019s failure to provide sufficient information about \u201cwhat he did as a supposed youth wing leader.\u201d Significantly, though, Camara did not claim that he was persecuted on account of activities he undertook in that position. Rather, Camara explained in detail that he was arrested because, in his capacity as a doctor, he allegedly refused to provide medical treatment to Guinean government supporters. <em>See Mulanga v. Ashcroft, </em>349 F.3d 123, 138 (3d Cir. 2003) (cautioning that \u201c[a]n applicant for asylum must provide corroborating evidence only when it would be reasonably expected.\u201d). The IJ also found Camara\u2019s credibility was undermined by a letter from his wife which did not describe why he was targeted by the Guinean government. That letter, however, explains that Camara \u201cwho was a licensed surgeon ... was accused by armed men loyal to President Lassana Conte for being a strong supporter of [the RPG].\u201d On this record, the IJ erred in relying on a lack of evidence concerning Camara\u2019s activities in the RPG organization. <em>See Chen v. Gonzales, </em>434 F.3d 212, 220 (3d Cir.2005) (reviewing for substantial evidence IJ\u2019s finding that it was reasonable to expect corroboration).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">The IJ also cited alleged inconsistencies concerning whether Camara started working at a hospital in September 1996 or November 1996, and whether he began work there as a surgeon. These factors, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>however, do not go to the heart of Camara\u2019s claim that he was persecuted in 2000 for allegedly not treating government supporters. <em>See Gao v. Ashcroft, </em>299 F.3d at 272. Notably, the IJ did not doubt that Camara had his medical license during the period when the alleged persecution occurred.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While the IJ doubted Camara\u2019s credibility on the basis that his three-year stay in Senegal provided him \u201cyears to plan his trip to the United States of America and what he would do about it,\u201d nothing in the record supports the idea that Camara\u2019s \u201copportunity to be thoughtful about his case\u201d led to a fabrication of his story.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">In sum, we conclude that the adverse credibility determination was not supported by substantial evidence. The BIA and IJ unreasonably rejected Camara\u2019s explanations for discrepancies, improperly speculated about evidence demonstrating Camara\u2019s membership in the RPG, and impermissibly required corroboration for assertions not relevant to Camara\u2019s claims. Accordingly, we will grant Camara\u2019s petition and remand to the Board (which then may remand to the IJ) to determine, without regard to the prior adverse credibility finding, whether the administrative record, as a whole, provides substantial evidence in support of Camara\u2019s applications for relief. We express no opinion as to the ultimate outcome.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b203-14\">. Because Camara's claim for asylum was filed prior to the effective date of the REAL ID Act of 2005\u2019s new credibility determination standard, see INA \u00a7 208(b)(l)(B)(iii) [8 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>U.S.c. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii) ], we review the credibility determination under our case law which predated the REAL ID Act. <em>See Chukwu v. Attorney General, </em>484 F.3d 185, 189 (3d Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b204-6\">. The description of Camara's experiences that appears in his supplemental asylum application is virtually identical to that provided in his initial application. Both applications were prepared by the same person. If, as this suggests, the supplemental application was not started from scratch, a translation error in the first application likely would have been transferred to the second.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b204-10\">. As further support for his contention that the preparer mistranslated some of his statements, Camara notes that the asylum applications referred to a \"fractured hand,\u201d even though a physical examination of his body clearly indicated to the IJ that it was Camara's arm that had been injured.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b206-6\">. In any event, the alleged inconsistencies were reasonably explained by Camara\u2019s testimony that although he was \"under the surgery department\" at the hospital, he first had to work in the pharmacy \"so that I can know the medication that I prescribe to the patients.\u201d Because that position was considered to be in the commercial sector and required that Camara travel to deliver drugs, he was issued a passport identifying him as a \"businessman.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
