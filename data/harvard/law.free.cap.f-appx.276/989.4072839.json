Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>SF-0831-07-0294-1-1, 107 M.S.P.R. 183 (M.S.P.B. Aug. 27, 2007) <em>(\u201cFinal Decision </em>\u201d). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-10\">Ms. Waters married Mr. McTonnell, a former employee of the United States Postal Service, on May 14, 2006. <em>Waters v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>SF-0831-07-0294-11, slip op. at 2 (M.S.P.B. May 10, 2007) <em>(\u201cInitial Decision\u201d). </em>Sixteen days later, on May 30, 2006, Mr. McTonnell died from cardiac arrest, purportedly caused by cirrhosis of the liver and colon cancer. <em>Id. </em>Following Mr. McTonnell\u2019s death, on June 28, 2006, Ms. Waters applied for lump sum death and survivor annuity benefits. <em>Id. </em>On August 7, 2006, OPM denied Ms. Waters\u2019s application. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1014-11\">On August 20, 2006, Ms. Waters sought reconsideration of OPM\u2019s denial of benefits, producing additional evidence showing that, prior to their marriage, Mr. McTonnell had authorized her, pursuant to a durable power of attorney, to manage his personal property and other affairs. <em>Id. </em>Ms. Waters noted that the power of attorney authorized her to submit claims for government benefits inuring to Mr. McTonnell and to collect such benefits, which power, she argued, permitted her to collect the benefits she sought. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1014-14\">Upon considering the additional evidence, OPM affirmed its original determination that Ms. Waters was entitled to neither lump sum death nor survivor annuity benefits. <em>Id. </em>at 3. With respect to the lump sum death benefits, OPM noted that Mr. McTonnell had designated a prior spouse, Anne McTonnell, as the recipient of such benefits on a Designation of Beneficiary form that OPM received on April 19, 1962. <em>Id. </em>Though Mr. McTonnell later divorced Ms. McTonnell in 1988, he never removed her as the designated beneficiary of the lump sum death benefits. <em>Id. </em>OPM concluded that a Marital Settlement Agreement, in which Mr. McTonnell listed \u201cbenefits resulting from ... employment ... with (sic) United States Postal Service\u201d as separate property, did not serve to remove Ms. McTonnell as the designated beneficiary of the lump sum death benefits. <em>See id. </em>at 2-3. With respect to the survivor annuity benefits, OPM noted that 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8341(a)(1)(A) defines a \u201cwidow\u201d eligible to receive such benefits as a person married to the federal employee spouse \u201cfor at least 9 months immediately before his death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3. Since Ms. Waters and Mr. McTonnell were married only for 16 days, Ms. Waters did not qualify for survivor annuity benefits. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1014-15\">Ms. Waters appealed OPM\u2019s reconsideration decision to the Board, which allowed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>Ms. McTonnell to join the case as an intervenor. <em>Id. </em>at 8-4. On April 10, 2007, the Administrative Judge (\u201cAJ\u201d) assigned to the case held a telephonic hearing in which Ms. Waters served as the sole witness. <em>Id. </em>at 4. In the hearing, Ms. Waters asserted that she and Mr. McTonnell had been close friend for 20 years and that they always intended to be married, notwithstanding the extremely short duration of their actual marriage. <em>Id. </em>at 3-4. Ms. Waters testified that Mr. McTonnell had always intended that she receive his government benefits and that his untimely death prevented him from taking the necessary steps to designate her as the beneficiary. <em>Id. </em>Ms. Waters also argued for equitable relief, asserting that Mr. McTonnell had left her with considerable debt obligations that she could not pay absent receipt of Mr. McTonnell\u2019s government benefits. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">The AJ first analyzed Ms. Waters\u2019s claimed entitlement to lump sum death benefits. The relevant statute, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8342(c), provides that the recipient of such benefits shall be \u201cthe beneficiary or beneficiaries designated by the employee ... in a signed and witnessed writing received in the Office before his death.\u201d Here, Mr. McTonnell had designated Ms. McTonnell as the designated beneficiary in a document received by OPM on April 19, 1962. <em>Id. </em>at 3, 5. The statute additionally provides that \u201ca designation, change, or cancellation of beneficiary in a will or other document not so executed and filed has no force or effect.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8342(c) (2000). Thus, Mr. McTonnell\u2019s Marital Settlement Agreement in which he claimed all marital property as separate did not suffice to remove Ms. McTonnell as the designated beneficiary of the lump sum death benefits, given that Mr. McTonnell did not execute the agreement or file it with OPM. <em>Initial Decision </em>at 5. Similarly, the durable power of attorney possessed by Ms. Waters was neither executed nor filed with OPM. <em>Id. </em>Consequently, Ms. McTonnell was the proper recipient of the lump sum death benefits, and Ms. Waters therefore could not claim entitlement thereto. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1015-7\">The AJ then analyzed Ms. Waters claimed entitlement to survivor annuity death benefits. The relevant statute, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8341(b)(1), provides that the widow or widower of a retired federal employee who dies is entitled to survivor annuity death benefits, and 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8341(a)(1)(A) defines \u201cwidow\u201d as a spouse who \u201cwas married to [the deceased retried federal employee] for at least 9 months immediately before his death.\u201d Ms. Waters conceded that she was married to Mr. McTonnell for only 16 days, and Ms. Waters would not qualify as a common law wife, despite her lengthy relationship with Mr. McTonnell, given that their state of residence, California, does not recognize common law marriages. <em>Id. </em>at 6, 6 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-9\">Finally, the AJ considered the various equitable considerations raised by Ms. Waters and concluded that such considerations, though compelling, did not merit departure from the clear statutory scheme created by Congress. <em>Id. </em>at 7. Accordingly, the AJ affirmed OPM\u2019s reconsideration decision. <em>Id. </em>The <em>Initial Decision </em>became the final decision of the Board when the Board denied Ms. Waters\u2019s petition for review for failure to meet the criteria for review set forth at 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.115(d). <em>Final Decision </em>at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-11\">We have jurisdiction over Ms. Waters\u2019s appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9). Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c), we must affirm the Board\u2019s decision unless we find it to be (1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"992\">*992</page-number>(2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence. <em>See also Kewley v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>153 F.3d 1357, 1361 (Fed.Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">On appeal, Ms. Waters does not allege errors of fact or law in the Board\u2019s decision. Rather, she appears to contend that equitable considerations, including the apparent intent of Mr. McTonnell that she receive his government benefits, and the fact that she cannot satisfy her debt obligations without receiving such benefits, weigh in favor of her receiving the benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">We see no error in the Board\u2019s decision. With respect to the lump sum death benefits, the Board properly held that the April 19, 1962 designation of Ms. McTonnell as the recipient was never revoked and that she, rather than Ms. Waters, was the proper recipient of the benefits. The statute provides in relevant part: Lump-sum benefits ... shall be paid to the person or persons surviving the employee or Member and alive at the date title to the payment arises in the following order of precedence, and the payment bars recovery by any other person: First, to the beneficiary or beneficiaries designated by the employee or Member in a signed and witnessed writing received in the Office before his death. For this purpose, a designation, change, or cancellation of beneficiary in a will or other document not so executed and filed has no force or effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-6\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8342(c). The April 19, 1962 document designated Ms. McTonnell as the sole beneficiary, and she therefore must receive the lump sum death benefits, to the exclusion of Ms. Waters, unless another document altered the designated beneficiaries. Neither the durable power of attorney possessed by Ms. Waters nor the Marital Settlement Agreement, however, suffices to change the beneficiary, because neither was executed or filed with OPM.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-9\">With respect to the survivor annuity benefits, Ms. Waters does not qualify as a \u201cwidow\u201d entitled to such benefits under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8341(b)(1) because 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8341(a)(1) defines \u201cwidow\u201d as someone who \u201cwas married to [the deceased federal employee] for at least 9 months immediately before his death.\u201d Ms. Waters was married to Mr. McTonnell for only 16 days, and their lengthy pre-marriage relationship does not establish entitlement to benefits inasmuch as California law does not recognize common law marriage. <em>Knight v. Superior Court, </em>128 Cal.App.4th 14, 26 Cal.Rptr.3d 687, 690 (2005).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1016-10\">Accordingly, the statutory scheme for death benefits created by Congress affirmatively forecloses the possibility of Ms. Waters\u2019s receiving either lump sum death or survivor annuity benefits. The equitable considerations of Ms. Waters\u2019s case, including her debt load and lengthy pre-marriage relationship with Mr. McTonnell, however compelling, do not justify our departure from the system that Congress has created. <em>See Office of Pers. Mgmt. v. Richmond, </em>496 U.S. 414, 434, 110 S.Ct. 2465, 110 L.Ed.2d 387 (1990) (declining to consider individual hardship in claim for disability annuity payments). Because the relevant statutory provisions clearly establish that Ms. Waters is not entitled, to receive the lump sum death benefit, which was properly assigned to Ms. McTonnell, or the survivor annuity, which inures only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number>to spouses of 9 months or more, the Board did not err in its affirmance of OPM\u2019s reconsideration decision. For the foregoing reasons, the final decision of the Board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">No costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1016-7\">. The statute also provides for an exception to the 9 month marriage period in the event that the death of the federal employee spouse is \"accidental.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8341(i)(l). Ms. Waters has never contended, however, that Mr. McTonnell\u2019s death was accidental.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
