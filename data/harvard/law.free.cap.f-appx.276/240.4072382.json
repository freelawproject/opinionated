For the reasons that follow, we will deny his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-23\">We write exclusively for the parties, who are familiar with the factual context and legal history of this case. Therefore, we will set forth only those facts necessary to our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-24\">Calikiran is a native and citizen of Turkey. On September 5, 1996, because he had remained in the United States after the expiration of his nonimmigrant visa, deportation proceedings were commenced against him pursuant to former Immigration &amp; Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 241(a)(1)(B).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On August 28, 1996, Calikiran received an Order to Show Cause that included a deportation hearing notice instructing him to appear on March 14, 1997 before an IJ. The hearing notice explained the consequences of any failure to appear. Nevertheless, Calikiran failed to appear at his hearing and the IJ issued an order that he be \u201cremoved in absentia.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-25\">On July 9, 2003, Calikiran filed his first motion to reopen, requesting that the IJ vacate the removal order and reopen the case based upon Calikiran\u2019s marriage to an approved immigrant alien worker. In sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>port of his motion, he included a medical note indicating that on March 12, 1997, he was examined for possible peptic ulcer disease. On July 18, 2003, the IJ denied Calikiran\u2019s motion because it had not been filed within the 180-day period prescribed by the statute and because he failed to demonstrate exceptional circumstances for his failure to appear at the original hearing. On May 13, 2004, the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion. Calikiran did not petition for review of that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">On October 16, 2006, Calikiran filed a second motion to reopen in which he argued that he had demonstrated \u201creasonable cause\u201d for his failure to appear at his original hearing in 1997, and thus met his burden. On December 28, 2006, the BIA denied this second motion to reopen as number-barred. The Board also found that even if his motion to reopen was not statutorily barred, it was without merit. This petition for review followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">We have jurisdiction to review petitions challenging a final order of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a). In cases where the BIA adopts the findings of the IJ and discusses the basis for the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the decisions of both the IJ and the BIA. <em>Chen v. Ashcroft, </em>376 F.3d 215, 222 (3d Cir.2004). We review an IJ\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Shardar v. Ashcroft, </em>382 F.3d 318, 324 (3d Cir.2004). We will disturb the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen only if it was \u201carbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law.\u201d <em>Guo v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 556, 562 (3d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">Petitioner\u2019s in absentia hearing was conducted pursuant to former INA \u00a7 242B. (A.R. 2; Petitioner\u2019s Br. 8; Government\u2019s Br. 8). That section states that an order of removal pursuant to \u00a7 242B can only be rescinded in one of two ways:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-10\">(A) upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of deportation if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances (as defined in subsection (f)(2) of this section), or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-11\">(B) upon a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that the alien did not receive notice in accordance with subsection (a)(2) of this section or the alien demonstrates that the alien was in Federal or State custody and did not appear through no fault of the alien.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-12\">INA \u00a7 242B(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-13\">Petitioner argues that his first motion to reopen \u2014 filed six years after the final order of removal \u2014 was not time-barred and that his failure to attend his hearing was due to his medical condition. However, after the IJ\u2019s denial of the motion was affirmed by the BIA, Petitioner did not file a petition for review before this Court. Instead, he filed a second motion to reopen more than two years later.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-14\">INA \u00a7 242B(c)(4) states that any petition for review challenging a final order issued pursuant to an order of deportation in absentia must be filed \u201cnot later than 60 days\u201d after the date of the final order. As no petition was filed within 60 days of the final order denying the first motion to reopen, we do not have jurisdiction to review the denial of the first motion to reopen. <em>See Nocon v. I.N.S., </em>789 F.2d 1028, 1033 (3d Cir.1986) (finding a petition for review must be filed with the statutory time limit given for \u201cthe specific order sought to be reviewed\u201d and that \u201cstrict compliance with the statutory directive is a jurisdictional prerequisite to judicial review.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>Turning to Petitioner\u2019s second motion to reopen, for which the petition has been timely filed, the Government argues that this motion is nonetheless number-barred. The Government relies primarily on 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2, which states that \u201cexcept as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, a party may file only one motion to reopen deportation or exclusion proceedings.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-5\">However, our ease law is clear that [u]nder the statute that applies to preIIRIRA proceedings, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252b [INA \u00a7 242B], there is no limit on the number of motions to reopen that an alien may file.... The old statute continues to apply to aliens who were placed in proceedings before April 1, 1997, the effective date of IIRIRA.... The BIA has also promulgated regulations that apply to aliens placed in proceedings before April 1, 1997. Under these regulations, an alien who is ordered deported in absentia may file an unlimited number of motions to reopen.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7W\"><em>Luntungan v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>449 F.3d 551, 556 (3d Cir.2006). Because proceedings against Petitioner commenced in 1996, under <em>Luntungan, </em>his second motion is not number-barred. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Regardless, Petitioner\u2019s second motion to reopen is untimely. Petitioner has not alleged that he did not receive notice, or was in government custody at the time of the hearing. Therefore, INA \u00a7 242B(c)(3)(B) does not apply. Petitioner alleges that his medical condition caused him to miss the hearing. According to INA \u00a7 242B(c)(3)(A), the exception for such circumstances applies only in those cases when the motion is filed within 180 days of the date of the order. As Petitioner filed this second motion well after the 180 day period expired, his claim is time-barred, the merits of his allegations notwithstanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b265-16\">.
