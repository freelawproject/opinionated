He argues that his sentence is unreasonable and that the district court abused its discretion by not properly considering relevant factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-24\">When the applicable Guidelines range is undisputed, as it is here, we consider whether the sentence is unreasonable in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261-62, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); <em>United States v. Mathis, </em>451 F.3d 939, 941 (8th Cir.2006) (review for reasonableness is akin to review for abuse of discretion). We conclude that Krejee\u2019s sentence at the bottom of the advisory Guidelines range is not unreasonable. The record shows that the district court considered only relevant factors \u2014 including Krejee\u2019s two prior bank robbery convictions and his commission of this offense while on supervised release for a previous bank robbery, as well as the need to promote respect for the law and to afford adequate deterrence \u2014 and we see no clear error of judgment in the court\u2019s weighing of those factors. <em>See United States v. Harris, </em>493 F.3d 928, 932 (8th Cir.2007) (sentence within advisory Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 1263, 170 L.Ed.2d 111 (2008); <em>United States v. Haack, </em>403 F.3d 997, 1004 (8th Cir.2005) (listing factors that might signal abuse of discretion); <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (approving appellate presumption of reasonableness).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-28\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b550-21\">.
