Rules Cr. Proc. Rule 35(b), 18 U.S.C.A., U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1,\u201d in which he challenged the sentence imposed for his guilty plea conviction for possession with intent to distribute cocaine base. He argues that Government breached the plea agreement by failing to file a motion for a reduction of his sentence on account of his substantial assistance. He argues that the Government\u2019s refusal to file a motion for a reduction of his sentence and the district court\u2019s denial of this motion violated his due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">Section 5K1.1 has no postsentencing application, and only the Government can file a motion for reduction of a defendant\u2019s sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3553(e) and Rule 35(b). <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>26 F.3d 512, 523 (5th Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 141 (5th Cir.1994). Walton\u2019s motion was \u201can unauthorized motion which the district court was without jurisdiction to entertain.\u201d <em>See Early, </em>27 F.3d at 142. Walton argues for the first time on appeal that the Government\u2019s refusal to file such a motion was based on his race. We will not consider a new argument raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999); <em>cf. United States v. Cervantes, </em>132 F.3d 1106, 1109 (5th Cir.1998). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Walton\u2019s motion. <em>See Early, </em>27 F.3d at 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b406-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
