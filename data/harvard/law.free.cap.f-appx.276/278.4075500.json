The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the University and its officials, and this appeal followed. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">In reviewing the granting of a motion for summary judgment, we view the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, here, Bowers. <em>See Holland v. Washington Homes, Inc., </em>487 F.3d 208, 213 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">At the time of the events in question, the University of Virginia was supporting legislation that would allow it greater autonomy in the area of human resources. Bowers, while employed at the University, sent an email message to a colleague using her University email account and bearing a signature stamp identifying her as a University Human Resources employee.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Attached to the message were documents and charts that Bowers had-received during a meeting of the local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (\u201cNAACP\u201d). The attachments purported to portray the likely results of the salary restructuring initiatives (or \u201cdecentralization\u201d), and reflected the NAACP\u2019s opposition to the pending legislation supported by the University. The attachments consisted of four separate documents with different file names. Although the first attachment had a cover page stating that it was prepared by the local chapter of the NAACP, there was no similar cover on the remaining three attachments.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-14\">After receiving the email and attachments, the colleague sought and received Bowers\u2019s permission to forward them to an unknown number of University employees. Neal Grandy, one such second-tier recipient, forwarded the email and attachments on anew, with the following note: \u201cYou might want to pass this along, as it seems HR is circulating this (and Dena Bowers, who did the breakdown for HR, said it was okay to forward.) This appears to be the compensation package we\u2019ll be getting with decentralization. It does not seem to be good news.\u201d J.A. 106. As that employee subsequently testified, \u201cI did not know Ms. Bowers, but noted that from her original e-mail that she was an employee of the University\u2019s Human Resources, or \u2018HR\u2019 division, so I assumed that the information she had sent was HR information about restructuring.\u201d J.A. 105. Another recipient forwarded the email to a Listserv of University staff. Shortly thereafter, Grandy began to receive questions and expressions of concern. J.A. 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-15\">When Bowers learned that some recipients had perceived her email as official correspondence, she made an effort to clarify that the attachments were from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>NAACP, not the University Human Resources office. She communicated as much to the colleague to whom she had originally sent the email, and in response to a request from another one of the recipients, stressing the distinction between sending the message and attachments \u201cin [her] capacity as an NAACP member\u201d instead of as a University employee. J.A. 240-41; <em>see also </em>J.A. 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Several days after Bowers sent the email noted above, she spoke by telephone with appellees Lucinda Childs-White (\u201cChilds-White\u201d) and Nat Scurry (\u201cScurry\u201d), two of Bowers\u2019s supervisors, and appellee Yoke San Reynolds (\u201cReynolds\u201d), the chief financial officer of the University, among others. Reynolds told Bowers that her email contained significant inaccuracies and had caused confusion and disruption in the workplace. Reynolds asked several questions of Bowers, including to whom she sent the information, and where it originated. Bowers answered some of the questions, but refused to explain where the information used to create the NAACP documents came from; she maintained that the University had no right to demand that information.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">The day after this telephone conversation, Bowers met with Scurry and ChildsWhite for a \u201cpredetermination meeting,\u201d J.A. 142-43, to decide whether Bowers\u2019s conduct warranted disciplinary action. Scurry and Childs-White again met with Bowers approximately one month later, on November 17th, 2005, in what ChildsWhite characterized as a \u201csecond predetermination meeting.\u201d J.A. 143-44. At that point, Bowers was placed on paid leave until November 22nd. Bowers was told that a third meeting would take place on November 22nd, at which Bowers would have an opportunity to \u201cpresent a defense.\u201d J.A. 238. According to Bowers, and accepted as true for purposes of our review, on the day before the hearing Bowers asked Scurry to specify the charges against her, but Scurry failed to respond. That evening, however, Bowers acknowledged receiving \u201cinformation indirectly and from a totally different source concerning at least the nature of the alleged charges being leveled against her, although the information was still highly non-specific.\u201d J.A. 17 (Compl.H 40). At the conclusion of the meeting on the 22nd, the University terminated Bowers\u2019s employment. The reasons given for the termination were Bowers\u2019s distribution of the email and her refusal to provide assistance in identifying the source of what the University identified as the substantively inaccurate information it contained.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-11\">Bowers filed this action in Virginia state court, alleging violations of her First Amendment rights of free speech and free association, a denial of her due process rights, and state law claims. The defendants removed the case to federal court. The district court dismissed the state law claims and Bowers\u2019s due process claim insofar as it alleged that she had received inadequate notice before the University terminated her employment. Following discovery, the district court granted summary judgment on all of Bowers\u2019s remaining claims except her due process claim insofar as it alleged that Bowers had been deprived of an opportunity to be heard. Bowers thereafter waived her remaining due process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>On appeal, Bowers challenges the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the University and its officials on Bowers\u2019s First Amendment claims and the dismissal of Bowers\u2019s due process claim relating to allegations of inadequate notice. We review these issues de novo. <em>See Holland, </em>487 F.3d at 213.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Bowers argues that the email and attachments sent from her work computer constituted protected speech, and that the University violated her free speech rights by firing her, in part, for sending it. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">In <em>Ridpath v. Bd. of Governors Marshall Univ., </em>447 F.3d 292 (4th Cir.2006), this court reiterated the test, first set forth in <em>McVey v. Stacy, </em>157 F.3d 271 (4th Cir. 1998), to be used in analyzing whether a public employee has proven that a retaliatory action taken by her employer violated her free speech rights:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-7\">First, the public employee must have spoken as a citizen, not as an employee, on a matter of public concern. Second, the employee\u2019s interest in the expression at issue must have outweighed the employer\u2019s interest in providing effective and efficient services to the public. Third, there must have been a sufficient causal nexus between the protected speech and the retaliatory employment action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-8\"><em>Ridpath, </em>447 F.3d at 316 (internal citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">Under <em>McVey\u2019s </em>second prong, we find that the University\u2019s \u201cinterest in providing effective and efficient services to the public\u201d strongly outweighs Bowers\u2019s \u201cinterest in the expression at issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Bowers violated a state policy limiting the sending of personal email from state accounts and computers. This policy bolstered the University\u2019s attempts to manage the dissemination of information from University accounts and computers, part of its broader attempt to provide \u201ceffective and efficient services to the public,\u201d <em>id.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Bowers\u2019s interest in the expression at issue, while not insubstantial, fails to tilt the balance in her favor. Accordingly, we hold that Bowers\u2019s speech was not entitled to First Amendment protection under <em>McVey\u2019s </em>second prong. <em>McVey, </em>157 F.3d at 277; <em>Ridpath, </em>447 F.3d at 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-12\">Bowers next claims that the University violated her First Amendment rights by discharging her, in part, for refusing to answer her supervisors\u2019 questions about the source of the information contained in the attachments. She argues that this was tantamount to retaliating against her for her association with the NAACP. The district court agreed, but held that the right at issue was not \u201cclearly established,\u201d and that, therefore, the University\u2019s action was protected by qualified immunity. <em>See Conn v. Gabbert, </em>526 U.S. 286, 290, 119 S.Ct. 1292, 143 L.Ed.2d 399 (1999) (\u201c[A] court must first determine whether the plaintiff has alleged the depri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>vation of an actual constitutional right at all, and if so, proceed to determine whether that right was clearly established at the time of the alleged violation.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">We do not reach the \u201cclearly established\u201d prong of qualified immunity, however, concluding instead that Bowers failed to assert a viable freedom of association claim as a threshold matter. It is not open to debate that the University could not ask Bowers about NAACP membership information. <em>See NAACP v. Alabama, </em>357 U.S. 449, 466, 78 S.Ct. 1163, 2 L.Ed.2d 1488 (1958). That, however, is not what happened here. Rather, Bowers was questioned about the source of the compensation and benefits information the attachments described as being in place at the University. Bowers points to no authority, nor are we able to find any, that would prevent such an inquiry. On its face, the information must have <em>originated </em>from the school \u2014 not the NAACP \u2014 and the medical center worker from whom Bowers claimed to have obtained the information denied having provided it to her. On these facts, the University did not violate Bowers\u2019s First Anendment rights in seeking to ascertain the internal source of what it reasonably believed to be false and potentially harmful data about its own compensation structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">Bowers also argues that the University violated her due process right to adequate notice. The University was required to provide Bowers with timely oral or written notice describing the nature of the charges and the general evidence against her. <em>See Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, </em>470 U.S. 532, 546, 105 S.Ct. 1487, 84 L.Ed.2d 494 (1985). Bowers acknowledges that University officials spoke with her by telephone and asked her about the email, and that she was provided a copy of the email. She attended two in-person meetings with University officials prior to her termination, at which the contents and the impact of the email were discussed. It is unclear what other information about the University\u2019s concerns Bowers expected. Under these circumstances, we are compelled to agree with the district court\u2019s assessment \u201c[t]hat there is simply no question that [Bowers] was aware of the conduct giving rise to her dismissal.\u201d <em>Bowers v. Rector and Visitors of the Univ. of Va., </em>478 F.Supp.2d 874, 889 (W.D.Va.2007).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b307-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b304-10\">. The Commonwealth of Virginia maintained an internet use policy that required employees to identify personal communications sent from Commonwealth systems as personal, to prevent them from being viewed as official communications. J.A. 635.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b305-7\">. Bowers later claimed to have received certain salary information from Aretha Spears, a medical center employee. J.A. 605. However, Spears testified that she did not give Bowers any such information. J.A. 194.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b306-9\">. The University's interest in providing effective and efficient services to the public was severely hampered in this case by Bowers\u2019s actions. The inclusion of Bowers's title\u2014 \"UVA Human Resources Recruiter\u201d \u2014 gave recipients of her message the mistaken impression that Bowers sent the information as part of her job-related activity. As a result, the email was likely to, and in fact did, generate considerable confusion among recipients. Indeed, one of the University recipients testified that he assumed that the information came from Bowers in her capacity as a University Human Resources employee. The confusion generated by Bowers's email was not alleviated by the cover sheet accompanying the first attachment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b307-8\">. Bowers also asserts that the district court erred in its finding that Sandridge and Reynolds were not involved in her firing, and that the court erred in dismissing the University as a defendant. Bowers also challenges the district court\u2019s striking of certain emails from evidence for lack of authentication. In light of our holdings, <em>supra, </em>that Bowers's email was not protected speech, that she failed to assert a viable free association claim, and that her due process rights were not violated, we find it unnecessary to reach these issues. We have examined her other arguments, and find them to be without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
