We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>view de novo, <em>Boston Mut. Ins. v. Murphree, </em>242 F.3d 899, 902 (9th Cir.2001), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Glair contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to defendants because the search warrant was not supported by probable cause, and was based on omissions and misleading statements by the officers. We disagree. Considering the totality of the circumstances and in particular the report by Officer Gonzalez, the district court had a substantial basis for concluding that probable cause for the warrant existed. <em>See Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 238-39, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983). The record supports the district court\u2019s conclusion that Glair failed to raise a triable issue as to the validity of Officer Gonzalez\u2019s report. <em>See Hervey v. Estes, </em>65 F.3d 784, 790 (9th Cir.1995) (stating that on summary judgment a \u201csubstantial showing\u201d is required that the officers \u201cmade deliberately false statements or recklessly disregarded the truth in the affidavit.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Glair\u2019s remaining challenges to the validity of the warrant, including that the conditions in his apartment were insufficiently serious to constitute a violation, that not all of the officers repoi\u2019ted a smell, that the issuance of the warrant was to punish Glair for not agreeing to a warrantless inspection, and that the warrant lacked a legal basis, are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">Glair also contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment because the seizure of the dog was objectively unreasonable. We disagree. The photographic evidence obtained during the search gave the district court an objective basis to consider \u201cthe perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight.\u201d <em>Graham v. Connor, </em>490 U.S. 386, 396, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989). Considering this photographic record, the district court properly determined that Glair failed to raise a triable issue as to whether the seizure was objectively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-11\">Glair\u2019s remaining contentions, including those regarding the scope of Los Angeles Municipal Code \u00a7 53.10(a), judicial bias, and alleged mistakes in the magistrate judge\u2019s report, are also unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b684-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
