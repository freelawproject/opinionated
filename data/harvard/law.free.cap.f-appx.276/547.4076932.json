On appeal, Fry argues the revocation-hearing evidence was insufficient to support the district court\u2019s finding that Fry had committed an assault. After carefully reviewing the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">We conclude the district court did not clearly err in finding by a preponderance of the evidence that Fry had violated the conditions of his supervised release. <em>See United States v. Carothers, </em>337 F.3d 1017, 1019 (8th Cir.2003) (stating the government\u2019s burden of proof and the clear-error review standard). Although the district court did not engage in the balancing required by this court\u2019s precedent before admitting hearsay evidence of the alleged assault at the revocation hearing, <em>see United States v. Reynolds, </em>49 F.3d 423, 426 (8th Cir.1995) (explaining, before admitting hearsay evidence at revocation hearing, the court must balance defendant\u2019s constitutional right to confront a witness against the government\u2019s explanation for why confrontation is undesirable or impractical), the evidence appears to be admissible under that test, <em>see United States v. Martin, </em>371 F.3d 446, 448 (8th Cir.2004) (concluding the hearsay evidence offered by the government is admissible if the evidence is sufficiently reliable and the government has a reasonably satisfactory explanation for not producing the witness). Even if the evidence were not properly admitted, we conclude any error was harmless, given the evidence of other supervised release violations. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a) (\u201cAny error, defect, irregularity, or variance that does not affect substantial rights must be disregarded.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-13\">We grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b572-10\">.
