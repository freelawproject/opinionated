Odom, Lynda Joy Odom, James Steven White, Gregory Wayne White, Kimberly Gibson White, Jason R. Castleberry, and Renee P. Ryan (\"the plaintiffs\"), filed a complaint against the Dierckses, alleging that the Dierckses\n   had begun construction on an accessory building (\"the structure\") on lot 58 in the subdivision that was in violation of the restrictive covenants applicable to the subdivision. The plaintiffs requested the trial court to order the Dierckses to stop construction of the structure and to return lot 58 to its previous condition. On May 7, 2015, the Dierckses answered the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On February 4, 2016, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a summary judgment. On April 29, 2016, the Dierckses responded to the summary-judgment motion. The trial court entered a summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs on May 6, 2016. On June 5, 2016, the Dierckses filed a postjudgment motion; that motion was denied on July 26, 2016. On September 6, 2016, the Dierckses filed their notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The trial court set out the undisputed facts in its judgment as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \"1.

In addressing the issue, our supreme court found it noteworthy that \"[t]here is no restriction [in the restrictive covenants] which prohibits specifically the subdivision of a lot.\" 293 Ala. at 685, 309 So.2d at 818. The supreme court concluded that the trial court in that case had correctly determined that the subdivision of the lot was not prohibited so long as the subdivided lots remained subject to the restrictive covenants.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Tanglewood Homes Ass'n, Inc. v.

App. 2014) (holding that landowner could combine adjacent lots into one lot when restrictive covenants did not expressly forbid such action).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Relying on our supreme court's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Hoffman\n   </em>\n   and the general consideration that restrictive covenants must be\n   strictly construed, we conclude that the restrictive covenants at issue in the present case do not prevent the Dierckses from combining their two adjacent lots into one lot, with the combined lot remaining subject to the restrictive covenants. In its judgment, the trial court, primarily by treating lot 58 as a separate lot from lot 47 and by viewing the structure as the lone structure on lot 58, determined that the structure violated the restrictive covenants. However, as we have held, the Dierckses validly combined the lots, and the question for adjudication should have been whether the construction of the structure on the combined lot violated the restrictive covenants. Based on its erroneous belief that the lots remained legally separated for the purposes of the restrictive covenants, the trial court never reached that issue. Thus, we reverse the trial court's summary judgment to the extent it determined that the lots remained legally separate, and we remand the case for the trial court to reconsider its judgment in light of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Dierckses also argue that the trial court erred in determining that the construction of the structure violated covenant 2.B., which provides that the \"house [is] to be located on lot in accordance with zoning regulations of the City of Brewton, Alabama.\" The trial court determined that the structure, which is intended to garage a mobile home owned by the Dierckses, violated covenant 2.B. because a local zoning ordinance prohibits detached accessory buildings from being above 15 feet in height. By its plain language, covenant 2.B. only requires the location of the house on a lot to be in accordance with Brewton's zoning regulations. Covenant 2.B. does not regulate the height of accessory buildings by requiring compliance with local zoning regulations or otherwise. Thus, the trial court erred in concluding that the height of the structure violated covenant 2.B.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Based on the foregoing, we reverse the summary judgment entered by the trial court, and we remand the case for the trial court to conduct further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   REVERSED AND REMANDED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Pittman and Donaldson, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Thompson, P.J., dissents, with writing, which Thomas, J., joins.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   This appeal is from a summary judgment the Escambia Circuit Court (\"the trial court\") entered in favor of certain residents (\"the residents\") in the Second Alexander Heights Subdivision (\"the subdivision\") in their civil action against Robert Diercks and Carin Diercks, who also reside in the subdivision. In their action, the residents sought to enforce the \"protective covenants,\" also known as restrictive covenants, of the subdivision and to require the Dierckses to remove what is characterized as a \"pole barn/shed\" from a second lot the Dierckses had purchased\n   behind the lot on which their residence is located.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   We review a summary judgment pursuant to the following standard:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   \"This Court's review of a summary judgment is de novo.\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

More than 16 years after moving into that house, they purchased lot 58, which was vacant. The front of lot 58 faces Brooks Boulevard. The back of lot 58 abuts the back boundary line of lot 47, and it also abuts the back boundary line of lot 48, which is next door to the Dierckses' house. In other words, lot 58 runs from Brooks Boulevard to the back of lots 47 and 48. There is a drainage ditch on the east side of lot 58, causing it to curve into a triangular or wedge shape, so that the front of the lot that abuts Brooks Boulevard is 78.5 feet in width. The map shows that the greater portion of lot 58 lies behind lot 48 rather than behind the Dierckses' lot 47. The Odoms, who are among the residents who brought this action, live on Brooks Boulevard, on lot 57, which is on the west side of lot 58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The structure to be built on lot 58 is a detached accessory building, described in the Dierckses' application for a zoning variance as a \"pole barn/shed\" under which they intend to park their motor home. The application also states that the structure will exceed 15 feet in height, which exceeds the maximum height allowed for detached accessory buildings as set forth in the zoning requirements for the City of Brewton. Article IX, Section 9.142, City of Brewton Land Use and Development Ordinance (\"the zoning ordinance\"). According to the record, the Zoning Board of Adjustment did not grant the Dierckses the height variance they had requested. The Dierckses have appealed that decision. However, the Dierckses did not present any evidence to rebut the facts asserted by the residents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Upon consideration of the evidence submitted, the trial court determined that there were no genuine issues of material fact and that, as a matter of law, the residents were entitled to the injunctive relief they sought, that is, to have the Dierckses enjoined from going forward with construction of the \"pole barn/shed.\" Among other things, the undisputed evidence indicates that the structure exceeds the 15-foot height limit imposed by the zoning ordinance on detached accessory structures and that the front of the \"pole barn/shed\" opens onto the front of lot 58, which runs along Brooks Boulevard, in\n   violation of \"protective covenant\" 1.C. of the subdivision. That covenant provides that \"carports and garages must not open on or face toward the front of the lot.\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   \"Restrictive covenants will be recognized and enforced when established by contract, but they are not favored and will be strictly construed.\n   <em>\n    Carpenter v.

The effect of the covenants is to prohibit open garages and carports from being seen from the street and to prevent detached accessory buildings from detracting from the appearance of the neighborhood. The structure the Dierckses intend to build clearly violates at least some of the restrictive covenants at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Because the structure at issue in this case violates the restrictive covenants governing the subdivision, and because the Dierckses presented no evidence to indicate that their structure does not violate those covenants, I believe that the summary judgment was proper. Because I would affirm the judgment of the trial court, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Thomas, J., concurs.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    In their complaint, the plaintiffs alleged only violations of the restrictive covenants. We do not express any opinion on whether the plaintiffs could have also sought independent enforcement of the zoning regulations of the City of Brewton regarding the height of the structure. The record discloses that the City of Brewton notified the Dierckses that the height of the structure violated a city ordinance. The Dierckses sought a variance to permit the construction, which was denied. The Dierckses have appealed that determination. We express no opinion on whether the variance should be permitted. We hold only that the height of the structure does not violate covenant 2.B.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
