Indeed, the issues alleged by appellant in case no. 16-03245-CA were resolved adverse to appellant by virtue of the final judgment entered in case no. 16-00013-CA27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-13\">\n    Notwithstanding the caption of the order suggesting it is non-final, the content of the order (i.e., closing the case, denying all pending motions, referencing the res judicata effect of lower tribunal case no. 16-00013-CA27) makes clear that the appealed order has ended all judicial labor in the case.\n    <em>\n     Miami-Dade Water &amp; Sewer Auth. v.
