At the hearing on the motion to suppress, Defendant argued that if consent for the blood draw was given under the guise that there would be punishment for not consenting, the consent was not valid.

In\n   <em>\n    McNeely\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held that in drunk-driving investigations, the natural dissipation of alcohol in the bloodstream does not constitute an exigency in every case sufficient to justify conducting a blood test without a warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   There were three defendants in\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   . One of the defendants, Birchfield, was arrested for drunk driving and advised of his obligation under North Dakota law to undergo blood alcohol concentration testing and that refusing to submit to a blood test would lead to criminal punishment. Birchfield refused to let his blood be drawn and was convicted of a misdemeanor for his refusal. He appealed, arguing that the Fourth Amendment prohibited criminalizing his refusal to submit to the test. Another defendant, Beylund, was arrested for driving while impaired. He was read North Dakota's implied consent advisory, informing him that test refusal was a crime. Beylund then agreed to have his blood drawn. Given the test results, Beylund's driver's license was suspended for two years after an administrative hearing. He appealed, arguing that his consent to the blood test was coerced by the officer's warning that refusing to consent would itself be a crime. In addressing these claims, the Supreme Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Because breath tests are significantly less intrusive than blood tests and, in most cases, amply serve law enforcement interests, we conclude that a breath test, but not a blood test, may be administered as a search incident to a lawful arrest for drunk driving. As in all cases involving reasonable searches incident to arrest, a warrant is not needed in this situation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Having concluded that the search incident to arrest doctrine does not justify the warrantless taking of a blood sample, we must address respondents' alternative argument that such tests are justified based on the driver's legally implied consent to submit to them. It is well established that a search is reasonable when the subject consents,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Schneckloth v.

There is no indication in the record or briefing that a breath test would have failed to satisfy the State's interests in acquiring evidence to enforce its drunk-driving laws against Birchfield. And North Dakota has not presented any case-specific information to suggest that the exigent circumstances exception would have justified a warrantless search. Cf.\n   <em>\n    McNeely\n   </em>\n   , 569 U.S., at 163-64, 133 S.Ct. at 1567.

He submitted to a blood test after police told him that the law required his submission, and his license was then suspended and he was fined in an administrative proceeding.

He indicated that a traffic accident on November 15, 2016, resulted in the death of Derrik Williams. Defendant was transported to the hospital because of injuries from that accident. Tagliarino spoke to Defendant at the hospital and sought her version of what occurred. He testified that Defendant \"had a strong odor of alcoholic beverage.\" He then stated, \"When we got to that point, I advised her of her rights and proceeded with the paperwork, as required under a crash investigation.\" At the time he spoke to Defendant, Tagliarino was aware of the fatality. He did not have a warrant to draw Defendant's blood. When asked what he informed Defendant regarding the drawing of blood, Tagliarino stated, \"We read the forms that are required to read, and I asked Ms. Wilson if she would consent, which she did, and she signed the consent papers. I think she signed two different consent papers.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Tagliarino was questioned about State's Exhibit 1, a form regarding the arrestee's rights and notice of withdrawal of driving privileges. The form contained\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings and indicated that a blood test was administered. The form also contained a statement that Defendant had fifteen days from the date of her arrest to apply to the court for a hearing regarding her driver's license, and if a hearing was not requested, her license would be suspended for one year without eligibility for a hardship license. The collector's report that was part of the blood kit was admitted as State's Exhibit 2. Defendant signed that form, granting permission for the blood draw. Tagliarino testified that he read the forms to Defendant, and she indicated that she understood everything. Defendant did not state that she did not want to have her blood drawn and did not ask if she could decline to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Tagliarino was further questioned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Q. And you're ... are you aware of the Louisiana Supreme Court law that says that even if she had not consented, that you would have been authorized to take blood in this case?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   A. Yes, ma'am. I'm not familiar with the case law, but it is within our rights form that we do read.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Q. And you are familiar with that as part of your duties at Louisiana State Police at the time?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   A. Yes, ma'am.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Q. Okay.

No, ma'am. I asked ... I'll ask anybody that, if they'll voluntarily submit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Q. And you believe her consent to be voluntary?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   A. Absolutely.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The questioning of Tagliarino continued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Q.

Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Q. Okay.

He spoke to Defendant at the Natchitoches Parish Hospital. He recalled Tagliarino reading Defendant her rights from State's Exhibit 1, the arrestee's rights form and notice of withdrawal of driving privileges, and was present when the form was signed. Sergeant Raines filled out State's Exhibit 2, the collector's report from the blood kit. He was also present when Defendant signed Exhibit 2. Sergeant\n   Raines testified Defendant never indicated she did not consent, nor did she ask questions about whether she could refuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Sergeant Raines was questioned about consent to the blood draw:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   Q.

There is a form that we read when it a ... when it's not a vehicle [sic] homicide case.

Defendant argued that warrantless blood draws were unlawful, and that a motorist could not be deemed to have consented to submit to a blood test on \"pain of committing a criminal offense.\" Defendant further argued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   She submitted to a blood test, not necessarily in the pain of committing a criminal offense, but it's the pain of receiving some type of criminal punishment if she doesn't consent to the blood test. You have the officer who was on the scene at the beginning who admitted that he told her about the implied consent laws and he told her that in the case of a fatality, she basically cannot say, \"I don't consent.\" And that's why she consented. That is not voluntary consent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The State countered that it was conjecture to say that Defendant consented to the blood draw because she thought she could not refuse. Defendant argued that the form itself informed her that her consent is implied, and that if she failed to consent, she would receive punishment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The trial court ruled:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   I believe that Ms. Ebone Wilson's consent was valid and voluntary. In fact, there are two documents that indicate her consent. I believe that the blood draw was justified under the circumstances. Louisiana law allows law enforcement officers to draw blood from a motorist who has been involved in an accident in which there is a fatality. There was consent in this case. In fact, two documents. But even past that, the law allows under\n   Louisiana R.S. 32:681(a) the operator of any motor vehicle which is involved in a collision, or an operator of any watercraft involved in a collision, crash, or other casualty, in which a fatality occurs should be deemed to have given consent to and shall be administered a chemical test or test of the blood, urine, or other bodily substances for the purposes of determining the presence of any abused substance or controlled dangerous substance as set forth in Louisiana R.S. 40:964, or any other impairing substance. So, point of fact, that she has given consent, additionally in accordance with this law and\n   <em>\n    State v. Weber\n   </em>\n   , which has been cited by the State, I believe that the blood draw was justified and the Motion to Suppress is denied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In her writ application, Defendant discussed\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   , stating that police should have conducted a breath test to determine her blood alcohol concentration rather than a warrantless blood draw, which, she argued, is prohibited by the Fourth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Louisiana's implied consent law and penalties for failure to acquiesce thereto can be found in La.R.S. 32:661.

He argued that pursuant to La.R.S. 32:666, prior to the 2012 amendment thereto, he had the right to refuse to submit to the blood test because there was no probable cause to believe he was operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcoholic beverages at the time of the accident that killed the driver of the vehicle he struck. The first circuit, noting there were signs of impairment, discussed La.R.S. 32:681 and found that once police determined on the scene that defendant was the driver of the truck and a fatality had occurred, police had reasonable grounds to order defendant's blood drawn for analysis. The court stated, \"Defendant, as the operator of the vehicle, was 'deemed to have given consent' to the blood test, and the trial court did not err in ruling that he lawfully submitted to the test.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6837384,6837431,6837409,6837464\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/180/315/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6837384,6837431,6837409,6837464\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/180/315/\">\n    at 450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   In the instant case, by virtue of La.R.S. 32:681, Defendant, as the operator of a vehicle involved in a collision resulting in a fatality, is deemed to have given consent to the blood test conducted. Additionally, under La.R.S. 32:666, Defendant could not refuse testing. Furthermore, the penalties\n   set forth in La.R.S. 32:666 for refusal to submit to testing are inapplicable to Defendant.
