West Boca Medical Center, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6856976,6856939\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/174/1114/\">\n    174 So.3d 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fla. 4th DCA 2015).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In July 2008, Alexis Cantore suffered permanent brain damage while being treated for hydrocephalus at West Boca Medical Center (WBMC) and Miami Children's Hospital (MCH). The Fourth District described the background of this case as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2006, two years before the illness that gave rise to this case, when Alexis Cantore was twelve years old, she was diagnosed with hydrocephalus, a condition resulting from a build-up of excess cerebral spinal fluid within the cranium. Her condition resulted from a benign tumor which grew and blocked the outflow of the fluid which normally circulates around the brain. In 2006, she underwent a procedure, known as an Endoscopic Third Ventriculostomy (\"ETV\"), to remove the blockage. The procedure, which was performed at MCH, relieved the problem without causing Alexis any permanent injury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   However, scar tissue began to develop; a December 2007 CT scan at WBMC showed fluid starting to accumulate around her brain again. MRIs in March and June 2008 confirmed that a blockage was occurring again. A doctor at MCH scheduled Alexis for an ETV on July 28, 2008.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   However, on July 3, 2008, at 2:30 p.m., Alexis began experiencing painful headaches and vomiting. Alexis's parents called MCH; a nurse told them to bring Alexis to the nearest hospital for a CT scan if they could not make it to MCH. Alexis was taken by ambulance to WBMC, arriving at 4:29 p.m. She was triaged and, on a three-tiered scale of categories (emergent, urgent and non-urgent), was listed in the middle category as \"urgent.\" \"Urgent\" patients are those who are sick and require care, but are able to progress. In contrast, \"emergent\" patients may deteriorate quickly and need interventions, while \"non-urgent\" patients may have something like a laceration or a bite, which requires care but is not a medical emergency. The triage nurse on duty, in categorizing Alexis as \"urgent,\" noted that she was awake and alert, moving all extremities, had a normal neurological exam, and a normal pupillary response, which was not indicative of an impending brain herniation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Dr. Freyre-Cubano (\"Dr. Freyre\"), a pediatrician who was working in the WBMC emergency room, ordered a CT scan STAT at 4:47 p.m., before examining Alexis. Dr. Freyre first evaluated Alexis and noted that she had a normal pupillary exam. A nurse also noted no deficits to Alexis's eyes. Dr. Freyre performed another eye exam which showed that Alexis's pupils were equal and reactive to light. A radiologist read the new CT scan, compared it with the previous one from December 2007, and confirmed in a report that Alexis's condition was worsening, and that the ventricles were larger than they had been on the previous CT scan. The findings were \"consistent with worsening hydrocephalus.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   By 5:40 p.m., Dr. Freyre had reviewed the report on the CT scan and called Dr. Sandberg, the on-call pediatric neurosurgeon at MCH, regarding transferring Alexis to MCH. At that time, Dr. Freyre told Dr. Sandberg that Alexis was \"stable.\" This became an important issue at trial and ... on appeal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Dr. Freyre spoke with MCH's emergency department physicians regarding transferring Alexis via MCH's helicopter transportation service, known as \"LifeFlight.\" About twenty minutes later, the MCH dispatcher for LifeFlight received the request for transport.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   A WBMC nurse called the operations administrator at MCH, and apparently learned that the pilots on shift were approaching the maximum twelve hours of flight time and Alexis's transport would be completed by the on-coming pilots. LifeFlight's estimated arrival time was 7:00 p.m.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   At 6:22 p.m., Alexis had an episode of vomiting, during which her heart rate briefly dropped to 55. A WBMC nurse then contacted a MCH Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (\"PICU\") nurse to update them. Dr. Freyre noted that she had called the MCH emergency department physician regarding Alexis's transfer and gave the necessary information.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Alexis was transferred to LifeFlight care at 7:25 p.m. She was examined by a LifeFlight nurse. The neurological assessment at that time was that Alexis was asleep, non-verbal and oriented as to person. When she was awakened, she was able to respond to her mother by nodding her head, and her pupils were equal, round and reactive to light. She had a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 13, with a perfect score being 15. She had a decrease in her speech. The helicopter lifted off at 8:09 p.m.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   During the flight, Alexis suffered an acute decompensation. By the time she landed at MCH at 8:25 p.m., she had suffered a brain herniation. Accordingly, instead of taking Alexis to PICU, hospital personnel took her straight to the ER. Alexis arrived in very critical condition. Dr. Sandberg did an emergent ventriculostomy, in which he drilled a hole into her skull to insert a catheter, thereby relieving pressure on the brain. This procedure saved her life. However, Alexis suffered permanent brain damage; she has significant mental impairment and must be fed through a tube. She will never be able to work or live independently.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6856976,6856939\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/174/1114/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6856976,6856939\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/174/1114/\">\n    at 1115-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In 2010, Alexis and her parents, Felix and Barbara Cantore, sued WBMC and MCH, alleging that they had not provided proper medical care for Alexis on July 3, 2008. The Cantores presented testimony from several expert witnesses regarding the timing of Alexis' transfer from WBMC to MCH and the care she received from the LifeFlight crew. One of the witnesses, Dr. William Loudon, a pediatric neurosurgeon, testified that, based on his understanding of Alexis' condition before she herniated, if she had come under his care prior to the herniation, he would have performed an emergency ventriculostomy. In Dr. Loudon's opinion, if Alexis had received earlier relief from the build-up of cerebrospinal fluid in her brain, the herniation could have been prevented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Over the Cantores' objection, counsel for WBMC was permitted to publish to the jury the deposition of Dr. Sandberg, the pediatric neurosurgeon at MCH who operated on Alexis, in which Dr. Sandberg answered hypothetical questions as to how he would have treated Alexis had she arrived at MCH an hour or two earlier. The trial court also permitted Dr. Steven White, WBMC's expert on pediatric emergency medicine, to testify that Dr. Sandberg's statement as to what he would have done had Alexis arrived at MCH earlier was consistent with what other neurosurgeons would have done.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Ultimately, the jury returned a verdict in favor of WBMC and MCH. The Fourth District affirmed, concluding that this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Saunders v.

A subsequent treating physician simply may not be present at the time a defendant physician makes an allegedly negligent decision or engages in a potentially negligent act. Further, it is not only the final physician, but rather each treating physician who must act in a reasonably prudent manner.... To [allow testimony from a subsequent treating physician like that of the first neurosurgeon], would alter the long-established reasonably prudent physician standard where the specific conduct of an individual doctor in a specific circumstance is evaluated. It would place a burden on the plaintiff to somehow prove causation by demonstrating that a subsequent treating physician would not have disregarded the correct diagnosis or testing, contrary to his or her testimony and irrespective of the standard of care for the defendant physician.

Dr. Sandberg explained that this would have been the result regardless of the condition Alexis was in when she arrived. If Alexis had arrived earlier and had been in stable condition, Dr. Sandberg would have scheduled a surgery for later in the day, but Alexis likely would have deteriorated prior to the scheduled surgery, requiring the same type of emergency intervention she actually received.

In the parties' hypotheticals, Dr. Sandberg was not asked to explain the standard of professional care for transferring patients with hydrocephalus who exhibit symptoms like the ones Alexis was exhibiting. Nor was he asked his opinion about whether any of the other healthcare providers involved in Alexis' care on July 3, 2008, failed to meet that standard. In the context of the entire trial record, it is clear that the purpose of introducing the challenged portions of Dr. Sandberg's deposition testimony was to break the chain of causation between the alleged negligent conduct of WBMC or MCH, or both, and Alexis' injuries-i.e., to establish that Alexis still would have suffered permanent brain damage even if the hospitals and their staffs had effectuated a faster transfer from WBMC to MCH.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, Dr. Sandberg's testimony on that point was \"irrelevant and inadmissible,\"\n   <em>\n    Saunders\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6896511\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/151/434/\">\n    151 So.3d at 443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and the trial court abused its discretion in allowing it to be read to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Contrary to the dissent's attempt to factually distinguish this case from\n   <em>\n    Saunders,\n   </em>\n   nothing in the four corners of\n   <em>\n    Saunders\n   </em>\n   provides that the admissibility of a subsequent treating physician's testimony about the causation element is affected by the subsequent treating physician also serving as an advisor to an initial treating physician\n   or being referred to as a neutral and \"hybrid\" expert witness. Instead, in\n   <em>\n    Saunders\n   </em>\n   , this Court's focus was on the substance of the subsequent treating physician's testimony and its effect on the plaintiff's case. Similarly, here, the pertinent hypotheticals at issue concerned Dr. Sandberg's status as the subsequent treating physician and how his own subsequent treatment might have changed if any previous treating healthcare providers had acted differently (i.e., arranged a faster transfer).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Additionally, the error here was not harmless.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 59.041, Fla.

Indeed, the Cantores presented multiple witnesses who testified that the actions of WBMC (including Dr. Freyre) and MCH fell below the applicable standard of care, causing Alexis to suffer permanent brain damage. However, counsel for WBMC and MCH relied on Dr. Sandberg's responses to the hypothetical questions to argue to the jury that the Cantores failed to meet their \"promise\" to show that the outcome in this case would have been different had Alexis arrived at MCH earlier than she did. In making this argument, counsel for WBMC and MCH each read directly from Dr. Sandberg's deposition, highlighting the erroneously admitted portions of his testimony. In\n   <em>\n    Saunders\n   </em>\n   , this Court expressly disapproved of this type of burden-shifting argument regarding the causation element of a medical malpractice claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6896511\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/151/434/\">\n    151 So.3d at 442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But for the erroneous admission of Dr. Sandberg's deposition testimony, counsel could not have made such an argument and put the Cantores in the position of needing to prove that Dr. Sandberg's testimony was false. Furthermore, the record reflects that during deliberations the jury twice asked to review Dr. Sandberg's deposition testimony. After a five-week long trial with 42 witnesses, this was one of only two witnesses the jury asked to hear from again. Finally, as the Cantores point out, Dr. Sandberg's testimony about how he would have treated Alexis if she had arrived at MCH earlier was bolstered by Dr. White's testimony that Dr. Sandberg's responses were \"consistent\" with his own experience with emergency ventriculostomies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Accordingly, the erroneous admission of Dr. Sandberg's testimony was not harmless.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Dr. Sandberg's testimony about how he would have treated Alexis had she arrived at MCH earlier was inadmissible and cannot be considered harmless error.

First,\n   <em>\n    Cantore\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Saunders\n   </em>\n   involve entirely different questions of law regarding medical malpractice actions.\n   <em>\n    Cantore\n   </em>\n   involves the admissibility of certain deposition testimony from a \"subsequent\" treating physician. In\n   <em>\n    Saunders\n   </em>\n   , this Court's majority couched its holding, in part, in terms of the relevance and admissibility of the subsequent treating physician's deposition testimony, but that language in\n   <em>\n    Saunders\n   </em>\n   is mere dicta. The actual question of law in\n   <em>\n    Saunders\n   </em>\n   involved not whether the testimony was admissible but rather whether the testimony could be given conclusive effect regarding the element of causation. Second, even if\n   <em>\n    Saunders\n   </em>\n   can properly be read to involve the issue of admissibility, jurisdiction is still lacking because\n   <em>\n    Cantore\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Saunders\n   </em>\n   do not involve substantially similar controlling facts. Among other things, the nature of the testimony at issue in\n   <em>\n    Cantore\n   </em>\n   is significantly different from the specific type of testimony proscribed by\n   <em>\n    Saunders\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    The Actual Question of Law in\n    <em>\n     Saunders\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   This Court's majority in\n   <em>\n    Saunders\n   </em>\n   chose to couch its holding, in part, in terms of the relevance and admissibility of the deposition testimony.\n   <em>\n    Saunders\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6896511\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/151/434/\">\n    151 So.3d at 443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the majority's determination of jurisdiction rests squarely on the admissibility aspect of the \"holding\" in\n   <em>\n    Saunders\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   majority op. at 257 (quashing the Fourth District's decision \"[b]ecause the treating physician's deposition testimony ... was inadmissible\").

On appeal, the Fourth District framed the issue regarding defense counsel's closing argument as one involving the burden of proof.

Without providing any framework for doing so, the majority in\n   <em>\n    Saunders\n   </em>\n   couched its holding, in part, in terms of the relevance and admissibility of the deposition testimony: \"we hold that testimony that a subsequent treating physician would not have treated the patient plaintiff differently had the defendant physician acted within the applicable standard of care\n   <em>\n    is irrelevant and inadmissible\n   </em>\n   and will not insulate a defendant physician from liability for his or her own negligence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6896511\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/151/434/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6896511\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/151/434/\">\n    at 443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). There is nothing to indicate that the issue of admissibility was in any way presented to this Court. None of the analysis in\n   <em>\n    Saunders\n   </em>\n   addresses the issue of admissibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Lacking any foundation in the Court's analysis, the language in\n   <em>\n    Saunders\n   </em>\n   regarding relevance and admissibility simply pops up from nowhere in the conclusion of the opinion. It is wholly unnecessary to the resolution of the case and is thus mere dicta. Under article V, section 3(b)(3) of the Florida Constitution, express and direct conflict cannot be established based on a purported conflict with a sua sponte statement from this Court-whether couched as a holding or otherwise-regarding some future issue that was never presented or analyzed in the case. Rather, that constitutional requirement must be grounded in a decision concerning an issue actually presented and considered by the Court. And in\n   <em>\n    Saunders\n   </em>\n   , the only \"question of law\" that was actually \"deci[ded]\" involved the burden of proof and whether certain testimony could be given conclusive effect regarding the element of causation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   art.

Not one of those three cases turned on the issue of admissibility.

In\n   <em>\n    Goolsby\n   </em>\n   , the issue was whether a directed verdict was properly granted in favor of a defendant physician based on the absence of evidence showing that any of the other physicians involved would have done anything differently even if the x-rays had been properly read.\n   <em>\n    Goolsby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9124481\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/847/1001/\">\n    847 So.2d at 1002-03\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And in\n   <em>\n    Ewing\n   </em>\n   , the issue was whether a directed verdict was properly granted in favor of the defendant physician based on testimony from the subsequent treating physician that he would not have done anything differently even if the defendant physician had performed a risk evaluation.\n   <em>\n    Ewing\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11523267\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/758/1196/\">\n    758 So.2d at 1196-97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These three district court cases all involve the conclusive effect of testimony as opposed to the admissibility of that testimony.

The actual holding of\n   <em>\n    Saunders\n   </em>\n   is thus that testimony by a subsequent treating physician regarding what he or she would have done cannot be given conclusive effect regarding the element of causation. Although such testimony may create an inference of no causation, ultimately the case cannot be decided as a matter of law based on what a particular physician would have done as opposed to what a hypothetical physician operating under the professional standard of care would have done.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In short, because the decisions in\n   <em>\n    Saunders\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Cantore\n   </em>\n   involve entirely different questions of law, this Court does not have jurisdiction to review\n   <em>\n    Cantore\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    The Differing Factual Nature of\n    <em>\n     Saunders\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Cantore\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Even assuming that\n   <em>\n    Saunders\n   </em>\n   can properly be read to involve the issue of admissibility, conflict jurisdiction still does not exist.

For example,\n   unlike\n   <em>\n    Saunders\n   </em>\n   -in which, unbeknownst to the jury, the subsequent treating physician had been an active defendant at the time of his deposition-the district court in\n   <em>\n    Cantore\n   </em>\n   described the subsequent treating physician as being \"at all times a neutral third-party witness with no motivation to deny wrongdoing or avoid liability as he was never a defendant, unlike the testifying neurosurgeon in\n   <em>\n    Saunders\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Cantore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6856976,6856939\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/174/1114/\">\n    174 So.3d at 1121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, in\n   <em>\n    Cantore\n   </em>\n   , the district court made clear that the subsequent treating physician was also intimately involved in and \"played such an influential role in the care at issue:\" the original treating physician and other medical personnel at the original treating physician's hospital \"continually followed [the subsequent treating physician's] instructions, heeded his recommendations, and noted his preferences.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6856976,6856939\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/174/1114/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6856976,6856939\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/174/1114/\">\n    at 1119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Finally, unlike\n   <em>\n    Saunders\n   </em>\n   , the district court in\n   <em>\n    Cantore\n   </em>\n   repeatedly referred to the subsequent treating physician as an \"expert\" witness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6856976,6856939\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/174/1114/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6856976,6856939\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/174/1114/\">\n    at 1115, 1119, 1120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Saunders\n   </em>\n   itself recognized that medical malpractice actions \"often involve\" expert witnesses testifying to hypotheticals involving \"what a reasonably prudent physician would have done\n   <em>\n    and the effect that such reasonable care would have had\n   </em>\n   on the patient.\"\n   <em>\n    Saunders\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6896511\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/151/434/\">\n    151 So.3d at 442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). And that is exactly how the district court portrayed the subsequent treating physician in\n   <em>\n    Cantore\n   </em>\n   -as an expert witness testifying regarding hypotheticals. The majority here ignores the differences between the subsequent treating physicians in\n   <em>\n    Saunders\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Cantore\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <em>\n    Cantore\n   </em>\n   is also distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Saunders\n   </em>\n   based on the underlying nature of the deposition testimony in the two cases. In\n   <em>\n    Saunders\n   </em>\n   , this Court's majority proscribed (in dicta) certain specific testimony from a subsequent treating physician-namely, testimony \"that adequate care by the defendant physician would not have altered the subsequent care.\"\n   <em>\n    Saunders\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6896511\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/151/434/\">\n    151 So.3d at 442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That proscribed testimony is missing here. In\n   <em>\n    Cantore\n   </em>\n   , the \"true condition\" of the child while under the physical care of the original treating physician was very much in dispute at trial and was the critical factual issue for the jury to decide. As the district court noted, the original treating physician's \"action (or inaction) was the focus of the entire five-week trial,\"\n   <em>\n    Cantore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6856976,6856939\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/174/1114/\">\n    174 So.3d at 1121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and the plaintiffs' \"strategy during the course of the litigation and at trial was to demonstrate that [the original treating physician] failed to appreciate [the child's] true condition and as a result provided inaccurate information to multiple healthcare providers at [Miami Children's Hospital], including, but not limited to, [the subsequent treating physician],\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6856976,6856939\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/174/1114/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6856976,6856939\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/174/1114/\">\n    at 1120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . What is clear from the district court's opinion is that the subsequent treating physician's deposition testimony regarding the likelihood of the same end result was based\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   on the underlying assumption that the child was \"alert and oriented,\" as opposed to deteriorating neurologically.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6856976,6856939\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/174/1114/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6856976,6856939\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/174/1114/\">\n    at 1117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And that underlying assumption \"was based on his understanding of [the child's] condition at that time.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6856976,6856939\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/174/1114/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6856976,6856939\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/174/1114/\">\n    at 1119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In fact, the district court specifically noted that the subsequent treating physician testified \"that\n   <em>\n    he would have made different recommendations\n   </em>\n   to intubate and administer diuretics had he been told\" that the\n   child's condition was as the plaintiffs suggested-that is, deteriorating neurologically.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6856976,6856939\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/174/1114/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6856976,6856939\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/174/1114/\">\n    at 1120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, the subsequent treating physician testified that he would have treated the child\n   <em>\n    differently\n   </em>\n   under the competing factual scenarios. The gist of his \"expert\" testimony thus was that the child's \"true condition\" was the \"key point\" that would have determined \"the timing of intervention.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6856976,6856939\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/174/1114/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And he explained why, assuming that the child was in fact awake and oriented, it would not have mattered if the child had come under his physical care two hours earlier than she did.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6856976,6856939\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/174/1114/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6856976,6856939\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/174/1114/\">\n    at 1117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nothing within the four corners of the\n   <em>\n    Cantore\n   </em>\n   opinion supports the conclusion that the subsequent treating physician testified that he would not have treated the child differently-and that the end result would have inevitably been the same-even if the child's \"true condition\" was as asserted by the plaintiffs at trial. The nature of the deposition testimony in\n   <em>\n    Cantore\n   </em>\n   -as described by the district court within the four corners of its opinion-is dramatically different than that in\n   <em>\n    Saunders\n   </em>\n   , in which the original treating physician did not correctly diagnose the patient, and in which the subsequent treating physician testified that a correct diagnosis would nevertheless not have affected the subsequent treatment of the patient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The majority improperly bases its determination of jurisdiction in this case on its \"disagreement with the result reached by a district court applying\"\n   <em>\n    Saunders\n   </em>\n   , as opposed to on express and direct conflict with\n   <em>\n    Saunders\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Dorsey v.
