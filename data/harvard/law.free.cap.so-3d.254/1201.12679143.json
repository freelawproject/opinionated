In this case, plaintiff asserted that after the delivery of her baby, during which she was administered epidural anesthesia multiple times, she was unable to feel her legs. Despite her protestations, plaintiff asserted the nursing staff at Lafayette General Medical Center forced her out of bed and she fell onto the floor, injuring her neck. In my view, the negligence asserted by the plaintiff is such that a lay person could infer negligence without the need for expert testimony. For this reason, I find defendant's motion for summary judgment should have been denied. Thus, I would grant plaintiff's writ application and reverse the rulings of the lower courts.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
