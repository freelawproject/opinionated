On appeal, Appellant argues that: 1) the State failed to prove that he committed the offense of battery on an emergency medical care provider; and 2) Appellant's trial counsel was ineffective on the face of the record for failing to request a self-defense jury instruction and failing to move for a judgment of acquittal on the battery on an emergency medical care provider charge. We agree with Appellant's arguments pertaining to the battery on an emergency medical care provider count and reverse that conviction. We affirm otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Appellant was involuntarily brought to the emergency department of the VA pursuant to Florida's Baker Act\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   after his employer reported that Appellant was exhibiting erratic behavior. Appellant was subsequently admitted to the VA's inpatient psychiatric unit where, after learning that he was not being released, Appellant became combative and spit on a nurse and a VA law enforcement officer. Based on the foregoing, the State charged Appellant with one count of battery on an emergency medical care provider for spitting on the nurse, one count of battery for spitting on the VA officer, and one count of resisting an officer without violence. Appellant pled not guilty and filed a notice of intent to rely upon insanity as a defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The matter proceeded to a jury trial where the State presented evidence that the nurse victim was a Licensed Practical Nurse (\"LPN\") who, on the day in question, was working in the VA's inpatient psychiatric unit. The State's evidence also established that the psychiatric unit was a secure lockdown unit which was separate and distinct from the VA's other departments, including the emergency department. At the conclusion of the State's case, Appellant's counsel declined to move for a judgment of acquittal (\"JOA\") on any of the charges. Instead, counsel focused on\n   an insanity defense, presenting evidence from a psychiatrist who opined that Appellant was not able to determine whether what he did was right or wrong when he spit on the nurse and VA officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Considering the evidence, the jury rejected Appellant's insanity affirmative defense and found him guilty of battery on an emergency medical care provider, guilty of battery, and not-guilty of resisting an officer without violence. The court adjudicated Appellant per the jury's verdict and sentenced Appellant to time served followed by eighteen months of probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    a) Sufficiency of the Evidence Proving Battery on an Emergency Medical Care Provider\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Appellant contends that the State's evidence regarding the nurse victim was insufficient to support a conviction for battery on an emergency medical care provider. Appellant is correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Section 784.03 of the Florida Statutes provides that the offense of battery is a first degree misdemeanor and \"occurs when a person: 1. [a]ctually and intentionally touches or strikes another person against the will of the other; or 2. [i]ntentionally causes bodily harm to another person.\" \u00a7 784.03(1)(a) -(b), Fla. Stat. (2015). When a battery is committed on certain persons, including \"an emergency medical care provider ... while the ... emergency medical care provider ... is engaged in the lawful performance of his or her duties,\" section 784.07 of the Florida Statutes reclassifies the offense \"of battery, from a misdemeanor of the first degree to a felony of the third degree.\" \u00a7 784.07(2), (2)(b), Fla. Stat. (2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the elements of the offense of battery on an emergency medical care provider are: (1) the defendant intentionally touched or struck the victim or intentionally caused bodily harm to the victim; (2) the victim was an emergency medical care provider; (3) the defendant knew that the victim was an emergency medical care provider; and (4) the emergency medical care provider was engaged in the lawful performance of his or her duties when the battery was committed.

Therefore, in order to prove that Appellant committed the offense of battery on an emergency medical care provider with respect to the alleged nurse victim, the State was required to prove that the nurse was indeed \"an emergency medical care provider.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The term \"emergency medical care provider\" is defined as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   1) [A]n ambulance driver, emergency medical technician, paramedic, registered nurse, physician as defined in s. 401.23, medical director as defined in s. 401.23, or any person authorized by an emergency medical service licensed under chapter 401 who is engaged in the performance of his or her duties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   2) The term \"emergency medical care provider\" also includes physicians, employees, agents, or volunteers of hospitals as defined in chapter 395, who are employed, under contract, or otherwise authorized by a hospital to perform duties directly associated with the care and treatment rendered by the hospital's emergency department or the security thereof.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00a7 784.07(1)(a), Fla.

Accordingly, in order to meet the first classification of persons outlined in the definition of \"emergency medical care provider,\" the State needed to establish that the nurse victim was a \"registered nurse ... or any person authorized by an emergency medical service license under chapter 401 who is engaged in the performance of his or her duties.\" \u00a7 784.07(1)(a), Fla. Stat. (2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The definition section of chapter 401 defines a \"registered nurse\" as \"a practitioner who is licensed to practice\n   <strong>\n    professional\n   </strong>\n   nursing pursuant to part I of chapter 464.\" \u00a7 401.23(20), Fla. Stat. (2015) (emphasis added). Chapter 464 governs the regulation of nursing in Florida. Part I of Chapter 464 provides that an LPN is any \"person licensed in this state or holding an active multistate license under s. 464.0095 to practice\n   <strong>\n    practical\n   </strong>\n   nursing.\" \u00a7 464.003(16), Fla. Stat. (2015) (emphasis added). It further delineates that \"the practice of\n   <strong>\n    practical\n   </strong>\n   nursing\" is distinct from \"the practice of\n   <strong>\n    professional\n   </strong>\n   nursing\" and that only a \"registered nurse\" is licensed \"to practice professional nursing.\" \u00a7 464.003(19) -(20), (22), Fla. Stat. (2015) (emphasis added). As an LPN is only licensed to practice practical, not professional, nursing, an LPN does not meet the definition of a \"registered nurse\" under either chapter 401 or 464. Therefore, as an LPN, the nurse victim did not qualify as a \"registered nurse\" as used in the definition of \"emergency medical care provider.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Likewise, the evidence also did not establish that the nurse victim was \"any person authorized by an emergency medical service license under chapter 401.\" Chapter 401 provides for the licensure of emergency medical transportation services such as ambulances and air ambulances. \u00a7\u00a7 401.25, .251, Fla. Stat. (2015). The nurse victim was working for a hospital, not a medical transportation service. Accordingly, based on both her license classification and who she worked for, the State did not prove that the nurse victim fell under the first class of persons defined as an \"emergency medical care provider.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   To fall under the second classification of persons outlined in the definition of \"emergency medical care provider,\" the State was required to prove that the nurse victim was an \"employee[ ], agent[ ], or volunteer[ ] of [a] hospital[ ] as defined in chapter 395, who [was] employed, under contract, or otherwise authorized by [the] hospital to perform duties directly associated with the care and treatment rendered by the hospital's\n   <strong>\n    emergency department\n   </strong>\n   or the security thereof.\" \u00a7 784.07(1)(a), Fla. Stat. (2015) (emphasis added). The evidence adduced at trial established that when she was spit upon, the nurse victim was performing LPN services in the VA's inpatient psychiatric unit. The evidence also established that the VA's inpatient psychiatric unit was separate and distinct from its emergency department. Accordingly, the evidence submitted at trial did not establish that the nurse victim's duties were \"directly associated with the care and treatment rendered by the hospital's emergency department.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7010281\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/114/1042/#p1045\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, the State also did not prove that the nurse victim qualified as an \"emergency medical care provider\" under either classification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Despite the State's failure to prove that the nurse victim qualified as an \"emergency medical care provider,\" Appellant failed to move for a JOA based on the insufficiency of the evidence and, therefore, failed to preserve the issue for anything other than a fundamental error review.\n   <em>\n    F.B. v.

Based on this narrow application, the Florida Supreme Court has clearly delineated that unpreserved challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence may only be reviewed for fundamental error in two circumstances: \"(1) the mandatory review by [the supreme court] of the evidence by which a capital defendant was convicted and sentenced to death; and (2) when there is insufficient evidence that a defendant committed\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   crime.\"\n   <em>\n    Monroe v.

Therefore, Appellant's insufficiency of the evidence argument is not cognizable on appeal. The issue is, however, cognizable as an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    b) Ineffective Assistance of Counsel on the Face of the Record\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \"[I]neffective assistance of counsel claims should rarely be raised on direct appeal because they are generally fact-specific.\"\n   <em>\n    Michel v.

Therefore, had counsel made a proper motion, Appellant would have been entitled to a JOA on the battery on an emergency medical care provider count and a reduction of the charge to the lesser included offense of battery. The distinction between the two offenses is significant as battery is a misdemeanor while battery on an emergency care provider is a felony. Thus, it is plain from the face of the record that counsel's failure to seek a JOA on the battery on an emergency care provider charge was prejudicial to Appellant and constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bagnara\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6806509\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/189/167/#p171\">\n    189 So.3d at 172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (counsel's failure to properly move for JOA when state did not prove value element of grand theft constituted ineffective assistance of counsel on the face of the record);\n   <em>\n    Gordon v.

Arguing self-defense as proffered would have required Appellant's counsel to assert that, in the alternative, Appellant knew what he was doing but reasonably believed he needed to act to protect himself from being unlawfully detained. It is entirely possible and reasonable that counsel made a strategic decision not to pursue an alternate defense of self-defense in order not to undermine the credibility of the proffered insanity defense.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cole v.

Although Appellant's trial counsel did not preserve this error for appeal by moving for a JOA and the error is not fundamental, counsel's failure to move for a JOA constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel on the face of the record. Counsel was not, however, ineffective on the face of the record for failing to request a self-defense instruction when counsel also proffered a potentially inconsistent insanity defense. Based on the foregoing, we reverse Appellant's conviction and sentence for battery on an emergency medical care provider and, on remand, direct the trial court to enter a judgment of guilt for the lesser-included offense of battery and proceed with a resentencing on that count. We otherwise affirm without prejudice for Appellant to file a motion for postconviction relief on the self-defense issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    Affirmed in part, reversed in part and remanded.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Levine, J., concurs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Kuntz, J., concurs specially with opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   As Judge Winokur explains in his concurring opinion in\n   <em>\n    Latson v.

In response, defense counsel represented that the Defendant was not seeking a judgment of acquittal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Monroe v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6802223\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/191/395/#p401\">\n    191 So.3d 395\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 398 (Fla. 2016), \"[a]fter the State rested, the trial court asked defense counsel if they intended to move for judgment of acquittal. Defense counsel declined.\" The defendant argued on appeal that the state failed to introduce evidence to establish an element of the crime.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6802223\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/191/395/#p401\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6802223\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/191/395/#p401\">\n    at 399-400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Conceding the issue was not preserved, the defendant argued it was fundamental error to convict him when the State failed to prove each element of the crime.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6802223\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/191/395/#p401\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Our supreme court reaffirmed its prior decisions, holding that unpreserved challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence cannot be reviewed on direct appeal when there is sufficient evidence to establish the defendant committed a crime.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6802223\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/191/395/#p401\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6802223\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/191/395/#p401\">\n    at 401-02\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Such unpreserved claims are only cognizable as fundamental error on direct appeal when the State fails to prove the defendant committed any crime at all.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6802223\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/191/395/#p401\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   But the lack of preservation or fundamental error did not result in an affirmance.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6802223\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/191/395/#p401\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court continued and held \"that the failure of Monroe's trial counsel to preserve the sufficiency of the evidence issue for appellate review constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel that is apparent from the face of this record.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6802223\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/191/395/#p401\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6802223\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/191/395/#p401\">\n    at 402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Based upon the finding of ineffective assistance of counsel on the face of the record, the court reversed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6802223\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/191/395/#p401\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6802223\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/191/395/#p401\">\n    at 404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The question presented in this case is nearly identical to that answered in\n   <em>\n    Monroe\n   </em>\n   . In both cases, the State failed to prove each element of the crime, but the defendant did not preserve the issue by moving for a judgment of acquittal. Further, in both, the State presented sufficient evidence to establish a lesser included offense thereby precluding fundamental error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Based on\n   <em>\n    Monroe\n   </em>\n   , I agree that we must reverse the Defendant's conviction for ineffective assistance of counsel on the face of the record. The circumstances are too similar. But absent the controlling opinion from the supreme court, I would question our authority to do so. The legislature limited direct appeal of a criminal judgment to preserved issues and fundamental error. Notwithstanding the statutory limits, claims of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal are now commonly asserted. As Judge Winokur concluded, \"the practice of permitting claims of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal stemmed from a misreading of case law, and is directly contrary to controlling statutory law.\"\n   <em>\n    Latson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6795444\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/193/1070/#p1071\">\n    193 So.3d at 1074\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Allowing a defendant to assert claims of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal, absent fundamental error, allows the defendant to evade the strict requirements for fundamental error and \"deprives trial counsel of the opportunity to defend themselves against allegations of unprofessional conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6795444\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/193/1070/#p1071\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In the future, we should be careful to limit our review to that authorized by statute or, as here, mandated by supreme court precedent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    \u00a7\u00a7 394.451-.47892, Fla.
