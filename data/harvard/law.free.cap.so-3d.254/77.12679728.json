On the afternoon of April 7, 2013, Demetrius Lee returned home from work between 3:00 and 4:00 p.m. Lee resided in the DeLisle community at 7486 Lobouy Road, which is part of a larger property commonly known as \"the Hill.\" The Hill is comprised of two houses and a mobile home. While Lee was relaxing, someone knocked on his window, but he remained inside. Twenty to thirty minutes later, Lee went outside and saw Robert Trosclair, whom he knew from frequently being at the Hill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 3. Lee testified that Trosclair was running and looked like he had been in a fist fight, because he was shirtless and bloody. Trosclair had a busted lip, blood coming out of his nose, and blood on his chest. Ambrose, his brother Stevie Ambrose,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Orlander Dedeaux were following behind Trosclair, taking turns hitting him. Stevie handed Lee a cell phone and told him to record. Lee testified that he videoed anywhere from a mere second to two minutes of the assault. Trosclair was trying to get away and was not fighting back. Ambrose kept asking Trosclair, \"[W]here is my stuff, you got some explaining to do\" to which Trosclair responded, \"it was Terry.\" Ambrose, Stevie, and Dedeaux continued taking turns hitting, kicking, and knocking down Trosclair for thirty minutes to an hour.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 4. Sometime during the assault, Donna Sims arrived at the Hill to return a book bag to her grandson, who had been staying with his mother Crystal Jameson at the Hill. When Sims arrived, she saw someone lying on the ground. Although Sims knew Trosclair, she was unable to recognize him because his head was bloody and swollen. Sims saw Ambrose, Stevie, Lee, and Dedeaux standing around Trosclair. Sims, whose grandson is also Ambrose's nephew, had known Ambrose for years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 5. Sims told Ambrose and Stevie to stop assaulting Trosclair and leave him alone. Ambrose responded that Trosclair had \"stolen stuff out of his car.\" Sims grabbed, pushed, and pulled Ambrose and Stevie in an effort to stop them, but she was unsuccessful. Sims begged them to stop, but they continued hitting Trosclair. Lee also testified that Sims had yelled for them to stop assaulting Trosclair. Sims testified that Trosclair was not fighting back and was unable to stand up other than partially sitting up at one point. Sims testified that Lee was laughing and videoing the assault with a phone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 6. After the beating had subsided, Ambrose got into a white truck and told \"them\" to put Trosclair in the truck. Sims recognized the truck because it belonged to her daughter Crystal and her boyfriend Luke Turner, who is Ambrose's brother.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sims approached Ambrose while he was in the driver's seat of the truck. Sims spoke to Ambrose for about five minutes. Meanwhile, Sims testified that \"they\" had put Trosclair in the back of the truck because he could not get up from the ground. Sims testified that Lee helped load Trosclair into the back of the truck. Lee denied helping load Trosclair in the back of the truck at the Hill; rather, Lee testified that after the fighting had stopped, Trosclair attempted to roll in the back of the truck. Lee testified that someone then picked up his feet and pushed him in the back of the truck. Lee got into the passenger's seat of the truck and Ambrose drove away with Trosclair in the back of the truck. Lee was under the impression that Ambrose was going to take Trosclair home. Stevie got into his car with Dedeaux and they followed the truck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 7. Lee testified that, by the time Sims arrived at the Hill that afternoon, most of the assault had subsided. Lee testified that Sims was there about ten minutes before they left the scene; however, Sims testified that the incident at the Hill lasted thirty-five to forty-five minutes from the time she arrived at the Hill to the time they left the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    Events at Fire Tower Road\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 8. Upon leaving the Hill, Lee described Ambrose's demeanor as \"mad, real mad.\" Lee soon realized Ambrose was not taking Trosclair home, but he was too scared to say anything. Instead, they went to an address about five minutes away on Fire Tower Road where Jimmy Lawton lived. Lawton, also known as \"Turk,\" lived at 9042 Fire Tower Road at the end of a long dirt driveway. Ambrose drove the truck down the driveway and parked in front of a trailer next door to Lawton, where Lashonda Jacobs lived. Ambrose parked, got out of the truck, and went toward Lawton's house. Ambrose walked to Lawton and spoke to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 9. Meanwhile, Stevie got out of his car and pushed Trosclair out of the back of the truck. Lee testified that Trosclair and Stevie \"squared off\" as if to fight. Trosclair \"rushed\" Stevie, pushing him away, and ran away toward the main road in an effort to \"get away.\" Lee estimated that Trosclair made it about forty yards away. Lee testified that Ambrose ran after Trosclair and caught him. Ambrose grabbed Trosclair by the waistband of his shorts and said, \"you got some more explaining to do.\" Trosclair responded, \"man, I don't know what's going on. It wasn't me. It was Terry.\" Ambrose walked Trosclair back toward the truck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 10. Lee testified that the situation then \"turned up a level\" and \"got more heated.\" Trosclair ended up on the ground and Ambrose, Stevie, and Dedeaux began kicking\n   him. Other than initially rushing Stevie to get away, Trosclair did not fight back at all. During the assault, Lee grabbed Ambrose and said \"[w]e need to figure out who Terry is\" because Trosclair continued yelling the name \"Terry.\" Ambrose responded, \"there ain't no Terry.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 11. Lee testified that Stevie hit Trosclair in the head with a garden hose reel with \"full force\" as Trosclair was lying down on the ground. Lee testified that Ambrose retrieved a fully inflated car tire on a rim and hit Trosclair in the head with it as Trosclair was lying on the ground. Lee testified that Trosclair's head bounced off the ground when Ambrose hit him with the tire. After Trosclair was hit \"two to three\" times with the tire, Lee testified that Trosclair \"went to sleep\" and started \"making a snoring sound.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 12. Lawton, who witnessed portions of the assault in front of his house, also testified. That evening, Lawton recalled that Ambrose, whom he had known for about five years, arrived at his house. Lawton saw him getting out of the driver's side of the white truck. At the time, Ambrose regularly stayed at the trailer next door to Lawton's house and Ambrose would come to the house to get the trailer key. Lashonda Jacobs also lived at the trailer next door to Lawton's house. Lawton, assuming Ambrose was there to get the key, went outside under the carport to meet Ambrose with the key.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 13. While under the carport, Lawton saw Dedeaux and Trosclair sitting in the back of the truck with no commotion. As Ambrose reached the carport, Lawton saw Trosclair take off running up the driveway toward the main road. Lawton testified that Dedeaux and Stevie ran after Trosclair first. Lawton testified that when Trosclair had run about ten to twenty-five yards, Ambrose also ran after him. Stevie and Dedeaux caught Trosclair first and knocked him down. Ambrose made it to Trosclair soon thereafter. Lawton testified that Ambrose, Stevie, and Dedeaux started kicking and punching Trosclair. Lawton went inside for a moment to get his phone to call his next door neighbor Jacobs. Lawton then continued observing from his window.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 14. Lawton testified that Trosclair started stumbling back toward the trailer. Lawton testified that Trosclair would walk for a moment and then \"one of them would hit him and he would go a little more and then he fell again.\" Lawton testified that Trosclair was not fighting back. Lawton testified that Ambrose and Dedeaux hit Trosclair with the tire and the hose reel. Lawton testified that \"[t]hey picked up a tire and they picked up a [hose reel]. They struck him with it more than twice, I know that for sure.\" Lawton testified that he \"kn[e]w [Dedeaux] picked it up once. And [he was] sure the other one was [Ambrose].\" When asked if he was sure about which one hit him with which object, Lawton responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Not - I'm not really sure. I know one of them picked this one up, the other one picked that one up. I'm just saying it was, boom, and they pick something else up, hit him. And then the other one, Stevie, was right there with him. He picked it up and hit him hisself, you know. And [Lee], the one he was there taking pictures with the camera.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 15. On cross-examination, Lawton testified that Ambrose hit Trosclair with the hose reel and the tire. Lawton also testified that Stevie picked up the hose reel and hit Trosclair with it. Lawton testified that Trosclair was hit with the tire more than two times. Lawton testified that Trosclair was lying on his side when he was hit with the garden hose reel and the tire. After Trosclair was hit with these two objects, he rolled over. During the assault,\n   Lawton testified that he then went to the bathroom for fifteen or twenty minutes and came back to the window and saw the truck and car leaving the scene. After the two vehicles left, Lawton went outside and saw at least three areas of blood in the gravel driveway. Lawton also noticed that the hose reel and tire, which were used to strike Trosclair, were lying on the ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 16. Lee testified that after Trosclair had been knocked out in front of Lawton's house, Ambrose got into the truck. Stevie and Dedeaux tied Trosclair's hands and body with a yellow ratchet tow strap and put him in the back of the truck. When Trosclair was put in the back of the truck, his head was jerking back and forth.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lee testified that he got in the truck with Ambrose and they left Lawton's with Stevie and Dedeaux following in Stevie's car. Ambrose did not tell Lee where he was driving. Lee testified that Ambrose turned off \"some little entrance, and backed up. And then Stevie and Dedeaux pulled [Trosclair] out the truck.\" Stevie and Dedeaux dumped Trosclair on the side of the road and they left the scene. Lee testified that Trosclair was unable to move or talk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 17. Later that evening, Lawton testified that Ambrose came to his house with Jacobs. Lawton said that Ambrose apologized about what had happened in front of his house. Lawton said that Ambrose asked for a shovel, but Lawton told him he did not have one. The next day, Lawton went outside and noticed that the areas of blood were covered up. Lawton also noticed that the garden hose reel and tire had been moved and thrown in the bushes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    Discovery and Investigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 18. The same evening, Bradley Holmes was driving home on Cunningham Road in Pass Christian around 7:00 p.m. Holmes stopped his truck when he noticed what appeared to be a body lying on the side of the road. Holmes called 911, and when he was getting out of his truck, he realized it was an unconscious man, later identified as Trosclair, lying face down between the white line of the road and the roadside ditch. Holmes testified that Trosclair was making a gargling, snoring sound. Holmes testified Trosclair was partially clothed, with short pants and socks on. Holmes described that Trosclair was tied up with a yellow ratchet strap, which was tightly tied around his wrists and loosely tired around his back. Holmes described his head as \"very dirty, covered in dirt, black and blue, blood.\" Holmes said that Trosclair's ears had blood coming out of them. Holmes also observed stab wounds, cuts, and scrapes to Trosclair's body.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 19. Deputy Carl James of the Harrison County Sheriff's Department received a call at approximately 7:00 p.m. with regard to an assault victim who had been stabbed on Cunningham Road just west of Lobouy Road. Deputy James was the first officer to respond to the scene. Deputy James testified that Trosclair was wearing only a pair shorts and socks. Deputy James testified that Trosclair had bruising, blood, and abrasions on his face and his whole body. Deputy James observed blood on the middle of his torso, including three stab wounds to the lower back. Deputy James testified that Trosclair's hands and waist were tied with a ratchet tow strap. Deputy James tried to communicate with Trosclair, but he was unresponsive. Trosclair's breathing was shallow and labored with a gurgling sound resembling a snore.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 20. Trosclair was flown by helicopter to the University of South Alabama Medical Center, where he arrived intubated because he was unable to breathe on his\n   own and had signs of head injuries. Trosclair was unresponsive, and the treating physician determined that Trosclair had undergone some brain injury and diagnosed him with a global severe cerebral edema. Because of the swelling of Trosclair's brain, it had shifted four millimeters to the left. Trosclair also was diagnosed with a jaw fracture, nasal bone fracture, and superficial lacerations on his flank, meaning that they did not enter where his organs were. The treating physician testified that the lacerations were not life threatening in and of themselves. After performing tests to determine brain activity over the next two days, the treating physician determined that Trosclair was clinically brain dead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 21. On April 9, 2013, Trosclair's mother Vena Trosclair went to the police station to report her son missing because he had not been home and was not returning her calls. Law enforcement officials advised Vena that an unidentified male matching her son's description was at the University of South Alabama Medical Center. Vena went to the hospital and identified Trosclair, who was comatose and on life support. Trosclair never regained consciousness and died after he was removed from life support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 22. On April 11, 2013, forensic pathologist Dr. Frank Krolikowski performed an autopsy of Trosclair. Dr. Krolikowski found Trosclair had suffered from three stab wounds to his side, substantial amounts of head trauma, multiple hemorrhages within his head, strangulation, and superficial abrasions in a number of different parts of his body. Dr. Krolikowski testified that the hemorrhages within Trosclair's head could be consistent with multiple strikes to the head. Dr. Krolikowski opined that all of Trosclair's various traumas were cumulative and contributed to his demise. Dr. Krolikowski concluded that Trosclair's cause of death was \"multiple blunt trauma, multiple stab wounds, and asphyxia by strangulation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 23. During law enforcement's investigation, Ambrose and Stevie were developed as suspects and an arrest warrant for aggravated assault was issued because Trosclair was still alive at the time, albeit in a coma. The charges were later upgraded after Trosclair died of his injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 24. At the Hill, investigators discovered the white truck that had been driven by Ambrose. Investigators observed a red substance appearing to be blood inside the truck's tailgate. Investigators discovered a leather belt and blue, torn up, tank top shirt inside a trash can outside the mobile home. Investigators discovered blood stained gravel in the center of the driveway in front of Lawton's home. Investigators also discovered the blood stained tire and garden hose reel in a wooded area about twenty-five yards from Lawton's home near the driveway where blood was found.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 25. At trial, the State introduced evidence showing that Trosclair's DNA matched a reddish brown stain sample collected from the interior of the truck bed near the tailgate. Trosclair's DNA matched a reddish brown stain sample consistent with the appearance of blood collected from the garden hose reel. Trosclair's DNA matched a reddish brown sample from the tire rim. Trosclair's DNA matched samples from reddish brown stained rocks found in the middle of the driveway near Lawton's home. Trosclair's DNA also matched samples taken from the blue tank top found in a trash can at Lobouy Road and the ratchet tow strap. Although DNA testing performed on the belt showed a mixed profile from more than one person, Trosclair could not be excluded as being a contributor to the mixture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    Ambrose's Version of Events\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 26. Ambrose took the stand in his defense. At the time, Ambrose had been driving the white truck that he had borrowed from Jameson because his car was broken down and parked in front of his mother's trailer at the Hill. On the morning of April 7, 2013, Ambrose received a call from Jameson, who is Sims's daughter. Ambrose learned that his car had been broken into. Ambrose went to the Hill to return the truck to Jameson and to assess the damage to his car. Ambrose arrived and saw that his car's window had been broken out with a brick and the trunk had been opened. When Ambrose opened the driver's side of his car, he discovered that his prescription pills for a back injury that had occurred at work had been taken. Ambrose also discovered that other drugs, a speaker, and an amplifier had been taken from the trunk of the car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 27. Ambrose became upset and decided to drive around the DeLisle community and ask if anyone had seen someone trying to sell a speaker and amp so he could determine who had broken into his car. Ambrose picked up Dedeaux from his house, and they drove around the community looking for the stolen items. While they were driving around, Stevie called. Ambrose learned that Trosclair was at the Hill. Ambrose had known Trosclair for more than a decade, and they had grown up together. Ambrose described Trosclair as his \"brother, best friend.\" Ambrose and Trosclair were not actually related; on cross-examination, Ambrose clarified that Trosclair was his friend. Ambrose also confirmed that he, his brother Stevie, Dedeaux, Lee, and Trosclair all were friends.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 28. When Ambrose returned to the Hill, Ambrose approached Trosclair and asked him about a dog house that Ambrose had asked Trosclair to build. Earlier that day, Trosclair claimed he could not build it because he was on his way to the hospital due to third degree burns he had suffered from working on a car radiator. Because Ambrose saw that Trosclair did not have burns on his body, Ambrose confronted him about the stolen items.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 29. Trosclair then admitted to breaking into Ambrose's vehicle, but claimed he did not break out the window. Ambrose became angry when Trosclair admitted to breaking into his car. Trosclair claimed that an individual named Terry had broken out the window. Ambrose did not know an individual named Terry and the argument became heated. Ambrose and Trosclair \"squared off\" and fought for \"four to five minutes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 30. During the fight, Ambrose ripped off Trosclair's blue tank top. Ambrose punched Trosclair about five or six times. Trosclair fought back and struck Ambrose with a few blows. The only other individuals present at the time were Stevie and Dedeaux. Later, Lee came outside and \"blindsided\" Trosclair, hitting him from behind and knocking him down. Ambrose told Lee that he did not need any help. Trosclair got up and he and Ambrose continued to fight. Ambrose testified that Dedeaux was \"actually the one with the phone [videoing].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 31. The fight subsided and Ambrose told Trosclair to take him to Terry. Ambrose testified that Trosclair was \"pretty beat up.\" Ambrose went toward the truck so they could go to Terry's house. Ambrose claimed that Sims pulled up as they were on their way to the truck. Ambrose denied that Sims had pleaded for him to stop beating Trosclair because the fight already had ended. Ambrose told \"them to get on back of the truck and take me to whoever this guy named Terry is house [sic].\" Ambrose testified that Trosclair got in the back of the truck so they could get his belongings back. Ambrose testified that\n   he did not force Trosclair into the truck and Trosclair willingly got in the truck. Ambrose told Trosclair that once he received his speakers, he \"wasn't going to mess with him anymore.\" Stevie followed Ambrose to \"go get the stuff.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 32. Instead of going to where Terry supposedly lived, as Ambrose originally had planned, he remembered that he had purchased four tires from Lawton for his other vehicle, which had a flat tire. Even though Ambrose was angry about his belongings being stolen, he decided to take a detour to Lawton's. Ambrose drove to Lawton's house, which was \"right around the corner.\" Ambrose pulled up and Lawton had the trailer keys in his hand, but Ambrose advised Lawton that he was there just to get the tires.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 33. While Ambrose and Lawton were talking, \"a commotion ... was going on by the trailer a few feet away, and [Ambrose] saw people running.\" Ambrose testified: \"I didn't really know what the commotion was about, but when I saw people running, I instantly just ran. I took off. I did. I took off to see what the commotion was about.\" Ambrose saw Lee, Dedeaux, and Stevie striking Trosclair. Ambrose caught up with them and began striking Trosclair too. Ambrose admitted that all of them were beating Trosclair after they chased him down. Ambrose also admitted that \"this whole thing [was] about [Ambrose] being mad at [Trosclair] because [Ambrose] believe[ed] he [had] broke[en] into [his] car.\" Ambrose admitted that was the reason everyone was beating him at the time. Ambrose testified the beating lasted two minutes until Ambrose learned that Terry was not involved and Stevie actually had broken into his car. Ambrose then fought Stevie for about three minutes. When Ambrose and Stevie started fighting, Ambrose testified that Trosclair was injured but got up and walked back toward Lawton's house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 34. When Ambrose was finished fighting with Stevie, he saw Dedeaux strike Trosclair in the head with the tire. After Dedeaux struck Trosclair with the tire, Trosclair just \"laid there\" and did not get up. Ambrose testified that he was hurt by Stevie and just wanted to get away. Ambrose left the scene alone in Stevie's car because it was the closest vehicle to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 35. Later that evening, Ambrose returned to Lawton's house with Jacobs. Ambrose apologized to Lawton about the fight that had occurred earlier that day. Ambrose testified that he and Lawton spoke for about three minutes and he left. Ambrose denied asking Lawton for a shovel. Ambrose denied intentionally killing Trosclair or making him go anywhere against his will. Ambrose denied stabbing, strangling, or choking Trosclair. Ambrose denied striking Trosclair with the tire or hose reel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 36. Ambrose's defense theory presented at trial was that he was criminally responsible as an accomplice to the events in question or, at most, guilty of a lesser homicide than capital murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    The Verdict\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 37. Following the culpability phase of trial, the jury returned a verdict finding Ambrose guilty of capital murder. After an approximately one hour cooling off period, the penalty phase of the trial commenced. The State reintroduced and incorporated by reference all testimony, evidence, and exhibits contained in the culpability phase of trial and rested.

Ambrose argues that the trial court unconstitutionally and prejudicially prevented him from confronting and impeaching Lee with evidence highly probative of Lee's bias in favor of testifying in the manner desired by the State. Ambrose argues that Lee, an uncharged coparticipant in the events leading to Trosclair's death, was the most crucial witness to the State's theory presented at trial. Ambrose argues that at the time Lee made his bargain with the State to be a witness rather than a defendant, the jury did not additionally learn that Lee also needed the State to refrain from seeking revocation of probation for a nonadjudicated sentence for burglary that he was serving at the time. Ambrose also argues that Lee faced a similar risk of prosecution for an unrelated armed robbery for which he had been arrested while he was being questioned as a suspect in the present matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

On June 5, 2015, the State filed a motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   to prohibit Ambrose from cross-examining Lee about his prior nonadjudicated burglary and armed robbery arrest. The State asserted that on August 16, 2010, Lee had pleaded guilty to burglary and was sentenced to five years of nonadjudicated probation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Also, on April 10, 2013, Lee was arrested for armed robbery, which ultimately was no true billed by a grand jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b6 43. On June 11, 2015, prior to trial, the trial court held a hearing on the State's motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   . The State argued that the prior nonadjudication and armed robbery arrest were inadmissible under Mississippi Rule of Evidence 609 because neither was a felony conviction. The State represented that, at the time of the hearing, Lee still was on nonadjudicated probation. Ambrose responded that because the grand jury returned a no true bill for Lee's armed robbery arrest, he sought to introduce the evidence as evidence of bias under Mississippi Rule of Evidence 616.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b6 44. According to Ambrose, a probation revocation had been filed in the burglary matter and was heard six to ten months later. The record is silent as to the basis of the filed revocation or its disposition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ambrose claimed that at the time Lee was interviewed by investigators, he was facing twenty-five years for the burglary nonadjudication.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ambrose argued that Lee was not charged with capital murder, not charged with armed robbery, and did not have his probation revoked even though evidence existed that he had violated \"a couple of terms of his probation.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court granted the State's motion based on Mississippi Rule of Evidence 609.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b6 45. At trial, Ambrose cross-examined Lee. Lee admitted giving two different stories to investigators on April 10, 2013, about the events leading to Trosclair's death. Hours after giving the first version, Lee testified that investigators had asked whether he wanted to be a capital murder defendant or a witness. Lee testified that he chose to be a witness rather than a defendant and cooperated with investigators. The trial court then granted Ambrose's request to make a proffer outside the presence of the jury and allowed cross-examination with regard to Lee's criminal past.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b6 46. The testimony offered during the proffer showed that, at the time of Trosclair's murder on April 7, 2013, Lee was serving nonadjudicated probation for burglary of a dwelling. Lee acknowledged that he initially was concerned about his probation status while being questioned by investigators about the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   . After Lee gave his first statement, an investigator asked Lee about an unrelated, January 27, 2013, armed robbery for which he had been identified as a suspect. Lee testified that he was not worried about his probation being revoked as a result of being a suspect in the armed robbery because he was innocent of the armed robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b6 47. Following the proffer, the trial court entertained arguments from counsel. According to Ambrose, Lee had been arrested for the unrelated armed robbery in April 2013\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   and had remained in jail for\n   eight months until January 2014 when the grand jury returned a no true bill on the charge. Ambrose urged that Lee's criminal past was admissible as evidence of bias under Rule 616. The trial court retained its prior ruling and also found that Lee's testimony Ambrose sought to elicit had no relevance to the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   . The trial court refused to \"allow questioning about a situation where [Lee] could have been revoked on a prior [nonadjudication] by an arrest which was presented to the [g]rand [j]ury and no true billed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b6 48. On appeal, Ambrose acknowledges that the trial court properly recognized that Rule 609 restricts impeachment of a witness's character for truthfulness with prior criminal conduct to only conduct that has resulted in a conviction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R.E. 609. However, Ambrose argues that the trial court failed to recognize that Lee's prior criminal conduct went not merely to his general credibility, but to a specific factual basis for his being biased in favor of the State or having an interest in receiving a benefit or forestalling harm from prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b6 49. Ambrose argues that the trial court erred by excluding testimony that Lee faced unresolved criminal charges, over which the prosecutor retained the power to exercise favorable or unfavorable discretion. Ambrose argues that the trial court's error clearly was prejudicial because Lee's testimony was key to implicating Ambrose for kidnapping and designating him as the lead participant in the blows with the tire that resulted in Trosclair's fatal brain injuries. In response to Ambrose's claim of prejudice, the State argues that the jury heard evidence of Lee's motive and bias to testify as a witness rather than as a defendant charged with capital murder for his involvement in the events leading to Trosclair's death. The State argues that any bias stemming from the deal was fully explored by defense counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Smart and Hughes were brother and sister, and may have colluded. Smart was charged with the same crime as Hall. Both Smart and Hughes had criminal charges pending against them at the time of the trial.

However,\n   <em>\n    Suan\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    McFarland\n   </em>\n   lend support to Ambrose's position because Lee may have been subject to probation revocation proceedings for a number of reasons, not just his armed robbery arrest, as presumed by the trial court. Although the jury heard that Lee chose to be a witness rather than a defendant in the present case, Ambrose's chief argument is that it did not hear that Lee also had an\n   <em>\n    additional\n   </em>\n   reason to be a witness,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the possibility of probation revocation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \u00b6 65. Aside from the obvious distinction that the evidentiary statute controlled in\n   <em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   , the State argues that\n   <em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   may be distinguished because Lee had no charges pending at the time of Ambrose's trial. The State argues that the jury could not have inferred that Lee was given leniency in exchange for testimony because the State sought revocation and presented the armed robbery case to the grand jury. The State argues that the charges were \"fully resolved by the time Lee testified at Ambrose's trial.\" As suggested by Ambrose, certain terms of his revocation may have included his arrest or involvement in the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   or his association with alleged convicted felon Dedeaux. At the time he was interviewed by investigators, Lee certainly was subject to prosecution. Moreover, the record shows that Lee continued to be subject to prosecution through trial. The State admitted that Lee was \"still on non-adjudicated probation\" at the motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   hearing on June 11, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   \u00b6 66.

Here the defense sought to show that Eddie Grammer had been involved in criminal activity but had not been prosecuted. The point was that Grammer's neck was on the line if he did not testify in a manner pleasing to the prosecution. This Suan was entitled to show-or at least to attempt to show. The Circuit Court erred when it refused to allow such cross-examination. Because Grammer was the principal witness for the State, and because so much of the prosecution's case turned upon his credibility, the error is of reversible proportions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <em>\n    Suan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7550769\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/511/144/#p147\">\n    511 So.2d at 148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \u00b6 67. In the same way, Lee's neck was on the line at the time he was interviewed by police and through trial. Although Lee's testimony was not necessary to finding Ambrose guilty of capital murder beyond a reasonable doubt, as further explained below, we hold that, under the heightened scrutiny standard of review, the trial court erred by excluding the evidence. By limiting Ambrose's cross examination of Lee, the trial court denied Ambrose the opportunity to fully challenge Lee's credibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   \u00b6 68. Alternatively, the State argues that, even if the evidence was admissible under Rule 616, it was properly excluded under Rules 611(a) and 403. While the State may be correct that the evidence may have been properly excluded under Rule 403, the trial court did base its decision\n   to exclude the evidence on Rule 403. Here, the trial court erroneously concluded that the evidence of bias was not relevant, as we have held that similar testimony is probative of the witness's interest or bias.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anthony\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7003597,7003557\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/108/394/\">\n    108 So.3d at 397-98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6\u00b6 5-7) ;\n   <em>\n    McFarland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11853055\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/707/166/#p176\">\n    707 So.2d at 176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6\u00b6 32-34) ;\n   <em>\n    Suan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7550769\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/511/144/#p147\">\n    511 So.2d at 147-48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. 1987) ;\n   <em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7598986\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/476/26/#p27\">\n    476 So.2d at 27-28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Ambrose admitted to fighting Trosclair at the Hill, driving him to Lawton's house, chasing down Trosclair, and beating Trosclair again. At the Hill, Sims testified that she saw Ambrose beating Trosclair, who was not fighting back. Sims testified that she begged Ambrose to stop beating Trosclair, but he refused. Sims also testified that Ambrose instructed Stevie, Dedeaux, and Lee to put Trosclair in the truck before they left. Sims testified that they complied with Ambrose's instructions.

But what of Subsection (d)'s contemplation of lethal force? The two surely are not synonymous, although \"contemplate\" is one synonym for intend.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Roget's\n   <em>\n    International Thesaurus\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 653.7 (4th ed. 1977).

In this sense, Subsection (c)'s \"intended that a killing take place\" is surplusage and may with profit be set aside. But the converse is not necessarily so. One may contemplate lethal force while stopping short of a definite plan or design to kill. In a sense, Subsection (d) describes a contingent intent. Where, as a part of pre-crime planning, a defendant includes in his plans the substantial probability that fatal force will be employed, Subsection (d) is satisfied.

Eleven potential jurors answered in the affirmative, including Garner. The entire exchange between Garner and the trial court is set out below:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-164\">\n   THE COURT: Mr. Garner?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-165\">\n   MR.

Garner was accepted by Ambrose without a challenge for cause or exercising a peremptory strike and was seated on the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   \u00b6 99. Ambrose argues that Garner's response to the question asking whether he would maybe lean toward the law enforcement side of the case was an admission that he was biased. Ambrose relies on\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

App. 2014), in support of his argument. Ambrose's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   is misplaced for two reasons. First, the bias was unequivocal because the juror stated \"it would be hard to be impartial.\"\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6874852\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/164/1046/\">\n    164 So.3d at 1048\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6\u00b6 3-4). Second, the issue was addressed within the context of a claim for constitutional ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to challenge the allegedly biased juror.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6874852\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/164/1046/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6874852\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/164/1046/\">\n    at 1051\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   \u00b6 100.

Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3496579\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/688/494/#p500\">\n    688 F.3d 494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 500-01 (8th Cir. 2012), the Court was faced with the issue of whether \"whether the empaneling of Juror S.R., who admitted there 'might be a possibility' she would find law enforcement officers more credible than other witnesses, violated Johnson's Sixth Amendment right to be tried by an impartial jury[.]\" The Court of Appeals declined to employ plain error review on appeal when reviewing a scenario in which the defendant failed to object to the seating of a juror during voir dire when the basis for the objection was then known.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3496579\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/688/494/#p500\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3496579\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/688/494/#p500\">\n    at 500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court of Appeals wrote that the \"failure to object at the time the jury is empaneled operates as a conclusive waiver if the basis of the objection is known or might have been known or discovered through the exercise of reasonable\n   diligence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3496579\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/688/494/#p500\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3496579\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/688/494/#p500\">\n    at 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The reasoning for the rule is simple: \"if a defendant is allowed to forego challenges for-cause to a biased juror and then allowed to have the conviction reversed on appeal because of that juror's service, that would be equivalent to allowing the defendant to plant an error and grow a risk-free trial.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3496579\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/688/494/#p500\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3496579\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/688/494/#p500\">\n    at 501-02\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   \u00b6 105. Here, on appeal, Ambrose argues that Garner was biased based solely on his response when asked if his relationship with his policeman son would cause him to \"maybe lean toward the law enforcement side of this case.\" Undoubtedly, the basis for the objection that Ambrose now advances was known during voir dire. We follow the guidance of the Court of Appeals in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   and decline to employ plain error review. Ambrose waived his right to challenge the seating of allegedly biased Juror Garner by not challenging him during voir dire, because the basis for the objection was then known.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3496579\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/688/494/#p500\">\n    688 F.3d at 500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that by failing to object to the seating of the allegedly biased juror during voir dire, the defendant intentionally relinquished or abandoned a known right).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   \u00b6 106. As to the merits, the State argues that it is \"painfully obvious\" that Garner's substantive answer to the question of whether his relationship would cause him to lean toward the law enforcement side of the case was \"no\" even though he led in with \"yes, sir.\" The State also argues that the trial court's followup statement, \"Not his work, okay. Good. Thank you[,]\" confirms that the trial court understood Garner to be answering the question in the negative. Furthermore, the State points out how Garner responded to the trial court's follow up statement with \"Yes, sir,\" which was not an actual response to a question. The State argues that the record demonstrates that neither the trial court nor Ambrose perceived Garner's response as demonstrating bias. The State's interpretation of the record is persuasive, and thus, we cannot say that evidence of bias is plain and obvious, based on a reading of the entire exchange in context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Juror Jeffrey Jenkins\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   \u00b6 107. Ambrose argues that the trial court reversibly erred at the conclusion of the penalty phase evidence when it removed Juror Jeffrey Jenkins, who asserted his lack of bias, and then compounded the error by replacing him with an alternate rather than granting a mistrial. During jury selection, Jenkins responded that he knew Ambrose's uncle, Mark Turner. The exchange was as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-187\">\n   MR. JENKINS: Yes, sir. In reference, when she was mentioning Mark Turner, I also know him by Pastor Turner, but I know him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-188\">\n   THE COURT: I see. Okay, would the fact that your pastor is going to testify in this case cause you to automatically lean toward the side that he testifies for?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-189\">\n   MR. JENKINS: He is not my pastor, your Honor. No, sir. His nephew and me were real good friends when we were young.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-190\">\n   THE COURT: Okay. Would that have any effect on you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-191\">\n   MR. JENKINS: No, sir. When she mentioned that I was like that is the same pastor. I just want to be truthful. That's all.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   \u00b6 108. Jenkins ultimately was seated on the jury without a challenge for cause lodged by the State or Ambrose. Jenkins remained on the jury through the culpability phase of trial, returned a guilty verdict, and heard the testimony presented during the penalty phase. During the penalty\n   phase, Ambrose called several family members and friends to testify on his behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   \u00b6 109. During a recess following the conclusion of the mitigation witnesses' testimony, but before the jury was instructed, a juror submitted a note disclosing his personal relationship with Ambrose's family. The note read: \"I cannot sit on the penalty phase of the trial due to my personal relationship with the defendant's family. Jeffrey Jenkins.\" Ambrose suggested to the trial court that counsel \"should voir dire him, find out what his relationship is, and it may be that it doesn't amount to anything.\" Then Ambrose moved for a mistrial on the basis that the juror had misinformed the trial court and he should not have been on the jury at all. The trial court brought in Jenkins and allowed voir dire. Jenkins gave the following testimony:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-194\">\n   Q. Mr. Jenkins, you sent out a note stating that you could not sit in on the punishment phase of this trial because you're related to someone. Is that true?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-195\">\n   A. No, my personal relationship is with the defendant's father's side of the family.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-196\">\n   Q. Personal relationship with the defendant's father's side of the family?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-197\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-198\">\n   Q. Are you talking about Willie Dedeaux or Mark Turner?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-199\">\n   A. Mark Turner.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-200\">\n   Q. Okay. Do you know the defendant?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-201\">\n   A. After the testimony, I knew him when he was a young child. Because when I first were in the Jury pool when you asked did anybody know Mark Jackson-not Mark Jackson, Mark Turner, I raised my hand, said I knew him as Pastor Turner. I'm good friends with his nephew. So I didn't realize until the penalty phase when they came up and mentioned Luke Turner I realized at that time that at the time when his father was killed I was staying -- I was still good friends with his cousins Sam and Jonathan. And I remember Rahim as a young child when he came through. I say he was around two or three, you know, so many years ago, he would come by and visit his grandmother.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-202\">\n   Q. So at the time that we were doing the voir dire when you were sitting out front and we were picking Jurors -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-203\">\n   A. Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-204\">\n   Q. -- you didn't realize that you were related to Rahim in some way?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-205\">\n   A. I'm not related to him. I didn't realize who Rahim's father was. Rahim's father's last name is Turner. When you asked did I know Mark Turner, I raised my hand, said yes, I do know Mark Turner. But I didn't realize until we came up to the penalty phase and they mentioned that his father was Luke Turner, at that time I'm like, I know Luke. And when Mark came up and I realized that they were brothers, because at the time when you was asking the jury pool, you never asked was Mark and Luke brothers. If you would have said that, I would have said yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-206\">\n   Q. You knew Luke Turner, Junior?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-207\">\n   A. I knew Luke, too.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-208\">\n   Q. How old are you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-209\">\n   A. I'm 44.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-210\">\n   Q. Okay. Well, you were very young when you knew Luke Turner, senior, weren't you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-211\">\n   A. I was very young. But as I stated, I was good friends with his -- which is\n   the defendant's cousin, would be with Jonathan, Rahim and Sam Turner. And I'm still good friends with them today. But I was very young, yes, but I happened to be, if he was two, I happened to be twelve at that time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-212\">\n   Q. Well, do you think you can't be fair and impartial in this?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-213\">\n   A. In the penalty phase?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-214\">\n   Q. Yeah -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-215\">\n   A. I don't feel comfortable. I can be fair and impartial, as I stated. I still stand by my original verdict. But as far as what the penalty phase, I just wanted to make it be known and be truthful that I knew the family. And, you know, I have been with my Jurors for the last three or four days, and I just wanted to be truthful to the court to say, hey, I know Mark Turner. I knew the defendant as he came along. But, your Honor, I didn't want to be, like, I was hiding some type of secret, because I don't feel comfortable sitting in there, and I got this background, unfair background to say I know this man. So I just wanted to be honest. As I stated, when I did in the beginning, I just wanted to be honest, say, hey, I know him. I don't want it to come back either way, because if I didn't make this be known, you know, to me it gives the defendant an unfair advantage because I got a personal relationship with Mark, Ms. Bernice, Jonathan, Sam, Sherrell. I know the whole family. Like I said, your Honor, we stay -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-216\">\n   Q. You didn't recognize the name Rahim?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-217\">\n   A. No. I knew a lot of -- I know a lot of different people with\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-218\">\n   Q. Ambrose?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-219\">\n   A. No, I don't know Ambrose. Like I said, I know a lot of different people with Masonic names, because his cousin Wajida, they got Masonic names. I didn't recognize Rahim. I haven't seen him since he was two.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-220\">\n   Q. Well, you don't think you could be fair and impartial in deciding what his punishment should be?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-221\">\n   A. I mean, yeah, I can be fair and impartial. But as my note said, I didn't feel comfortable going into that situation without advising the court and the judge and things like that. I didn't feel comfortable to go in that situation with my jurors to keep this secret that I knew the defendant, and I knew Mark. I mean, you can ask me history about the family, I know it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-222\">\n   Q. Have you discussed this with any jurors?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-223\">\n   A. No. So none of the other Jurors know about this?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-224\">\n   A. I mean, I discussed with them that I was coming out because of my personal relationship. And I told the foreman that I need to write a note advising the jury that I know the defendant. I don't know the defendant, but I know the defendant's immediate family.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-225\">\n   Q. So you told the other jury members about that, at least some of them?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-226\">\n   A. Yeah. I wrote the note. They knew why I was coming out, yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-227\">\n   Q. You say they, who are you talking about?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-228\">\n   A. I mean, we were all in the room. They knew the reason why I was stepping out because I wrote the note.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-229\">\n   Q. The other thirteen people in there know why you're in here now?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-230\">\n   A. Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   \u00b6 110. The trial court then heard arguments for and against the grant of a mistrial. Ambrose's counsel spoke to the concern about Jenkins's possible influence on the other jurors and what Jenkins may have told the other jurors about Ambrose's family. The trial court asked what prejudice Ambrose would suffer if the juror was removed. Ambrose's counsel responded that \"We don't know. We don't have any firm information one way or the other regarding this man. Quite frankly, part of our team thinks he is a positive influence. And others are uncertain, and you know it's one of those deals.\" The trial court denied the motion for a mistrial and then heard from counsel whether Jenkins should be removed and replaced with an alternate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   \u00b6 111. The State argued that Jenkins should be removed because he had indicated that his personal relationship with Ambrose's family would give Ambrose an unfair advantage. Ambrose's counsel responded, \"I can't deny what he said, your Honor. He did, in fact, say that. I would like to see him stay on the jury.\" The trial court determined that, based on the note and Jenkins's testimony that continuing to serve would be an unfair advantage to Ambrose, Jenkins should be removed from the jury. Jenkins was removed and replaced with the first alternate Juror Glen Turner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   \u00b6 112. The standard of review for the denial of a mistrial is abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Hutto v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12383183\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/227/963/#p984\">\n    227 So.3d 963\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 984 (\u00b6 66) (Miss. 2017). \"A trial judge need declare a mistrial only when there is an error in the proceedings resulting in substantial and irreparable prejudice to the defendant's case.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12383183\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/227/963/#p984\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ambrose argues that the Court should employ a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   standard of review because the denial of the mistrial violated the Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   \u00b6 113. This Court disagrees with Ambrose's proposed standard of review because neither case cited by Ambrose employs a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   standard of review to the present scenario. As discussed more fully below, the Court addressed a nearly identical issue recently and held that the trial court's decision to dismiss a juror for good cause and substitute an alternate is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Evans\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12366118\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/226/1/#p39\">\n    226 So.3d at 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 55). Moreover, the Court held that a defendant must show actual prejudice from the exclusion and substitution.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12366118\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/226/1/#p39\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, we review the trial court's decision for an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   \u00b6 114. Ambrose abandons the exact grounds for a mistrial he initially made to the trial court,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Jenkins may have improperly influenced the jury. To the extent that Ambrose reurges the argument, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for the mistrial based on Jenkins's testimony and as evidenced by Ambrose's counsel's uncertain response to the trial court's inquiry as to what prejudice Ambrose would suffer if Jenkins was removed from the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   \u00b6 115. In Ambrose's motion for a new trial or, alternatively, for acquittal notwithstanding the verdict, Ambrose argued that the trial court had erred by removing Jenkins and replacing him with the first alternate juror in violation of Mississippi Code Section 13-5-67. On appeal, Ambrose advances the same argument he advanced in his post trial motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   \u00b6 116. Section 13-5-67 provides, in relevant part: \"An alternate juror who does not replace a regular juror shall be discharged at the time the jury retires to consider its verdict.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2013-5-67\">\n    Miss.

Ambrose argues that once deliberations have commenced, no replacement of a juror with an alternate is permitted. In support, Ambrose relies on\n   <em>\n    Balfour v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7502985,7502799\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/598/731/\">\n    598 So.2d 731\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 754 (Miss. 1992) (holding that it was error for the trial court to excuse a juror after the jury had retired to deliberate a sentencing verdict), and\n   <em>\n    Folk v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7535524\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/576/1243/#p1251\">\n    576 So.2d 1243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1251-52 (Miss. 1991) (holding the trial court erred by substituting an alternate juror after the alternate juror had been dismissed from jury service and after the jury had been in deliberations for almost two hours).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   \u00b6 117. Ambrose contends that, for purposes of a death penalty case governed by Mississippi Code Section 99-19-101(1), the discharge of alternates occurs when the jury retires to deliberate guilt during the culpability phase.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   \u00b6 118. Section 99-19-101(1) provides, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-240\">\n   (1) Upon conviction or adjudication of guilt of a defendant of capital murder or other capital offense, the court shall conduct a separate sentencing proceeding to determine whether the defendant should be sentenced to death, life imprisonment without eligibility for parole, or life imprisonment. The proceeding shall be conducted by the trial judge before the trial jury as soon as practicable. If, through impossibility or inability, the trial jury is unable to reconvene for a hearing on the issue of penalty, having determined the guilt of the accused, the trial judge may summon a jury to determine the issue of the imposition of the penalty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2099-19-101\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 99-19-101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Rev. 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   \u00b6 119. Ambrose argues that the statute mandates that the trial jury hears the sentencing phase, and if through impossibility or inability the trial jury is unable to reconvene, the only statutory solution available is to summon a jury to act. Ambrose argues that the Court narrowly construes the capital sentencing statutes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bell v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6875904\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/160/188/\">\n    160 So.3d 188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. 2015). Ambrose argues that a mistrial is the only option if a juror cannot continue serving once guilt deliberations commence, since a unanimous twelve person jury is required to return a valid verdict under Mississippi's Constitution, caselaw, and the Uniform Rules of County and Circuit Court Practice in effect at the time. Ambrose also argues that the failure to grant a mistrial violated his Fourteenth Amendment right due to \"state procedural shortcomings\" affecting his \"substantial and legitimate expectation[s].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   \u00b6 120. Alternatively, Ambrose argues that the trial court abused its discretion by removing and replacing Juror Jenkins because there was no evidence Jenkins was unable to continue to perform his duties for any reason, including bias. Ambrose argues that the record was \"devoid of evidence\" that Jenkins had \"lied under oath or withheld information\" and he had assured that he was capable of being a fair and impartial juror. Ambrose argues that the trial court has \"no license to remove jurors and replace them with alternates willy nilly.\" Jenkins was not removed \"willy nilly;\" rather, the note and Jenkins's own testimony provided good cause to remove him from the jury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shaw v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7542898\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/540/26/#p28\">\n    540 So.2d 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 28 (Miss. 1989) (holding that the dismissal of a juror for good\n   cause and his replacement with an alternate is within the sound discretion of the trial judge).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   \u00b6 121. The State argues that Ambrose is procedurally barred because an objection on one ground waives all other grounds on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rubenstein v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8460374\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/941/735/#p760\">\n    941 So.2d 735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 760 (\u00b6 87) (Miss. 2006) ). Although Ambrose did not raise the statutory argument at trial, he raised the argument in his post trial motion. \"On numerous occasions, th[e] Court, has held that an objection on one ground waives remaining grounds for purposes of appeal and that the failure to raise an issue in the trial court requires this Court to impose a procedural bar on appeal. Notwithstanding [an appellant's] failure to raise [a] specific ground before the trial court, th[e] Court may, alternatively, consider the merits of the argument.\"\n   <em>\n    Evans\n   </em>\n   , 725 So.2d at 638 (\u00b6 48).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   \u00b6 122. After Ambrose filed his initial brief, the Court handed down\n   <em>\n    Evans v.

As an alternate juror, Lind did not participate in deliberations with the twelve-member panel, which undoubtedly would have been improper.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Luster v.

In Ambrose's reply brief, he argues that\n   <em>\n    Evans\n   </em>\n   was wrongly decided and urges the Court to revisit the holding. We decline to disturb the holding. According to the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Evans\n   </em>\n   , the trial court did not violate Sections 99-19-101(1) and 13-5-67 by replacing Juror Jenkins with Alternate Juror Turner after the culpability phase had concluded, but before the penalty phase deliberations had begun. We follow the guidance of\n   <em>\n    Evans\n   </em>\n   and hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by removing Juror Jenkins and replacing him with Alternate Juror Turner, who had heard all of the evidence presented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   \u00b6 127. We likewise reject Ambrose's alternative argument that Jenkins's removal was improper because he had testified that he could remain fair and impartial. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by removing Juror Jenkins for good cause based on the note and Jenkins's testimony that in his own estimate, remaining on the jury would give Ambrose an \"unfair advantage,\" an admission also acknowledged by Ambrose's counsel at trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shaw\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7542898\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/540/26/#p28\">\n    540 So.2d at 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

I want you to assume that there's some evidence been presented and it's proven beyond a reasonable doubt in your mind that these facts exist, that the defendant killed someone, he intended to kill him, he didn't have any good cause to kill him, it wasn't in self-defense, he wasn't insane, there was nothing wrong with him, he just did it.

Forty-six members of the venire responded to the question in the affirmative. After recording the members of the venire who had responded affirmatively, Ambrose's counsel posed a follow-up question:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-264\">\n   Now, I asked you that question, and I, didn't mention anything about mitigating circumstances, did I? Mitigating circumstances are factors in the background, record and life of the defendant if he is found guilty of capital murder. Those things are admissible to tell the jury a little bit about the defendant, give you some idea of what kind of person he is, and to also let you understand that he is a human being and that what you're trying to do, what you're determining is whether this person is -- this human being is so much of an offense to the community of other human beings that we have to eliminate him, we have to get rid of him. Would you at least consider the mitigating circumstances? Those of you who would -- you don't care about mitigating circumstances, you don't care what kind of life he's had, what kind of problems he's had, what kind of things that have developed and molded him into the person that he is, you don't care\n   about any of that.

Of the forty-six potential jurors who had answered the first question affirmatively, nine answered the follow-up question affirmatively. Ambrose's counsel recorded the nine potential jurors' numbers. After a brief follow up, the trial court called for a recess to allow for individual voir dire. The potential jurors who indicated that they had conscientious scruples against the death penalty were identified and the following exchange occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-266\">\n   MR.

But when you say you have actually convicted this guy of capital murder, would you vote for the death penalty. So they are, in fact, automatically voting. If the guy is found guilty of capital murder, they're going to vote for the death penalty. That's as automatic as it gets.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-269\">\n   MR.

But in\n   <em>\n    Holliman\n   </em>\n   , this Court reversed because the prosecutor, over objection, repeatedly asked the jurors to imagine how they would feel if a loaded shotgun were pointed in their faces.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7022255\" index=\"291\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/79/496/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7022255\" index=\"291\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/79/496/\">\n    at 499-500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It is an improper influence to put the jury in a \"box\" by voir dire tactics which extract a promise, prior to trial, to ignore evidence favorable to the defendant. This promise or pledge prevents the jurors from considering all factors relative to the verdict. The jurors are then called upon during closing argument to fulfill that promise, and the effect-whether calculated or not-is to shame or coerce the jury into rejecting factors which would tend to mitigate against the death penalty. We charge the jury in a capital murder case to narrow and distinguish the cases deserving of the death penalty from those which do not warrant such an extreme punishment. This awesome responsibility demands the freedom and flexibility to consider all relevant factors. A verdict returned on the basis of anything less cannot stand.

Ambrose argues that the State did not offer any knife into evidence and did not adduce any testimony that Ambrose, Stevie, or Dedeaux stabbed Trosclair during the assault. Ambrose claims evidence of the stab wounds was proof of a crime distinct from that alleged in the indictment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Palmer v.

However, it was undisputed that Trosclair had suffered puncture wounds to his side. Moreover, the record does not suggest that another crime distinct from capital murder with the underlying felony\n   of kidnapping had occurred. Ambrose's issue with the evidence essentially is that no one admitted to stabbing Trosclair or witnessed Trosclair being stabbed during the events leading to Trosclair's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-431\">\n   \u00b6 195. A reasonable juror could conclude from the evidence that Trosclair was stabbed during the lengthy fatal beating that he endured. \"It is within the jury's province to draw reasonable inferences from facts based on experience and common sense.\"\n   <em>\n    Howell v.

At trial, Lee testified that, after the beating at Lawton's house, Trosclair was unresponsive and was dumped on the side of the road with his hands and waist tied with a ratchet tow strap. Holmes discovered Trosclair lying unconscious on the side of the road tied with the ratchet tow strap. Holmes immediately observed Trosclair's stab wounds. Holmes testified that when Trosclair was rolled over, he \"could see like the blood pouring out.\" A law enforcement official also observed the stab wounds upon his arrival. Trosclair's treating physician and the pathologist also confirmed the presence of puncture wounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-433\">\n   \u00b6 197. The admission of the evidence of Trosclair's stab wounds does not constitute plain error. The evidence was particularly relevant because Dr. Krolikowski opined that Trosclair's death was caused by \"multiple blunt trauma, multiple sharp wounds, and asphyxia by strangulation.\" Dr. Krolikowski opined that the causes of death worked in combination as an aggregate to cause Trosclair's death. Although the treating physician testified that the stab wounds were superficial and not life threatening in and of themselves, Dr. Krolikowski opined that the stab wounds contributed to Trosclair's death. Based on the evidence presented at trial, a reasonable juror could infer from the evidence that Trosclair was stabbed during the course of the beating and kidnapping.

On April 7, 2013, around 7:00 p.m., Holmes discovered Trosclair lying on the side of the road as he was traveling home and immediately called 911. Prior to trial, the trial court denied Ambrose's motion to suppress Holmes's 911 call. The trial court found that the 911 call was more probative than prejudicial to the issues and should be admitted into evidence under Mississippi Rule of Evidence 403. The trial court also found that Holmes's statements with regard to Trosclair's injuries qualified as a lay opinion under Rule 701 and as a present sense impression exception to hearsay under Rule 803(1). Over the defense's renewed objection, Holmes's 911 call was played for the jury at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-436\">\n   \u00b6 199. Ambrose argues that the evidence improperly bolstered Holmes's testimony when his credibility had not been attacked. Ambrose relies solely on\n   <em>\n    White v.

The State distinguishes\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   , in which the Court held that testimony was admitted improperly as a prior consistent statement under Mississippi Rule of Evidence 801(d)(1)(B) because the credibility of the declarant witness had not been attacked.\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7468646\" index=\"335\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/616/304/\">\n    616 So.2d at 308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The State correctly notes that the 911 call was not admitted as a prior consistent statement, so\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   is inapplicable. Finally,\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   does not pertain to the admission of a 911 call into evidence.

Ambrose also takes issue with Holmes's statements that Trosclair was \"internally bleeding,\" and that he had been \"tortured.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, the trial court found that Holmes's statements in regard to Trosclair's injuries qualified as a lay opinion under Mississippi Rule of Evidence 701. Ambrose does not cite any relevant authority that the trial court's finding was an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7000461\" index=\"338\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/121/808/#p871\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-438\">\n   \u00b6 201. Ambrose argues that the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule does not apply as the State had argued at the motion hearing that because Holmes was not a victim of the crime, his utterances did not fall under the exception. Although the State argued at trial that the excited utterance hearsay exception applied to the 911 call, the trial court actually found that the 911 call qualified as a present sense impression exception to the hearsay rule. As such, Ambrose's argument is misplaced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-439\">\n   \u00b6 202. Under Mississippi Rule of Evidence 803(1), a \"present sense impression\" is \"statement describing or explaining an event or condition made while the declarant was perceiving the event or condition or immediately thereafter.\"\n   <em>\n    Clark v.

Ambrose argues that the 911 call did nothing but add inflammatory emotion and improperly incite the jury. \"Under Rule 403, evidence which is deemed admissible may still be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of its resultant unfair prejudice.\"\n   <em>\n    Batiste\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7000461\" index=\"340\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/121/808/#p871\">\n    121 So.3d at 863\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 143). \" Rule 403 is an ultimate filter through which all otherwise admissible evidence must pass.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7000461\" index=\"341\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/121/808/#p871\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"The trial court has broad discretion under Rule 403.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7000461\" index=\"342\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/121/808/#p871\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-441\">\n   \u00b6 204. Here, the trial court found that the probative value of the 911 call was not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice under Rule 403. Holmes testified at trial as to his observations of Trosclair on the side of the road and was subject to cross examination with regard to his 911 call. The admission of the evidence did not constitute an abuse of discretion so as to be prejudicial to Ambrose.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Corrothers\n   </em>\n   , 148 So.3d at 310 (\u00b6 76).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-442\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Autopsy Evidence of the Presence of Cocaine in Trosclair's System\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-443\">\n   \u00b6 205. Prior to trial, the State filed a motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   to preclude Ambrose from mentioning that Trosclair's toxicology results from the autopsy showed that he had tested positive for benzoylecgonine, a cocaine metabolite. In support of the motion, the State argued that only a defense\n   of a self-defense would permit such evidence. The State also argued that there was uncertainty about whether Trosclair used drugs in general and what motivated the car break in. Ambrose opposed the motion, arguing that the preclusion would impede his right to present a defense because he had a right to show that Trosclair had a drug problem that motivated him to break into Ambrose's car. However, at the hearing, when asked what witness would testify in support of the theory, Ambrose's counsel stated that he did not know, but he suspected that one or several of the State's witnesses would testify as such. The trial court granted the motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   , but reserved to Ambrose the right to approach the bench and revisit the issue if one of the witnesses said something during the course of the trial that concerned him or if he wished to cross examine a witness in that regard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-444\">\n   \u00b6 206. On appeal, rather than arguing how the toxicology report was relevant, Ambrose relies on\n   <em>\n    Richardson v.

However,\n   <em>\n    Richardson\n   </em>\n   involved a defense of self-defense and did not involve a toxicology report of the victim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6923913\" index=\"345\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/147/838/#p841\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Even so, in the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   , the trial court granted the State's motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   because it found that Ambrose's reason for offering the results was based on \"pure speculation.\" Even though Ambrose had failed to demonstrate the relevance of the toxicology report at the motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   hearing, the trial court assured that Ambrose would have the opportunity to revisit the issue in the course of the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-445\">\n   \u00b6 207. Ambrose also claims that a decedent's contribution to his own demise is a statutory mitigating factor of which a capital defendant has a right to adduce evidence, and if he adduces such evidence, to rely upon in mitigation if he so desires.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"346\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2099-19-101\">\n    Miss.

Surely Ambrose is not suggesting that Trosclair participated in or consented to his own murder because he may have stolen speakers or drugs from Ambrose's car. We decline to hold that Trosclair participated in and consented to being killed because autopsy results revealed that he tested positive for cocaine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-446\">\n   \u00b6 208. Again, \"[t]he admissibility of evidence rests within the discretion of the trial court, and reversal is appropriate only when a trial court commits an abuse of discretion resulting in prejudice to the accused.\"\n   <em>\n    Ross v.

We cannot say the trial court abused its discretion in excluding the evidence, resulting in prejudice to the defense. The trial court found the basis on which Ambrose sought to offer the toxicology results was \"pure speculation\" and granted the State's motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   , while also reserving to Ambrose the right to revisit the issue in trial. Despite the trial court's ruling, Ambrose's theory that he sought to prove through the victim's toxicology results was indeed presented to the jury,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that Trosclair had broken into his car and that drugs had been taken. As such, even assuming the trial court abused\n   its discretion, Ambrose's claim that he was denied his right to present a defense on the issue simply is not supported by the record.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Newell v.

The State argues that Ambrose fails to explain how his indictment was insufficient so as to prevent him from pleading double jeopardy if the State sought to prosecute him in the future for the same crime.

Ambrose argues that the jurors were insufficiently instructed on mitigation or on their individualized right and duty to decide the sentence as individuals, including their right to decide against a death sentence for reasons of mercy or sympathy. Ambrose sought to have the jury instructed in accord with his argument through proposed instructions, particularly D-4, which read:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-518\">\n   The Court instructs the jury that a mitigating circumstance is any fact relating to ABDUR RAHIM AMBROSE's character or history, or any aspect of the crime itself, which may be considered extenuating or reducing the moral culpability of the killing or making ABDUR RAHIM AMBROSE less deserving of the extreme punishment of death. Mitigating circumstances are those circumstances that tend to justify the penalty of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole as opposed to death.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-519\">\n   \u00b6 245. The trial court refused Ambrose's proposed instruction D-4. The State argues\n   that instruction D-4 instruction was fairly covered elsewhere. Instruction S-14 informed the jury that mitigating circumstances are \"those which tend to warrant the less severe penalty of life imprisonment without parole[.]\" Instruction S-14A listed the mitigating circumstances, which included \"[a]ny other matter, any other aspect of the Defendant's character or record, and any other circumstance of the offense brought to you during the trial of this case which you, the Jury, deem to be mitigating on behalf of the Defendant. Instruction S-14A also provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-520\">\n   If you individually find from the evidence that one or more of the preceding elements of mitigation exists, then you must consider whether they outweigh or overcome the aggravating circumstances you previously found. In the event that you find that the mitigating circumstances do not outweigh the aggravating circumstances, you may impose the death sentence. Should you find that the mitigating circumstances outweigh or overcome the aggravating circumstances, you shall not impose the death sentence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-521\">\n   \u00b6 246. Ambrose recognizes that the Court previously has rejected the same argument he advances under the present assignment of error in\n   <em>\n    Batiste\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Batiste\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7000461\" index=\"439\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/121/808/#p871\">\n    121 So.3d at 867\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 157) (reaffirming that capital defendants are not entitled to a mercy instruction);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thorson\n   </em>\n   , 895 So.2d at 108 (\u00b6 51) (holding that an instruction that was nothing more than a mercy instruction was refused properly by the trial court). The Court agrees with the State that the substance of the instruction was fairly covered elsewhere.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-522\">\n   \u00b6 247. Ambrose also urges the Court to revisit the equipoise issue decided in\n   <em>\n    Batiste\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that the sentencing scheme purports to permit a death sentence when the mitigation and aggravation are in equipoise. In\n   <em>\n    Batiste\n   </em>\n   , the Court rejected the same argument Ambrose repeats today.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Batiste\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7000461\" index=\"440\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/121/808/#p871\">\n    121 So.3d at 866-67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6\u00b6 155-157) (holding that the death penalty may be imposed when the State has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the mitigation circumstances do not outweigh the aggravating circumstances, including where the aggravating circumstances and mitigating circumstances are in equipoise).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-523\">\n   \u00b6 248. Finally, Ambrose urges the Court to revisit the constitutionality of Section 99-19-101, namely that the jury must find that mitigation outweighs aggravation in the weighing process because in all other respects the burden is firmly on the State to establish beyond a reasonable doubt everything that is required to impose a death sentence.

Under Section 99-19-105(3)(c), we must consider whether the sentence of death is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"467\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2099-19-105\">\n    Miss.

Ambrose argues that his death sentence is constitutionally and statutorily disproportionate for a combination of two circumstances. First, Ambrose argues that he was sentenced to death with the jury's sole finding under Section 99-19-107(7) that he \"contemplated that lethal force would be employed.\" Ambrose contends that consequently, the jury declined to find that Ambrose killed, attempted to kill or intended to kill Trosclair. Second, Ambrose argues that the codefendants Stevie and Dedeaux, who were identified as employing lethal force by eyewitnesses, did not receive a death sentence. In support of his argument, Ambrose relies on\n   <em>\n    Randall v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9390427\" index=\"468\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/806/185/#p232\">\n    806 So.2d 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 234 (\u00b6 143) (Miss. 2011) where the Court held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-549\">\n   Randall reminds us of\n   <em>\n    Bullock v.

While the co-defendants testified that Randall and Stokes both pointed guns at Daniels, there is no proof as to who actually killed him. The jury specifically declined to find that Randall killed or attempted to kill Daniels. Additionally, Stokes only received life in prison and the other co-defendants entered into plea agreements which spared their lives. Because the only fact, as found by the jury, was that Randall \"contemplated\" lethal force, the death sentence was disproportionate based on the findings of fact as determined by the jury. However, on retrial, other facts may be developed sufficient to support a death sentence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-550\">\n   <em>\n    Randall\n   </em>\n   , 806 So.2d at 234 (\u00b6 143).

We disagree.\n   <em>\n    Randall\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable. Here, evidence showed that Ambrose was the instigator of the events leading to Trosclair's death. Sims begged\n   Ambrose to stop beating a defenseless Trosclair, but he refused. Sims also pleaded for Ambrose to take Trosclair home after the assault at the Hill, but Ambrose did not. Ambrose admitted to telling Trosclair that once he received his \"stuff,\" he was not going to \"mess with him anymore. Ambrose admitted to driving Trosclair to Lawton's house. Ambrose admitted that the reason they assaulted Trosclair at Lawton's house was because Ambrose believed Trosclair had stolen his belongings out of his truck. Lee and Lawton testified that Ambrose prevented Trosclair's escape. Lee and Lawton testified that Ambrose struck Trosclair with a fully inflated tire with rim. Lee testified that Ambrose drove an unconscious Trosclair away from Lawton's home, where he was dumped on the side of the road. A passing motorist discovered Trosclair, who was tied up with a ratchet tow strap, unresponsive, lying on the side of the road.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-552\">\n   \u00b6 267.

Demetrius Lee participated in the April 10, 2013, killing of Robert Trosclair, for which Ambrose was convicted and sentenced to death. The jury learned that the State had given Lee the choice either to be a defendant or a witness in the capital murder case. But the jury never was informed that, at the time Lee testified in Ambrose's capital murder prosecution, Lee's involvement in the capital murder had placed him in peril of revocation of a three-year, non-adjudicated felony probation sentence for burglary of a dwelling. Nor did it learn that Lee was, at the time he testified against Ambrose, in peril of prosecution for an unrelated armed robbery. The majority acknowledges the trial court's error: \"[b]y limiting Ambrose's cross examination of Lee, the trial court denied Ambrose the opportunity to fully challenge Lee's credibility.\" Maj.

Ambrose's theory of defense was that he had not been the instigator of the beatings and kidnapping which led ultimately to Trosclair's death, but that he had been a mere accomplice. The State theorized, however, that Ambrose had been the instigator of the acts which caused Trosclair's death. And Lee's testimony was consistent with the State's theory. The majority outlines the \"overwhelming evidence\" of Ambrose's guilt as follows: Ambrose admitted fighting and participating in the beating of Trosclair because Trosclair had broken into his (Ambrose's) car, Ambrose \"instructed Stevie, Dedeaux, and Lee to put Trosclair in the truck before they left.\" Maj. Op. \u00b6 71. While \"Ambrose claimed Trosclair did not go anywhere against his will, Ambrose admitted telling Trosclair that once he received his speakers [the speakers Ambrose thought Trosclair had stolen from him], he 'wasn't going to mess with him anymore.' \" Maj. Op. \u00b6 71. But the only witness testimony contradicting Ambrose's testimony that Trosclair willingly left \"the Hill\" came from Lee. And Lee\n   was the only witness who claimed to have seen Ambrose restraining Trosclair with the tow strap, driving Trosclair from Jimmy Lawton's house, and leaving Trosclair on the side of the road.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-566\">\n   \u00b6 277.

[w]hen done with or without any design to effect death, by any person engaged in the commission of the crime of ... kidnapping ....\").While disturbing, various witnesses' observations of Ambrose beating Trosclair did not, standing alone, support Ambrose's capital murder conviction. The testimony of Lee was not merely ancillary to the overwhelming evidence of guilt. Lee's testimony was indispensable to prove the felony underlying the capital murder, that Ambrose kidnapped Trosclair. Yet the jury was not told of the considerable leverage the State wielded over Lee's testimony. It is impossible to say to what extent Ambrose was prejudiced by the trial court's refusal to allow cross examination, but it cannot be said to have been harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.
