Jarquin filed a petition for preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, declaratory judgment, and damages against defendants Danny R. Blanks, Barlow J. Cook, James R. Washington, III, and Mary LeBlanc individually and in their capacities as members of Ponchatrain Partners, L.L.C. The plaintiff, also a member of the Ponchatrain Partners, L.L.C., asserted that the defendants intentionally acted contrary to the L.L.C. operating agreement and applicable law, recklessly disregarding his rights and interest through conduct that caused and continues to cause him harm. Specifically, the plaintiff complains that the defendants illegally removed him as manager of their joint business venture at a meeting held on October 2, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 10, 2017, the plaintiff filed suit against the defendants in Jefferson Parish but that suit was dismissed on an Exception of Improper Venue. On October 31, 2017, the plaintiff filed the instant action in Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans against the defendants (but not the L.L.C), seeking damages and injunctive relief. The defendants responded to the plaintiff's application for injunctive relief, filing numerous exceptions, including the Exception of No Cause of Action at issue in this appeal. The hearing on the exceptions and preliminary injunction, based on verifications and affidavits only (as requested by the plaintiff in his application for injunctive relief) was heard on November 8, 2017. By judgment rendered orally on November 8, 2017, and signed on December 7, 2017, the district court granted the defendant's exception of no cause of action as to the plaintiff's claims for injunctive relief and denied as moot the plaintiff's application for a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The plaintiff timely filed this devolutive appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The denial of a preliminary injunction is reviewed under the abuse of discretion\n   standard.\n   <em>\n    Limousine Livery, Ltd. v.

This question, however, goes to the substantive matters of the case. The only issue currently before us is whether the district court abused its discretion in granting the defendants' exception of no cause of action with regard to injunctive relief and dismissing the plaintiff's application for injunctive relief. The pertinent jurisprudence is clear: the purpose of injunctive relief is to prevent future action, not to overturn an action that has already taken place. In this case, the action complained of took place on October 2, 2017. The plaintiff does not dispute that he was notified in advance of the meeting and chose not to attend or seek injunctive relief until more than a week later. Moreover, the action taken which the plaintiff seeks to overturn is his removal as managing partner of the L.L.C. Clearly, reinstatement as managing partner in a business is beyond the parameters of injunctive relief. Therefore, we find no error in the judgment of the trial court granting the defendants' exception and dismissing the plaintiff's application for injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    The plaintiff was given notice that the meeting would take place on September 27, 2017.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
