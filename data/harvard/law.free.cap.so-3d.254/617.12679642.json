Thomas, C.J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In this collateral appeal, we address whether Appellant's counsel provided constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to object to testimony by a law enforcement officer who specialized in training and utilizing dogs to track suspects and detect odors. The officer used his dog \"Diesel\" to track down fleeing suspects involved in a home burglary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   At trial, Officer Michael Michener testified regarding Diesel's ability to detect odors from someone in an anxious mental or physical state, running from police or otherwise in a state of distress. He had worked with the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office twenty-two years, with sixteen years as a K-9 handler. Officer Michener testified that he selected Diesel when the dog was eleven months old; he personally trained him and had been working with Diesel for nearly two years. Officer Michener testified that Diesel was an explosive-detection dog, but also performed patrol functions, including tracking people based on odor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Officer Michener testified that he and Diesel were dispatched to the scene of a burglary where people were fleeing from police. When he arrived at the neighborhood, Diesel indicated that he was sensing human body odor consistent with the nervousness or anxiety of someone fleeing. The officer testified that animals react depending on the human odor they are searching for; people who are fleeing give off a different type of odor than sedentary people, and based on his experience with Diesel and other dogs, he can tell when Diesel is indicating someone has been fleeing. He gave Diesel a command to locate human odor. Diesel led Officer Michener to a private fence, began pulling the officer very strongly, and eventually led him to the backyard of a residence and a shed, where the officer observed three people hiding. Diesel made contact with one of the people in the shed, and all three were eventually detained, including Appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Appellant was convicted of burglary of a dwelling and sentenced to thirty years' imprisonment. This court affirmed the judgment and sentence without opinion.\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. State,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=68%20So.%203d%20238\">\n    68 So. 3d 238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fla. 1st DCA 2011) (table).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The relevant trial testimony between the prosecutor and Officer Michener, to which Appellant's trial counsel did not object, was as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Q: Well, let me take you back then to October, that particular day on the 29th. Did you do a search with Diesel?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   A: Yes, ma'am, I did.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Q: And what method did you actually use that day?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   A: Because of the nature of the information I was obtaining through the police radio prior to getting there, this was what I would consider to be a hot search, meaning I actively had people that were fleeing from the police, I had bodies that were going through neighborhoods. So the most efficient thing to work towards is the dog's abilities to capitalize on that, is what we call an area search. To break that down ... we went with what we call a yard search which is a systematic search of each yard as we go.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Q: And when you're doing that systemic search with Diesel, what is he picking up on that will help him locate a suspect?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   A: The command I give the dog is to locate human odor. That -- that is, in essence, what the command means to the dog. When we start, I will tell the dog locate human odor so I'm looking for human beings is what I'm looking for.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Q: And is there a way that Diesel reacts when he locates human odor?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   A: Yes, ma'am. The animals react definitely depending on the human odor they happen to be searching for.\n   <em>\n    Human beings that are running or fleeing from the police obviously give a different type of scent, cast a different type of the odor off their body than say you and I do sitting here today.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Q: Is that because they're nervous, sweating, that sort of thing?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   A: Sweating, fearful. Anxiety plays a factor into it. There's a lot of different factors that play into it, versus somebody that may have been lost and walked off into the woods and sitting there. Now, he's capable of finding each of them in each of those cases, but the reaction from him is vastly different for those two.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Q: So based on your experience with Diesel as well as the other dogs\n   <em>\n    you can tell when he's indicating on somebody that is potentially a suspect who has been fleeing, say, versus, a homeowner in their backyard gardening\n   </em>\n   ?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   A:\n   <em>\n    Yes, ma'am.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (Emphasis added.) According to Appellant's collateral attorney, this was \"inconceivable scientific testimony that a canine animal could smell a guilty suspect.\" And defense counsel at trial exacerbated this \"inconceivable\" testimony on cross-examination by eliciting even more \"incomprehensible testimony\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Q: So Diesel is trained to detect any human odor?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   A: That's correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Q: Now, you stated on direct that Diesel is trained to pick up on like if somebody's been running or nervous or whatever it may be, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   A: Yeah. He has\n   <em>\n    self-taught himself\n   </em>\n   that over a series of involved pursuits ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Collateral counsel now argues, \"Michener acknowledges that not only is his canine able to sniff out the difference between guilty suspects and your average Joe, but [Diesel] has apparently 'self-taught himself' this miraculous feat.\" But notwithstanding the lavish description by Appellant's collateral counsel, the issue here is straightforward: Did counsel provide deficient representation in failing to object to the State's direct examination?

Section 90.701, Florida Statutes, describes when lay witnesses may give opinion testimony:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   If a witness is not testifying as an expert, the witness's testimony about what he or she perceived may be in the form of inference and opinion when:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (1) The witness cannot readily, and with equal accuracy and adequacy, communicate what he or she has perceived to the trier of fact without testifying in terms of inferences or opinions and the witness's use of inferences or opinions will not mislead the trier of fact to the prejudice of the objecting party; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (2) The opinions and inferences do not require a special knowledge, skill, experience, or training.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \"Of course, '[a]ll lay witnesses have some specialized knowledge-knowledge relevant to the case that is not common to everyone....

Rothstein,\n   <em>\n    Fed. Rules of Evidence\n   </em>\n   Rule 701 (3d ed.) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Here, the officer's testimony could not have been intelligently presented without admitting his answers regarding Diesel's asserted abilities. But under section 90.701, Florida Statutes, the question is, first, was he required to \"communicate ... inferences and opinions [which would] not mislead the trier of fact to the prejudice of the objecting party.\" Here, we think this criterion was met. The officer could not intelligently present his observations of Diesel's actions without expressing an opinion about the dog's training and capabilities. And a layperson understands that a dog, especially a specifically trained dog, could detect odors that human beings cannot detect or follow. The use of drug-sniffing dogs, and dogs used to smell and detect people trapped in rubble, is well known and understood. When viewed in context, the officer did not attempt to testify that Diesel could smell a burglar, but only that he could detect odors of a person in an anxious state attempting to flee, i.e., a \"fight or flight\" physiological phenomenon. We further do not think the officer's testimony caused unacceptable prejudice to the opposing party. A jury could believe or disbelieve the officer's testimony, as his lay opinions were not unreasonably expressed or based on any esoteric knowledge or techniques that could not be readily discredited on cross-examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The second question we must answer under section 90.701, Florida Statutes, is whether the officer's testimony contained any \"special knowledge, skill, experience, or training.\" If so, a defense objection would have been properly sustained under the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Federal courts have addressed the admission of lay opinion testimony under a federal evidentiary statute that is substantially similar and also prohibits such lay testimony from containing expert analysis:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Federal Rule of Evidence 701 allows lay opinion that \"is limited to those opinions or inferences which are (a) rationally based on the perception of the witness and (b) helpful to a clear understanding of the witness' testimony or the determination of a fact in issue.\" Rule 701 permits such testimony if it is based on \"relevant historical or narrative facts that the witness has perceived,\"\n   <em>\n    Teen-Ed, Inc. v.

In\n   <em>\n    Espino,\n   </em>\n   the Eighth Circuit rejected arguments that the lay witness could not testify regarding the weight of methamphetamine, where the witness did not necessarily weigh every evidentiary item:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Here, these witnesses, particularly Goatley, testified that they either actually weighed the quantities of methamphetamine purchased from Espino, or through their experience knew that the volume sold generally constituted a certain weight of the drug. These lay witnesses testified based upon their experience. They were not attempting to explain any technical or specialized information, and several of them had actually used a scale to weigh the methamphetamine.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9341746\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/317/788/#p797\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9341746\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/317/788/#p797\">\n    at 797\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In this case, the officer certainly had the requisite experience training dogs, but the question is whether his testimony constituted \"technical or specialized information\" and was thus impermissible lay expert testimony. We think Appellant's collateral counsel reads too much into the officer's testimony in his argument that the officer offered an impermissible expert opinion. In essence, the officer was testifying that Diesel could sense and identify a person running, in contrast to a sedentary person. While the question containing the phrase \"potentially a suspect\" may have been unduly precise, the question can only be fairly understood to mean that Diesel could detect a person who had been running, not literally whether they were guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   A federal district court has specifically ruled that testimony by a law enforcement officer about canine-training procedures was admissible as lay opinion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   The Court will allow Sergeant Skoro to testify as a lay witness under Federal Rule of Evidence 701.
