For the reasons that follow, we affirm defendant's convictions, vacate defendant's sentences, and remand this matter for resentencing in accordance with instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On March 26, 2013, defendant was charged by bill of information with one count of production of pornography involving juveniles under the age of seventeen in violation of La. R.S. 14:81.1 (count one), and with two counts of sexual battery upon a juvenile under the age of thirteen in violation of La. R.S. 14:31.1 (counts two and three). Defendant pled not guilty on all counts on April 14, 2013. On September 24, 2013, defense counsel filed a motion for the appointment of a sanity commission, which was granted by the trial court. On November 11, 2013, the trial court conducted a competency hearing and found defendant competent to proceed to trial. On May 16, 2016, the State amended the bill of information to reflect the correct date of the offense on all counts. The bill of information was further amended on May\n   15, 2017, correcting the offense in count one to production of pornography involving a juvenile under the age of thirteen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 16, 2017, a twelve-person jury found defendant guilty on all counts. On May 17, 2017, defendant filed a motion for new trial and a motion for post-verdict judgment of acquittal, which the trial court denied. On August 24, 2017, defendant was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment at hard labor without the benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence on count one, and 99 years at hard labor without the benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence on counts two and three, with all counts to be served concurrently. Defendant filed a motion to reconsider sentence which was denied. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant was often the caretaker of his two-year old sister, L.D.,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   when his mother, C.D., worked. On January 26, 2013, while watching L.D., defendant invited Rayan Badeaux, a man he met on the Internet, to his house located at 1402 Hancock Street in Gretna, where defendant engaged in sexual intercourse with Mr. Badeaux. Afterwards, defendant left the room to check on L.D. While defendant was out of the room, Mr. Badeaux looked through defendant's cell phone and located a video of a young toddler and an adult male who was touching the toddler's vagina. Mr. Badeaux immediately left defendant's house with defendant's cell phone and went to the New Orleans Police Department's (NOPD) Fourth District Station in New Orleans. Because the aforesaid residence is located in the City of Gretna, the Gretna Police Department was contacted regarding the pornographic video on the cell phone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Detective Jeffrey Laborie\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   with the Gretna Police Department met Mr. Badeaux at NOPD and obtained the cell phone from him. Mr. Badeaux showed Detective Laborie one video of a small female toddler, approximately one or two years old, with a pacifier in her mouth. The video showed a female toddler who was unclothed, and an adult man's hand touching her vagina. Detective Laborie testified that he believed, based on experience, that there was additional contraband on the cell phone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   During his investigation, Detective Laborie developed a potential suspect, \"Allen,\" and went to 1402 Hancock Street where he spoke with C.D. about the cell phone and the number associated with it. C.D. told him that the cell phone belonged to her son, Roy, not \"Allen.\" C.D. stated that she confronted defendant about videos on his phone, and told defendant that he was no longer welcome at her house. At that point, defendant became the potential suspect. While speaking with C.D., defendant approached the residence on his bicycle. Detective Laborie noticed that defendant was wearing the same clothing and matched the description he was previously given. Based on his corroborated observation, Detective Laborie approached defendant. Defendant appeared upset and was crying. Defendant spontaneously stated that he wanted to tell his side of the story. Detective Laborie transported defendant to the police station and placed him in a holding cell. While defendant was in the holding cell, Detective Laborie wrote his report in a nearby room equipped with a\n   monitor which allowed him to view and hear defendant. Detective Laborie overheard defendant crying and saying to himself, \"I'm so stupid. I can't believe I did that. I'm so lazy. I should have deleted those files. I lost my family. I will never be able to make up for this.\" Detective Laborie transcribed this statement \"word for word\" into his report as defendant was talking. At that point, Detective Laborie turned over his investigation to Sgt. Lewis Alvarez, who was a detective at the time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Before interviewing defendant, Sgt. Alvarez obtained a search warrant for defendant's cell phone, on which three videos were found. Sgt. Alvarez stated that it was too dark to see anything on the first video. The second video depicted a black adult male's penis ejaculating on a toddler's vagina. The third video showed a black adult male's hand \"playing with [toddler's] vagina.\" Sgt. Alvarez testified that he believed that there was more contraband on the phone, and he brought defendant from the holding cell to interview him. After being advised of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   rights, defendant agreed to voluntarily give a recorded statement. In his statement, defendant admitted to \"sexting\" \"Brad Howard,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   who asked him about his family. Defendant told Brad about his sister, L.D., and her age. Brad wanted defendant to touch L.D.'s vagina and ejaculate on her on video, and to send the videos to him. Although defendant initially refused, defendant stated that he did take the videos of L.D. as Brad requested. Defendant stated that he \"knew it was wrong\" but he wanted to keep communicating with Brad, and believed that if he did as requested, Brad would continue sending him photographs and videos of himself. Defendant stated that one video depicted him rubbing the outside of L.D.'s vagina with his finger. In a third video, he was rubbing L.D.'s vagina, but the lighting was too dark. He stated that he did not \"insert\" his finger into her vagina. Defendant also stated he took a video of himself ejaculating on L.D. Both videos were done in his mom's house located 1402 Hancock Street while he was changing L.D.'s diaper, and were sent to Brad. After further questioning, defendant also admitted to taking and sending approximately ten pornographic photographs of L.D.'s vagina to Brad, including one in which defendant inserted a Q-tip into L.D.'s vagina.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   When defendant was asked if he inserted his penis into L.D., defendant stated emphatically that he \"never\" put his penis in her vagina or anus, and \"never\" licked either. Defendant stated that he knew what he did was not right because L.D. could not protect herself, but stated that he did not hurt her. Defendant stated that he was \"in jail because of the stuff that was on my memory card that I thought I deleted.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After his statement, defendant was placed under arrest. Sgt. Alvarez went to 1402 Hancock Street to locate L.D. and meet with C.D. He observed a toddler that was one or two years old, and learned that L.D. was born February 20, 2011, which corroborated what he was told by defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In his first assignment of error, defendant contends for the first time on appeal that his counsel failed to provide effective assistance of counsel at a critical stage in the proceeding against him. Specifically, defendant contends that counsel was ineffective when he participated in his competency hearing by telephone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A criminal defendant is entitled to effective assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, \u00a7 13 of the Louisiana Constitution. To prove ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show both that his counsel's performance was deficient, and that the deficiency prejudiced him.\n   <em>\n    Strickland v.

The Supreme Court rejected the defendant's argument that counsel's telephone participation should be treated as a \"complete denial of counsel,\" and held that counsel's participation by telephone did not constitute the complete denial of counsel as contemplated under\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675918\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/120/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In the case before us, defendant's counsel participated via telephone at defendant's competency hearing, and thus defendant was not completely denied counsel as contemplated under\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   . Therefore,\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   governs this ineffective assistance of counsel claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Based on a review of the record, defendant failed to establish that counsel was ineffective under\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    's\n   </em>\n   two-prong test. Counsel actively participated in defendant's competency hearing, albeit by telephone. Defendant's counsel stated he received the doctor's report the day\n   before and he reviewed it, even though he did not have time to discuss it with defendant. The report's contents provided that there were no grounds to find defendant incompetent and that he was competent to proceed with trial. Counsel joined the State's stipulation that if Dr. Rafael Salcedo and Dr. Richard Richoux were called to testify, they would qualify as experts in psychology and would testify consistently with the contents of their report. The trial court asked defendant if he understood the stipulation and he responded that he understood. Based on the joint stipulation, the trial court accepted the report into evidence and found defendant competent to proceed to trial. This Court also notes that defendant's motion for competency did not contain a memorandum or any facts supporting a theory of defendant's alleged incompetence. Further, defendant does not contend that if defense counsel had been physically present, the outcome would have been different. Under the circumstances of this case, we find that defendant was not prejudiced or denied effective assistance of counsel by counsel's participation in the competency hearing via telephone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In his second assignment of error, defendant contends that the trial court erred by imposing excessive sentences on all three convictions. Defendant contends that while the facts of the offense are disturbing, (1) these offenses are not the worst in their class of offenses; (2) he is not the worst offender; (3) he is young; and (4) he is a first felony offender. Therefore, defendant contends maximum sentences are not appropriate. In his third assignment of error, defendant contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion to reconsider sentence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, \u00a7 20 of the Louisiana Constitution prohibit the imposition of excessive punishment.

See\n   <em>\n    State v. Morgan\n   </em>\n   , 97-997 (La. App. 3 Cir. 02/04/98),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11886384\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/706/1084/#p1086\">\n    706 So.2d 1084\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1086-1087 (defendant was sentenced to the maximum sentence, at that time, for abusing two young victims, one of whom had a mental disability, and the court found that the sentence was not excessive);\n   <em>\n    State v.

Unlike the facts in\n   <em>\n    Wilmot\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6927660\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/142/141/#p149\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6927660\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/142/141/#p149\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   there is no history of long term, repeated abuse by defendant towards L.D. Additionally, while defendant admitted in his statement to taking the photographs and videos of L.D., he was adamant that he did not penetrate L.D. with his mouth or penis orally, anally, or vaginally. There is nothing in the record which indicates anything to the contrary. Defendant, a young, homosexual male, stated that he knew what he was doing was wrong, but he took the photographs and videos and sent them to Brad in exchange for photographs and videos of Brad himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   As to the second factor, the nature and background of the offender, defendant had no prior felony criminal record. Defendants with extensive criminal records are more likely to receive a maximum or near maximum sentence for sexual battery of a juvenile under the age of thirteen. In\n   <em>\n    State v. Blake\n   </em>\n   , 50,732 (La.

In\n   <em>\n    Badeaux\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9473294\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/798/234/\">\n    798 So.2d at 239\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , defendant's maximum sentence was affirmed, but at that time, the maximum sentence was ten years at hard labor for sexual battery. Defendant was a first felony offender, but according to PSI report, defendant was previously accused of molesting\n   his former stepdaughters and defendant's brother testified that defendant was \"an exhibitionist, pedophile, and a manic-depressant.\" In\n   <em>\n    State v.

Again, while the maximum sentence in\n   <em>\n    Badeaux\n   </em>\n   was affirmed, it was only ten years at the time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In addressing the third factor, sentences imposed for similar but somewhat more serious crimes by defendants convicted for crimes involving limited instances of abuse by offenders who have no criminal record, received sentences between 35 to 45 years.

In\n   <em>\n    State v. Redfearn\n   </em>\n   , 44,709 (La.

While we do not condone or excuse defendant's disgusting behavior, we do not believe defendant is a typical sex offender of these classes. At the time of the offense, defendant was a young homosexual male adult, who appears to have performed these repugnant acts on his sister solely in exchange for nude photographs of an individual named Brad. Defendant admitted to taking the photographs and videos of L.D. wherein he touched her vagina with his hand and ejaculated on her, but did not touch or penetrate L.D. with his mouth and/or penis. Defendant has no prior felony criminal record, he graduated from high school and was gainfully employed at the time of the instant offense. Under the atypical facts of this case, defendant's maximum sentence of 99 years without the benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence is grossly disproportionate to the offense\n   charged, and far greater than other affirmed sentences for more serious crimes, or committed by multiple offenders, or both. Therefore, we vacate defendant's sentences for sexual battery of a juvenile under the age of thirteen (counts two and three) and remand this matter for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Pursuant to La. C.Cr.P. art. 881.4A, this Court may provide direction regarding a constitutionally reasonable sentence in a given case. Considering the factors enumerated above and the unique facts of this case, we suggest that a sentence of thirty-five to forty years imprisonment at hard on counts two and three to run concurrently with defendant's sentence on count one would be the longest sentence we could conclude to be not constitutionally excessive on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Production of Pornography Involving Juvenile Under the Age of Thirteen (count one):\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Defendant was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment at hard labor without the benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence for production of pornography involving juvenile under the age of thirteen. At the time of this offense, La. R.S. 14:81.1E(5)(b) provided that offenders over the age of seventeen who produced pornography involving juveniles under the age of thirteen shall be imprisoned at hard labor for not less than 25 years nor more than 99 years, with at least twenty-five years without the benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, we find defendant's 20-year sentence for production of pornography involving juvenile under the age of thirteen to be illegally lenient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Appellate courts may correct an illegal sentence at any time. La. C.Cr.P. art. 882. However, illegally lenient sentences may be corrected only on appeal by the state, or when such illegality is discoverable by mere inspection of the pleadings.\n   <em>\n    State v. Kelly\n   </em>\n   , 2015-0484 (La. 06/29/16),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6790878\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/195/449/\">\n    195 So.3d 449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendant's sentence is illegally lenient in that it does not comply with the statutory minimum sentence of 25 years, thus, this defect is discoverable by mere inspection of the record. Therefore, defendant's sentence for production of pornography involving a juvenile under the age of thirteen is hereby vacated, and the matter is remanded to the trial court for resentencing in accordance with the statutory range of La. R.S. 14:81.1E(5)(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In accordance with La. C.Cr.P. art. 881.4A, and considering the facts of this case as stated above, we suggest that a sentence of 35 to 40 years imprisonment at hard labor for the conviction of production of pornography involving a juvenile under the age of thirteen, to run concurrently with defendant's sentences for sexual battery, would not be constitutionally excessive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    Errors Patent Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The record was reviewed for errors patent, according to the mandates of La.
