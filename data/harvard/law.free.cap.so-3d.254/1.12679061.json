In January of 2016, Geneva was 91 years old and had pneumonia, respiratory distress, chronic heart failure, dementia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, peripheral vascular disease, and varicose veins. On January 19, 2016, a Lexington House employee dropped Geneva while transferring Geneva from a bath chair to her bed. Geneva's right leg was badly cut. Geneva died on May 16, 2016, allegedly because the injuries she received caused an insurmountable decline in her overall condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On November 2, 2016, Deana Fredrick (Deana) requested the formation of a medical review panel. Deana is Geneva's granddaughter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On May 19, 2017, Deana attempted to \"supplement\" the request for a medical review panel to include James Guffey (James) as a claimant and stated that she was the representative of Geneva's estate. On May 22, 2017, Lexington House filed an exception of no right of action grounded on the assertion that Deana was not a proper party claimant because as Geneva's granddaughter, she is not included in the list of beneficiaries who have the right to file a survival action under La.Civ.Code art. 2315.1 or a wrongful death action under La.Civ.Code art. 2315.2. The trial court denied the exception and agreed with the Plaintiffs' argument that the definition of \"claimant\" in\n   La.R.S. 40:1231.1(A)(4) is not limited to those who will ultimately be allowed to assert a survival or wrongful death claim when the panel proceedings are concluded.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Truxillo v.

According to Lexington House, Plaintiffs must rely solely upon the argument that the filing of the complaint of malpractice made by Deana on November 2, 2016, suspended prescription in their favor. Lexington House's argument that the action is prescribed is founded on the assertions that Deana had no right of action to bring the claim for medical malpractice on behalf of Geneva and that Plaintiffs' claims cannot relate back to the date of the original filing of the request for a medical review panel for that reason. Lexington House contends that Deana has conceded that she has no right of action because she is not a party plaintiff in the present action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs deny that they are arguing any relation back to the original filing because it was unnecessary for James and George to participate in the medical review panel proceedings since the claim filed by Deana suspended prescription as to them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \"The Supreme Court conclusively established in\n   <em>\n    LeBreton v.

The fourth circuit stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   There are no cases which address the specific issue with which we are presented; however, we find nothing in the Louisiana Medical Malpractice Act (\"MMA\") that requires that\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   parties who may potentially have a claim against a health care provider invoke a medical review panel proceeding. To the contrary, the purpose of the MMA, together with the MMA's express provisions and our jurisprudence interpreting it, leave no doubt that a medical review panel request need not be invoked by each and every person who may ultimately have a claim in medical malpractice. To hold otherwise would allow for the filing of multiple medical review panels by separate\n   claimants for the same claims. This could result in numerous and varied medical review panel decisions, which, in turn, could result in more than one applicable prescriptive period for initiating suit, an untenable result. As discussed more fully herein, we find that the suspension of the time period for filing suit, triggered by the filing of a medical review panel request, accrues to the benefit of all persons who have claims arising out of the alleged medical malpractice, including those who did not participate in requesting the medical review panel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    Truxillo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12185122\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/200/972/\">\n    200 So.3d at 974\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original).

Thus, as instructed by the holding in\n   <em>\n    Warren\n   </em>\n   , we are constrained to conclude that the doctrine of relation back set forth in LSA-C.C.P. art. 1153 cannot be applied to allow the amended complaint adding Mr. Triggs'[s] children as claimants, which was filed more than one year after the alleged malpractice, to relate back to the timely filing of any other complaint.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   As discussed above, this court has already considered a writ application by Lexington House on the issue of whether Deana had a right of action and found no error the trial court's ruling that she was, in fact, a proper claimant under the provisions of the LMMA. Plaintiffs contend that Lexington House is raising the same issue as in its exception of no right of action but calling it an exception of prescription. Plaintiffs argue that this court's disposition of \"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     WRIT DENIED\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n   We find no error in the trial court's ruling[ ]\" is now law of the case. Lexington House argues that it is not\n   law of the case because when the trial court ruled on the exception of no right of action, the trial court said \"You're premature in [ ] filing whatever you're filing because if, in fact, the Medical Malpractice Act is just a prelude to a lawsuit, then when you get to the lawsuit[,] you might have a valid no right of action [sic] to the claim.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   One of the issues raised in the writ application in 17-829 was that the trial court erred in failing to rule on the merits of the exception in finding that it was premature.

According to La.R.S. 40:1231.1(A)(4) :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   \"Claimant\" means a patient or representative or any person, including a decedent's estate, seeking or who has sought recovery of damages or future medical care and related benefits under this Part. All persons claiming to have sustained damages as a result of injuries to or death of any one patient are considered a single claimant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \"Representative\" is defined as \"the spouse, parent, guardian, trustee, attorney or other legal agent of the patient.\" La.R.S. 40:1231.1(A)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Deana had a power of attorney from Geneva for two years prior to Geneva's death. She was named executrix and sole beneficiary in Geneva's will. Although she did not specifically designate herself as the succession representative when the original complaint was filed, the complaint makes clear that she was filing on behalf of her deceased grandmother. She amended the complaint to reflect that she was the representative of the estate. When the exception of no right of action was filed, she introduced documents proving that she was the succession representative. Lexington House does not dispute the validity of those documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Louisiana Revised Statutes 40:1231.8(B)(2)(a) now allows the health care provider to raise the peremptory exception of no right of action at any time, including before completion of the medical review panel process. The right to bring that exception was added by 2012 Acts No.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   802, \u00a7 1. There was no corresponding amendment to the definition of \"claimant\" even though 2012 Acts No. 538, \u00a7 1, did add subsection (L) to La.R.S. 40:1231.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Lexington House argues that to define \"claimant\" as broadly as the trial court did in this case and in\n   <em>\n    Truxillo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12185122\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/200/972/\">\n    200 So.3d 972\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , would render La.R.S. 40:1231.8(B)(2)(a) meaningless because \"absolutely anyone\" could be a claimant. Lexington House's argument completely ignores the language used in the definition of \"claimant.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \"It is [ ] well established that the Legislature is presumed to enact each statute with deliberation and with full knowledge of all existing laws on the same subject.\"\n   <em>\n    M.J.

Although the legislature could have \"Claimant\" defined as those who have a right of action under either La.Civ.Code art. 2315.1 or 2315.2, it did not do so and specifically included \"representative\" and \"a decedent's estate.\" La.R.S. 40:1231.1(A)(4). Furthermore, La.R.S. 40:1231.1(A)(4) does not state that the representative or the estate can be a claimant only when the classes of persons listed in La.Civ.Code arts. 2315.1 and 2315.2 do not exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   We find that there is a difference between having a right of action to bring a complaint before the medical review panel and having a right of action to file suit in the district court once the panel proceedings are concluded. There must be a difference because there is the possibility that the patient will die after the conclusion of the panel proceedings but before the conclusion of any following litigation. Thus, a distinction between who can bring a claim before the panel and who can sue for damages after the conclusion of the panel proceedings is both reasonable and logical. The determination of who can bring a claim for damages is irrelevant to the definition of \"claimant.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Lexington House's argument also ignores the last sentence of La.R.S. 40:1231.1(1)(4). Despite the first circuit's ruling in\n   <em>\n    Parks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6892466\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/155/609/#p613\">\n    155 So.3d at 613\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original), the legislature did express an intent \"for a similar application of the statute to benefit all other unnamed potential\n   <em>\n    plaintiffs\n   </em>\n   or claimants.\" If the singular term \"claimant\" is the basis for the first circuit's decision, then this basis falls in light of the pronouncement that \"[a]ll persons claiming to have sustained damages as a result of injuries to or death of any one patient are considered a single claimant.\" La.R.S. 40:1231.1(1)(4). \"There is, accordingly, no focus whatsoever on the claimants during the medical review panel process.\"\n   <em>\n    Truxillo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12185122\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/200/972/\">\n    200 So.3d at 976\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
