For the following reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On September 12, 2012, Gregory Cormier, a Lieutenant with the Lafayette Police Department (LPD), was notified that his employment with the LPD was terminated by then Police Chief James Craft, as a result of Internal Affairs investigation AD2012-007. Investigation AD2012-007 involved the removal and dissemination of a confidential police file document. It was determined that Mr. Cormier removed said document from the file, whited out certain information included on the form, and gave the document to Scott Poiencot, a Corporal with the LPD. The confidential document was then given to Olita Magee, an attorney representing Edward Mclean, who was appealing his termination by the LPD. Olita Magee attached the document in question to an appellate brief and it was later learned that the document was taken from a shift level investigative file. The LPD considers the information contained in these files to be confidential.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Cormier appealed his termination to the Lafayette Municipal Fire and Police Civil Service Board. An evidentiary hearing was held on February 17, 2016, to determine Cormier's appeal. After the evidence and testimony was presented, the Board found that Cormier \"improperly removed a confidential document from an Internal Affairs file and disseminated it to other parties without any authorization.... in direct violation of Lafayette Consolidated Government PPM: 2161-2, G.O. 201.2, G.O. 204.5 and G.O. 301.9.\" The Board unanimously upheld the LPD's decision, finding that the LPD \"acted in good faith\" in terminating Cormier's employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Cormier next appealed to the Fifteenth Judicial District Court. He argued that the document was not a protected document because it was on the LPD server. He further argued that it had been introduced\n   as an exhibit in previous Civil Service appeals with no parts redacted. It had also been produced pursuant to a public records request. Therefore, Cormier argued, he should not have been disciplined for producing a protected document. The Fifteenth Judicial District Court found no manifest error in the Board's decision to uphold the termination of Mr. Cormier and affirmed the ruling. Mr. Cormier now appeals the judgment of the Fifteenth Judicial District Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    LAW AND ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The procedure for appeals by civil service employees to the board is found in La.R.S. 33:2501(A). It states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Any regular employee in the classified service who feels that he has been discharged or subjected to any corrective or disciplinary action without just cause, may, within fifteen days after the action, demand, in writing, a hearing and investigation by the board to determine the reasonableness of the action. The board shall grant the employee a hearing and investigation within thirty days after receipt of the written request.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   If the employee is aggrieved by the decision of the Board, his recourse is found in La.R.S. 33:2501(E), which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (1) Any employee under classified service and any appointing authority may appeal from any decision of the board, or from any action taken by the board under the provisions of the Part that is prejudicial to the employee or appointing authority. This appeal shall lie direct to the court of original and unlimited jurisdiction in civil suits of the parish wherein the board is domiciled.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (2) The appeal shall be taken by serving the board, within thirty days after entry of its decision, a written notice of the appeal, stating the grounds thereof and demanding that a certified transcript of the record, or written findings of facts, and all papers on file in the office of the board affecting or relating to such decision, be filed with the designated court. The board shall, within ten days, after the filing of the notice of appeal, make, certify, and file the complete transcript with the designated court, and that court shall thereupon proceed to hear and determine the appeal in a summary manner.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (3) This hearing shall be confined to the determination of whether the decision made by the board was made in good faith for cause under the provisions of this Part. No appeal to the court shall be taken except upon these grounds and except as provided in Subsection D of this Section.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Poiencot v.

He contends that there is no information contained on the document identifying any investigation of any officer. In support, Mr. Cormier cites\n   <em>\n    City of Baton Rouge v. Capital City Press\n   </em>\n   , 07-1088,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=07-1089%20%28La.App.%201%20Cir.%202/13/09%29\">\n    07-1089 (La.App. 1 Cir. 2/13/09)\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8153759\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/7/21/\">\n    7 So.3d 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In that case, the local newspaper, The Advocate, attempted to retrieve records of investigations of officers who were charged with offenses post-Katrina. The City of Baton Rouge contended that the records were confidential and were not subject to the Public Records Law. The first circuit ruled that the documents were subject to production, with personal information redacted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Mr. Cormier's reliance on this case is misplaced. The Advocate was not an employee of the police department, and, as such, it was not governed by the department's policies and procedures. As an officer of the LPD, Mr. Cormier was bound by the Lafayette Consolidated Government Policy and Procedures. He was found to be in violation of PPM: 2161-2: Conditions of Employment, which states: \"2.7 'Unauthorized removal or use of any official correspondence, record, computer file, e-mail or report from any LCG building, office or file.' \" Mr. Cormier was also found to be in violation of Lafayette Police Department General Order 204.5 Departmental Discipline, 3.8 Confidentiality: \"All departmental business is to be considered confidential and no employee shall release any information to any non-law enforcement entity without proper authorization. No employee shall make known to anyone a proposed action of the Department or the details of any police action/operation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In our view, Mr. Cormier is clearly in violation of both of these policies. He removed a document from a file without authorization. PPM 2161-2 prohibits its unauthorized removal, which Mr. Cormier admits that he did. Under this regulation, whether the document is considered confidential is of no moment. Regardless, G.O. 204.5 considers all departmental business to be deemed confidential. Therefore, as it pertains to employees of the Lafayette Police Department, this document is considered to be confidential in accordance with the policies and procedures manual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Next, Mr. Cormier argues that the notice of the pre-disciplinary hearing did not inform him of the charges against him, nor was he given an explanation of his employer's evidence. As such, he contends that his due process rights were violated. In\n   <em>\n    Cleveland Board of Education v.

After a recitation of the allegations against him, Mr. Cormier was told that he could make a verbal statement and/or provide the investigator with a written statement. Mr. Cormier chose to make a verbal statement in which he stated, \"The only thing I can say [about] all these allegations that you cited [is that] I didn't do [it].

If the board finds that the municipal police department has shown good cause for the granting of an extension of time within which to complete the investigation, the board shall grant an extension of up to sixty days. Nothing contained in this Paragraph shall be construed to prohibit the police employee\n   or law enforcement officer under investigation and the appointing authority from entering into a written agreement extending the investigation for up to an additional sixty days. The investigation shall be considered complete upon notice to the police employee or law enforcement officer under investigation of a pre-disciplinary hearing or a determination of an unfounded or unsustained complaint. Further, nothing in this Paragraph shall limit any investigation of alleged criminal activity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   C. There shall be no discipline, demotion, dismissal, or adverse action of any sort taken against a police employee or law enforcement officer unless the investigation is conducted in accordance with the minimum standards provided for in this Section. Any discipline, demotion, dismissal, or adverse action of any sort whatsoever taken against a police employee or law enforcement officer without complete compliance with the foregoing minimum standards is an absolute nullity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Mr. Cormier urges this court to utilize April 11, 2012, as the date in which this investigation was initiated. He argues that, on that day, Sergeant Keith Gremillion discovered that the confidential memorandum was attached to the Mclean brief. It was then that Sergeant Gremillion began to search for the source of the document. Based on this argument, the time to complete the investigation ended on June 10, 2012, and, therefore, the request for extension that went before the Board on June 12, 2012, was too late, as the time delays had expired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   A formal investigation was launched on May 11, 2012. It should be noted that Sergeant Gremillion had not ascertained who had removed and disseminated the confidential document on that date. Since no person had been identified, fourteen LPD officers and one LPD civilian employee were investigated based upon their access to the file in question. Mr. Cormier was one of the fifteen employees. This is important because La.R.S. 40:2531(B) states that these minimum standards apply \"[w]henever a police employee or law enforcement officer is under investigation.\" While Sergeant Gremillion may have been looking into the matter on April 11, 2012, and thereafter, no police employee or law enforcement officer was under investigation until May 11, 2012. Even then, fifteen investigations were filed because Sergeant Gremillion had not yet discovered the source of the document.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Further, this same argument was before this court in\n   <em>\n    Uletom Hewitt v. Lafayette City-Parish Consolidated Government\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15-835%20%28La.App.%203%20Cir.%203/2/16%29\">\n    15-835 (La.App. 3 Cir. 3/2/16)\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6818126\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/186/339/\">\n    186 So.3d 339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In that case, Hewitt sought review of the decision of the Board, which affirmed his seven-day suspension. The district court upheld the ruling. Hewitt argued that the decision of the Board must be reversed because the investigation of him was not completed within the time mandated by La.R.S. 40:2531. Hewitt contended that a form entitled \"INVESTIGATION OF POSSIBLE MISCONDUCT BY EMPLOYEE\" that was filed on February 25, 2011, sounded the beginning of the investigation. This court disagreed and found that this form was actually the formal, written complaint contemplated by La.R.S. 40:2531, after which the chief of police or his authorized representative must initiate the initial investigation. That date was determined to be March 2, 2011, which is the date the formal investigation, signed by Chief Craft, was initiated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In our case, the form initiating the Internal Affairs Investigation, including allegations, was signed by Major Jackie Alfred as Designee for Chief Jim Craft on May\n   11, 2012. Mr. Cormier acknowledged receipt of this document by his signature and by dating it May 15, 2012. Therefore, the request for extension that went before the Board on June 12, 2012, was timely. According to La.R.S. 40:2531, the extension must be made within sixty days of the investigation's commencement. The extension granted the LPD an additional sixty days within which to complete the investigation. The pre-disciplinary hearing, which triggered the conclusion of the investigation was held on September 7, 2012, within one hundred twenty days of the initial investigation. We find that the investigation was completed timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    DECREE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Based on the foregoing, we find no error in the Board's decision to uphold Gregory Cormier's termination. We find that the Internal Affairs Investigation of Gregory Cormier was conducted in a timely manner. We further find that the Lafayette Municipal Fire and Police Civil Service Board acted in good faith and statutory cause in finding that there was sufficient evidence to terminate Greg Cormier's employment with the Lafayette Police Department. All costs of this appeal are assessed to Greg Cormier.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    The Internal Affairs Investigation of Greg Cormier occurred in 2012. Louisiana Revised Statutes 40:2531 was amended in 2014 and 2017.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
