Terrick, appeals his sentence of life imprisonment with parole eligibility in twenty-five years, which was imposed on resentencing, for his 2002 second degree murder conviction. For the\n   following reasons, we affirm defendant's sentence. We also grant appellate counsel's motion to withdraw as counsel of record, and remand the matter to the trial court for correction of the November 11, 2017 minute entry in accordance with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This is defendant's second appeal. Defendant was a juvenile at the time of the offense on July 27, 2001 and was tried as an adult on a charge of second degree murder.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The conviction and resulting sentence of life in prison without the benefit of parole, probation or suspension of sentence were affirmed by this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Since that appeal, in\n   <em>\n    Miller v.

On June 20, 2013, defendant filed a \"Motion to Correct Illegal Sentence and Supporting Memorandum of Law and Facts,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   in which he requested resentencing pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Miller.\n   </em>\n   In response, the trial court set a hearing on September 13, 2013 for consideration of defendant's request for resentencing. However, the matter was continued due to the fact that on the date of the scheduled hearing, defendant filed a \"Motion for Discovery\", requesting various documents and information in the State's possession for consideration of resentencing under\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On March 24, 2016, defendant filed a pro se \"Motion to Amend Motion to Correct Illegal Sentence Supporting Memorandum of Law and Facts,\" re-urging the arguments made in prior pleadings challenging the legality of his sentence. On March 30, 2016, defendant filed a \"Motion for Appointment of Counsel and Funding\" and a portfolio containing religious, educational and self-help improvement certificates for the trial court's consideration. On November 30, 2017, after several continuances, the trial court heard the merits of defendant's motions. At that time, the trial court resentenced defendant pursuant to La. R.S. 15:574.4D to \"life with the benefit of parole after serving twenty-five years\". Defendant filed a timely appeal and the court assigned the Louisiana Appellate Project to represent defendant on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Under the procedure adopted by this Court in\n   <em>\n    State v.

The supreme court explained that an\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   brief must demonstrate by full discussion and analysis that appellate counsel \"has cast an advocate's eye over the trial record and considered whether any ruling made by the trial court, subject to the contemporaneous objection rule, had a significant, adverse impact on shaping the evidence presented to the jury for its consideration.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11870799\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/704/241/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   When conducting a review for compliance with\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   , an appellate court must conduct an independent review of the record to determine whether the appeal is wholly frivolous.\n   <em>\n    Bradford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7436533\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/676/1108/#p1110\">\n    676 So.2d at 1110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If, after an independent review, the reviewing court determines there are no non-frivolous issues for appeal, it may grant counsel's motion to withdraw and affirm the defendant's conviction and sentence. However, if the court finds any legal point arguable on the merits, it may either deny the motion and order the court-appointed attorney to file a brief arguing the legal point(s) identified by the court, or grant the motion and appoint substitute appellate counsel.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7436533\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/676/1108/#p1110\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant's appellate counsel asserts that after a detailed review of the record, she could find no non-frivolous issues to raise on appeal, nor ruling of the trial court to be challenged. She further states that she considered whether to raise the issue of excessiveness of sentence but felt such a claim would be frivolous. Appellate counsel points out that the trial court sentenced defendant to the mandatory minimum and granted parole eligibility with credit for time served. She also asserts that trial counsel lodged an objection to the sentence but did not file a motion to reconsider the new sentence and did not request a downward departure at the hearing or resentencing. As such, appellate counsel contends that the sentence would not be regarded as constitutionally excessive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Upon receipt of appellate counsel's brief, this Court sent defendant a letter by certified mail informing him that an\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   brief had been filed and that giving him a return date to file a pro se supplemental brief.

(sic)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendant's first assignment of error relates to this Court's disposition in a prior pro se writ application filed on December 15, 2017, challenging his November 30, 2017 resentencing. This Court denied that writ, finding that because the sentence was appealable, the merits of the writ application would not be considered in the writ application.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On April 10, 2018, this Court transmitted the appellate record to defendant at his request and gave him until May 10, 2018, to file a supplemental brief. Defendant filed a pro se Motion to Supplement (Appellate Brief) and a \"Supplement Brief\" on April 10 and 20, 2018, respectively. It is clear defendant had access to the November 30, 2017 resentencing transcript at the time he filed his supplemental brief because he made references to it in his supplemental brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendant has now challenged his November 30, 2017 resentencing in the instant appeal, this Court has the entire appellate record and will address defendant's pro se assignments of error, thus giving defendant a full and fair opportunity to be heard. The merits of defendant's challenge to his sentence are now properly before us in this appeal.

R.S. 15:574.4, violated the\n   <em>\n    Ex Post Facto\n   </em>\n   Clause and his constitutional rights to due process and fair warning. He indicates that he should have been resentenced to the lesser responsive verdict of manslaughter, the law that was in effect at the time he committed the offense.

To comply with the directive set forth in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , the Louisiana Legislature passed 2013 La. Act 239 (\"the Act\"). The Act created La. C.Cr.P. art. 878.1, which directs the district courts to conduct a hearing before sentencing to determine whether the life sentence to be imposed on a juvenile homicide offender should be with or without parole eligibility. The Act also created La. R.S. 15:574.4(E)(1), which provides the conditions that must be met by any juvenile homicide offender serving a sentence with a judicial determination of parole eligibility\n   pursuant to article 878.1 in order to be considered for parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On November 5, 2013, in\n   <em>\n    State v.

A State may remedy a\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   violation by permitting juvenile homicide offenders to be considered for parole, rather than by resentencing them.

There is no consideration of whether the defendant was entitled to a downward departure from the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment at hard labor. Rather, the trial court is required to consider only whether that mandatory sentence should include parole eligibility.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12427032\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/232/1284/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Moreover, Louisiana courts have repeatedly rejected the argument that resentencing pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , requires a defendant to be sentenced under the manslaughter statute.\n   <em>\n    State v. Brown\n   </em>\n   , 51,418 (La. App. 2 Cir. 6/21/17), --- So.3d ----,\n   <em>\n    writ denied,\n   </em>\n   17-1287 (La. 4/27/18),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12666440,12666437,12666438,12666439\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/241/306/\">\n    241 So.3d 306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and cases cited therein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In the matter before us, the record shows that the trial judge adhered to the law set forth in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   and its progeny in resentencing. According to that law, the trial judge's purpose at the hearing was to determine whether to resentence defendant to life imprisonment with parole eligibility or life imprisonment without parole eligibility. After reviewing the law, the exhibits, and the facts of the case, the trial judge chose to vacate defendant's sentence and resentence him to life imprisonment with parole eligibility in twenty-five years, the less severe of the two potential penalties. Defendant's sentence now provides him with a meaningful opportunity for release. In light of the foregoing, we find that defendant's sentence was neither excessive, nor an infringement of the principles of\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   . Therefore, we find no merit in defendant's assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    ERRORS PATENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   This Court has reviewed the record for errors patent according to La. C.Cr.P. art. 920.\n   <em>\n    State v. Oliveaux\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9644569\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/312/337/\">\n    312 So.2d 337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (La. 1975) ; and\n   <em>\n    State v. Weiland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7508323\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/556/175/\">\n    556 So.2d 175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (La. App. 5 Cir. 1990). A review reveals that, although the resentencing transcript, minute entry indicate that defendant was sentenced pursuant to La. R.S. 15:574.4(D), defendant was actually sentenced under La. R.S. 15:574.4(G). Section (D)(1) provides that the statute is not applicable to a person who is serving a life sentence for second degree murder. Defendant in the instant case is serving a life sentence for second degree murder. Section (G)(1) provides that the statute is applicable to any person serving a life sentence for second degree murder who was under the age of eighteen at the time of the offense and whose indictment for the offense was prior to August 1, 2017. Defendant in the instant case meets those requirements. For purposes of accuracy, we remand this matter to the trial court with instructions to amend the minute entry of commitment to reflect that defendant was sentenced under La. R.S. 15:574.4(G).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Finally, we find that an independent review of the record supports appellate counsel's assertion that there are no non-frivolous issues to be raised on appeal. The minute entry reflects that defendant and his counsel appeared at his resentencing. As such, there are no appealable issues surrounding defendant's presence. Accordingly, we grant appellate counsel's motion to withdraw as counsel of record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    DECREE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we affirm defendant's sentence, and we remand the matter to the trial court for correction of the November 30, 2017 minute entry and commitment to indicate defendant was resentenced pursuant to La. R.S. 15:574.4(G). We also grant appellate counsel's motion to withdraw as counsel of record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     AFFIRMED; REMANDED FOR CORRECTION OF MINUTE ENTRY; MOTION TO WITHDRAW GRANTED.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    There is some confusion over whether defendant was 16 or 17 at the time of the offense.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    <em>\n     State v.
