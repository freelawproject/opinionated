The Marshall County Circuit Court entered an order dismissing Adlai Johnson from the suit for Plaintiffs' failure to timely serve him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Church Mutual Insurance Company (\"Church Mutual\") then moved to have the trial court declare that Tennessee substantive law controlled the case. After the trial court so declared, Church Mutual moved for summary judgment based on Tennessee law prohibiting direct actions against insurers for uninsured motorist (\"UM\") claims. The trial court then entered summary judgment in favor of\n   Church Mutual. Plaintiffs seek interlocutory review of all three rulings. We find no error in the dismissal of Johnson for Plaintiffs' failure to serve. We further find no error with the trial court applying Tennessee law to determine whether the contract provided UM coverage to Plaintiffs. However, we find that the trial court erred in applying Tennessee substantive law. We reverse those judgments of the Marshall County Circuit Court and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    STATEMENT OF FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. On April 28, 2013, Tarinika Smith and twelve minor children (collectively Plaintiffs) were involved in an automobile accident with a vehicle driven by Adlai Johnson.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Smith was operating a passenger van owned by Mount Vernon Missionary Baptist Church (Mt. Vernon), located in Rossville, Tennessee, which was transporting the children. The accident occurred in Marshall County, Mississippi. At the time of the collision, Smith was pregnant. Plaintiffs and Johnson all are Tennessee residents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. However, Church Mutual's principal place of business is in Wisconsin. Church Mutual issued a Commercial Automobile Policy to Mount Vernon, insuring a fifteen-passenger church van and a twelve-passenger church van. The agent for the policy was located in Brentwood, Tennessee. Although the full policy was not provided by either party, portions of the commercial auto policy, including the Business Automobile Declarations and the Tennessee Uninsured Motorists Coverage Endorsement, were included. The policy limits were $1,000,000 in liability, $5,000 in medical payments, $1,000,000 in uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage, and actual cash value or cost of repair, whichever is less, for both comprehensive and collision damage. Although the Tennessee Uninsured Motorists Coverage Endorsement was provided, the named insured, effective date, authorized representative, and schedule of bodily injury portions were left blank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. The Tennessee Uninsured Motorists Coverage Endorsement reads in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   A. Coverage\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   1. We will pay all sums the \"insured\" is legally entitled to recover as compensatory damages from the owner or driver of an \"uninsured motor vehicle.\" The damages must result from \"bodily injury\" sustained by the \"insured\" or \"property damage\" caused by an \"accident.\" The owner's or driver's liability for these damages must result from the ownership, maintenance, or use of the \"uninsured motor vehicle.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   2. With respect to damages resulting from an \"accident\" with a vehicle described in Paragraph\n   <strong>\n    (2)\n   </strong>\n   of the definition of \"uninsured motor vehicle,\" we will pay under this coverage only if\n   <strong>\n    a.\n   </strong>\n   or\n   <strong>\n    b.\n   </strong>\n   below applies:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   a.

A tentative settlement has been made between the \"insured\" and the insurer of an owner or operator of a vehicle described in Paragraph\n   <strong>\n    (2)\n   </strong>\n   of the definition of \"uninsured\n   motor vehicle\" and we have been given written notice of such tentative settlement as described in Paragraph\n   <strong>\n    E.4.b.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   That portion of the policy further declares that an \"insured\" is \"anyone 'occupying' a covered 'auto....' \" None of the exclusions listed therein applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 5. On June 15, 2015, Plaintiffs filed suit against Johnson and Church Mutual, alleging Johnson caused the accident. Plaintiffs sought damages for various injuries. Plaintiff Smith additionally sought recovery for the wrongful death of her \"unborn quick child.\" On June 16, 2015, Plaintiffs sent to Johnson, via U.S. certified mail, an envelope with the circuit court's process for service on him. It was not until August 11, 2015, however, that Plaintiffs' counsel received notice from the U.S. Postal Service that the envelope had been returned undelivered and marked \"unclaimed.\" As a result, Plaintiffs again attempted service on Johnson in September 2015, but learned in February 2016 that service had failed a second time. And so, on March 14, 2016, Plaintiffs, via a process server, tried to serve Johnson a third time. Plaintiffs' third attempt ultimately was successful, with Johnson being served on March 28, 2016 - 287 days after the filing of Plaintiffs' complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 6. In response to Plaintiffs' suit, Johnson moved to be dismissed on April 29, 2016, citing Plaintiffs' failure to timely serve him within the 120-day period prescribed by Rule 4(h) of the Mississippi Rules of Civil Procedure. Plaintiffs opposed Johnson's motion and argued for an extension of time to serve him properly. Plaintiffs offered a variety of reasons why Johnson was served beyond Rule 4(h)'s 120-day period - specifically, Plaintiffs allocated fault to both their chosen process server and Johnson. Plaintiffs, however, conceded that they were not made aware service had failed through their server until February 2016, which prompted their March 14, 2016, attempt. Following argument on Johnson's motion, the circuit court granted the motion under Rule 4(h) and dismissed Johnson without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 7. In June 2016, Church Mutual moved to declare Tennessee substantive law controlled this action. Church Mutual argued that, aside from the location of the accident, Mississippi had no contacts with the parties or subject matter of the action. Therefore, choice-of-law principles required Tennessee law to be applied to the action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 8. The circuit court granted Church Mutual's motion and held that Tennessee substantive law would govern all parties' claims and defenses, save for Mississippi's \"[R]ules of the [R]oad.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The circuit court specifically held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   This case arises from an automobile accident that occurred in Marshall County, Mississippi on April 28, 2013. The location of the accident was on Highway 72, just south of the Tennessee border. All parties to this action are domiciled or reside in Tennessee, with the exception of Church Mutual Insurance Company, whose principal place of business is in Wisconsin. Church Mutual insured the van driven by Plaintiff Smith. The insurance policy was negotiated\n   in Tennessee and was to be substantially performed in Tennessee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   This Court finds Tennessee law controls\n   <em>\n    plaintiffs' contractual claims\n   </em>\n   against Church Mutual. The place of contracting as well as the place of negotiating the contract was in Tennessee. The insured automobile was principally garaged in Tennessee. This Court finds the place of performance of the contract was substantially in Tennessee. Therefore, under the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws sections 188 and 193, this Court finds Tennessee law controlling.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   This Court finds Tennessee law controlling as to\n   <em>\n    plaintiffs' claims of negligence\n   </em>\n   . Tennessee is the common domicile of the plaintiffs and Defendant Johnson. No party to this action is domiciled or resides in Mississippi. Based on the facts presented to the Court, this Court finds Tennessee has the most substantial relationship with the parties involved. While the Court recognizes the place of injury is Mississippi, this Court finds that fact alone is not determinative as to which state's law governs this dispute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mitchell v.

Following the trial court's finding that Tennessee law would apply to Plaintiffs' suit and because Johnson previously had been dismissed from the underlying suit, Church Mutual moved for summary judgment, arguing that Tennessee law did not allow Plaintiffs to bring a direct action against a UM carrier, absent specific circumstances. The circuit court agreed, and on October 24, 2016, dismissed all Plaintiffs' claims against Church Mutual without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 10. Plaintiffs sought interlocutory relief from this Court. Specifically, Plaintiffs appealed the circuit court's orders dismissing Johnson from the suit and finding Tennessee substantive law controlling, before granting summary judgment to Church Mutual. This Court granted Plaintiffs interlocutory review and stayed all further proceedings of the circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 11. \"The standard of review for a trial court's grant or denial of a motion to dismiss is de novo.\"\n   <em>\n    Long v.

The record reflects that Plaintiffs filed their complaint on June 15, 2015. Under the rule, the 120-day period to effectuate service on Johnson expired on October 13, 2015. Because service was not made upon Johnson by October 13, 2015, Plaintiffs failed to satisfy the first prong of the Rule 4(h) inquiry. As a result, Plaintiffs' only recourse under Rule 4(h) was to establish \"good cause.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R.C.P. 4(h).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 14.

In an attempt to establish good cause, Plaintiffs argue that Johnson willfully evaded service. But Plaintiffs provide no evidence proving his alleged evasion, and the record is devoid of the same. Moreover, Plaintiffs were not diligent in serving Johnson, for Plaintiffs concede that they took no action as to the status of their service of process between the first week of October 2015 and February 2016-approximately four months. This four-month period extended beyond the original 120-day period. Due to Plaintiffs' lack of diligence, lack of proof of Johnson's willful evasion, and lack of any other mitigating circumstances warranting relief, we conclude that they failed to establish \"good cause.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 16. Additionally, Plaintiffs did not file their motion for extension of time until May 20, 2016-some 220 days after the expiration of their 120-day period, and 340 days after the filing of their complaint. Plaintiffs' motion for an enlargement of time to serve Johnson was made only\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   Johnson had filed his motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' claims against him on April 29, 2016. The circuit court analyzed Plaintiffs' claims under Rule 6(b) and denied their\n   motion for an extension. Pursuant to Rule 6(b):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   When by these rules or by notice given thereunder or by order of court an act is required or allowed to be done at or within a specified time, the court for cause shown may at any time in its discretion ... upon motion made after the expiration of the specified period permit the act to be done where failure to act was the result of excusable neglect....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   M.R.C.P. 6(b). \"This Court has held that the standards for deciding whether a plaintiff has demonstrated 'good cause' under Rule 4(h) and 'excusable neglect' under Rule 6(b)(2) are virtually identical.\"\n   <em>\n    Collins v.

Both the place of contracting and the place of negotiation were in Tennessee. The contract was performed substantially in Tennessee. The vehicles involved were garaged principally in Tennessee. And the domicile, residence, and place of business of the parties is Tennessee. Thus, Tennessee's law applies as to\n   whether the Plaintiffs are insureds under the policy and, if so, the limits of liability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Church Mutual has raised no coverage issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 20. Nothing in this commercial automobile policy excludes these Plaintiffs from recovering damages from an uninsured/underinsured motorist, provided they prove their case. The policy reads that Church Mutual is obligated to pay for an insured's injuries, and no exclusions to that obligation to pay were applicable. Moreover, policy exclusions were not claimed by Church Mutual and were not before the trial court. Church Mutual's argument is that Tennessee law should apply to all issues - no direct action against the UM carrier and no compensable damages as to Smith - not that all Plaintiffs were not insured under the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 21. The distinction in substantive tort law does not control recovery under the policy. The policy language controls recovery if Plaintiffs prove that Johnson violated the rules of the road and that violation was a cause of the accident and their damages. Nothing in the policy excludes Plaintiffs from the recovery sought, once violation and causation are proven. Church Mutual has presented no evidence that the UM policy is invalid when the vehicle is operated in states other than Tennessee. No matter if an accident occurred in Maine or Florida, Washington, Southern California, or Mississippi, Plaintiffs are entitled to recover damages (\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4) under the policy, provided they meet the policy requirements. The relief Church Mutual is seeking is not provided for in the policy. What could prevent recovery is not the policy, but Tennessee's substantive law. However, nothing in the policy states that Tennessee statutory law controls tort claims and recovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Twenty states permit injured persons to recover damages reduced by their percentage of fault only if their negligence does not exceed that of the defendant (the fifty-percent rule). Nine permit recovery only if plaintiff's negligence is less than that of the defendant (the forty-nine-percent rule), which has been adopted by Tennessee.

So, looking to the first two factors, the injury and the conduct causing the injury occurred in Mississippi.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   And though the first two factors initially weigh in favor of Mississippi, this Court has made clear that the place where the injury occurred often \"bears little relationship to any relevant considerations for choosing one law against another in a particular tort case.\"\n   <em>\n    Mitchell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9802955\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/211/509/\">\n    211 So.2d at 513\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This is so especially in cases such as this one, where the collision and the conduct causing the collision are the\n   <em>\n    sole\n   </em>\n   relationship to Mississippi. That is, it was a \"purely adventitious circumstance that the collision happened in [Mississippi].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9802955\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/211/509/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   \u00b6 47. Next, the third factor-the domicile and residence of the parties-reveals that Tennessee has the dominant interest. This is because all the parties, except for Church Mutual, are Tennessee residents. In addition, the sole witness to the collision is a Tennessee resident, and the vehicle utilized by Plaintiffs was owned by Mt. Vernon (a Tennessee church and the named insured under the Church Mutual policy at issue, which was issued and delivered in Tennessee). Referring to the Comment on Section 145(2)(c), it provides that, \"[t]he state where these contacts are grouped is particularly likely to be the state of the applicable law ... [and] [t]his state may also be the state of the applicable law when conduct and injury occurred in a place that is fortuitous and bears little relation to the occurrence and the parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Restatement (Second) Conflict of Laws\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 145(2)(c) cmt. e. Therefore, these contacts, taken together with the Comment's guidance, weigh entirely in favor of Tennessee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   \u00b6 48. As for the last factor, however, I find that it does not apply in this case. That is, the parties agree that they did not have a relationship\n   <em>\n    prior\n   </em>\n   to the collision. Though Plaintiffs argue that the parties' relationship became \"centered\" in Marshall County, as that is where the collision occurred, I find this assertion unpersuasive. As the\n   <em>\n    Restatement (Second)\n   </em>\n   provides, we are to review \"the place where the relationship,\n   <em>\n    if any\n   </em>\n   , between the parties is centered.\"\n   <em>\n    Restatement (Second) Conflict of Laws\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 145(2)(d) (emphasis added). But going further, the Comment to Section 145(2)(d) states that \"\n   <em>\n    [w]hen\n   </em>\n   there is a relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant\n   <em>\n    and when the injury was caused by an act done in the course of the relationship\n   </em>\n   ,\" then where the relationship is \"centered\" becomes a relevant contact.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9802955\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/211/509/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   cmt. e (emphasis added). Thus, the plain language of, and official comment to, Section 145(2)(d) both provide that this particular contact will not apply in all cases-such as the case here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   \u00b6 49. And so, I would conclude that Mississippi's choice-of-law principles require that the laws of Tennessee apply to the parties' tort-based claims and defenses in this case-absent, of course, a finding that the relevant Tennessee laws are repugnant to Mississippi's public policies. And for clarity's sake, my conclusion that Tennessee law applies does not abrogate the circuit court's finding (and the parties' concession) that Mississippi's Rules of the Road will determine negligence-rather, Tennessee's laws should govern as to the degree of recovery (if any) and as to Smith's wrongful-death claim, which is discussed in further detail below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Repugnance, if any, of Tennessee Laws\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   \u00b6 50. As the majority articulates, \"[c]ourts of this state will not give effect to the substantive law of another state if to do so would be 'offensive to the deeply ingrained or strongly felt public policy of the state.' \"\n   <em>\n    Zurich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8993099\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/920/427/#p437\">\n    920 So.2d at 437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Boardman v.

Being such, \"[t]his Court recognizes that the laws of other states sometimes conflict with Mississippi law[,\n   <em>\n    but] [c]onflict between the law of our state and another state does not itself mean that the foreign law is so offensive that it must be set aside.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Zurich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8993099\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/920/427/#p437\">\n    920 So.2d at 437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

Here, Plaintiffs assert that, because true conflicts exist between the laws of Mississippi and Tennessee, it follows that Tennessee's laws are repugnant to the laws of Mississippi. Specifically, Plaintiffs assert as repugnant both Tennessee's wrongful-death statute and its comparative-fault scheme. Plaintiffs, however, cite no authority supporting these specific propositions. But even so, in light of our caselaw on these issues, I would not find the Tennessee laws repugnant to Mississippi's and, therefore, Tennessee law should govern a majority of the issues in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   \u00b6 52. To reiterate, Mississippi allows a wrongful-death claim be brought on behalf of a \"quick\" fetus, whereas Tennessee law permits wrongful-death claims for fetuses only deemed \"viable\" at the time of injury.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2011-7-13\">\n    Miss.

And as outlined by the majority, Mississippi's use of the term \"unborn quick child\" in Section 11-7-13 has been interpreted and defined by this Court as \"one that has developed so that it moves within the mother's womb,\" but is not yet \"viable.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    66 Fed.

Tennessee, however, sets the threshold at viability-which, under its wrongful-death statute, is defined as a fetus \"[having] achieved a stage of development wherein it could reasonably be expected to be capable of living outside the uterus.\" Tenn. Code \u00a7 20-5-106(d). Thus, while Tennessee maintains a heightened standard for wrongful-death claims brought on behalf of fetuses, it does not altogether bar such claims for relief. I find this to be an important distinction. Because Mississippi and Tennessee both allow such claims (albeit, under different standards), we should not hold that Tennessee's wrongful-death statute is repugnant, so as to violate our deeply ingrained public policies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zurich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8993099\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/920/427/#p437\">\n    920 So.2d at 437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   \u00b6 54. The majority, however, does just that. But \"repugnance,\" as defined within the conflict-of-laws context, differs from the version articulated by the majority. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Maj. Op. \u00b6 23) (defining repugnance as \"the relationship of contradictory terms: inconsistency.\"). Indeed, repugnance requires more than mere inconsistencies. Rather, in this context, repugnance\n   has been defined as violating \"some fundamental principle of justice, some prevalent conception of morals, some deep-seated tradition of the common weal.\"\n   <em>\n    Loucks v.

At bottom, Tennessee's wrongful-death statute should apply to its citizens, however unfortunate that result may be on these facts. Doing such would further the\n   <em>\n    Restatement (Second)\n   </em>\n   's goal of fostering interstate comity, while also curbing forum shopping. Today's result, however, undermines these goals.

So, under each state's scheme, an injured party may recover-up to a certain level-even when that injured party contributed to the negligent action. Comparative-negligence schemes, however, are in stark contrast to the doctrine of contributory negligence, which bars an injured party's right to recover should the party be even one percent at fault.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mitchell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9802955\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/211/509/\">\n    211 So.2d at 510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   \u00b6 57. In that vein, Plaintiffs (and the majority to an extent) rely on\n   <em>\n    Mitchell\n   </em>\n   to argue the repugnance of Tennessee's fault scheme, but such reliance is misguided. That is, while the\n   <em>\n    Mitchell\n   </em>\n   Court rejected application of the contributory-negligence doctrine, thus finding it repugnant to Mississippi's deeply ingrained public policy, it did so in light of\n   <em>\n    Mississippi's\n   </em>\n   superior interests in that case and the effect the doctrine would have upon\n   <em>\n    Mississippi residents\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9802955\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/211/509/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9802955\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/211/509/\">\n    at 510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n   <em>\n    Mitchell\n   </em>\n   , like this case, involved a vehicular collision in a state other than the parties' state of domicile-that is, the collision occurred in Louisiana, while all parties were from Mississippi.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9802955\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/211/509/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Finding that Mississippi residents would be denied recovery due to Louisiana's doctrine of contributory negligence, this Court rejected application of Louisiana's law.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9802955\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/211/509/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   \u00b6 58. But the rationale justifying the\n   <em>\n    Mitchell\n   </em>\n   Court's rejection of a foreign law is not present here, because here, Tennessee has the most significant relationship to the parties, claims, and defenses. In fact, Mississippi has but a fortuitous interest in this case. And so, while Plaintiffs would be entitled greater leeway under Mississippi's pure comparative-fault scheme, that alone is not enough to reject Tennessee's superior interests in applying its own modified comparative-fault rules to its own citizens, and to those doing business in its state-which includes all the parties here. To that end, Tennessee expressly has outlined its policy stance on this issue, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   [W]e nevertheless decline to abandon totally our fault-based tort system. We do not agree that a party should necessarily be able to recover in tort even though he may be 80, 90, or 95 percent at fault. We therefore reject the pure form of comparative fault ....

Thus, Tennessee's fault scheme can and should be applied, notwithstanding the application of Mississippi's Rules of the Road.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fells v.

So, having found that Tennessee has the superior interest as to the issues raised in this appeal, I would hold that Tennessee's substantive laws should govern-and because the respective laws are not repugnant, so as to require their rejection, I would affirm the circuit court's judgment as to the issues outlined above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Application of the Most-Significant-Relationship Test to Plaintiffs' Contract-Based Issues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   \u00b6 60. Plaintiffs' claims against Church Mutual are contractual in nature, as they sought UIM benefits under the policy issued by Church Mutual to Mt. Vernon. And so, in its same order holding that Tennessee substantive law would govern as to Plaintiffs' negligence claims, the circuit court also held that Tennessee law would control Plaintiffs' contractual claims. The circuit court held such by applying Sections 6, 188, and 193 of the\n   <em>\n    Restatement (Second)\n   </em>\n   . Section 188 governs contractual issues generally, while Section 193 addresses more specifically \"the uninsured[-]motorist feature of a liability insurance contract[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Boardman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7621245\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/470/1024/#p1031\">\n    470 So.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1033 ;\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Restatement (Second) Conflict of Laws\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 188, 193.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   \u00b6 61. Because of the circuit court's holding, Tennessee's UIM motorist statute, Tennessee Code Section 56-7-1201 (2017), applied. And so, Section 56-7-1201, by effect, incorporated Tennessee Code Section 56-7-1206(d) (2017), which pertains to service of process by injured parties on uninsured motorists and its effect on whether a direct action may be maintained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   \u00b6 62. To begin, I find it noteworthy that Plaintiffs concede Tennessee's substantive UIM principles govern Church Mutual's policy at issue here, including Tennessee's statutes, regulations, and caselaw.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fleming v. Yi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11795688\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/982/868/#p870\">\n    982 S.W.2d 868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 870 (Tenn. App. 1998) (holding that, as a matter of law, all of Tennessee's UIM statutes become provisions of all automobile insurance policies issued for delivery in Tennessee). So it would appear the circuit court's holding as to Plaintiffs' contractual claims against Church Mutual is a nonissue-however, Plaintiffs and the majority later claim that Plaintiffs\n   <em>\n    can\n   </em>\n   maintain a direct action against Church Mutual, which refutes directly the plain language of Section 56-7-1206(d). While the majority agrees with the Plaintiffs, I do not. As such, I address first the circuit court's conclusion that Tennessee law governed Plaintiffs' contractual claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     Restatement (Second)\n    </em>\n    Section 188\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   \u00b6 63. Under Section 188(2), this Court looks to contacts such as \"(a) the place of contracting, (b) the place of negotiation of the contract, (c) the place of performance, (d) the location of the subject matter of the contract, and (e) the domicile, residence, nationality, place of incorporation, and place of business of the parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Restatement (Second) Conflict of Laws\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 188. And, more specifically, Section 193 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-135\">\n   The validity of a contract of fire, surety or casualty insurance and the rights created thereby are determined by the local law of the state which the parties understood was to be\n   <em>\n    the principal location of the insured risk during the term of the policy\n   </em>\n   , unless with respect to the particular issue, some other state has a more significant relationship under the principles stated in \u00a7 6 to the transaction and the parties, in which event the local law of the other state will be applied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   <em>\n    Restatement (Second) Conflict of Laws\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 193 (emphasis added). As this Court in\n   <em>\n    Boardman\n   </em>\n   held, \"[t]he central thrust of Restatement \u00a7 193 is that the law applicable in actions on insurance contracts (other than those providing life insurance) should [be] the law of the state the parties understood was to be the principal location of the risk.\"\n   <em>\n    Boardman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7621245\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/470/1024/#p1031\">\n    470 So.2d at 1033\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   \u00b6 64. In applying these provisions, I find that the circuit court correctly concluded that Tennessee law governed Plaintiffs' contractual claims. As articulated by the circuit court regarding the contacts under Section 188, both the place of contracting and the place of negotiation were in Tennessee; the contract was substantially performed in Tennessee; the subject matter of the contract (Mt. Vernon's vehicle) was principally garaged in Tennessee; and lastly, we know that the domicile, residence, and place of business of the parties is Tennessee. Thus, Section 188 weighs entirely in favor of Tennessee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   \u00b6 65. As for Section 193, the \"principal location of the insured risk\" in this case must be Tennessee-as the policy before us was issued and delivered in Tennessee, to a citizen of Tennessee, for the coverage of a vehicle principally garaged in Tennessee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Boardman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7621245\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/470/1024/#p1031\">\n    470 So.2d at 1033\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, I would affirm the circuit court's holding and find that Tennessee law governs the parties' contractual claims and defenses. That being so, I now address the effect of Tennessee's UIM statutes on Plaintiffs' claims against Church Mutual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Tennessee Code Section 56-7-1206(d)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   \u00b6 66. As a general matter, Tennessee's UIM statutes bar direct actions against insurers for UIM benefits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Griffin v. Shelter Mut. Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11505457\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/18/195/#p199\">\n    18 S.W.3d 195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 199 (Tenn. 2000) (holding \"a plaintiff generally may not institute a direct action against an uninsured motorist carrier\"). Thus, \"[a]bsent a specific policy provision authorizing a direct action, the uninsured motorist statute does not permit a plaintiff to bring suit directly against an uninsured motorist carrier.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11505457\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/18/195/#p199\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11505457\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/18/195/#p199\">\n    at 198\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But one exception to Tennessee's general bar on direct actions is found under Section 56-7-1206(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   \u00b6 67. Section 56-7-1206(d) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   In the event that service of process against the uninsured motorist, which was issued to the motorist's last known address, is returned by the sheriff or other process server marked,\n   <em>\n    \"Not to be found in my county,\" or words to that effect\n   </em>\n   , ... the service of process against the uninsured motorist carrier, pursuant to this section, shall be sufficient for the court to require the insurer to proceed as if it is the only defendant in the case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Tenn.

And in light of this Court's articulation in\n   <em>\n    Zurich\n   </em>\n   , I cannot find such a result repugnant to Mississippi's deeply ingrained public policies-considering especially Mississippi's inferior interest in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zurich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8993099\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/920/427/#p437\">\n    920 So.2d at 437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   \u00b6 69. The majority, however, finds otherwise. Instead, it holds that, because Mississippi's\n   <em>\n    general rule\n   </em>\n   allowing direct actions against UIM carriers is similar to Tennessee's\n   <em>\n    exception\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs' direct action is permitted. (Maj. Op. \u00b6\u00b6 33-36) (emphasis added). I find this conclusion untenable, as it ignores the plain language of Section 56-7-1206(d). Section 56-7-1206(d) is clear and should be applied as written. Again, Johnson properly was dismissed because Plaintiffs failed to serve him timely under Rule 4(h). The Plaintiffs' summons was returned as \"unclaimed.\" Therefore, Plaintiffs cannot pursue a direct action against Church Mutual because the returned summons failed to state \" '[n]ot to be found in my county,' or words to that effect[.]\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Liput\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7092936\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/405/664/#p675\">\n    405 S.W.3d at 675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
