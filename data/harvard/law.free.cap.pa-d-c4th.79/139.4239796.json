Defendant filed preliminary objections claiming this medical monitoring action is barred by the exclusivity provisions of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Action. No Pennsylvania court has ever ruled on the question of whether a medical monitoring claim must or even may be presented through workmen\u2019s compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act exclusivity provision states: \u201cThe liability of an employer under this act shall be exclusive and in place of any and all other liability to such employe[e]s.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As per injuries, the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act says: \u201cInjury and personal injury, as used in this act, shall be construed to mean an injury to an employe[e], regardless \u00f3f his previous physi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>cal condition, arising in the course of his employment and related thereto, and such disease or infection as naturally results from the injury or is aggravated, reactivated or accelerated by the injury.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although the Supreme Court has never directly approached the topic, some cases are informative regarding the definition of what constitutes an \u201cinjury\u201d under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. In <em>Creighan v. Firemen\u2019s Relief and Pension Fund Board, </em>397 Pa 419, 155 A.2d 844 (1959), a fireman filed an action in mandamus against defendant for pension benefits because he contracted tuberculosis as a result of his duties and subsequently became totally disabled. The Supreme Court emphasized that the \u201cword \u2018injury,\u2019 in ordinary modem usage, is one <em>of very broad designa</em>tion\u201d and defined the term \u201cinjury\u201d contained in section 411 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act as including \u201cwhatever lesion or change in any part of the system produces harm or pain, or a lessened facility of the natural use of any bodily activity or capability.\u201d The Supreme Court in <em>Creighan </em>further elaborated that the word injury\u2019s \u201ccommon and approved usage extends to and includes any hurtful or damaging effect which may be suffered by anyone.\u201d Quoting the precise language of <em>Creighan, </em>the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania reaffirmed this broad definition of \u201cinjury\u201d in <em>Pawlosky </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, </em>514 Pa. 450, 525 A.2d 1204 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">The only relevant appellate decision offering the possibility of medical monitoring payments pursuant to the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act is <em>Jackson Township Volunteer Fire Company </em>v. <em>W.C.A.B. (Wallet), </em>140 Pa. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>Commw. 620, 594 A.2d 826 (1991). The plaintiff, an ambulance attendant, was exposed to blood and bodily fluids infected with the AIDS virus and hepatitis B during his employment. At the direction of a physician, the plaintiff had a series of tests to detect for AIDS and hepatitis B and received precautionaiy injections to kill the hepatitis virus. The fire company and its insurer denied his claim for reimbursement for medical costs incurred. The Workers\u2019 Compensation referee required payment. The Commonwealth Court affirmed the referee\u2019s decision, holding that the fire company should pay for the tests and immunizations because \u201cpersons exposed to a serious risk of contracting a disease which is commonly known to be highly contagious/infectious and potentially deadly, have been \u2018injured\u2019 for the purpose of receiving compensation under the Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 625, 594 A.2d at 828. The court specifically noted that \u201conly those persons exposed to a real and serious risk of contracting highly contagious/infectious and potentially deadly diseases are entitled to compensation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 625-26, 594 A.2d at 829.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">While not involving either a contagious or infectious disease, the issue concerning the medical monitoring claims presented in the present case can be analyzed by the logic of the <em>Jackson </em>decision. The class members herein claim that exposure to toxic agents in the workplace has made them \u201cat risk for developing brain cancer\u201d and therefore a specific medical regimen they label \u201cmedical monitoring\u201d is medically warranted. They claim that an elevated rate of glioblastoma at the Spring House Research Facility has resulted in 12 employees being diagnosed with malignant brain cancer. The plaintiffs\u2019 claims are precisely analogous to the claims in <em>Jackson </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>where occupational exposure to toxic blood made the plaintiff at risk for developing AIDS and hepatitis B. The proactive medical testing and precautionary preventative emergency room care provided to the plaintiff in <em>Jackson </em>was covered by workers\u2019 compensation because it was necessitated by his occupational exposure to diseased blood. Similarly, the medical monitoring and preventative tests that plaintiffs in this case need are exclusively the result of their occupational exposure to toxic agents at the Spring House Research Facility. The Commonwealth Court in <em>Jackson </em>held that such preventative testing, as is needed by the plaintiffs here, is an injury under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Thus, as to all former employees, medical monitoring costs to detect and prevent the spread of brain cancer is an injury which is compensable under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s preliminary objections are sustained with leave by plaintiffs to file a workmen\u2019s compensation claim and the above captioned matter is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b154-9\">.77 P.S. \u00a7481.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b155-6\">. 77 P.S. \u00a7411.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b157-7\">. The court notes that there may be a distinction between present employees, who are continuing to be exposed to the toxic agents, and former employees who are presumably no longer exposed to any substances in the workplace. However, since the two representative plaintiffs are both former employees, this potential distinction is irrelevant. A class action may not proceed without a named plaintiff whose claims are representative of the class claims. Pa. R.C.P. 1702(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
