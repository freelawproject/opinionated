(General) is bound under an insurance policy issued by it to defend D \u2019Amico against claims of two defendants named Pfeffer, asserted by them (as plaintiffs) in an action in the Superior Court (Suffolk, Law No. 531,446). The ease was heard in the Superior Court upon a statement of \u201call the facts material to the issues.\u201d The trial judge concluded that the insurance policy covered \u201cthe damages claimed by the . . . Pfeffers\u201d and that General is bound to defend D \u2019Amico in the Superior Court action. A final decree made declarations in accordance with these conclusions. General appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">On August 6, 1957, D\u2019Amico made a contract with the city of Boston \u201cfor the widening and paving of\u201d Burley Street. In October, 1957, D\u2019Amico\u2019s employees started work \u201cas directed by the engineer . . . for the [c]ity . . . [who] established the side line on Burley Street and set stakes for D \u2019Amico to follow. \u2019 \u2019 D \u2019Amico then <em>11 </em>excavated to the line . . . set by the engineer in accordance with the line of taking by eminent domain, leaving a vertical wall of earth varying in height from . . . [zero] to . . . [six] feet above . . . the street adjoining the property of the Pfeffers [who owned two lots on Burley Street]. There were three large trees near the excavation located on the Pfeffer land .... Due to the . . . excavation along the line established by the engineer\u2019s stakes . . . roots of the trees . . . were uncovered. The [c]ity engineer determined that . . . the trees and the vertical wall . . . [were] unsafe and . . . re-stake [d] another line northerly of the original line and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>ordered D \u2019Amico\u2019s employees to cut the vertical hank back at 45\u00b0 and to remove the trees. It is disputed whether . . . D\u2019Amico had knowledge that the restaked area was outside the eminent domain taking and whether\u00bb. . . [the] Pfeifers gave permission to the [c]ity of Boston to enter upon the restaked area. D\u2019Amico . . . [cut] back the bank . . . [and cut] down the trees on the Pfeifers\u2019 land . . .. [D\u2019Amico\u2019s] work . . . under the contract was . . . accepted and D\u2019Amico was paid by the [c]ity . . . for this work in accordance with the unit price established under its contract . . .. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">About one year later D\u2019Amico and the city were made defendants in the action at law, mentioned above, in which the Pfeifers claim \u201cdamages caused by the alleged unlawful entry upon their land and the wrongful cutting down and carrying away of three trees and excavating and carrying away . . . earth and fill.\u201d Count 2 of the declaration in this action seeks treble damages under G. L. c. 242, \u00a7 7.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">General \u201chad issued a policy of insurance known as a Manufacturer\u2019s and Contractor\u2019s Schedule Liability Policy to . . . D\u2019Amico.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On November 27, 1958, General \u201cwrote a so-called \u2018reservation of rights\u2019 letter to D\u2019Amico in which it proffered to defend the case subject to its right to disclaim later .... D\u2019Amico did not object to this arrangement. . . . [0]n December 23,1959, counsel for General . . . advised D\u2019Amico\u2019s . . . counsel . . . that coverage was being disclaimed . . . and that General . . . was going to withdraw . . .. \u201d Thereafter D \u2019Amico\u2019s own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>counsel entered Ms appearance. The law action has not been tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">The policy provided insurance \u2018 \u2018 only with respect to . . . so many . . . coverages ... as are indicated by specific premium . . . charges.\u201d Under coverage \u201cB. Property Damage Liability\u201d in division \u201c1. Premises-Operations\u201d was shown a premium. The description of hazards under \u201c1. Premises-Operations\u2019\u2019 said merely, \u201cSee Schedule Attached.\u201d General agreed under coverage \u201cB. Property Damage Liability\u201d that it would \u201cpay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of injury to . . . property . . . <em>caused by accident </em>and arising out of the hazards hereinafter defined\u201d (emphasis supplied). Division \u201c1. Premises-Operations\u201d was defined as \u201c [t]he . . . use of premises, and all operations.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under the heading, \u201cII Defense, Settlement, Supplementary Payments,\u201d it was provided, \u201cWith respect to such insurance as is afforded . . . for property damage liability, the company shall: (a) defend any suit against the insured alleging such injury . . . and seeking damages on account thereof, even if such suit is groundless .... (b) . . . (2) pay all expenses incurred by the company, all costs ... in any such suit and all interest on the entire . . . judgment,\u201d subject to limitations not here relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">1. General contends that \u201ceven if D\u2019Amico committed the trespass under a mistake,\u201d the injury to the Pfeifers\u2019 property was not \u201ccaused by accident\u201d and that consequently, it did not arise \u201cout of hazards . . . defined\u201d in the policy. \u2018 \u2018Accident, \u2019 \u2019 as used in a somewhat comparable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>policy, has been said to be \u201ca more comprehensive term than negligence, and in its common signification ... [to mean] an unexpected happening without intention or design.\u201d See <em>Sheehan </em>v. <em>Goriansky, </em>321 Mass. 200, 205, holding that liability arising out of wanton or reckless conduct, as opposed to wilful or intentional conduct, was within the \u201cguest\u201d coverage of a motor vehicle liability policy insuring against \u201cliability . . . because of bodily injury . . . caused by accident.\u201d In <em>New England Gas &amp; Elec. Assn. </em>v. <em>Ocean Acc. &amp; Guar. Corp. </em>330 Mass. 640, 643, 650-657, the \u201cevent insured against was the sudden and accidental deforming ... of ... [a] turbine,\u201d which seems to have been brought about by the missetting of certain springs about one year before the injury. This court said (pp. 651-653), \u201cThe coverage was not limited to accidental means as distinguished from accidental results .... Although the setting of the springs was done voluntarily and knowingly by those who set them, they did not do so with any deliberate purpose or intent to damage the turbine. . . . The term accident . . . should be given its ordinary meaning as denoting an unexpected, undesigned, and unintended happening or a mishap and as including an event which, according to the common understanding of people in general, would rightly be considered as an accident.\u201d Recovery was allowed. See <em>Dow </em>v. <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co. </em>297 Mass. 34, 38, where the insured\u2019s death from burns was caused by immersion in a bathtub of scalding water. \u201cDoubtless the insured intended to turn on the water and ... to get into the tub, but it is . . . highly improbable that he intended to Immerse himself in scalding water. ... [T]he jury could well find that the scalding resulted from unusual or unexpected heat in the water or from some slip, mistake or false judgment ... as to the physical factors\u201d and hence that it was accidental.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\"><em>Haynes </em>v. <em>American Cas. Co. </em>228 Md. 394, arose under policy provisions closely similar to those in the present ease. During excavation work a contractor pointed out the property line within which work was to be done. His em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>ployees by mistake encroached upon adjacent property and cut down forty-eight trees. In the circumstances the damage was held to have been \u201ccaused by accident.\u201d Despite the fact that the physical acts were intentional and voluntory, they were viewed as causing damage unforeseen by the actor and hence within the insurance coverage. A somewhat comparable case is <em>Cross </em>v. <em>Zurich Gen. Acc. &amp; Liab. Ins. Co. </em>184 F. 2d 609, 610-611 (7th Cir.). There damage was held to have been\u2018\u2018 caused by accidents, \u2019 \u2019 where the insured\u2019s employees intentionally used acid in a solutian for washing windows in a strength which caused unintended damage, in part at least because of insufficient precautions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Thomason </em>v. <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co. </em>248 F. 2d 417, 419 (5th Cir.), but see Judge Bives\u2019s dissent at pp. 419-421.</p>\n<p id=\"A_t\">General places some reliance on cases holding that certain policies do not cover an insured for a deliberate and intentional assault upon another person. See <em>Sontag </em>v. <em>Galer, </em>279 Mass. 309, 313; <em>Bowen </em>v. <em>Lloyds Underwriters, </em>339 Mass. 627, 629. In the <em>Sontag </em>case, this court said, \u201cWe do not adopt the contention . . . that an injury is accidentally sustained merely because it may be accidental from the plaintiff\u2019s standpoint. It is the state of the \u2018will of the person by whose agency . . . [the injury] was caused\u2019 rather than that of the injured person which determines whether an injury was accidental. . . . [A] n injury caused by the <em>wilful and deliberate </em>act of the insured . . . is one for which the . . . company would not be liable . . . under the policy. The policy does not purport to protect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>the insured from her own <em>intentional and malicious </em>acts\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">The assault cases do not require us<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to treat D\u2019Amico\u2019s trespass as \u201cintentional and malicious.\u201d No fact agreed would warrant the conclusion that the trespass occurred with malice or intent to injure another. It could be inferred from the agreed facts that it was based on a mishap or mistake of a type which in the words of the <em>New England Gas &amp; Elec. Assn. </em>case (330 Mass. 640, 653) \u201caccording to the common understanding . . . would rightly be considered as an accident. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">The authorities just cited lead us to the conclusion that trespass by D \u2019Amico by mistake, or without actual intent to invade property upon which it knew it was not entitled to carry on work under its contract, would be \u201ccaused by accident\u201d within the policy. The declaration in the law action was broad enough (see <em>Berke Moore Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co., ante, </em>66, 70; cf. <em>Fessenden Sch. Inc. </em>v. <em>American Mut. Liab. Ins. Co. </em>289 Mass. 124, 127-130; <em>Stout </em>v. <em>Grain Dealers Mut. Ins. Co. </em>307 F. 2d 521, 524-525 [4th Cir.]) to permit the Pfeffers to recover for such a trespass. Accordingly, we hold that it was General\u2019s duty under the policy to defend D \u2019Amico.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">In reaching this conclusion we are aided by the principle that doubts about ambiguous insurance policy provisions are to be resolved against the insurance company. See <em>Schroeder </em>v. <em>Federal Ins. Co. </em>343 Mass. 472, 475. <em>Joseph E. Bennett Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. </em>344 Mass. 99, 103. It was open to General by explicit provision to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>have excluded liability for trespass by mistake, although some question might then have arisen whether the policy, with such an exclusion, would have satisfied the requirements of the city contract (see fn. 3, <em>supra). </em>The same principle of interpretation leads us to conclude that \u201cclearing of right of way . . . [and] excavation\u201d was not excluded from the coverage under item 23 of the extension schedule. Such work, we conclude, was comprised in the coverage for \u201cstreet . . . surfacing.\u201d The highly ambiguous parenthetical matter in item 23 (see fn. 4, <em>supra) </em>we view as merely stating that a separate rate was to be charged for these operations if such operations were to be undertaken in connection with street surfacing. See <em>Crook </em>v. <em>Kalamazoo Sales &amp; Serv. Inc. </em>82 R. I. 387, 394. Cf. <em>Clauss </em>v. <em>Americcm Auto. &amp; Ins. Co. </em>175 F. Supp. 641, 643-644 (E. D. Pa.). The circumstance (see fn. 4, <em>supra), </em>that the policy provided that the premiums shown on the declarations were to be \u201cestimated\u201d premiums only, lends support to our conclusion! This provision suggests that, if the work of street paving turned out unexpectedly to involve excavation, upon audit of the policy after the work was done, it would be open to General then to charge the correct premium, if it had not originally been charged. If it had been General\u2019s intention to exclude excavation and clearing of right of way from the coverage, Item <em># </em>23, \u201cStreet or Road Paving,\u201d that should have been clearly expressed as an exclusion from coverage. See <em>MacArthur </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Hosp. Serv. Inc. </em>343 Mass. 670, 672.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">2. General asserts that G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 47, Sixth (b), as amended through St. 1945, c. 436, and St. 1951, c. 73,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> prohibits the coverage for which D \u2019Amico contends. Although (see <em>Everett </em>v. <em>Canton, </em>303 Mass. 166,169) a trespasser is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>\u201cwrongdoer,\u201d we see in cl. Sixth no sufficient indication of any legislative intention that insurance companies shall not insure against property damage arising from trespass by mistake. Such a trespass is not within the statutory language, \u20181 deliberate or intentional crime or wrongdoing. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">3. General asserts that in any event it is not bound to defend or indemnify D\u2019Amico against liability for treble damages under G. L. c. 242, \u00a7 7 (see fn. 2, <em>supra). </em>As already indicated, General is bound to defend D\u2019Amico against the Pfeifers\u2019 claims under this section because their declaration in the law action asserts claims which may be found to have been \u201c caused by accident. \u2019 \u2019 Of course, upon trial of the law action, it may be established that D \u2019Amico (a) knew that the city was not authorized to disturb the Pfeifers\u2019 land and trees, and (b) proceeded to carry out the city engineer\u2019s instructions in wilful disregard of that knowledge. Of. <em>Moskow </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>318 Mass. 76, 78-79. It would then be open to General to contend that it has no obligation to indemnify D\u2019Amico against the Pfeifers\u2019 claims. Because this record does not show the extent of D\u2019Amico\u2019s knowledge, the trial judge was not, and we are not, in a position to declare the extent of General\u2019s obligation to indemnify D\u2019Amico.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The final decree thus is too broad in declaring that General\u2019s policy \u201ccover[s] the damages claimed by the . . . Pfeifers up to the limits of the insurance. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">4. The final decree is reversed and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. A new final decree is to be entered declaring (a) that General\u2019s policy affords coverage to D\u2019Amico for the property damage caused by any trespass upon the Pfeifers\u2019 land committed by D\u2019Amico by mistake and without design to cause tortious injury to the Pfeifers, and (b) that no determination can appropriately be made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>on this record of the extent of General\u2019s obligation to indemnify D \u2019Amico against liability for property damage inflicted by D\u2019Amico if it shall be shown that D\u2019Amico had knowledge (1) that the restaked area was outside the eminent domain taking and (2) that the Pfeifers had not given the city permission to enter upon the restaked area. The new final decree shall embody the substance of par. 2 of the final decree here reviewed (declaring General\u2019s obligation to defend D\u2019Aonico in the law action). In the discretion of the Superior Court, (a) entry of a final decree after rescript may await the final determination of the issues in the law action or may be delayed until the issues in that action have been determined in further hearings in this proceeding (see G. L. c. 231A, \u00a7 1, inserted by St. 1945, c. 582, \u00a7 1), or (b) in the final decree the Superior Court may retain jurisdiction to resolve any issues left open between General and D \u2019Amico after disposition of the law action. In any event a suitable decree may be entered in the Superior Court to provide for the representation of D\u2019Amico at General\u2019s expense (in connection with the determination of the issues raised in the law action) by counsel independent of General (see <em>Newcomb </em>v. <em>Meiss, </em>263 Minn. 315, 322; cf. <em>Stout </em>v. <em>Grain Dealers Mut. Ins. Co. </em>307 F. 2d 521, 523-525 [4th Cir.]) and for the payment by General of any expenses heretofore or hereafter caused to D\u2019Amico by General\u2019s refusal to comply with its obligation to defend D\u2019Amico. D \u2019Amico is to have costs of this appeal.

This provision was probably designed to avoid the principle of eases like the <em>Sontag </em>ease, 279 Mass. 309. The reasons for the insurer\u2019s failure to make a similar explicit provision with respect to claims based on the different tort of trespass are whoUy obscure. Trespass may occur from an intrusion by mistake (see Restatement: Torts, \u00a7 164; Prosser, Torts [2d ed.] \u00a7 17) even if it results from a voluntary act. See <em>United Elec. Light Co. v.

Such a trespass by mistake is distinguishable in quality from an intentional assault.
