L. e. 272, \u00a7\u00a7 28C-28G (inserted by St. 1945, c. 278, \u00a7 1<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>), against a book by Henry Miller, \u201cTropic of Cancer\u201d (Tropic), published by Grove Press, Inc. (Grove). Answers were filed by Grove, Miller, and other interveners, alleging that c. 272, \u00a7\u00a7 28C through 28H, \u201cas applied herein . . . violate rights of the intervenor[s] guaranteed ... by the . . . Constitution of the United States,\u201d under the First Amendment, \u201cas embraced in the Fourteenth Amendment,\u201d and under the Constitution of the Commonwealth, Part I, arts. 10, 12, and 16. The case was heard by a judge of the Superior Court, who made a report of material facts. A final decree was entered adjudging Tropic to be \u201cobscene.\u201d The interveners appealed. The evidence is reported. The trial judge made the findings summarized below.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-10\">c 1 The book was first published in Paris in 1934. The first publication in the United States was on June 24, 1961.\u201d Its distribution in Massachusetts was enjoined on July 24, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>1961. \u201cThere is no connected plot .... It is largely a tale of the sex experiences of an American . . . [who went to] Paris ... in the hope of becoming a writer, and who, except on a few occasions, lived the life of a down-andonter, sponging on friends .... It graphically describes sex episodes with almost minute detail. It is in many respects filthy, disgusting, nauseating and offensive to good taste. As one favorable review, which was introduced in evidence, put it, \u2018Now it must be granted that parts of \u201cTropic of Cancer\u201d will hammer away at some of the strongest of stomachs.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">The book, several book reviews, and some advertising were in evidence. \u201cPersons who qualified as literary experts testified.\u201d The trial judge stated that he was \u201cirresistibly led to the conclusion that the book is obscene, indecent and impure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">1. The opinion testimony is significant principally in that it discloses that competent critics entertain (and, in some cases, have entertained since 1934) the view that Tropic has great literary merit despite its repulsive features. Because the only important evidence is documentary, we are in essentially the same position as the trial judge, and \u201cmay draw our own inferences . . . from the basic facts . . . without deference to any inferences . . . drawn by the trial judge. \u2019 \u2019 See <em>Corkum </em>v. <em>Salvation Army of Mass. Inc. </em>340 Mass. 165,166-167. See also <em>Skil Corp. </em>v. <em>Barnet, </em>337 Mass. 485, 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">2. The issue \u2018 \u2018 is whether the \u2019 \u2019 material can \u2018 * reasonably and constitutionally be found to be obscene.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moniz, </em>338 Mass. 442, 443 (motion picture). The interveners \u201cconcede that the statute covers all material that is obscene in the constitutional sense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">In <em>Roth </em>v. <em>United States, </em>354 U. S. 476, 488-489, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>majority rejected the test of obscenity in <em>Regina </em>v. <em>Hicklin, </em>L. R. 3 Q. B. 360 (1868), and pointed out that later decisions have sought to determine \u201cwhether to the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to prurient interest. \u2019 \u2019 Material \u2018 \u2018 appealing to prurient interest \u2019 \u2019 was defined as \u201cmaterial having a tendency to excite lustful thoughts\u201d (354 U. S. 476, 487, fn. 20) and was equated to the definition of obscenity in A. L. I., Model Penal Code, \u00a7 207.10 (2) (Tent. Draft No. 6, 1957).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The <em>Roth </em>case recognized that there is constitutional protection (354 U. S. 476, 484) for works containing \u201cideas having even the slightest redeeming social importance \u2014 unorthodox ideas, controversial ideas, even ideas hateful to the prevailing climate of opinion \u2014 [which] have the full protection of the [First Amendment] guaranties, unless excludable because they encroach upon the limited area of more important interests.\u201d The court, however, stated (p. 485) that \u201cimplicit in the history of the First Amendment is the rejection of obscenity as utterly without redeeming social importance\u201d and that \u201cobscenity is not within the area of constitutionally protected speech or press.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>The <em>Roth </em>opinions discuss \u201cobscenity\u201d on a highly theoretical basis. Indeed, the court said (354 U. S. 476, 481, fn. 8), \u201cNo issue is presented . . . concerning the obscenity of the material.\u201d See Lockhart and McClure, Censorship of Obscenity: The Developing Constitutional Standards, 45 Minn. L. Rev. (hereinafter cited Lockhart) pp. 49-58.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At least the Chief Justice (see his concurring opinion, 354 U. S. 476, 496) thought that he was dealing with \u201cthe commercial exploitation of the morbid and shameful craving for materials with prurient effect.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Some principles have been established by the <em>Roth </em>case, as applied in the <em>Moniz </em>case, 338 Mass. 442, 445-450. (1) Hard core, commercial pornography, \u201cutterly without redeeming social importance\u201d (see 354 U. S. 476, 484-485), is not within the protection of the First Amendment. (2) \u201cThe portrayal of sex, e.g., in art, literature and scientific works, is not itself sufficient reason to deny material the constitutional protection of freedom of speech and press\u201d (354 U. S. 476, 487-488). (3) \u201c [W]hether a particular work is . . . [obscene] involves not ... an issue of fact but a question of constitutional <em>judgment </em>of the most sensitive . . . kind.\u201d See Mr. Justice Harlan\u2019s separate opinion, 354 U. S. 476, 497-498; the <em>Moniz </em>case, 338 Mass. 442, 446-447. (4) Material (see 354 U. S. 488-489) must be judged by its effect upon the <em>\u201caverage </em>person\u201d (not susceptible persons or youths) and by whether the <em>\u201cdominant theme </em>of the material <em>taken as a whole </em>appeals</p>\n<p id=\"b58-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>to prurient interest\u201d (emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (5) \u201c[A] work may not be adjudged obscene only because\u201d objectionable \u201cto many citizens as violative of accepted standards of propriety.\u201d See the <em>Moniz </em>case, 338 Mass. 442, 445. Apart from these principles, what the Supreme Court means by \u201cobscenity\u201d must be determined by what it has done in other eases.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">(a) In <em>Kingsley Books, Inc. </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>354 U. S. 436, the New York courts (see 1 N. Y. 2d 177, 180, affirming 208 Misc. [N. Y.] 150, 158-159) were sustained in enjoining distribution of fourteen booklets, \u201cNights of Horror,\u201d clearly hard core pornography. The Supreme Court assumed that the books were obscene and that only the issue of the constitutionality of the testing statute was before it (see p. 439).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">(b) In four per curiam decisions (October term, 1957) the Supreme Court reversed decisions of Federal courts of appeal which had treated several different types of material as obscene. See <em>Times Film Corp. </em>v. <em>Chicago, </em>355 U. S. 35 (revg. 244 F. 2d 432, 436 [7th Cir.] on a film dealing with the seduction of a sixteen year old boy by an older woman, and other \u201cillicit sexual intimacies and acts\u201d); <em>Mounce </em>v. <em>United States, </em>355 U. S. 180 (revg. 247 F. 2d 148 [9th Cir.] nudist publications; see <em>United States </em>v. <em>4200 Copies Intl. Journal, </em>134 F. Supp. 490 [E. D. Wash.]); <em>One, Inc. </em>v. <em>Olesen, </em>355 U. S. 371 (revg. 241 F. 2d 772 [9th Cir.] dealing with a post office order in respect of \u201c One \u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>The Homosexual Magazine\u201d); <em>Sunshine Book Co. </em>v. <em>Summerfield, </em>355 U. S. 372 (revg. 249 F. 2d 114 [Ct. App. D. C.] nudist material). See also the <em>Monis </em>case, 338 Mass. 442, 447 \u2014 449; Lockhart, pp. 32-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">(c) In <em>Kingsley Intl. Pictures Corp. </em>v. <em>Regents of the Univ. of N. Y. </em>360 U. S. 684, a New York decision (4 N. Y. 2d 349) was reversed which had sustained the denial of a license to show the film \u201cLady Chatterley\u2019s Lover.\u201d The majority did not consider whether the film was obscene (360 U. S. 684, 686), but said (at p. 688-689), \u201cWhat New York has done ... is to prevent the exhibition of a motion picture because that picture advocates an idea \u2014 that adultery under certain circumstances may be proper behavior. . . . [The First Amendment\u2019s] guarantee is not confined to the expression of ideas that are conventional or shared by a majority. It protects advocacy of the opinion that adultery may sometimes be proper, no less than advocacy of socialism or the single tax.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">(d) <em>Manual Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Day, </em>370 U. S. 478, reversing 289 F. 2d 455 (Ct. App. D. C.) (see fn. 3, <em>supra), </em>dealt (pp. 480-481) with a ruling of the Post Office Department barring from the mails magazines (\u201ctitled MANual, Trim, and Grecian Guild Pictorial\u201d) consisting \u201clargely of photographs of nude, or near-nude, male models\u201d; and containing \u201cadvertisements . . . offering nudist photographs for sale.\u201d See 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 1461 (fn. 5, <em>supra). </em>Mr. Justice Harlan\u2019s opinion (see fn. 8, <em>infra) </em>accepts (p. 481) findings that \u201c(1) the magazines . . . are composed primarily, if not exclusively, for homosexuals, and have no literary, scientific or other merit; [and] (2) they would appeal to the 6prurient interest\u2019 of such sexual deviates, but would not have any interest for sexually normal individuals.\u201d The Supreme Court on a diversity of grounds<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (six to one, two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>justices not participating) reversed the Court of Appeals decision which had sustained the post office order.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">The 1957 term per curiam decisions and the <em>Kingsley Intl. Pictures Corp. </em>case (360 U. S. 684) afford the best available indication of what material will not be treated as obscene by the Supreme Court. See <em>Grove Press, Inc. </em>v. <em>Christenberry, </em>175 F. Supp. 488, 501-502 (S. D. N. Y.) holding the book, \u201cLady Chatterley\u2019s Lover,\u201d not obscene, affd. 276 F. 2d 433, 438-439 (2d Cir.). Cf. <em>Eastman Kodak Co. </em>v. <em>Hendricks, </em>262 F. 2d 392, 395-397 (9th Cir.).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">The New York Court of Appeals has interpreted \u00a7 1141 of the New York Penal Law dealing with obscenity, as applying \u201conly to . . . \u2018hard-core pornography.\u2019 \u201d See <em>People </em>v. <em>Richmond County News, Inc. </em>9 N. Y. 2d 578, 586. Section 1141, says Judge Fuld, at p. 587, \u201cfocuses predominantly upon what is sexually morbid, grossly perverse and bizarre, without any artistic or scientific purpose or justification. \u2019 \u2019<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">The issue is where to draw the line between what the First Amendment protects and what is obscene in the constitutional sense. See Lockhart, pp. 58-68, 7A-77. The Supreme Court of the United States thus far, as Mr. Justice Harlan\u2019s opinion in the <em>Manual Enterprises </em>case indicates, has not drawn that line with precision. We, however, are confronted with litigation which should be decided under the law as it now stands, and it is our duty to draw that line as well as we can according to our best judgment of the dictates of the authoritative decisions. A majority of the court feel that we cannot properly evade that duty, even though (as the dissenting opinion points out) the <em>Both </em>case in some respects is a \u201cdim . . . beacon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b61-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>Referring to the three general categories of allegedly obscene material (fn. 5, <em>supra), </em>it appears that the Supreme Court already has treated some \u201cborderline entertainment\u201d material and works \u201cof serious . . . intent\u201d as not obscene. Hard core pornography (which involves a \u201ckind of \u2018pandering\u2019 \u201d or \u201ccommerce in the obscene,\u201d see Model Penal Code, Tent. Draft No. 6, pp. 13-17) is clearly obscene. The most difficult area is that of works which some persons reasonably believe to have literary merit but which, equally reasonably, may be even more objectional to others than \u201cLady Chatterley\u2019s Lover.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">We think, in the light of the decisions reviewed above, that the First Amendment protects material which has value because of ideas, news, or artistic, literary, or scientific attributes. If the appeal of material (taken as a whole) to adults is not predominantly prurient, adults cannot be denied the material. When the public risks of suppressing ideas are weighed against the risks of permitting their circulation, the guaranties of the First Amendment must be given controlling effect. The dangers of subjective judgments in the matter of censorship lead to a strong presupposition against suppression. We conclude, therefore, as in effect the New York court did in the <em>Richmond County News </em>case, that, with respect to material designed for general circulation, only predominantly \u201chard core\u201d pornography, without redeeming social significance, is obscene in the constitutional sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">The Attorney General relies largely on earlier Massachusetts decisions. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Isenstadt, </em>318 Mass. 543 (conviction for the sale of a book called \u201cStrange Fruit,\u201d under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 28, prior to its amendment by St. 1945, c. 278, \u00a7 1). <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>\u201cGod\u2019s Little Acre,\u201d </em>326 Mass. 281. These cases were decided, respectively, in 1945 and 1950, each several years before the decision in the <em>Roth </em>case. Compare <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>\u201cForever Amber,\u201d </em>323 Mass. 302, 309-310; <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>\u201cSerenade,\u201d </em>326 Mass. 324, also decided in 1950. The later Supreme Court cases, to the extent inconsistent with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>our earlier decisions, are controlling, of course, on constitutional issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">3. Whether Tropic is \u201cobscene\u201d in the constitutional sense thus depends upon whether the appeal (if any) of Tropic (taken as a whole) to the normal adult is predominantly prurient. It is not relevant that we think that the book at many places is repulsive, vulgar, and grossly offensive in the use of four letter words, and in the detailed and coarse statement of sexual episodes. That a serious work uses four letter words and has a grossly offensive tone does not mean that the work is not entitled to constitutional protection. Much in modern art, literature, and music is likely to seem ugly and thoroughly objectionable to those who have different standards of taste. It is not the function of judges to serve as arbiters of taste or to say that an author must regard vulgarity as unnecessary to his portrayal of particular scenes or characters or to establish particular ideas. Within broad limits each writer, attempting to be a literary artist, is entitled to determine such matters for himself, even if the result is as dull, dreary, and offensive as the writer of this opinion finds almost all of Tropic.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Competent critics assert, and we conclude, that Tropic has serious purpose,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> even if many will find that purpose obscure. There can be no doubt that a significant segment of the literary world has long regarded the book as of literary importance. A majority of the court are of opinion that the predominant effect and purpose of the book as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>whole is not prurient. If under the <em>Both </em>ease it be a relevant consideration, a majority of the court are of opinion that Tropic is more likely to discourage than \u201cto excite lustful thoughts.\u201d We think that the book must be accepted as a conscious effort to create a work of literary art<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and as having significance, which prevents treating it as hard core pornography. In reaching this conclusion, we have carefully considered all the aspects of the book upon which the dissenting justices and the trial judge have commented.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">This is not the first time that Tropic has run into censorship. In <em>Besig </em>v. <em>United States, </em>208 F. 2d 142 (9th Cir.), the court sustained a customs prohibition of its importation, relying (p. 146), however, upon something very close to the discredited <em>Hicklin </em>test of obscenity. A customs libel of the book by the United States, however, was recently withdrawn. See order of the United States District Court, Eastern District, New York, dated August 15, 1961, in evidence. Compare the discussion by Judge Murphy in <em>Upham </em>v. <em>Bill, </em>195 F. Supp. 5,10-11 (S. D. N. Y.). An unreported case <em>(Haiman </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>Illinois Superior Court, Cook County, February 21, 1962) has held the book not to be obscene. The Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas reached a contrary conclusion in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robin, </em>30 U. S. L. Week 2551 (dec. April 17, 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">We hold that Tropic is not \u201cobscene\u201d in the constitutional sense. It cannot constitutionally be held to be obscene under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7\u00a7 28C, 28E, and 28F. We rest our decision squarely on the First Amendment, so that, if review of our decision is sought, there may be no doubt that this case has been decided solely upon the Federal issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>4. We are not confronted with any question arising under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 28, as amended through St. 1948, c. 328, providing for prosecution for a sale to \u201ca person under the age of eighteen years [of] a book . . . which is obscene <em>... or manifestly tends to corrupt </em>the morals of youth\u201d (emphasis supplied). See <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Michigan, </em>352 U. S. 380, 382-384 (fn. 6, <em>supra). </em>See also <em>Prince </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>321 U. S. 158, 166-171; Lockhart and McClure, Obscenity Censorship, 7 Utah L. Rev. 289, 298-303. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Friede, </em>271 Mass. 318, 322-323.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">5. The final decree is reversed. A new decree is to be entered that the book \u201cTropic of Cancer\u201d is entitled to the protection of the First Amendment and cannot be held to be obscene under Gr. L. c. 272, \u00a7\u00a7 28C, 28E, and 28F.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">The Chief Justice and Justices Williams and Kirk cannot join in the foregoing opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">The majority, in expressing deference to some very recent decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States, particularly <em>Roth </em>v. <em>United States, </em>354 U. S. 476, declare that G. L. c. 272, \u00a7\u00a7 28C, 28E, and 28F, as applied to this book are repugnant to the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. The <em>Roth </em>case, as we read, is not clear authority to this extent, and as presently applied, is too dim a beacon by which to guess a course.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The onus of the present majority result should rest upon the court which decided the <em>Roth </em>case. If a majority of the members of that tribunal should be of the opinion that the people of Massachusetts constitutionally cannot be deprived of access to this item of reading material, we believe that they should be given the specific opportunity so to state.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">The book is pitched at the nadir of scatology. Indeed, its low level is relied upon as engulfing all obscene effect. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>We cannot bring ourselves to accept the thesis that the book, thus indicted, becomes endowed with constitutional protection. Its detailed and sordid sex episodes, persistently inserted at intervals in what passes for narrative, leave an outweighing staccato impression. In our opinion it should be classified as pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Because of its impact upon other obscenity statutes, many of long standing, the majority decision will have a wide practical effect. It should lead to legislative reexamination of the entire field.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">We would affirm the decree of the Superior Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b54-11\"> Section 280 reads in part, \u201cWhenever there is reasonable cause to believe that a book which is being . . . distributed ... is obscene, indecent or impure, the attorney general . . . shall bring an information ... in equity in the superior court directed against said book by name.\u201d Then follow provisions for issuing an order of notice to interested persons and for interlocutory action. Section 28E provides for an adjudication against the book, in the event of default, \u201cif the court finds that the book is obscene, indecent or impure . . ..\u201d Section 28F provides for a similar adjudication in the event of a contested hearing, at which \u201cthe court may receive the testimony of experts and may receive evidence as to the literary, cultural or educational character of said book and as to the manner and form of its publication, advertisement, and distribution.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b55-9\"> The findings also state, <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>Of the 318 pages of the book, there are sex episodes on 85 pages, some of which are described, on two or more pages, and all of which are described with precise physical detail and four-letter words. The author\u2019s descriptive powers are truly impressive and he rises to great literary heights when he describes Paris. And suddenly he descends into the filthy gutter. The literary experts testified that the book depicts a type of life in the thirties in a portion of Paris and that it has great literary merit. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b56-4\"> Section 207.10 (2) reads in part: <em>\u201cA </em>thing is obscene if, considered as a whole, its <em>predominant </em>appeal is to prurient interest, i.e., a shameful or <em>morbid </em>interest in nudity, sex, or excretion, and if it goes <em>substantially </em>beyond customary limits of candor in description or representation of such matters. . . . Obscenity shall be judged with reference to ordinary adults, except that it shall be judged with reference to children or other specially susceptible audience if it appears from the character of the material or the circumstances of its dissemination to be specially designed for or directed to such an audience\u201d (emphasis supplied).

Draft No. 6, p. 10) points out that the code rejects \"the prevailing test of tendency to arouse lustful thoughts . . . because it is unrealistically broad for a society that plainly tolerates a great deal of erotic interest in literature, advertising, and art, and because regulation of thought or desire, unconnected with overt misbehavior, raises the most acute constitutional as well as practical difficulties.\u201d See Mr. Justice Harlan's separate opinion in the <em>Roth </em>case (854 U.
