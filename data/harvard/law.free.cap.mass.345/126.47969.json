Sullivan, in which the plaintiff was a passenger, collided with a stone wall in Lincoln shortly after midnight July 30, 1959. The auditor found for the plaintiff on the ground that the defendant\u2019s automobile at the time of the accident was illegally registered and hence a trespasser on the highway. <em>Dudley </em>v. <em>Northampton St. Ry. </em>202 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>443. <em>Harnden </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>305 Mass. 485. <em>Comeau </em>v. <em>Harrington, </em>333 Mass. 768. The trial judge, in allowing the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment on the report, rightly ruled to the contrary, accepting, we assume, as do we, the defendant\u2019s contention that Sullivan was also the \u201cowner\u201d of the automobile within the meaning of &amp; L. c. 90, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, and hence that the automobile was legally registered.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">We reach this issue notwithstanding the defendant\u2019s exception to the overruling of his demurrer. Statute 1959, c. 259, which added to G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 9, the provision which wiped out the trespasser upon the highway doctrine, was approved May 4, 1959; it contained no emergency preamble; it is not a law which \u201crelates ... to the powers . . . of courts\u201d (art. 48 of the Amendments to the 'Constitution of Massachusetts, The Referendum, III, \u00a7 2); it was not, therefore, effective prior to ninety days after enactment (art. 48, <em>ibid., </em>The Referendum, I); it became effective August 2, 1959, after the accident; it was not retroactive in operation. <em>Ostertag </em>v. <em>Cahalin, </em>343 Mass. 523. Hence, the law as it stood on July 30, 1959, when the accident occurred gave a basis for the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">The defendant, Swanson, before leaving for a year\u2019s trip in Europe on August 25, 1958, told his friend Sullivan that he could use the car until Swanson\u2019s return, with the understanding that Sullivan would store it if and while he should be in military service. Sullivan took possession of the car on August 25; it remained registered in Swanson\u2019s name until the end of 1958. In early 1959, Sullivan, after his release from army service, wrote Swanson that he was going to register the car in the latter\u2019s name; Swanson cabled Sullivan to register and insure it in Sullivan\u2019s name if he wanted to use it. About May 11,1959, Sullivan applied for insurance and registered the car in his name. There was no lease or bill of sale; Sullivan paid no money for the use of the car; it remained in Swanson\u2019s ownership, and after the accident, in which Sullivan was killed, Swanson paid the storage charges on the car and sold it.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">The conclusion of the auditor that so far as it was a question of fact there was no bailment was, we conclude, based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>only on the subsidiary facts found. <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Garelick, </em>344 Mass. 654, 659. Those facts, however, show that Sullivan was in law the bailee of the automobile. <em>Nash </em>v. <em>Lang, </em>268 Mass. 407, 414. Swanson\u2019s delivery conferred upon Sullivan \u201cthe right to use and enjoy possession [of the car] free from control by . . . [Swanson], subject to the obligation to do so with care, with due regard to its nature and characteristics and its preservation in safety, and to return it in good order barring unavoidable casualties . . ..\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>p. 414. Thus, Sullivan had a bailee\u2019s \u201cspecial interest\u201d within the definition in the <em>Nash </em>case which held that a bailment existed when a wife loaned her car to her doctor husband to make his professional calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">It is to be noted that the original provision for registration of an automobile by a \u201cperson in control thereof\u201d as well as by the owner (St. 1903, c. 473, \u00a7 1) has not appeared in the statutes since the enactment of St. 1909, c. 534, \u00a7 2. But there has been no narrowing of the meaning of \u201cowner.\u201d This court has observed in another connection that the \u201cword \u2018owner\u2019 is not a technical term. It is not confined to the person who has the absolute right in a chattel, but also applies to the person who has the possession and control of it.\u201d <em>Keith </em>v. <em>Maguire, </em>170 Mass. 210, 212 (notice to husband of sale by bailee of goods of wife, stored with her consent by husband in his name, is adequate notice to \u201cowner\u201d). In our decisions the term \u201cowner\u201d in G. L. c. 90 has been thus broadly construed and has been recognized as inclusive of those having interests other than full legal and beneficial title. <em>Downey </em>v. <em>Bay State St. Ry. </em>225 Mass. 281, 284. <em>Hurnanen </em>v. <em>Nicksa, </em>228 Mass. 346, 350. (Both cases hold that a conditional vendee may register as owner.) <em>Temple </em>v. <em>Middlesex &amp; Boston St. Ry. </em>241 Mass. 124, 125 (conditional vendor). <em>Harlow </em>v. <em>Sinman, </em>241 Mass. 462, 463-464 (part owner).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">In the <em>Downey </em>case it was said that a bailee\u2019s interest was also within the term. The court said (p. 284): \u201cThe words \u2018person in control thereof\u2019 found in the earlier enactments obviously embrace a class of persons who may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>have no general or special property in the motor vehicle they are operating, while the word \u2018owner\u2019 includes, not only persons in whom the legal title is vested, but bailees, mortgagees in possession and vendees under conditional contracts of sale who have acquired a special property which confers ownership as between them and the general public for the purposes of registration. \u2019 \u2019 The statement in respect of bailees has been in substance repeated in the subsequent cases above cited and also in <em>Caccavo </em>v. <em>Kearney, </em>286 Mass. 480, 484, where the case was decided on the assumption that the registrant was not a bailee.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">That a motor vehicle may be registered in the name of a person having a special property therein as well as in the name of the person who has the general property in it is recognized in <em>Squires </em>v. <em>Fraska, </em>301 Mass. 474, 476. See <em>Crompton </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>216 Mass. 184. Special property as a basis for registration was recognized in <em>Hyland </em>v. <em>Hyland, </em>278 Mass. 112, 119, and <em>Middlesex Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. </em>336 Mass. 315, 319.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">A purpose of the requirement of registration in the name of the owner, although not the sole purpose, is \u201cto provide identification for the benefit of travellers injured on the highway.\u201d <em>Harlow </em>v. <em>Sinman, </em>241 Mass. 462, 464-465. Registration by a bailee in control of and with the right to operate the car serves this purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">Statute 1952, c. 266, \u00a7 2, added to c. 90, \u00a7 1, this definition: \u201c \u2018Owner\u2019 shall include, but not be restricted to, any lessee or bailee of a motor vehicle registered in another state or country, and having exclusive use thereof under lease or otherwise for a period greater than thirty days in the aggregate within a calendar year.\u201d This statutory definition does not expressly or impliedly modify the definition of \u201cowner\u201d expressed in the several decisions of this court; indeed, there is in the statutory omission of any attempt to modify the judicial definition evidence of legislative recognition of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">We rule that the special interest less than full ownership which permits legal registration includes a bailment as de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>fined in <em>Nash </em>v. <em>Lang, </em>268 Mass. 407, at least, if for an extended period. Compare <em>Baughman </em>v. <em>Milstone, </em>144 Md. 223 (a hirer for two or three days may not register). A bailment adequate to permit registration requires a delivery with \u201cthe right to use and enjoy possession free from control by the bailor\u201d <em>(Nash </em>case, p. 414). This must, of course, include the right to use the car on the highways. Obviously, for example, the special interest of an operator of a parking lot, though he is a bailee <em>(Doherty </em>v. <em>Ernst, </em>284 Mass. 341, 344), would not support registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">We do not suggest that registration by the bailee is required or that registration by the bailor only would be illegal. See <em>Squires </em>v. <em>FrasTca, </em>301 Mass. 474, 476.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">\n<em>Defendant\u2019s exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AzZ\">\n<em>Plaintiff\u2019s exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
