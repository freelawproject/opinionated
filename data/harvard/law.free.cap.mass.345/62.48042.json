Clark, had been an employee of the defendant General Cleaning Company, Inc.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (General), for many years. By an instrument dated August 23, 1958, Clark agreed with General to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>act as group supervisor for it at compensation \u201cnot less than . . . [Clark\u2019s] present average earnings of $140 per week.\u201d The agreement provided that it might \u201cbe transferred to any purchaser of this branch of the business, or in other words . . . Clark is ... an asset of this branch of the business and stays with it.\u201d General agreed to employ Clark for one year \u201cafter which . . . such employment may be terminated by either party after two weeks\u2019 notice in writing.\u201d There was evidence that, before the contract was made, General\u2019s president, who wanted Clark to have \u201ca job for at least a year,\u201d told Clark \u201cthat the business was to be sold, and that the . . . contract would be assigned to the purchasers.\u201d Clark agreed that the contract could be assigned to the new owner of the business, but was not told who the purchasers were to be until after completion of the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">The contract also contained various provisions designed to protect General and its successors as employer from competition by Clark, who knew of all of General\u2019s customers. \u201c [T]he people who were going to buy the business wanted all the key employees to have such a contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">General\u2019s business assets were sold to Central Coat, Apron &amp; Linen Service, Incorporated (Central), and the contract \u201cwas assigned in writing to . . . Central ... on September 12,1958.\u201d The instrument of assignment is not before us. Later in September, 1958, Coyne Industrial Laundry, Inc. (Coyne), took over General\u2019s former business from Central after Clark had worked for Central during a two week period. Central did not assign Clark\u2019s contract to Coyne. Clark worked for Coyne for two weeks after it took over the business. Coyne then wished to reduce Clark\u2019s salary and to obtain from him a different covenant against competition. As a consequence, Clark left Coyne\u2019s employ. He tried to earn a living as a salesman but was not able to make more than his expenses. He collected unemployment compensation for twenty-six weeks. He also unsuccessfully sought work similar to what he had done. Clark died in 1960. The plaintiff is executrix of his will.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>The trial judge, subject to the plaintiff\u2019s exception, denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion for a directed verdict in her favor and directed a verdict for General in this action to recover unpaid instalments of Clark\u2019s salary for the year following August 23, 1958. Counts against Central and Coyne were discontinued prior to the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">The evidence indicates that Clark had a contract with General for one year\u2019s employment at a salary of not less than $140 per week. The jury were not required to conclude that General had been released from that liability by novation. \u201cNovation, like other forms of payment, discharge or modification of existing liability, is an affirmative defence as to which the defendant has the burden of proof.\u201d <em>Tudor Press, Inc. </em>v. <em>University Distrib. Co. </em>292 Mass. 339, 340-341. Williston, Contracts (2d ed.) \u00a7 1875. The jury would have been warranted in concluding upon all the evidence that Clark did not consent, either in advance or later, to release General from its obligations to him, despite his consent to the assignment to Central of General\u2019s rights under the contract and the circumstance that the contract was made in contemplation of the sale of General\u2019s business. The verdict for the defendant should not have been directed.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">A novation may be inferred from the circumstances and from the conduct of the parties. See <em>Kirtley </em>v. <em>C. G. Galbo Co. Inc. </em>244 Mass. 179, 182-183; <em>Tudor Press, Inc. </em>v. <em>University Distrib. Co. </em>292 Mass. 339, 341. Such an inference, however, would not have been warranted solely by the evidence that Clark, after the assignment, went to work for Central and received his agreed compensation from Central for two weeks and later received two weeks\u2019 pay from Coyne. <em>Larson </em>v. <em>Jeffrey-Nichols Motor Co. </em>279 Mass. 362, 365-368; <em>Mansfield </em>v. <em>Lang, </em>293 Mass. 386, 392. See <em>King </em>v. <em>American Powder Co. </em>290 Mass. 464, 467-468. See also <em>Coral Gables, Inc. </em>v. <em>Granara, </em>285 Mass. 565, 572; <em>Cheng </em>v. <em>Chin Wai Yip, </em>339 Mass. 173, 176-177; Eestatement: Contracts, \u00a7 160 (4). Cf. <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Wickwire Spencer Steel Corp. </em>239 Mass. 584, 586. Additional facts to be considered do not amount to more than the assignment itself and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>Clark\u2019s advance consent thereto, given in contemplation of the sale of General\u2019s business, but without knowledge of the identity of the purchaser. In the light of the cases just cited, there was insufficient evidence to permit a finding that Clark agreed to accept Central\u2019s obligation upon the contract in lieu of that of General. See Restatement: Contracts, \u00a7\u00a7 160 (4), 164, 423-428; Corbin, Contracts, \u00a7\u00a7 866-867, 870-872; Williston, Contracts (2d ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 1869-1870; (3d ed.) \u00a7 423. Cf. <em>Pike </em>v. <em>Waltham, </em>168 Mass. 581, 587.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">The plaintiff contends that her motion for a directed verdict should have been granted because there was no evidence that would warrant finding (a) that Clark had agreed to a novation, or (b) that he had not taken reasonable steps to mitigate damages by finding other employment. We assume (without deciding) that on the issue of mitigation of damages the defendant had the burden of proof. See <em>Maynard </em>v. <em>Royal Worcester Corset Co. </em>200 Mass. 1, 6-7 (which left the point undecided); <em>Osadchuk </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>251 Mass. 540, 544; <em>Levine </em>v. <em>Lawrence &amp; Co. Inc. </em>305 Mass. 210, 212; Williston, Contracts (2d ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 1353, 1358-1360; Corbin, Contracts, \u00a7\u00a7 1039, 1095. See also <em>McNally </em>v. <em>Schell, </em>293 Mass. 356, 360; <em>Food Specialties, Inc. </em>v. <em>John C. Dowd, Inc. </em>339 Mass. 735, 748. Restatement: Contracts, \u00a7 336. There are, however, other issues as to which there was oral testimony, on which the plaintiff has the burden of proof, e.g., the existence and extent of the breach of the contract. The answer was a general denial. Accordingly, even though there seems to have been no real dispute about these issues, the record does not sufficiently show this to warrant action such as was taken in <em>Graves </em>v. <em>Apt, </em>233 Mass. 587, 590. See <em>Newman </em>v. <em>Sussman, </em>239 Mass. 283, 286; <em>Douglass </em>v. <em>Mussman, </em>240 Mass. 467, 470. Cf. <em>Great Barrington Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Day, </em>288 Mass. 181, 185. A verdict could not have been directed for the plaintiff. <em>McDonough </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>228 Mass. 450, 452. <em>Companion </em>v. <em>Columbo, </em>338 Mass. 620, 623. See <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Hanover, </em>314 Mass. 167, 170; <em>Reardon Importing Co. </em>v. <em>Security Trust Co. </em>318 Mass. 304, 307.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b104-15\"> We were informed at the arguments that this was not the correct name of General.
