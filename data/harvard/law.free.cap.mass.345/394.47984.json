L. c. 40A, \u00a7 21, by way of an appeal from a decision of the board of appeals of the town of Framingham granting a variance to permit the construction of a nine store shopping center in a residence district where garden apartments were permitted un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>der the zoning by-laws of the town. In the Superior Court, a decree was entered that the board of appeals had not exceeded its authority. An appeal from the decree brings the case to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">The defendant R &amp; S Construction Co. (R &amp; S) had built garden apartments to accommodate 350 tenants in the district concerned. R &amp; S thereafter applied for a permit from the building inspector to construct the shopping center. The application was denied. R &amp; S then purported to \u201cappeal\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to the board of appeals. The board of appeals treated the <em>1 \u2018 </em>appeal \u201d as a petition for a variance. Without intimating approval of this informal procedure, we consider the case on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">The decree must be reversed. The decision of the board contains no finding to satisfy the requirement of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 15, that \u201cowing to conditions especially affecting . . . [the locus] but not affecting generally the zoning district in which it is located, a literal enforcement of the provisions of the . . . by-law would involve substantial hardship, financial or otherwise to\u201d R &amp; S. For this reason, as repeatedly stated, the decision cannot stand on appeal. <em>Barnhart </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Scituate, </em>343 Mass. 455, 456-457, and cases cited. <em>Coolidge </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals of Framingham, </em>343 Mass. 742, 744-745.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">Nor do the findings of the judge avail R &amp; S. On the contrary, they vitiate the decree. The judge found in summary that the remaining land upon which R &amp; S proposes to erect the nine store shopping center is similar in nature to that already used for the recently erected garden apartments. See <em>DiRico </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Quincy, </em>341 Mass. 607, 610.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">The final decree is reversed and a decree is to be entered that the decision of the board of appeals of the town of Framingham was in excess of its authority and is annulled.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b437-10\"> The plaintiffs contend that B &amp; S failed to comply with the provisions of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 16, inserted by St. 1954, c. 368, \u00a7 2, in that B &amp; S did not file \u201cwith the board of appeals a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
