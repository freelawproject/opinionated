John asked the defendant if he would like to accompany him and his family to Ohio to attend the funeral. The defendant said that he would, and drove to John\u2019s house in Woburn. Upon his arrival the defendant and John discussed which of two automobiles, John\u2019s or the defendant\u2019s, would be used for the trip and it was agreed that the defendant\u2019s car would be used. John paid the defendant .$35 for the use of his car and agreed to pay all of the expenses. Shortly thereafter John, his wife, and two daughters, and the defendant left for Ohio in the defendant\u2019s car. The group spent three days in Ohio and on April 24, about 9 km., they started back to Massachusetts. During the first part of the trip the defendant did the driving. In New York John took the wheel. About 7 a.m. the automobile had reached the Massachusetts Turnpike and was nearing Westfield. The weather was clear and the roadway was dry.. The plaintiff was driving in the right hand lane of the Turnpike and had both hands on the wheel when suddenly he \u201cfelt the ear sway\u201d and \u201cpull sharply to the right.\u201d He tried \u201cto get the car back onto the road . . . by giving a sharp left.\u201d Then \u201call of a sudden . . . [he] felt . . . [the] car going on a soft shoulder, going down the embankment.\u201d In \u201corder not to capsize the car . . . [he] pulled the car straight down.\u201d As he was \u201cgoing along down the end . . . [he] was hitting objects.\u201d The car \u201ctravelled a distance better than 400 feet off the roadway.\u201d When he \u201chit whatever . . . [he] hit\u201d he \u201cpassed out\u201d and from that point on he remembered nothing. The front windshield was demolished and the right side of the car was badly damaged. John, his wife, and two daughters sustained injuries. At some time after the accident the defendant asked John how his wife was, and, upon being informed, he said, \u201cJohn, I\u2019m awfully sorry. ... I want you to know now, because sooner or later you are going to find out, the tires were bad.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">William Herbert, a towing truck operator with sixteen \u25a0 years\u2019 experience, who saw the defendant\u2019s automobile shortly after the accident, testified that the right front tire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>was \u201cblown out\u201d; that it was \u201cblown almost completely around, with a hole right through\u201d; and that the tire was \u201cbald.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">The defendant testified that three of the tires did not have good treads; that he knew that the trip would involve a distance of 1,000 to 1,500 miles; that he would be traveling over the Massachusetts Turnpike where the speed would be between fifty and sixty miles per hour; and that he was \u201caware of the fact that the right front tire was bald,\u201d but this did not1 \u2018 enter his mind. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">From the accident described above these seven actions of tort arose. Four were brought by John, his wife, and two minor daughters; and three were brought by John for consequential damages sustained by him on behalf of his wife and daughters. At the close of the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence the defendant rested and presented motions for directed verdicts, which were allowed, subject to the plaintiffs\u2019 exceptions. Although the declarations contain counts for ordinary negligence and counts for gross negligence, we shall consider the cases on the basis of ordinary negligence, for the defendant conceded at the arguments that the plaintiffs were paying passengers and had the status of invitees.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">The defendant has argued that the plaintiffs failed to show what caused the vehicle to leave the highway. See <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Richard Chevrolet, Inc. </em>344 Mass. 356, 358. He contends that the condition of the right front tire after the accident could just as well have resulted from the objects struck after the car left the highway. We assume, without deciding, that the evidence would warrant a finding that a blown out tire caused the car to leave the road (see <em>Curtin </em>v. <em>Benjamin, </em>305 Mass. 489), but we are of opinion that proof of negligence on the part of the defendant was lacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">The mere blowing out of the tire did not warrant a finding of negligence on the part of the defendant. See <em>Horwitz </em>v. <em>Bulham, </em>342 Mass. 327, 329. In order for the plaintiffs to prevail they must show that the tire was defective and that the defendant knew or reasonably should have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>known of the defect. <em>Lonergan </em>v. <em>American Ry. Exp. Co. </em>250 Mass. 30, 35-36. <em>Van Steenbergen </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>286 Mass. 400, 404, 405. See <em>Bolin </em>v. <em>Corliss Co. </em>262 Mass. 115, 117. The testimony of the defendant that the treads on the tires were not \u201cgood\u201d and his testimony and that of the tow truck operator that the right front tire was \u201cbald\u201d were not sufficient to establish that that tire was defective. Nor was anything of significance added by the defendant\u2019s admission to John, made after the accident, that the \u201ctires were bad. \u2019 \u2019 These general characterizations, without more, would not warrant a finding of negligence. See <em>Cormier </em>v. <em>Bodkin, </em>300 Mass. 357, 359-360; <em>Horwitz </em>v. <em>Sulham, </em>342 Mass. 327, 329.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">This is the opinion of a majority of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
