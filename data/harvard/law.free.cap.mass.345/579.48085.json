After trial on the merits, a demurrer was sustained by interlocutory decree. By final decree the bill was dismissed. The finance committee appealed from each decree. The facts are stated upon the basis of the report of material facts. The evidence is reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">At the 1959 town meeting, $7,000 was appropriated \u201cfor use by the finance committee for their 1959 budget, of which . . . $5,000 . . . was . . . for . . . paying the expenses . . . [of] a general survey of the [town] welfare department . . . by some outside organization. The finance committee thought that the welfare budget was too high and . . . that the committee itself was not qualified to make . . . [the] survey . . ..\u201d On June 29, 1959, the committee made a contract with a corporation under which one Shurtleff \u201cwas to have charge of the survey.\u201d He had \u201can extensive prior experience in . . . town matters and ... in welfare administration. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">On July 1, the finance committee requested the board to make available to the consultants \u201cdepartment records . . . as well as department personnel for . . . interviews.\u201d The board was also asked to authorize the consultants <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>to interview welfare recipients and other parties. \u2019 \u2019 The board replied on July 2,1959, that it must follow Gr. L. c. 66, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>\u00a7 17A (as amended through St. 1956, c. 356),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and asked \u201cthe scope of . . . [the] proposed investigation and what information will he requested ... so that we may . . . [ask] for the O.K. of the [State] department of public welfare.\u201d The letter also asked for \u201cthe qualifications and experience of the group under contract to do the investigation.\u201d On October 5, the finance committee renewed its request, to which the board replied that . . . Shurtleif could interview department personnel, and that it would \u201cmake any records available . . . that do not include the names of recipients, or case records.\u201d This letter stated that the \u201cdepartment has ruled that the finance committee may not delegate its authority,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and renewed a request for Shurtleff\u2019s qualifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>On October 13, Shurtleff and a member of the finance committee went to the board\u2019s office and requested the board\u2019s chairman \u201cto allow . . . Shurtleff to examine the public welfare records\u201d including case records \u201cpertaining to old age assistance, aid to dependent children, disability assistance, and . . . records pertaining to general relief.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Each year the board \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>establishes its budget and an analysis of . . . [these] case record[s] is necessary towards the establishment of such a budget. . . . Shurtleff . . . [would have been permitted to] interview the . . . [whole staff], go through all the administrative records . . . [and] any records he wanted to except those containing the names of the welfare recipients, bank reports, relative reports, and the amount of money being paid to the recipients. . . . [The chairman of the board] was willing to set up \u2018 dummy case records \u2019 \u2014 in all categories \u2014 going through the complete procedure, but- using fictitious names and circumstances, but this was not agreeable to . . . Shurtleff. The finance committee . . . has not been able to conduct the survey . . . through . . . [Shurtleff] by reason of having been denied access to the case records and names of . . . welfare recipients.\u201d Shurtleff -testified \u201cthat since the . . . case record . . . contains the entire case history, records of frequency of visitations, procedures employed with reference to original applications, the thoroughness of the receiving clerk, and the investigating clerk, the matter of placing liens w[h]ere legally required against properties, and so forth, ... it was necessary to look at that record to make any type of an appraisal of the . . . efficiency of the\u201d board. Records of general welfare payments, which are not assisted by State or Federal contributions, were separately requested. These also were refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">1. The principal question is whether c. 66, \u00a7 17A (fn. 2, <em>supra), </em>precludes the finance committee\u2019s consultant from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>examining case records in the custody of the board. The board contends that under \u00a7 17A it may not give access to these records to paid independent investigators, hired by the finance committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The enactment of \u00a7 17A5 <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> was caused by the 1939 amendments of the Social Security Act (now found in 42 U. S. 0. \u00a7\u00a7 302, 602, 1202 [1958] <footnotemark>6</footnotemark>), which provided that State plans for old age assistance, aid to dependent children, and aid to the blind must contain safeguards which restrict the use or disclosure of information concerning aid applicants and recipients to purposes directly connected with the administration of such aid. See also 42 U. S. 0. \u00a7 1352 (1958), added in 1950 by Pub. Law, No. 734 (81st Cong., 2d Sess.), \u00a7 351, 64 Stat. 477, 555, relating to aid to the permanently and totally disabled. The 1939 amendments must be read in the light of the so called Jenner amendment (Rev. Act of 1951, \u00a7 618, 65 Stat. 569), apparently not incorporated in the U. S. Code, but mentioned in annotations in the official copy of 42 IT. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 302, 602,1202, 1352 (1958).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>618 reads, \u201cNo State ... or political subdivision thereof shall be deprived of any grant-in-aid or other payment to which it otherwise is . . . entitled pursuant to title I, IV, X, or XIV of the Social Security Act, as amended, by reason of the enactment or enforcement by such State of any legislation prescribing any conditions under which public access may be had to records of the disbursement of any such funds . . . within such State, if such legislation prohibits the use of any list or names obtained through such access to such records for commercial or political purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">Section 17A permits boards like the finance committee to have access to \u201csuch records\u201d only \u201cfor purposes directly connected with the administration of such public assistance.\u201d Consequently, \u00a7 17A prohibits (particularly when read with c. 121, \u00a7 4A, and c. 271, \u00a7 43) any use of such records \u201cfor commercial or political purposes.\u201d We have been referred to no Federal regulation (cf. 45 C. F. B., part 201, pp. 125-128) which purports to prohibit access to such records in the manner now sought by the finance committee for purely public purposes. In view of the Jenner amendment, there is grave doubt whether such a regulation would be valid. Similarly, in view of the express grant, by the 1953 amendment of \u00a7 17A (see fn. 2, <em>supra), </em>of access to such records for town 1 \u2018 committees . . . responsible for the preparation of [or recommendations relative to] annual budgets for such public assistance,\u201d there would be serious question whether a regulation by the department of public welfare under c. 121, \u00a7 4A, would be \u201creasonable\u201d if it prohibited such a committee or its proper agents to have access to such records for public purposes. No such regulation, if there is any, appears in the record. There is, to be sure, reference in correspondence to a ruling of the department \u201cthat the finance committee may not delegate its authority.\u201d Such a ruling, of course, is invalid in view of our interpretation of \u00a7 17A.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">When the 1953 amendment of \u00a7 17A was enacted, the Jenner amendment was already in effect. No Federal legislation then prohibited the State from giving town finance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>committees access to the case records. The Legislature must be taken to have been familiar with the circumstance that members of town finance committees perform a difficult public service, usually if not invariably without compensation. In the absence of explicit language, it would be unreasonable to construe a statutory authorization to such committees, to examine voluminous and complicated public records, as requiring the committee members to do this routine work in person and as prohibiting the use of paid experts, consultants, accountants, and clerical assistants for what is likely to be seasonal or occasional research. Particularly would such a construction be peculiar in view of the express grant of authority in \u00a7 <em>17A </em>to any <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>representatives of the federal government\u201d (which term would include clerical employees, ordinary investigators, and auditing agents) to have access to these records.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\"><em>A </em>statutory right of access to records usually includes reasonable opportunity for the assistance of experts and other persons as well as the opportunity to make copies. See <em>Varney </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>194 Mass. 239, 241-242; <em>Powelson </em>v. <em>Tennessee E. Elec. Co. </em>220 Mass. 380, 384-385; <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>234 Mass. 592, 594-595; <em>Direct-Mail Serv. Inc. </em>v. <em>Registrar of Motor Vehicles, </em>296 Mass. 353, 356-358. Cf. <em>Gavin </em>v. <em>Purdy, </em>335 Mass. 236, 238-239. In seeking outside assistance, nothing unreasonable is proposed by the finance committee. The judge found that Shurtleff had \u201cprior experience in . . . welfare administration.\u201d No evidence suggests that he was not well qualified to conduct the survey. No discretionary power and no authority to make decisions was to be delegated to Shurtleff. See <em>West Springfield </em>v. <em>Mayo, </em>265 Mass. 41, 43-44. See also <em>Concord </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen. </em>336 Mass. 17, 21; McQuillin, Municipal Corporations (3d ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 10.41, 12.126, 12.127. Cf. <em>Shells </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>306 Mass. 535, 540-541. He was only to make a survey and to submit recommendations to the finance committee as an aid to their action. This type of nonrecurrent investigation is frequently carried on by consultants or independent investigators, and it was work on which (at least where authorized by the town to do so at town ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>pense) the finance committee reasonably might obtain assistance, without violation of \u00a7 17A, so long as the committee did not abdicate its own power of judgment and recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">The agreement between the finance committee and the consultant corporation, for which Shurtleff acted, required the corporation to \u201ccomply with all Federal, State, and town laws and bylaws applicable to the work to be done under this contract.\u201d This seems to us a reasonable and sufficient effort by the committee to ensure that Shurtleff and others acting for the corporation would preserve the confidential character of the case records. See Restatement 2d: Agency, \u00a7 396. We assume, also, that G. L. c. 271, \u00a7 43 (fn. 3, <em>supra), </em>would apply to an unauthorized disclosure by a consultant of the finance committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Proper investigation of welfare, old age assistance, and other public aid expenditures in connection with making recommendations for annual budgets is <em>1 \u2018 </em>directly connected with the administration of such public assistance.\u201d Such public assistance is paid from tax money raised from citizens and property owners. Their duly designated representatives are exercising a public function in connection with such public assistance when they examine expenditures for such assistance to make certain that the expenditures are neither excessive nor inadequate and are being made fairly, wisely, and economically, without waste or fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">The legislative history of \u00a7 17A and of the other statutory sections first enacted by St. 1941, c. 630 (see fns. 2, 3, 5, <em>supra), </em>leads us to construe those provisions as not intended by the Legislature to permit any disclosure of records that would violate Federal statutes or valid Federal regulations, or reasonably cause improper risk of forfeiture of Federal grants to the State and its subdivisions in aid of public assistance. Compare the analogous situation discussed in <em>Commissioner of Labor &amp; Indus. </em>v. <em>Boston Housing Authy., ante, </em>406, 415-416. Cf. also <em>Boston </em>v. <em>McCafferty, </em>328 Mass. 177,179-180; <em>Fenton </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>344 Mass. 343, 345-347. We perceive, however, no indication of any risk of loss of Federal funds because of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>the limited disclosure for public purposes which the finance committee now seeks to enforce. The finance committee was entitled to that disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\"><em>2. </em>There was no necessity of joining the department of public welfare or the town itself as a party. No action by the department was sought. If it has an interest, not apparent from the record, it should have asked leave to intervene. No question is raised of the validity of the town by-law prescribing the powers of the finance committee. See Gr. L. c. 231A, \u00a7 8. Cf. <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Banas, </em>331 Mass. 694, 698. Cf. also <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Comptroller of the Commonwealth, ante, </em>183,186.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">3. There is no merit to the board\u2019s contention that the finance committee has not exhausted its administrative remedies. We have interpreted \u00a7 17A as expressly giving the finance committee and its authorized consultants the right of access, in the circumstances, to all the board\u2019s records. Chapter 121, \u00a7 4A, provides no administrative procedure, which must be exhausted, for any appeal to the department of public welfare from the board\u2019s refusal to give access to the records.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">4. The bill is not multifarious. All questions argued are closely related to the board\u2019s refusal to give to the finance committee access to all the board\u2019s records in accordance with the vote (and appropriation) of the town. See <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Jennings, </em>344 Mass. 608, 621. See also <em>Caton </em>v. <em>Reuther, </em>341 Mass. 547, 549. Cf. <em>Defiance Printed Circuit Corp. </em>v. <em>Goodwin, </em>337 Mass. 473, 476.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">5. The finance committee in its brief does not argue the contention referred to in the prayers of its bill, that it is entitled to retain and pay counsel from town funds. We need not consider this issue. See Bule 13 of the Buies for the Begulation of Practice before the Full Court (1952), 328 Mass. 698, amended November 5,1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">6. The interlocutory decree and the final decree are reversed. The case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings and a declaration of rights consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-10\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b622-9\"><em> </em>See G-.
