The plaintiffs appeal from an interlocutory decree sustaining the demurrer and from a final decree dismissing the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">The bill alleges that on or about April 20, 1961, the defendant notified the plaintiffs by mail that it intended to take the plaintiffs\u2019 land by eminent domain for school purposes and that, since the land was presently used for agricultural purposes, G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 5B, would be complied with. That section provides: \u201cNo property used for agricultural purposes shall be taken without the consent of the owner thereof, except after a hearing by the board at which such owner shall be entitled to be heard and allowed to introduce evidence that other land not used for agricultural purposes is available for the public use for which it is intended to take his property. ...\u201d The hearing was scheduled for 3 p.m. on May 1, 1961, at which time counsel representing the plaintiffs met with the city council. The defendant, on May 22,1961, by a two-thirds vote of its city council, voted $3,981.12 \u201cto provide funds for the acquisition by purchase or eminent domain [of] land in the vicinity of Harrington Way; and the aforesaid sum is now available for the purpose of the present taking.\u201d On or about June 6,1961, the plaintiffs were notified by the defendant that the land in question had been taken \u201cby eminent domain'for school purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 bill also alleges that, although they were represented by counsel at the hearing, agents of the defendant made certain \u201cfalse\u201d representations at the meeting in order to \u201clull\u201d and \u201cmislead\u201d the plaintiffs into not presenting their full evidence, and that the plaintiffs relied upon the \u201cgood faith\u201d of the defendant but were \u201cdeceived and defrauded\u201d causing the hearing to be a \u201csham\u201d or \u201carbitrary and capricious act.\u201d The plaintiffs do not allege that they were prevented from presenting the evidence they had prepared. They were given notice and an opportunity to be heard with counsel. The allegations \u201cdeceived and defrauded,\u201d \u201csham,\u201d and \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>are all statements and conclusions of law and, as such, were not admitted by demurrer. <em>Joyce </em>v. <em>Hickey, </em>337 Mass. 118, 123.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 brief further alleges that there was not the necessary compliance with G. L. c. 43, \u00a7 30, which provides, in part, that: \u201cNo land shall be taken or purchased until an appropriation by loan or otherwise for the general purpose for which land is needed has been made by the city council, by a two thirds vote of all its members; nor shall a price be paid in excess of the appropriation, unless a larger sum is awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d They argue that to be valid the appropriation by the city council on May 22, 1961, should have included the cost of erecting the school as well as the cost of acquisition of the land, and that the sum of $3,981.12 was \u201cknowingly far under the reasonably anticipated cost of the land acquisition and of the buildings to be built thereon.\u201d The sum quoted was voted \u201cfor the purpose of the present taking.\u201d The statute does not require that the \u201cappropriation\u201d be the only one made to achieve the \u201cgeneral purpose.\u201d There is nothing to prevent a later appropriation providing for the construction of buildings. It would be extremely impractical to require that all of the costs of the intended project be set forth in detail before the land is acquired. The statute itself, by use of the phrase \u201cnor shall a price be paid in excess of the appropriation,\u201d clearly allows the initial sum voted to be for land acquisition purposes alone. The plaintiffs have cited no cases supporting their construction of the statute and we can find no reason for so construing it. The demurrer was rightly sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">\n<em>Interlocutory and final decrees affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
