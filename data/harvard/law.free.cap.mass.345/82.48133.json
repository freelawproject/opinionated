There, about January 14, 1958, Columbia\u2019s property was damaged after a heavy rain by an unusual backflow from a city sewer. The backflow came through drains left unplugged by plumbing and sprinkler subcontractors not negligently selected by Shuman. Shuman \u201chad the right to stop a [sub]contractor when the work was not being done properly\u201d and \u201cto tell . . . [him] what to do\u201d but its president did not think he had authority to \u201cdirect a subcontractor\u2019s men.\u201d It was a part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>Shuman\u2019s job to see that \u201csub-contractors complied with the pertinent codes pertaining to their work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Shuman employed one Aiello, a general laborer, \u201cto keep the place clean and secure . . . [it] at night.\u201d He was also \u201cto cement the [sewer] pipes in place,\u201d and to do other incidental work. Shuman gave \u201cAiello no instructions to check the job before leaving\u201d on January 14 \u201cor at any other time.\u201d Aiello \u201cin the past\u201d had been told \u201cto call the office if anything went wrong on the job.\u201d When Aiello left on January 14, he knew that the drains were unplugged, but did not inform Shuman.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Shuman\u2019s president saw the damage on January 15 and \u201ctold the plumbing sub-contractor that it was not very bright to leave out the plugs in the piping.\u201d There was testimony \u201cthat it was unskilful plumbing to leave the plug[s] out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">There was a verdict for Shuman in this action of tort to recover damages not received in settlements with the subcontractors. The case has been argued before us on exceptions to a part of the charge and to the failure of the judge to give two instructions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The essential facts have been stated in their aspect most favorable to Columbia.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">There is no merit to an obscure exception (see <em>Kane </em>v. <em>Fields Corner Grille, Inc. </em>341 Mass. 640, 646-647) to a portion of the charge dealing with whether Shuman was liable for the negligence of the independent subcontractors. The charge on this issue was at least as favorable to Columbia as was proper. See <em>Whalen </em>v. <em>Shivek, </em>326 Mass. 142, 149-152; <em>Ducey </em>v. <em>Springfield Co-op. Bank, </em>341 Mass. 449, 450; Restatement 2d: Torts (Tent. Draft No. 7, April 16,1962), \u00a7\u00a7 416, 422, 426, 427. If <em>Levesque </em>v. <em>Hildreth &amp; Rogers Co. </em>276 Mass. 429, 435 (dealing with a landowner\u2019s liability to invitees where he employed an independent contractor to make elevator repairs) has any relevance in the situation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>before us, no contention based upon the principles of that case was adequately brought to the attention of the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">Requested instruction No. 12 (see footnote 1) in effect says that, if Aiello knew the drains were unplugged, then Shuman was charged with Aiello\u2019s knowledge and is liable if it took no action. This instruction, of course, was defective because it would have imposed liability upon .Shuman without regard to whether Shuman was negligent and because it implies that Shuman reasonably should have foreseen that absence of the plugs was likely to result in damage to Columbia. It also improperly states in effect that Aiello\u2019s knowledge that the drains were unplugged must be imputed to Shuman.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">The trial judge left it to the jury to determine whether extraordinary precautions by Shuman were necessary to avoid an undue risk of damage from the subcontracted plumbing work. The jury\u2019s finding for the defendant may indicate that they found no need of such precautions. In any event, we think that no finding on the evidence was warranted that either the subcontracted sprinkler or plumbing work (a) was likely in the absence of special precautians by Shuman to create an unreasonable risk of the harm which occurred (cf. <em>Sturges </em>v. <em>Society for the Promotion of Theological Educ. at Cambridge, </em>130 Mass. 414, 415) or (b) required that Shuman supervise the work or place a trained mechanic on the premises to investigate the details of what the subcontractors did. It was not proved that Aiello, a \u201cgeneral laborer,\u201d had been employed to check or inspect details of the subcontractors\u2019 work. At most, it had been shown that Aiello was to keep the building clean, to secure it, and \u201cto call the office if anything went wrong on the job.\u201d When Aiello left on January 14, nothing had \u201cgone wrong.\u201d What was proved with respect to the naturc of Aiello\u2019s instructions and to the scope of Aiello\u2019s duties would not permit imputing to Shuman Aiello\u2019s knowledge of the uncapped drains. See <em>Wurm </em>v. <em>Allen Cadillac Co. </em>301 Mass. 413, 415-416; Restatement 2d: Agency, \u00a7\u00a7 229, 272, 275, 283. See also <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Worces</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number><em>ter Gas Light Co. </em>341 Mass. 425, 436-437. Cf. <em>Sarna </em>v. <em>American Bosch Magneto Corp. </em>290 Mass. 340, 342-343; <em>Dunlea </em>v. <em>R. D. A. Realty Co. </em>301 Mass. 505. Instruction No. 12 could not have been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">Instruction No. 13 also relates to Columbia\u2019s effort to prove that Shuman itself was negligent. Since no duty on Shuman\u2019s part to take any action had been established, it was wholly irrelevant that Shuman had power to act if it had found occasion to do so. The judge was not required to give the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b125-9\"> These instructions read, \u201cIS. If the jury finds that . . . [Shuman\u2019s] employee whose job was to secure the building, knew the drains were unplugged, such knowledge was tantamount to knowledge by . . . [Shuman], and . . . [Shuman] would be liable if it took no adequate action to cause the drains to be properly secured. 13. There is sufficient evidence that . . . [Shuman] had the right to prevent the plumbing remaining in an unsafe condition on January 14, 1958.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
