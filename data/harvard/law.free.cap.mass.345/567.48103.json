L. c. 231A ordered that the defendant Metropolitan District Commission (M. D. C.) pay to the plaintiff $19,977.66 out of the sum retained by M. D. C. under a general contract with Beacon Construction Company, Inc. (Beacon), dated April 24,1959, for the reconstruction of Longfellow Bridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-11\">Beacon and Maryland Casualty Company (Maryland) were parties defendant but on November 30, 1961, the demurrers of Beacon and Maryland were sustained by interlocutory decrees which did not refer to any of the grounds of demurrer. Maryland\u2019s demurrer averred that no facts were set out entitling the plaintiff (Long Island) to relief against it and that there was no <em>11 </em>actual controversy\u201d between Long Island and Maryland. Beacon\u2019s demurrer averred that the bill showed no controversy between it and Long Island which could be determined with finality in the suit, insufficient facts to show a right to relief under G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 39F, and facts not alleged with substantial certainty and clarity; also that the relief sought could not be had under G. L. c. 231A.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-12\">The final decree dismissed the bill as to Beacon and Maryland. Beacon and M. D. C. appealed from the final decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-13\">The case was heard on a statement of agreed facts entered into by Long Island and M. D. C. It was agreed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>inter alla, as follows: Long Island, a subcontractor, had completed its work; M. D. 0. had paid Beacon in full for that work; Beacon had only partially paid Long Island leaving $19,977.66 due; Long Island had made claim on M. D. C. for direct payment of this sum under Gr. L. c. 30, \u00a7 39F; Long Island had also perfected a lien under Gr. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29, against the performance bond on which Maryland was surety for alleged extras in the amount of $97,348; the retained percentage under the general contract was $25,342.10; no other claim under Gr. L. c. 30, \u00a7 39F, or Gr. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29, had been filed or received by M. D. 0. against the general contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">The substantive issue of law presented, and the only issue argued by M. D. C. on its appeal, is this: G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 39G, requires that M. D. C. deduct and retain from payment of a final (or semifinal) estimate \u201ca sum sufficient to satisfy any and all outstanding claims or liens . . . [duly filed against Beacon] under the provisions of section thirty-nine<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or thirty-nine A of this chapter or section twenty-nine of chapter one hundred and forty-nine . . .\u201d; the lien of Long Island under c. 149, \u00a7 29, for $97,000 plus required that all of the retained percentage ($25,000 plus) be withheld from Beacon; therefore, there are no \u2018 \u2018 sums payable to the general contractor on the general contract, \u2019 \u2019 and hence no sums from which it can make the payment which Long Island seeks and the final decree orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">1. The final decree is based on a correct construction of the statutes. Under G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 39G,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Beacon had no right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>to receive payment of any amount not in excess of \u201ca sum sufficient to satisfy\u201d all the specified claims or liens. Thus all persons who might have legal or equitable rights to the retained percentage ahead of Beacon were protected. Persons having such rights would be: (1) subcontractors under c. 30, \u00a7 39F, and (2) the surety, so far as it would have rights of subrogation because of payments to subcontractors under c. 149, \u00a7 29. See <em>Water Works Supply Corp. </em>v. <em>Cahill, </em>344 Mass. 442, 447. But Long Island had a higher right than Beacon\u2019s. Subcontractors have direct rights against the retained funds under \u00a7 39F<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Pioneer Steel Erectors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>344 Mass. 195, 198-199. Section 39G- does not bar the payment to a subcontractor under \u00a7 39F of amounts withheld from the general contractor under \u00a7 39G-. This construction serves the purpose of the statutes with reasonable regard to the affected interests; the payment from the retained percentage discharges, pro tanto, the general contractor\u2019s obligation to the subcontractor and relieves the surety of a claim which would otherwise be perfectible against the bond under c. 149, \u00a7 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">2. The final decree errs in making a statutory construction which purports to affect Beacon\u2019s rights although Beacon is not bound by it. See Gr. L. c. 231A, \u00a7 8. Beacon did not agree to the facts stated. The ruling is incorrect that because Beacon\u2019s demurrer was sustained Beacon could not \u201cassert that it has an interest or would be affected by a declaration involving . . . [Long Island and M. D. 0.].\u201d If this were an action or suit between private parties for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>recovery of the $19,000 plus, we assume M. D. C. would be bound to Long Island by the decree and would risk Beacon\u2019s possible right also to recover the sum paid to Long Island ostensibly for Beacon\u2019s account. But under c. 231A, \u00a7 8, \u2018 \u2018 all persons shall be made parties who have or claim any interest which would be affected by the declaration. \u2019 \u2019 Furthermore this proceeding can be sustained only as a strict declaratory proceeding (see point 3), and M. D. C.\u2019s consent to proceed in the absence of Beacon was beyond its authority so far as it might result in maldng the Commonwealth liable to Long Island and Beacon for the same retained sum.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Although M. D. C. has not argued the point, its appeal from the final decree opens the interlocutory decree to revision so far only as it appears to the full court that such final decree is \u2018 \u2018 erroneously affected thereby. \u201d Gf. L. c. 214, \u00a7 27. The dismissal of the bill as to Beacon was grounded in the interlocutory decree. Hence we review that decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">3. It was not a good ground for demurrer that the proceeding is against the Commonwealth and that Gr. L. c. 258 does not permit such a suit. The declaration sought by this bill is a construction of Gr. L. c. 30, \u00a7\u00a7 39F and 39Gr and c. 149, \u00a7 29, so that M. D. C. may properly perform its obligations thereunder. In this respect the case is like <em>Saint Luke\u2019s Hosp. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn. </em>320 Mass. 467, where in a suit under Gr. L. c. 231A the court determined the jurisdiction of the Labor Relations Commission to entertain a certification proceeding under Gr. L. c. 150A. The Commonwealth is not a party. No decree against the Commonwealth for the sum which should be paid by M. D. C. is directly sought or can be entered on this bill. Compare <em>Pioneer Steel Erectors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>344 Mass. 195. Compare also <em>Executive Air Serv. Inc. </em>v. <em>Division of Fisheries &amp; Game, </em>342 Mass. 356, 358, which notes that in the <em>Saint Luke\u2019s Eosp. </em>case \u2018 \u2018 the agency was the only party directly concerned. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">So far as the demurrers raise issues not disposed of above, they are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">4. The agreed facts and the tenor of the arguments suggest that there may be no substantial issue which Beacon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>will seek to raise other than those now decided. That, of course, is beside the point. Beacon, as a necessary party, must have an opportunity to be heard. The interlocutory decree sustaining Beacon\u2019s demurrer and the final decree are reversed and the case is to stand for further proceedings in the Superior Court in accordance herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b611-7\"> Although the reference to \u00a7 39 remains in \u00a7 39G, that section (39) was repealed by St. 1957, e. 682, \u00a7 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b611-8\"> Section 39G reads in part: \"Within sixty-five days after the work required by a contract with the commonwealth or any agency or political subdivision thereof . . . has been completed to the satisfaction of the duly authorized representative or agent of the contracting authority, a final estimate of the quantity of work done thereunder and the value of such work shall be prepared ....
