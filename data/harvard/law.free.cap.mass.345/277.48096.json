The declaration contains allegations that the plaintiff made a written lease of premises at 581 Mystic Avenue, Somerville, to Savino A. Ferrante, doing business as Aster Chair Co., for a term of twelve months from June 25,1959, at a monthly rental of $400; and that the lessee assigned the lease to the defendant. The case was heard upon a case stated. The record contains the plaintiff\u2019s appeal from \u201cfinding of court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>for defendant\u201d but contains no finding. The docket shows an entry, \u201c'Court find[s] for defendant.\u201d This general finding was in effect an order for judgment from which an appeal lies under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 96. <em>National Cash Register Co. </em>v. <em>Warner, </em>335 Mass. 736. <em>Thurlow </em>v. <em>Crossman, </em>336 Mass. 248, 250. <em>United States Plywood Corp. </em>v. <em>Pioneer Display Co. </em>343 Mass. 150.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">On August 18, 1959, the lessee obtained a loan from, and delivered six papers to, the defendant bank: (1) a promissory note; (2) a chattel mortgage; (3) an \u201cassignment of lease\u201d; (4) lessee\u2019s copy of the lease; (5) a \u201cgrant of rights,\u201d so called; and (6) an agreement by the lessee not to assign accounts receivable or deplete inventory. Bent from February 24, 1960, in the amount of $1,773.33 has not been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">The case stated recites that the only question for the court is whether under the \u201cassignment of lease\u201d the bank became liable for rent as of August 18, 1959.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">The plaintiff relies upon <em>Dunlap </em>v. <em>Bullard, </em>131 Mass. 161, and argues that, since the defendant took the whole of the unexpired leasehold estate, it is liable as assignee. This principle is not here doubted. See Am. Law of Property, \u00a7\u00a7 3.56, 3.57. We think, however, that it has no present application because of the wording of the \u201cassignment of lease.\u201d In it a sentence reads, \u201cThis assignment is to become complete, effective and binding only upon acceptance on behalf of Everett National Bank by one of its officers and the date of acceptance shall be conclusively accepted as the date inserted hereon by such officer.\u201d At the end of the document below the signature of the lessee appears the following phrase with unfilled blanks: \u201cAccepted by Everett National Bank . . . this . . . day of . . ..\u201d The document \u201cshould be construed so as to give it effect as a rational business instrument and in a manner which will effectuate the intent of the parties.\u201d <em>New York Cent. R.R. </em>v. <em>New England Merchants Natl. Bank, </em>344 Mass. 709, 714. <em>McMahon </em>v. <em>Monarch Life Ins. Co., ante, </em>261, 264. We are of opinion that as a matter of construction the quoted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>sentence refers to and imposes as a condition precedent to the effectiveness of the assignment the filling of the blanks at the foot of the document by a bank officer. Without it the agreement would not be <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>complete, effective and binding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">This conclusion is not affected by the presence of another sentence which reads, \u201cThis assignment is complete, effective, binding and irrevocable on behalf of Savino A. Ferrante and no notice need be given him upon acceptance by Everett National Bank nor shall he in any way hinder, deny or interfere with Everett National Bank\u2019s rights or interest hereunder.\u201d The net effect of the \u201cassignment of lease\u201d is that the bank, which has lent the money, has been given an option to accept an assignment of the lease as security upon completing the instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">The plaintiff is looking for a windfall. What his argument means is that the bank in attempting to secure its loan overreached itself and, in effect, gratuitously underwrote the lessee\u2019s obligations to the plaintiff. Such, in our opinion, would not be a reasonable interpretation to place upon this business transaction and the method and language used to achieve its purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">\n<em>Order for judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
