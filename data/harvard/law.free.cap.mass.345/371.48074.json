In one count, Patricia Harrington, a minor, alleges that on November 2,1957, she fell on a defective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>stairway in a snbway station controlled and operated by the defendant; in the other count, her father seeks to recover consequential damages. Verdicts were returned for each plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">The sole question relates to a ruling on evidence which arose in these circumstances. As a result of a motion made by the defendant the plaintiffs were ordered to specify, among other things, what the defective condition on the stairway was. The plaintiffs specified as follows: \u201c2. The defective condition of the stairway was the accumulation of debris and foreign substances on said stairway. 3. The defendant, its agents, servants or employees, were negligent in the maintenance of the premises because they permitted an excessive amount of debris and foreign substances to be accumulated on their stairs and permitted it to remain for an unreasonable length of time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Several months later the plaintiffs moved to strike out the above specifications and to substitute others, and the motion was granted. The substituted specifications were: <em>\u201c2. </em>The defective condition of the stairway was a broken piece of nosing 3% inches wide and an accumulation of debris and foreign substances on said stairway. 3. The defendant, its agents, servants or employees were negligent in the maintenance of the premises because they permitted a broken piece of nosing to remain on the stairs and because they permitted an excessive amount of debris and foreign substances to be accumulated on their stairs and permitted it to remain for an unreasonable length of time. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">The plaintiff Michael Harrington testified on direct examination that on returning from a hospital with his daughter on the day of the accident he asked her to show him where she fell and she \u201cpointed out the sixth step\u201d where a \u201cjagged piece of the nosing about three or four inches from the center of the stair [was] missing and . . . [the] concrete or grout had broken away.\u201d On cross-examination counsel for the defendant \u201cattempted to read to this plaintiff the original specifications and to cross examine him relative to the claim of the plaintiff as originally stated in the specifications, and to call the Jury\u2019s attention to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>facts.\u201d The judge excluded this evidence, subject to the defendant\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">General Laws c. 231, \u00a7 87, provides: \u201cPleadings shall not be evidence on the trial, but the allegations therein shall bind the party making them.\u201d The plaintiffs\u2019 specifications, when filed, became part of the pleadings in the case. \u201cSpecifications must be read with the declaration, and the proof must conform to the specifications.\u201d <em>Lishner </em>v. <em>Bleich, </em>319 Mass. 350, 352. To the same effect are <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Giles, </em>1 Gray, 466, 469, <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Crompton &amp; Knowles Loom Works, </em>305 Mass. 327, 328-329, <em>Snow </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Transit Authy. </em>323 Mass. 21, 23, and <em>Wolfson </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>338 Mass. 603, 604. By reading the original specifications to the witness and cross-examining him with respect to them, the defendant was attempting to use the pleadings as \u201cevidence on the trial.\u201d This, under \u00a7 87, cannot be done. <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>110 Mass. 61. See <em>Taft </em>v. <em>Fiske, </em>140 Mass. 250; <em>Demelman </em>v. <em>Burton, </em>176 Mass. 363; <em>Fellows, Gamage Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Jackman, </em>296 Mass. 570, 573; <em>Stoney </em>v. <em>Soar, </em>322 Mass. 408, 412. Moreover, as the court said in <em>Taft </em>v. <em>Fiske, supra, </em>at page 252: \u201cIt would be a serious embarrassment to that liberal amendment of pleadings contemplated by our statutes, if a party availing himself of the leave in this respect granted by the court could only do so by subjecting himself to the imputation that his new form of statement, by its difference from that previously made, showed that he presented a simulated case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">The case of <em>Clarke </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>269 Mass. 335, relied on by the defendant, is not in point. That case had to do with the admissibility in evidence of a party\u2019s specifications in <em>another </em>case, and it was held that they were competent as admissions in the case on trial. The defendant also relies on <em>Woodworth </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>235 Mass. 443, but that case is distinguishable. As the court said there, at page 445, the \u201cquestions did not relate to . . . [the] contents [of the pleadings], but to \u2018 declarations material to the issues on trial.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
