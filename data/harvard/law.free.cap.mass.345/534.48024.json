[taxpayer\u2019s] tangible property situated in the Commonwealth on December 31, 1955, as is not subject to local taxation, was $4,302,124.\u201d The board refused the taxpayer\u2019s requests for rulings of law. The stenographic report of the proceedings before the board and the exhibits are part of the record on appeal. Most of the facts are not in dispute, many of them having been stipulated by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">The taxpayer is a domestic manufacturing corporation engaged in business in Massachusetts and elsewhere. On July 10, 1956, the taxpayer filed its corporate excise tax return for the year ending December 31, 1955, based upon G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 32. At the time, that section of the statute imposed a tax on the taxpayer in an \u201camount equal to five dollars per thousand upon the value of its corporate excess or five dollars per thousand upon the value of such of its tangible property situated in the commonwealth on said day as is not subject to local taxation . . ., whichever is higher.\u201d The taxpayer\u2019s return included a tax computation based on the second or \u201ctangible property\u201d measure under the statute. On January 23, 1959, the taxpayer was notified of an increase in its tax liability for the year 1955, such increase resulting entirely from the commission\u2019s raising the taxpayer\u2019s \u201cMassachusetts tangible property\u201d figure. On May 4, 1959, the taxpayer filed for an abatement of its 1955 excise tax and was informed by the commission that the \u201cabatement had been allowed but only within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>allowable limitations as defined by . . . Corporation Excise Ruling 1957-2. \u2019 \u2019<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ***The parties do not contend that this ruling is inapplicable because it went into effect subsequent to the tax year here involved. It is a limitation imposed by this ruling which gives rise to the dispute in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">The following figures are stipulated by the parties. The taxpayer\u2019s net \u201cMassachusetts tangible property not subject to local taxation\u201d has a book value of $4,556,587. However, Ruling 1957-2 permits a \u201cwrite-down\u201d of this book value for excise tax purposes when the value of the taxpayer\u2019s capital stock (as determined pursuant to the ruling) is less than the corporation\u2019s \u201cnet book asset value\u201d (a term comparable to net worth or book value). Such a \u201cwrite-down\u201d occurred in this case. Applying a formula which includes a consideration of earnings over the preceding five years, the taxpayer\u2019s capital stock was deemed to have a value of $5,300,760 while the \u201cnet book asset value\u201d was $5,796,789. Under Ruling 1957-2, \u00a7 V, the difference, or $496,029, is the \u201cwrite-down.\u201d Up to and including this last figure the taxpayer does not challenge the reasonableness of Ruling 1957-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>The parties disagree, however, as to whether the taxpayer is entitled to use all or part of the \u201cwrite-down\u201d in reduction of its \u201cMassachusetts tangible property\u201d figure. The taxpayer contends that the full $496,029 should be applied to the $4,556,587 of \u201ctangible property\u201d without any limitation, thus giving rise to an ultimate figure of $4,060,558. The commission contends, and was sustained by the Appellate Tax Board, that the $496,029 \u201cwrite-down\u201d should be limited, in accordance with Ruling 1957-2, to \u201csuch proportion as the Massachusetts tangibles not subject to local taxation bear to the total assets of the corporation, or $254,463.\u201d Employing this formula the ultimate figure would be $4,302,124 ($4,556,587 less $254,463). The narrow issue for this court to decide is whether the taxpayer should have been credited with the entire $496,029 \u201cwrite-down\u201d or with merely a portion thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">The taxpayer\u2019s argument that the limitation used in the ruling is \u201carbitrary, unreasonable and improper\u201d is as follows. The \u201cwrite-down,\u201d which occurs because the value of the taxpayer\u2019s capital stock is less than the \u201cnet book asset value,\u201d can only mean that the taxpayer\u2019s assets are \u2018 \u2018 overvalued \u2019 \u2019 on its books. Once the amount of the \u2018 \u2018 overvaluation\u201d is ascertained, \u201cit is necessary, as a matter of law, \u2019 \u2019 to determine the 1 \u2018 specific assets \u2019 \u2019 which are so overvalued. By a process of elimination, certain assets such as cash, accounts receivable, and prepaid expenses can be shown not to have been overvalued, leaving only \u201cmachinery and other assets\u201d as the sole assets possibly overvalued. Unlike many of its assets, the taxpayer\u2019s \u201cmachinery and other assets\u201d are located exclusively in Massachusetts. Thus, since the \u201covervaluation\u201d can be traced solely to Massachusetts assets, the \u201covervaluation\u201d or \u201cwrite-down\u201d should be applied to the \u201cMassachusetts tangibles\u201d in its entirety and not limited by a fraction which divides assets located in this State by the total assets of the company, wherever located.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">We are not persuaded. The transcript is replete with evidence that the \u201cwrite-down\u201d has its origin in the entire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>potentiality of the corporation and is not explained by the failure of specific assets, such as machinery, to generate their maximum return. The \u201cwrite-down\u201d occurs when the value of the capital stock is depressed and the formula for the value of the common stock has, as one of its components, the earnings record of the corporation for the preceding five years. Earnings may be depressed for any number of reasons ranging from the quality of the management to the general health of the industry. There are, quite obviously, innumerable intangibles which never appear on a balance sheet. Machinery and equipment are not usually unique items and do not alone explain why one firm has high earnings and thus a high valuation for its capital stock and another firm a much lower valuation. As was said in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cary Improvement Co. </em>98 Mass. 19, 22, \u201cthe property held by a corporation does not furnish a proper measure of the value of its capital stock regarded as a franchise.\u201d <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn. </em>v. <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>310 Mass. 674, 693. <em>United Shoe Mach. Corp. </em>v. <em>Gale Shoe Mfg. Co. </em>314 Mass. 142,157,158. As the \u201cwrite-down\u201d is attributable to a depressed capital stock value, a condition explained only in terms of the entire corporation both within and without this State, the commission was justified in refusing to apply the entire amount of the \u201cwrite-down\u201d to tangible property in Massachusetts. The particular limitation in Ruling 1957-2, while not the only formula that might have been used, was, we believe, a reasonable method of.protecting revenues. It \u201cfairly reflected the value\u201d of the assets involved \u201cin accordance with principles and methods consistent with the statutes and with a reasonable uniformity in their application.\u201d <em>State Tax Commn. </em>v. <em>Sears Roebuck &amp; Co. </em>344 Mass. 471, 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">The refusal of the taxpayer\u2019s requests for rulings raises no issues not already considered in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">\n<em>Decision affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b578-6\"> We are concerned only with \u00a7 V of this ruling, which reads,</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">\u201cValuation of Massachusetts Tangible Property not Subject to Local Taxation</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">\u201cIf the tax falls upon Massachusetts tangible property not subject to local taxation, the value of such property shall be determined as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">\u201c1.
