Chartrand became an examiner in the registry of motor vehicles in 1950. The registrar on January 11, 1960, sent Chartrand a letter stating certain charges, suspending him, and notifying him of a hearing on January 15, 1960, \u201cas to whether you shall be discharged, removed, transferred, or lowered in rank.\u201d On January 15, following the hearing, Chartrand \u201cwas notified [in writing] of the [registrar\u2019s] decision ... to discharge\u201d him upon certain of the charges. Chartrand received the notice on January 18,1960.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">Chartrand on January 18 talked with a lawyer. He saw the lawyer dial a number on the telephone and heard \u2018 \u2018Registrar Riley\u2019s voice.\u201d Upon objection Chartrand\u2019s testimony about the conversation was excluded. Chartrand claimed an exception and made an offer of proof (1) \u201cthat he had heard the registrar\u2019s voice approximately 100 times and had heard the registrar\u2019s voice on the telephone more than half a dozen times,\u201d and (2) that he \u201cheard him [the registrar] say that it was a mistake, that the discharge is of no effect, that he did not notify the department or the division of civil service\u201d and that Chartrand \u201cshould return to work.\u201d Chartrand also offered to prove that the registrar in the conversation asked Chartrand to \u201creturn the notice of discharge to . . . [the] counsel for the [registry ... so that the discharge would have no effect.\u201d Later on January 18, Chartrand went to the registry and talked with his immediate supervisor. The latter had approved Chartrand\u2019s annual vacation for February, 1960. Chartrand told the supervisor \u201cthat the discharge letter was a mistake and had been rescinded.\u201d The supervisor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>told Chartrand that there was \u201cno assignment for him, and that . . . [Chartrand] could use the . . . time remaining before . . . [his] vacation ... to start to effectuate a transfer,\u201d and that the registrar and the supervisor \u201cwould sign the transfer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">Chartrand\u2019s records and his testimony indicated that he was ill on certain days in January. February was his vacation period. Chartrand voluntarily reported to the registry every month after the vacation period in February.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The trial judge made the following findings, among others. \u201cA personnel service requisition dated April 1, 1960, was signed by the registrar and by the director of the department of administration and finance, which . . . indicated that the department . . . desired to appoint . . . [Chartrand] to a position. The document, after the inquiry \u2018Department where employed,\u2019 stated \u2018Registry of Motor Vehicles,\u2019 and stated in answer to another question that . . . [Chartrand] was at present in the State service. On May 19 the registrar . . . wrote to the director of civil service attaching a copy of the notice of discharge sent to \u2019 \u2019 Chartrand. Chartrand \u2018 \u2018 did not, within five days after receiving the registrar\u2019s notice of discharge, nor thereafter, request in writing a hearing before a member of the civil service commission or some disinterested person designated by the . . . commission . . . and accordingly no hearing was granted.\u201d No proceedings for review of Chartrand\u2019s discharge were taken, other than this petition for a writ of mandamus. See Gr. L. c. 31, \u00a7 43 (as amended through St. 1959, c. 569, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2), and \u00a7 45 (as amended through St. 1955, c. 407, \u00a7 2). The trial judge found that various State records or documents tended to indicate that Chartrand remained an employee after January 15, 1960. These findings are quoted in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial judge ruled that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>Chartrand \u201cwas legally discharged and his employment terminated on January 11, <em>I960,\u201d </em>that his \u201cdischarge . . . was not rescinded,\u201d that he \u201cwas not reinstated,\u201d \u201cthat the facts . . . found . . . have not served to maintain . . . [Chartrand\u2019s] status as an employee of the registry . . . and that ... he has not been such an employee since his discharge on January 15,1960.\u201d Chartrand duly excepted to the judge\u2019s rulings and to the denial of certain requests for rulings, summarized below so far as necessary. The case is before us upon Chartrand\u2019s bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">1. Chartrand first contends that State records, including records executed by officials of the registry of motor vehicles, indicate that he remained an employee of the registry during 1960. The trial judge\u2019s findings (see fn. 1, <em>supra) </em>with respect to these records were warranted. We assume, without deciding, that at least the report of the division of personnel and standardization listing Chartrand as on leave as of June 30, 1960, was a public record (see G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 30, as amended through St. 1952, c. 144) admissible in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Although the State records tended to show that Chartrand was a State employee, at the registry, after January 11, 1960 (see <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Brooks Hosp. Inc. </em>338 Mass. 754, 757-759), the judge reasonably could have found that the statements in these records were inaccurate in the light of the direct evidence of the hearing on January 15, 1960, and of Chartrand\u2019s purported discharge on that day. Counsel for Chartrand had \u2018 \u2018 stated for the record that there was no question that there was a suspension, a hearing, and a letter of discharge . . . all . . . done in accordance with statute.\u201d Similarly, the trial judge could have relied upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>\u201cpersonal service requisition\u201d seeking Chartrand\u2019s transfer to another State agency and upon Chartrand\u2019s testimony that he reported for work at this agency, as showing the inaccuracy of documents indicating that Chartrand was an employee at the registry after April, 1960.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The delay until May 19, 1960, in notifying the director of civil service of Chartrand\u2019s discharge may have been part of a kindly intended effort to arrange Chartrand\u2019s transfer to another State position. The evidence does not definitely disclose its purpose. Failure to send notice \u201cforthwith\u201d to the director of civil service of Chartrand\u2019s suspension and discharge was, of course, in direct violation of the applicable statute (see G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 18, as amended through St. 1947, c. 22). We are of opinion, however, that, under the statute, the delay did not invalidate the discharge. See <em>Thibeault </em>v. <em>New Bedford, </em>342 Mass. 552, 558. See also <em>Ferrante </em>v. <em>Higgiston, </em>296 Mass. 208, 209. If the Legislature had intended such a consequence, a more explicit provision to that effect would probably have been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">The trial judge did not err in denying Chartrand\u2019s requests for rulings in effect that the State records and documents in evidence required him to find that Chartrand remained an employee at the registry.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">2. Despite whatever latitude may be given to a trial judge in passing upon the authentication of telephone conversations (see McCormick, Evidence, \u00a7 194), we think that the trial judge should have admitted Chartrand\u2019s testimony about his attorney\u2019s alleged telephone talk with the registrar on January 18, 1960. The preliminary questions and offer of proof established that Chartrand knew the registrar\u2019s voice adequately, that he identified the voice, and that he overheard the conversation himself. See <em>Bond Pharmacy, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>338 Mass. 488, 490-491; McCormick, Evidence, \u00a7 193; Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 222, 413, 660, 2155. The circumstance that neither the attorney who made the call nor the registrar was called as a witness is a matter going only to the weight of the evidence and not to its admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>The telephone conversation, if believed, tended to establish an oral withdrawal of the discharge by the registrar. It would have been possible, even if such an inference was unlikely, to infer from the conversation that there was unequivocal withdrawal of the notice. If the judge had drawn this inference, his conclusions, which appear to have been based in large part upon the discharge notice, might have been different. If the registrar had treated the whole discharge proceeding as cancelled, there was evidential basis for concluding that he thereafter had prevented Chartrand from performing services, which the latter was ready and willing to perform, by failing to give him assignments. In the circumstances, on a confused record, we cannot say that failure to admit the telephone conversation was not prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">3. Because the exception to the exclusion of the telephone conversation must be sustained, we consider various questions which have been somewhat discussed in the briefs and which may arise in further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">(a) Other evidence gives little support for the view that the telephone conversation (if the testimony about it should be believed) completely nullified the discharge notice. Significant facts are (1) that Chartrand\u2019s supervisor on January 18, 1960, \u201chad no assignment for him\u201d and suggested that he \u201cstart to effectuate a transfer\u201d; (2) that the registrar himself approved a \u201cpersonal service requisition\u201d (a request for transfer to another State agency, dated April 1, 1960, under Gr. L. c. 31, \u00a7 16A, as amended through St. 1958, c. 55), of which Chartrand himself knew and which he signed; (3) that, as Chartrand testified, on April 6,1960, he reported for work at the other State agency; and (4) that he was requested to turn in his registry badge after he had signed the transfer requisition. This evidence would warrant the conclusion that any withdrawal of the discharge was conditional upon Chartrand\u2019s effecting a transfer to another State agency within a reasonable time.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>We think that even such a conditional oral* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> withdrawal of the discharge, at least before the discharge was reported to the director of civil service (see G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 18, as amended through St. 1947, c. 22), would have deprived the discharge notice of final effect and would have made impossible, before the discharge became final, an appeal to the Civil Service Commission under G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 43 (b), as amended through St. 1948, c. 240, \u201cwithin five days after receiving written notice of the decision of the appointing authority.\u201d In the absence of such an appeal to the commission, judicial review under G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 43 (d), as amended through St. 1955, c. 407, \u00a7 1, and \u00a7 45, as amended through St. 1955, c. 407, \u00a7 2, would also have been impossible. If it should be determined that there was a conditional withdrawal of the discharge notice, there thus would be basis for concluding that Chartrand was not barred from seeking seasonably relief by mandamus, merely because he had not exhausted his remedies under the statutes just cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">(b) Q-eneral Laws c. 31, \u00a7 46A, as amended through St. 1959, c. 569, \u00a7 5, requires that a petition for a writ of mandamus \u201cfor the reinstatement of any person alleged to have been illegally discharged ... be filed . . . within six months next following such allegedly illegal discharge.\u201d See <em>Coyne </em>v. <em>City Manager of Cambridge, </em>331 Mass. 270, 273. If this is a proper case for mandamus under \u00a7 46A (see <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Mayor of Medford, </em>320 Mass. 663, 667-668), it may be that it was not brought seasonably,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>record suggests (although it does not establish) that Chartrand knew or should have known that his discharge was being treated as final and effective as early as a date shortly after the communication of the discharge notice to the director of civil service on May 19, 1960. If so, Chartrand was required to pursue any remedy he had under Gr. L. c. 31, \u00a7 46A, within six months thereafter. On the other hand, it may appear that Chartrand did not learn (and had no occasion to learn) that the discharge notice was being treated as final until within six months prior to filing this petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">(c) Chartrand did no work at the registry after January 11, 1960. Certain documents in evidence indicate that he was on leave of absence without pay at least during the last ten months of 1960. As the registrar\u2019s brief suggests, any such leave of absence for over three months should have had the prior approval of the director of civil service as required by Gr. L. c. 31, \u00a7 46E, as amended through St. 1951, c. 37. If there was no such approval, the question will arise whether Chartrand\u2019s failure to work operated as a termination of his employment. See <em>Ferrante </em>v. <em>Higgiston, </em>296 Mass. 208, 209-210. See also <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Civil Serv. </em>279 Mass. 504, 509-510; <em>McKenney </em>v. <em>Dobbratz, </em>315 Mass. 39, 41; Rep. A. G., Pub. Doc. No. 12,1960, p. 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">(d) In any event, it will be incumbent upon Chartrand, in order to obtain relief, to establish facts showing that at the time of filing this petition he was still entitled to be treated as an employee of the registry (and that he had not been transferred to some other State agency) and that the registrar was under a clear duty to reinstate him. See <em>Knights </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Recr. Gen. </em>236 Mass. 336, 337. Cf. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>District Attorney for the No. Dist. </em>342 Mass. 212, 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">4. What has already been said sufficiently indicates that the registrar\u2019s motion to dismiss should not have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b365-6\"><em> </em>\u201cThe State Employees\u2019 Group Insurance Commission report for the month ending February 29, 1960, indicated that . . . [Chartrand] was \u2018Off February payroll pending . . . [approval] of empl. \u2019 Their report for the following month indicated that he was \u2018On leave w-o from 2-13-60.' The division of personnel and standardization listed Chartrand as of June 30, 1960, as on leave of absence. Records of the State Employees\u2019 Group Insurance Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>indicate that . . . [Chartrand] was retained on the rolls of the commission, for the purposes of coverage . . . throughout 1960. [It was stipulated by counsel that he received monthly notices to pay Blue Cross-Blue Shield and group insurance premiums through I960.] On January 6, 1961, the registry sent . . . [Chartrand] a form for conversion of his group life insurance coverage. . . . [A] notice, dated January 6, 1961, signed by the registrar, informed the division of civil service of . . . [Chartrand\u2019s] termination of employment, stating his last date of paid employment as January 11, 1960, and his services as terminated on January 15, 1960, following hearing.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b368-6\"> The record gives no satisfactory account of what, if anything, Chartrand did at the agency to which he was seeking transfer. The registrar denied an allegation in Chartrand\u2019s petition that the 1 \u2018 application [for transfer] was not approved by the director of civil service on the ground that . . . [Char<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>trand] lacked sufficient knowledge of accountancy.\u201d The \u201cpersonal service requisition\u201d shows what appears to be a rubber stamp signature, \u201cJohn E. Einnegan,\u201d director of personnel, under the word \u201cApproved.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b369-11\"> Obviously, such an important matter as cancelling (either absolutely or conditionally) the discharge of a civil service employee for cause should not have been handled by telephone or orally. The applicable statutes (see G. L. c. 31, \u00a7\u00a7 18 and 43, as amended) provide for precise, formal, written action at least in relation to other aspects of discharge. If such a matter was in fact dealt with orally, written confirmation of the oral action should have been made promptly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b369-12\"> There was failure to invoke this remedy (still in part discretionary, see <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Bacey, </em>329 Mass. 598, 600) for a considerable period in a situation where applicable statutes obviously contemplate that relief from allegedly illegal official action shall be sought promptly. See <em>Bowe </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>320 Mass. 230, 239. Of. <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Mayor of Boston, </em>193 Mass. 569, 574; <em>Sears v. Treasurer Sr Beer.
