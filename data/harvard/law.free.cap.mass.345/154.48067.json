The grounds were legal insufficiency; that the statements were not libellous or defamatory; that they had no tendency to hold the plaintiff up to hatred, ridicule or contempt, and were not reasonably capable of any defamatory meaning; and that the statements did not by their natural import or in connection with the facts alleged reflect adversely upon the plaintiff either as an individual or in his business or profession. The demurrers were sustained, and the plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">The plaintiff rightly concedes that the publication is not reasonably capable of any defamatory meaning; and that to report merely that a person has resigned his position, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>that his employment has terminated, is not defamatory. See <em>Ricci </em>v. <em>Crowley, </em>333 Mass. 26, 27; <em>Boston Nutrition Soc. Inc. </em>v. <em>Stare, </em>342 Mass. 439, 442; <em>Jack\u2019s Cookie Co. </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>227 F. 2d 935, 937 (4th Cir.), cert. den. sub nom. <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Jack\u2019s Cookie Co. </em>351 U. S. 908; <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Item Publishers, Inc. </em>309 N. Y. 596, 601; <em>Ratzel </em>v. <em>New York News Publishing Co. </em>67 App. Div. (N. Y.) 598, 600-601; <em>Gartmen </em>v. <em>Hedgpeth, </em>138 Texas, 73, 78; <em>Mulligan </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>10 Q. B. D. 549, 550-551; 138 A. L. R. 671; 53 C. J. S., Libel and Slander, \u00a7 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s brief summarizes his case as follows: The defendants, motivated by malice toward the plaintiff, knowingly caused a false publication to be made which resulted in injury to the plaintiff\u2019s reputation and impairment of his earning capacity. \u201cThis is not a case involving_inadvertent mistake or negligence, but of deliberate intent to injure the plaintiff through a false publication known to be false. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">(Unless the words \u201cfalsely and maliciously\u201d include an allegation of intent to injure by a false publication, there is no allegation of intent. If we assume that these words do include an allegation of an intentional injury of some kind, the crux of the declaration is that the false announcement of the resignation \u201cimplied\u201d toaconsiderable and respectable class of the community.....that...h^-had-lBieii_dM&amp;haj geU for a failure in duty. We think that this is not a reasonable implication, particularly to a class who knew the plaintiff well enough to know that he\" was on his regular vacation, had indicated no intentionUfresigning or of not returning to his position as cashier, and had not sought other employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">The plaintiff relies, upon Restatement.;...Ti3.r-is. \u00a7\u00a7 870, 873.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The present case does not make it necessary that we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>determine the extent to which any principles stated in those sections should be adopted as the law of this Commonwealth, because the allegations of the declaration do not fall within them. <em>Owens </em>v. <em>Mench, </em>81 D. <em>&amp; </em>C. (Pa.) 314, 316-317. In the plaintiff\u2019s argument reliance is now placed upon injury to reputation and impairment of earning capacity. On the allegations there is nothing to show that the defendants should have realized that this false report could cause an impairment of earning capacity. <em>McGurk </em>v. <em>Cronenwett, </em>199 Mass. 457. Likewise, in view of the concession that a mere report of a resignation cannot be defamatory, there is no allegation which indicates how this particular report could or did cause injury to reputation. It may be noted also that there are no allegations that either result was specifically intended, should that be a material consideration. Doo<em>ling </em>v. <em>Budget Publishing Co. </em>144 Mass. 258.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">In <em>Morasse </em>v. <em>Brochu, </em>151 Mass. 567, the intended injury to a physician in his profession was \u201cthe probable and natural result of the speaking of the words\u201d (p. 574). In two New York lower court cases, to which we are referred by the plaintiff, the damage due to the intentionally false statement was clearly to be anticipated. <em>Gale </em>v. <em>Ryan, </em>263 App. Div. (N. Y.) 76. <em>Schauder </em>v. <em>Weiss, </em>88 N. Y. S. 2d 317, affd. 276 App. Div. (N.

Liability for Intended Consequences. A person who does any tortious act for the purpose of causing harm to another or to his things or to the pecuniary interests of another is liable to the other for such harm if it results, except where the harm results from an outside force the risk of which is not increased by the defendant\u2019s act.\u201d \u201c\u00a7 873. Causing Harm by Intentionally False Statement. A person who, with knowledge of its falsity, makes an untrue statement concerning another which he realizes will harm the other is liable to the other for such resulting harm as he should have realized might be caused by Ms statement.\u201d See Halpern, Intentional Torts and the Restatement, 7 Buffalo L.
