No bail was fixed under the other indictments. The petitioner pleaded guilty to the unauthorized use of a motor vehicle and was sentenced to the Massachusetts Correctional Insti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>tution at Concord for an indefinite terra. The petitioner was found not guilty of the offence for which bail was fixed and the third indictment was filed without a finding. In prior proceedings in the District Court there had been three complaints and bail had been fixed only in the ease for possession of burglary tools.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">The petitioner contends that under G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 33A, as amended through St. 1958, c. 173, the sentencing judge should have ordered that the petitioner \u201cbe deemed to have served a portion of said sentence, such portion to be the number of days spent by the prisoner in confinement prior to such sentence awaiting and during trial.\u201d We agree that the petitioner was entitled to the benefit of this statute as to time spent in confinement from the time bail was fixed in the District Court under the related complaint. See <em>Stearns, petitioner, </em>343 Mass. 53 (time spent in mental hospital by insane prisoner awaiting trial is to be credited). Compare <em>Needel, petitioner, </em>344 Mass. 260 (time spent in confinement pursuant to sentence for an unrelated crime not to be credited). But the petitioner does not show how under the statutes regulating release of prisoners serving an indefinite sentence, or under any procedure of the Parole Board, an order under c. 279, \u00a7 33A, would have any effect to shorten his term. See G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 32; c. 127, \u00a7\u00a7 128-151. Compare G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 24; Consolidated Laws of New York \u201cAnn. Penal Law,\u201d \u00a7 2193. Furthermore, G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 129B, as amended through St. 1961, c. 74, provides for the same reduction in sentence \u201cunless the court in imposing such sentence had already deducted therefrom the time during which such prisoner had been confined while awaiting trial. \u2019 \u2019 Therefore, if the parole procedure is such that the petitioner\u2019s status will be affected by his right to this credit, that section will give him the benefit of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">It is unnecessary to consider the Commonwealth\u2019s contention that the writ of error is not the appropriate remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
