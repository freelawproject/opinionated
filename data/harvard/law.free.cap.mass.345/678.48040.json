At the close of the evidence, the trial judge allowed the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict, subject to the plaintiff\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-14\">We state the evidence most favorable to the plaintiff. The defendant owns commercial property in Brighton which she rents to Kennedy <em>&amp; </em>Co. a retailer of butter and eggs, who had been a tenant there prior to the defendant\u2019s acquisition of the property in 1951. The defendant owns an open lot to the rear of the building from which access could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>be gained to an adjoining street, and \u201cover which, area deliveries and collection[s] could be made to the rear of Kennedy\u2019s and which lot was used to make deliveries to Kennedy\u2019s by the plaintiff.\u201d This lot contained a \u201cdry well\u201d for drainage and two \u201carea ways.\u201d An \u201carea way\u201d is a \u201chole in the ground near a cellar window to allow light, air and deliveries to the cellar.\u201d The \u201carea way\u201d in question was the one closer to the rear door of Kennedy\u2019s. It was located a foot out from the rear wall of the premises and two to three feet to the right of Kennedy\u2019s rear door as one faced the rear of the building. The hole was covered by \u201cmatched boards one inch thick and approximately 2 feet wide and 4 feet long,\u201d and \u201ccovered by dirt and appeared to be part of the ground. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">On March 19,1959, the plaintiff, a truck driver, was making a delivery of goods to Kennedy\u2019s. In the course of unloading the goods the plaintiff \u201cstepped from the rear step of his truck down a distance of 3 feet onto the \u2018area way\u2019 cover\u201d which \u201cgave way beneath the plaintiff and he fell 3 or 4 feet into the . . . hole,\u201d thereby suffering injury. An examination of the cover revealed that \u201cthe wooden underpinnings and supports were water soaked and rotted and were below the ground level. \u2019 \u2019 From time to time the \u201cdry well\u201d located in the area owned by the defendant to the rear of the \u201carea ways\u201d became \u201cblocked up by debris and flooded this area with water and kept this area wet all the time and ... on a number of occasions the cellar of Kennedys became flooded because of this condition.\u201d The defendant\u2019s employees, either on request by the health department or as a result of complaint by the tenants in the area, would clean out the debris and unblock the dry well to permit drainage. There was testimony that under these circumstances a wooden cover below ground level would rot and that all other \u201carea ways\u201d in this group of buildings were bordered by masonry and covered by iron rods.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">The defendant had four employees whose duties were to \u201cmake repairs\u201d on the defendant\u2019s various properties and who \u2018 \u2018 at one time made repairs to the Kennedy front and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>Kennedy\u2019s rear door.\u201d The defendant\u2019s carpenter foreman learned of the accident from the defendant\u2019s renting agent on the following day and he \u201cwent to the premises to see the condition and to see what materials he would need to make repairs, however, the \u2018area way\u2019 cover had already been replaced. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">The defendant contends that the directed verdict should be upheld because the plaintiff \u201cfailed to show that there has been a change in the condition of the property and particularly the \u2018area way\u2019 where he was injured between the date of the new letting between Kennedy &amp; Co. and the defendant and the date of the plaintiff\u2019s injury.\u201d It is true that with respect to common areas used by tenants over which the landlord retains control, the landlord owes to his tenants \u201cthe duty to use reasonable care to keep the common areas in as good a condition as that in which they were or appeared to be at the time of the creation of the tenancy.\u201d <em>Crea </em>v. <em>Stunzenas, </em>344 Mass. 265, 267. However, this rule has been restricted to \u201ccommon\u201d ways or passageways such as stairs. Its inapplicability to cases of another nature has been pointed out quite often. <em>Yorra </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em>226 Mass; 153, 155. <em>Gilroy </em>v. <em>Badger, </em>301 Mass. 494, 496-497. <em>Globe Leather &amp; Shoe Findings, Inc. </em>v. <em>Golburgh, </em>339 Mass. 380, 382. In the instant case it does not appear that the tenant, Kennedy &amp; Co., used the \u201carea way\u201d in question in \u2018 \u2018 common\u2019 \u2019 with even one other tenant. See <em>Flanagan </em>v. <em>Welch, </em>220 Mass. 186, 191-192. The defendant\u2019s brief itself points out that the \u201cplaintiff has not shown that the \u2018area way\u2019 where the plaintiff injured himself was a common way or area. \u201d It is precisely this fact which renders inoperable the rule of law for which the defendant argues.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">Where no \u201ccommon passageway\u201d is involved, the rule is that a person in control of a building, or of a part thereof, is required to exercise reasonable care to keep it in such condition that others will not be injured in their persons or property. <em>Grasselli Dyestuff Corp. </em>v. <em>John Campbell &amp; Co. </em>259 Mass. 103, 108. <em>Gilroy </em>v. <em>Badger, </em>301 Mass. 494, 496. \u201cThis duty of due care extends as much to an occu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>pant of another part of the same building, whether the negligent person be landlord or tenant, as it does to an adjoining proprietor or to a traveller on the highway.\u201d <em>Gilroy </em>v. <em>Badger, supra, </em>496. Compare <em>Chalfen </em>v. <em>Kraft, </em>324 Mass. 1, 4; <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Broitman, </em>338 Mass. 770, 772-773. If this duty extends to a traveler on the highway, then it must extend also to a business invitee of the owner\u2019s tenant, a status conceded to the plaintiff in the defendant\u2019s brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">We believe a jury could have found that the \u201carea way\u201d wherein the plaintiff hurt himself was not a 1 <em>\u2018 </em>common passageway,\u201d that the defendant owner retained control over the exterior of the building and surrounding areas, and that the defendant or her employees failed to exercise due care in the maintenance of such areas. It was error, therefore, to direct a verdict for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
