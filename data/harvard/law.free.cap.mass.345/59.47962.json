L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 273, \u00a7 11. The defendant was found guilty and appealed. At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>the trial in the Superior Court, before a jury, he was again found guilty. The case is here on the defendant\u2019s exception to the denial of his motion for a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The complainant testified as to sexual relations with the defendant on several occasions, the last time being early in July, 1960, and that a child was born to her on April 10, 1961; that at the time of conception and birth of the child she was a married woman; that she had \u201cnot seen . . . [her] husband in six years\u201d; and that she made no \u201cdirect statement\u201d to the defendant that he was the father until she made the complaint upon which the defendant was tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">A birth certificate, admitted in evidence, shows her husband and the father of the child to be Walter Lewis Radcliffe, and the complainant and her husband to be residents of Hyannis, Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">The only question raised and argued in the defendant\u2019s brief is \u201cwhether there have been sufficient facts to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant\u2019s husband had no access to her during the period of time when, according to the course of nature, he could have been the father of the child.\u201d The defendant \u201ccontends that as a matter of law the statement \u2018I have not seen my husband in six years\u2019 by the complaining witness is insufficient proof to overcome the presumption that a child born in wedlock is legitimate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">\u201cThe legal presumption always is, that a child born in lawful wedlock is legitimate. But this presumption may be rebutted by . . . facts which prove, beyond all reasonable doubt, that the husband could not have been the father.\u201d <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Allen, 2 </em>Allen, 453, 454. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kitchen, 299 </em>Mass. 7, 9. This presumption may be overcome by proof of impotency of the husband, or his non-access to the wife, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kitchen, supra, </em>8, or exclusion by a blood grouping test made in a scientific manner by a duly qualified person and where there is no dispute among the experts. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>D\u2019Avella, </em>339 Mass. 642, 647.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Circo, </em>293 Mass. 361, the presumption of legitimacy was overcome by the complainant\u2019s testimony that she had not seen her husband for about two years and that at the time of conception she had moved from her home to the city of Boston. The same result was accomplished in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosenblatt, </em>219 Mass. 197, 198, by the mother\u2019s testimony that her husband had deserted her more than three years before the child was begotten and that she had not seen him since. There was also \u201csome evidence tending to show\u201d that the husband was in Europe. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kitchen, supra, </em>9, the presumption of legitimacy was overcome by the mere testimony of the complainant \u201cthat she has not seen or held any communication with her husband and was and is unaware of his whereabouts ...\u201d for a period of 305 days before the birth of the child. In the instant case the testimony was of nonaccess for a period of six years.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">The only witness to nonaccess was the mother. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kitchen, supra, </em>9. We are of opinion that her testimony was sufficient to overcome the presumption of legitimacy. The jury could, and apparently did, believe her testimony. There was no error in the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
