L. c. 41, \u00a7 108E, inserted by St. 1959, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>c. 228 (providing minimum salaries for members of local police forces in communities accepting the section \u201cby vote of the city council, subject to the provisions of the charter\u201d). On November 25, 1959, the mayor \u201cvetoed . . . [the] order.\u201d On December 1, 1959, the board by an eight to two vote, with one alderman absent, voted to pass the order over the mayor\u2019s veto. Thereafter, a group of citizens circulated a referendum petition (see G. L. c. 43, \u00a7\u00a7 38, 42)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> protesting the board\u2019s action, which was filed on December 15, 1959, with the city clerk. The city clerk on that day transmitted the petition to the board of registrars of voters, which on December 21,1959, certified \u201cthe names of the registered voters on . . . [the] petition [to be] in excess of twelve per cent ... of the registered voters of . . . Holyoke\u201d and on December 21, 1959, transmitted to the city clerk\u2019s office the petition together with the certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The mayor requested the city clerk to call a special meeting of the board of aldermen for December 21 to act upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>the petition. The minutes of that meeting stated that the president of the board \u201cmade note of the fact that the petitions protesting the establishment of the minimum compensation bills for the [p]olice and [fjirefighters were in the [c]hamber and on the desk of the [c]lerk of the [b]card.\u201d A quorum was lacking both then and on December 29, the date to which \u201cthe [December 21] meeting was recessed.\u201d On December 30, to which the meeting again had been \u201crecessed,\u201d the board took action on another matter but took no affirmative action on the referendum petition. On January 19,1960, the board, purporting to act pursuant to Gr. L. c. 43, \u00a7\u00a7 38-44, \u201cvoted to call a [s]pecial [e]lection ... on the questions concerning minimum annual compensation for [p]olicemen.\u201d At this election a majority of the votes cast were against approval of the board\u2019s action in accepting St. 1959, c. 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">The present bill<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> is brought by three present members and one retired member of the Holyoke police department for declaratory relief with respect to the proceedings already described, and for a determination whether G-. L. c. 41, \u00a7 108E, was accepted by Holyoke as a consequence of any of these proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">There was an \u201cagreement as to all the material facts,\u201d including the fact that Holyoke has accepted St. 1953, c. 343, so that G. L. c. 43, \u00a7\u00a7 37-44, inclusive, \u201cbecame a part of the [c]harter of ... Holyoke.\u201d See St. 1896, c. 438. The case was reported by a judge of the Superior Court without decision for our determination upon the pleadings and that agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">The plaintiffs contend that the provisions of G. L. c. 43, \u00a7 42 (see fn. 2, <em>supra) </em>were not satisfied in that (1) \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>referendum petition was not presented to the [b]card of [a]ldermen . . . within the required twenty days,\u201d and (2) the board \u201cdid not immediately, or at any time, reconsider its order accepting the provisions of ... c. 41, \u00a7 108E.\u201d There is no merit in either contention.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">1. The physical presence of the referendum petition and of the registrars \u2019 certificate at the December 21 meeting of the board of aldermen was an adequate compliance with the requirement of G. L. c. 43, \u00a7 42 (as amended through St. 1935, c. 68, \u00a7 2) that a referendum petition \u201cwithin twenty days after the final passage of any measure . . . [be] presented to the\u201d board of aldermen. Mo thing in the relevant statutes suggests that the absence of a quorum on December 21, 1959, prevented such a presentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Even if filing the uncertified petition with the city clerk did not constitute presentation of the petition to the city council (see <em>Carriere </em>v. <em>Board of Registrars of Voters of Fitchburg, </em>257 Mass. 287), the city clerk\u2019s possession, in his capacity as clerk of the board, of both the referendum petition and the registrars\u2019 certificate satisfied the final provision of G. L. c. 43, \u00a7 38, prescribing that \u201c [t]he city clerk shall forthwith transmit the . . . certificate with the . . . petition to the city council.\u201d We perceive no statutory basis for implying any further action as necessary to effect presentation of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">In the <em>Carriere </em>case, 257 Mass. 287, 288, it was said that \u00a7 42 required that the initial filing with the city clerk be sufficiently early \u201cto enable the registrars of voters to make the certificate required by \u00a7 38, so that the city clerk may present the petition and certificate to the city council \u2018within twenty days after the final passage of the measure.\u2019 \u201d Even if we assume this conclusion to have been correct, the decision seems to proceed upon the assumption that presentation to the city council would be effected when the petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>and the registrars\u2019 certificate were transmitted by the city clerk to the council.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 6</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">2. We do not interpret the requirement of G. L. c. 43, \u00a7 42 (see fn. 2, <em>supra), </em>that \u201cthe city council . . . immediately reconsider such measure\u201d as requiring council action at any precise time or in any specific manner. The fair import of the provision is that, if the council within a reasonable time does not decide that the measure is to be \u201centirely rescinded,\u201d then the measure is to be submitted to the voters. On January 19, 1960, without entirely rescinding the vote of December 1, 1959, the board of aldermen voted to call a special election. This was adequate compliance with the relevant procedural requirements of G. L. c. 43, \u00a7\u00a7 38 and 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">3. As the plaintiffs concede, the interpretation of \u00a7\u00a7 38 and 42 for which they contend \u201cwould permit the very legislative bodies whose actions are . . . reviewable by . . . referendum ... to avoid the [referendum] entirely; merely by failing to meet within twenty days or failing to reconsider an action already approved by . . . its membership, a . . . [c]ouncil could forestall a referendum.\u201d That the plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation of these sections would thus tend to make the sections wholly ineffective is strong indication that this interpretation does not reflect the legislative intention. See <em>Selectmen of Topsfield </em>v. <em>State Racing Commn. </em>324 Mass. 309, 314.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">The plaintiffs\u2019 contentions would probably not be advanced, were it not for the <em>Carriere </em>decision, 257 Mass. 287, which tended to frustrate the obvious legislative intention of the somewhat confusing language of \u00a7\u00a7 38 and 42, to provide a simple, practicable method of obtaining municipal referenda. We doubt whether the <em>Carriere </em>case would be followed today even upon its precise facts. This, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>is probably an academic question in view of the 1961 legislation (see fns. 2, 5, <em>supra). </em>In any event, the <em>Garriere </em>case is not controlling upon these different facts. We are not willing to extend its application.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">4. The case is remanded to the Superior Court. A decree is to be entered declaring that Holyoke did not by any proceedings described in the record accept St. 1959, c. 228. Costs are to be in the discretion of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b218-6\"> Section 42 (as amended through St. 1935, c. 68, \u00a7 2) reads, \u201cIf, within twenty days after the final passage of any measure ... by the city council ... a petition signed by registered voters of the city, equal in number to at least twelve per cent of the total number of registered voters [and addressed to the city council . . .] <em>is presented to the city council </em>. . . protesting against such measure . . . taking effect [is filed with the city clerk], the same shall . . . be suspended from taking effect; and the city council . . . shall immediately reconsider such measure . . . and if such measure ... is not entirely rescinded, the city council shall submit the same ... to a vote of the registered voters of the city . . . and such measure . . . shall forthwith become null and void unless a majority of the registered voters voting . . . vote in favor thereof. The petition . . . shall be termed a referendum petition and section thirty-eight shall apply to the procedure in respect thereto, except that the words \u2018measure . . . protested against\u2019 shall for this purpose be understood to replace \u2018measure\u2019 in said section wherever it may occur, and \u2018referendum\u2019 shall be understood to replace the word \u2018initiative\u2019 in said section.\u201d By St. 1961, c. 5501, effective August 25, 1961, the words shown above in brackets were added and the words italicized above were omitted. Section 38 reads, \u201cSignatures to initiative petitions need not be all on one paper. All such papers pertaining to any one measure . . . shall be filed in the office of the city clerk .... Within five days after the filing of said petition the registrars of voters shall ascertain by what number of registered voters the petition is signed, and what percentage that number is of the total number of registered voters, and shall attach thereto their certificate showing the result of such examination. The city clerk shall forthwith transmit the said certificate with the said petition to the city council . . ..\u201d The term \u2018\u2018city council\u201d in \u00a7\u00a7 38 and 42 refers \u201cin a city which has no such body . . . [to] the board . . . having like powers or duties.\u201d Gr. L. e. 4, \u00a7 7 (definition of \u201caldermen,\u201d etc.). See <em>Kaeble </em>v. <em>Mayor of Chicopee, </em>311 Mass. 260, 261; <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Holyoke, </em>342 Mass. 669, 671.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b219-7\"> The original papers in <em>Monty </em>v. <em>Mayor of Holyoke, </em>342 Mass. 781, show that persons purporting to be \u201cmembers of the regular [p]oliee [department and regular [f]ire department of . . . Holyoke\u201d brought a bill (\u201cin their individual capacities and on behalf of the entire membership \u2019 \u2019 of such departments) for declaratory relief relating to the same votes of the board of aider-men and the same referendum vote of the registered voters as are here involved. In that case it was decided that Holyoke had not accepted St. 1958, c. 621, relating to minimum pay of members of the fire department. The members of the police department, who were plaintiffs in the <em>Monty </em>case, discontinued their proceedings prior to the arguments in that ease. See <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Holyoke, </em>342 Mass. 669.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b220-8\"> In view of our disposition of these contentions, we do not pause to consider certain other issues discussed, in the briefs, such as loches and the effect of a stipulation in the earlier litigation (see fn. 3, <em>supra) </em>and of a release given to the city by some members of the police department at about the time of a pay increase effective January 1, 1961.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b221-8\"> The 1961 amendments of \u00a7 42 (see fn. 2, <em>supra), </em>of course, have no application to these events in 1959 and. early 1960. There is nothing in the legislative history of the 1961 amendments (see 1961 House Doc. Ho. 618; 1961 Senate Doc. Ho. 651; 1961 Senate Journal, pp. 699, 1050, 1069, 1079; 1961 House Journal, pp. 1058, 1085, 1649, 1658) to indicate that the \u00cd961 Legislature regarded the then existing provisions of \u00a7 42 as requiring more.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
