The defendant answered (1) a general denial and (2) that \u201cthere was a failure of consideration in plaintiff\u2019s performance of its contract upon which recovery herein is sought\u201d by virtue of unskilful treatment of the defendant\u2019s wife which resulted in injury to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>The only witness at the trial was the assistant manager in the office of the plaintiff who had charge of all hospital records. Over the defendant\u2019s objection she testified to the itemized charges on the \u201cCooper account,\u201d that they were fair and reasonable, and to a credit of $110.60 appearing on the account, the origin of which was not identified. On a claim of report by the defendant the Appellate Division found no error in the admission of this evidence. With that conclusion we concur. See G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 78; <em>Household Fuel Corp. </em>v. <em>Hamacher, </em>331 Mass. 653, 658.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Both parties having rested, the defendant made requests for rulings,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 23all of which were denied by the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">It is argued by the defendant that there was no evidence to support a finding that the defendant is the husband of the patient to whom there was supplied hospital care and board. A hospital record, duly admitted, was that of the \u201cAccount of John Cooper, for Alice Cooper, 1011 Centre Street, Brockton.\u201d The writ described the defendant as \u201cJohn Cooper of 1011 Centre Street, Brockton, Plymouth County, Massachusetts.\u201d The return of service states that the deputy sheriff made an attachment of property of the \u201cwithin named . . . John Cooper, 1,011 Centre Street, Brockton\u201d and \u201cafterwards on September 20, 1961, . . . summoned the within named defendant, John Cooper, to appear and answer at Court as within directed, by giving to him in hand a summons of this writ. \u2019 \u2019 The defendant appeared in response to this summons. While \u201cbald identity of name without confirmatory facts or circumstances is not enough to indicate identity of person,\u201d <em>Ayers </em>v. <em>Ratshesky, </em>213 Mass. 589, 594, there is evidence here which goes beyond \u201cbald identity.\u201d The name and address appearing in the writ, the return, and the hospital record are identical. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>defendant appeared and answered. The judge could find that the \u201cJohn Cooper\u201d who had joined issue upon the merits was the same \u201cJohn Cooper\u201d named in the hospital record. <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>DiPaolo, </em>313 Mass. 492, 494-495. There was slight but sufficient evidence before the judge to warrant him in holding the defendant liable for the care of the patient, the cost of which was itemized in the account. <em>Herman </em>v. <em>Fine, </em>314 Mass. 67, 69. The judge properly denied those requests which sought rulings to the effect that the services rendered by the hospital were not necessary. All of the defendant\u2019s requests were properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">\n<em>Order dismissing report affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b659-7\"> \u201c1. Upon all the evidence a finding for the defendant is required. 2. Upon all the evidence plaintiff has failed to establish that the charges for room and board were necessary items, and, therefore, cannot recover. 3. Upon all the evidence plaintiff has failed to establish that the items alleged were necessaries, and, therefore, cannot recover. 4. Upon all the evidence plaintiff has failed to establish the fair value of the items alleged due from the defendant, and, therefore, cannot recover. 5. Upon all the evidence there is no privity of contract between plaintiff and defendant. 6. Plaintiff has failed to establish that defendant is the husband of the party for whom charges as alleged were made, and, therefore, cannot recover.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
