MacMackin, sought an adjudication as to the right of the town of Lancaster to enforce a lien under O. L. c. 118A, \u00a7 4, against real estate of Rose for old age assistance furnished her from February 9, 1956, to February 9,1961, the date of her death. The lien is asserted against real estate which Rose and her late husband, Archie<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, owned as tenants by the entirety on February 9, 1956, when notice of lien was filed. The notice applied to real estate of Archie as well as of Rose as aid had also been furnished the husband. No claim is made that there is an existing lien for the aid to Archie. See <em>Weaver </em>v. <em>New Bedford, </em>335 Mass. 644.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-16\">The judge in the Superior Court ruled in substance that the lien of February 9, 1956, was valid against the entire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>interest of Bose as surviving tenant by the entirety. That ruling and the consonant final decree were right.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">General Laws c. 118A, \u00a7 4, gives a lien on \u201can interest in real estate.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Bose\u2019s interest in the real estate during coverture was not transferable by her and could not be attached and sold upon execution. <em>Licker </em>v. <em>Gluskin, </em>265 Mass. 403. <em>Pineo </em>v. <em>White, </em>320 Mass. 487, 490-491, and cases cited. \u201cThe husband enjoys many incidents of ownership during coverture, while the exercise of similar incidents by the wife lies dormant.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>p. 491. But c. 118A, \u00a7 4, does not limit the interests subject to lien thereunder to those which could be conveyed by the wife or attached by her creditors. The wife\u2019s interest is of sufficient substance so that by general principles, except for the limitations applicable to real estate of women at common law, it would be subject to conveyance and attachment. <em>Licker </em>v. <em>Gluskin, </em>265 Mass. 403, 406-407. The limitations of the common law do not restrict the power of the Legislature. During coverture the wife\u2019s interest and her husband\u2019s \u201cwere \u2018one indivisible estate in them both and the survivor of them.\u2019 <em>Wales </em>v. <em>Coffin, </em>13 Allen, 213, 215. <em>Hoag </em>v. <em>Hoag, </em>213 Mass. 50.\u201d <em>Pineo </em>v. <em>White, </em>320 Mass. 487, 491. The surviving wife took no new title when her husband died. \u201cUpon . . . [his] death the estate simply was freed from participation by him.\u201d <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Recr. Gen. </em>222 Mass. 263, 265. The purpose of the statute that the town be reimbursed from the property of the recipient of aid, at a time when hardship will be avoided, is served by the ruling that this substantial interest in the wife is one to which c. 118A, \u00a7 4, applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">We recognize that under this construction the town may not enforce the lien during the husband\u2019s lifetime notwith<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>standing the statutory direction so to do either \u201cupon the death of the recipient or . . . [her] otherwise ceasing to receive old age assistance. \u2019 \u2019 Although there is in this provision of the statute some indication of an intent to limit the interests subject to lien to those against which the lien may be enforced at any time after it arises, we think the general purpose of the statute is controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b206-17\"> Archie died on December 5, 1958.
