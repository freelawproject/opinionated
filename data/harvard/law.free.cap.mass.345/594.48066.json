The policy covered the vehicle which injured the plaintiffs on September 22,1957. The trial judge found that this vehicle, driven by the defendant Dakas, \u201cwas proceeding at a high rate of speed and went out of control upon the public way, entered upon . . . [private] property . . . and struck the plaintiffs \u2019 car. \u2019 \u2019 The plaintiffs \u2019 automobile was then upon property occupied by a Howard Johnson restaurant at a point \u201cfifteen to twenty feet from the line of the State highway.\u201d The judge ruled that the accident was within the policy coverage, i.e., providing indemnity for bodily injuries \u201carising out of the . . . operation ... [of the vehicle] upon the ways of the commonwealth.\u201d Westchester appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">The judge\u2019s ruling was correct. See <em>Desmarais </em>v. <em>Standard Acc. Ins. Co. </em>331 Mass. 199, 200-203, and cases cited. Here the cause of the injury was the negligent operation of the vehicle upon a public way. In view of the terms of the coverage, it is immaterial that the impact of Gogas\u2019s automobile upon the plaintiffs, and their injuries, caused by the operation upon the highway, occurred after the entire automobile had left the highway and had entered upon private property. See G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34A (as amended through St. 1949, c. 571, \u00a7 1<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed with costs of the appeal.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b637-6\"> See later amendments by St. 1959, c. 282, \u00a7 3, and St. 1951, c. 177, \u00a7 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
