He was tried before a jury, found guilty on each count, and sentenced to a term of not more than ten years and not less than seven years. The defendant is here on his exception to the denial of his motion for a directed verdict on count 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-14\">There was evidence that several police officers went to the defendant\u2019s home at 564 Warren Street, Roxbury, on March 21,1961; that some of the officers engaged in a conversation with the defendant; that, while the conversation was taking place, two officers found some heroin and other narcotics in a common hallway which led down from the rear of the defendant\u2019s apartment; that, when shown the drugs found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>in the hall, the defendant admitted that the heroin was his bnt denied that any of the other narcotics belonged to him. The heroin found was worth about $80 retail value. The defendant admitted that he had been an habitual user of heroin but had \u201ckicked it three weeks ago.\u201d There was further testimony that the defendant and the officers went to the cellar of the defendant\u2019s house where he showed the officers other narcotics, none of which was heroin, hidden behind a board.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">There was no direct evidence of any intention to sell or deliver the heroin in question and there are no cases or statutes in this jurisdiction creating any presumption that a person who has possession of heroin has it with the intention to sell it. The Commonwealth\u2019s case, therefore, rests solely on circumstantial evidence, the rule for the probative character of which is well settled. It is that \u201cthe circumstances must be such as to produce a moral certainty of guilt, and to exclude any other reasonable hypothesis ; \u2018. . . the circumstances taken together should be of a conclusive nature and tendency, leading on the whole to a satisfactory conclusion, and producing, in effect, a reasonable and moral certainty, that the accused, and no one else, committed the offence charged. \u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>5 Cush. 295, 319.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>339 Mass. 521, 527.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">While the rule of law is clear, it is not always easily applied. On the sparse evidence presented the Commonwealth has shown merely the bare possession of heroin coupled with the defendant\u2019s admission that although he had been a user of heroin he had \u201ckicked it three weeks ago.\u201d It is argued that, since the defendant admitted that he had not personally used the heroin for that period, his only object in retaining possession of it must have been to sell it. However, another plausible explanation comes readily to mind, which would permit a contrary inference to be drawn with at least as much justification. A drug addict might retain $80 worth of a narcotic upon which he was formerly dependent until he was certain he had de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>feated the habit. On previous occasions he may have attempted to terminate his addiction to drugs and failed. As frequently happens with cigarette smokers or drinkers he may have wished to test his will power to resist taking the narcotic while still retaining possession of the drug.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">The inference that the defendant held the heroin with the intention to sell it is no more compelling than the inference we stated above. \u201cWhen the evidence tends equally to sustain either of two inconsistent propositions, neither of them can be said to have been established by legitimate proof.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>305 Mass. 393, 400. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>306 Mass. 141, 147. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>339 Mass. 521, 528-529. \u201cA verdict in favor of the party bound to maintain one of those propositions against the other is necessarily wrong. \u2019 \u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, supra, </em>400. In choosing among the possible inferences from the evidence presented, a jury necessarily would have had to employ conjecture. This is insufficient to sustain the burden resting upon the Commonwealth. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Albert, </em>310 Mass. 811, 817.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">When the evidence in the case at bar is considered in the light of the governing principles of law, we are of opinion that the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
