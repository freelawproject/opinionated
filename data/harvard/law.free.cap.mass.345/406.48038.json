L. c. 121, \u00a7 26K, as amended through St. 1954, c. 72, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2) operates twenty-seven housing projects in Boston, including sixteen federally aided projects containing an aggregate of 10,242 dwelling units and producing total annual rents of $6,446,520. On September 20, 1960, the commissioner asked the authority to supply a list of the classifications of work performed by the groups of employees referred to in \u00a7 26T (see fn. 1, <em>supra). </em>The authority did so, and later furnished additional information. On October 26, 1960, the commissioner determined the wage rates to be paid to employees in certain classifications, and on April 6, 1961, made a similar determination with respect to two other classifications. A schedule of his wage rate determinations and of certain related Federal wage rate determinations is set out in the margin.* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Public Housing Administration (PHA), the successor of United States Housing Authority (see 12 Fed. Reg. 4981), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>was originally created in 1937 by Pub. Law (75th Gong., 1st Sess.) 412, 50 Stat. 888-899, now found, as amended, in 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1401-1435 (1958). See 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1401-1436 (Supp. III, 1962). On June 24, 1959, the authority entered into a \u201cconsolidated annual contributions contract\u201d with PHA. Section 407 of part two of this contract (as amended) requires the authority to submit to PHA its proposed annual operating budgets for each project (or on a consolidated basis for all the authority\u2019s projects). The authority (after an initial period) may \u201cnot . . . incur any operating expenditures . . . except ... in accordance with an . . . operating budget,\u201d approved by PHA, with certain exceptions not here relevant. See \u00a7 407(H). The authority may submit to PHA requests for revision of any approved budget. The budget, in various respects, is clearly important in assisting PHA \u201cto assure the low-rent character of the project.\u201d The contract (part two, \u00a7\u00a7 415, 418) provides in effect that the annual contribution shall be within a stated maximum.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">On or before August 12,1960, PHA \u201cmade a comprehensive survey of the prevailing wage rates being paid by public and private employers in the . . . Boston [area] to like classifications of employees of . . . [the] authority in order to determine the prevailing wage rates in compliance with ...[\u00a7] 16 (2) of the United States Housing Act as amended [42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1416 (2) (1958)]. . . . [0]n August 12, 1960 . . . [PHA] made prevailing wage rate deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>minations pursuant to . . . [\u00a7] 16 (2) ... and on September 1, 1960, forwarded such determinations to the . . . authority. . . . The[se] wage rates . . . were predicated on the survey .... [T]he . . . authority paid its employees and is now paying its employees the wage rates determined by . . . [PHA] effective April 1,1960. \u2019 \u2019 PHA has not adopted the wage rates determined hy the commissioner. On December 2,1960, PHA by circular letter <em>11 </em>cautioned\u201d all housing authorities in Massachusetts \u201cnot to exceed\u201d the PHA wage rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">The total increase in the authority\u2019s operating budgets due to the commissioner\u2019s wage determinations of October 26,1960, and April 6,1961, was $286,492. These determinations, in most instances, are higher than those made by PHA (see fn. 2, <em>supra).</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The authority has been receiving the maximum subsidy from PHA on projects aided by it and from the Commonwealth on projects aided by the State.4 <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> None of the authority\u2019s employees is \u201cengaged in the construction of public works as distinguished from the development or administration of housing projects.\u201d The basis of the commissioner\u2019s determinations<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> is discussed later in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">The authority contends that the commissioner\u2019s orders are void as to federally aided projects because (a) they impair the obligation of the authority\u2019s contract with PHA, (b) they invade a field which the authority says has been preempted by congressional legislation and administrative action, and (c) they seek to compel a breach by the author<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>ity of the contract with PHA. The authority also contends that the orders were arbitrary and capricious, especially in their application to janitors.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Because the case presented issues that might seriously affect PHA and also the State Housing Board, we caused inquiry to be made whether either body wished to intervene or to have counsel in its behalf file a brief as amicus curiae. Each agency disclaimed any such wish. The Department of Justice, however, in behalf of PHA, has filed a \u201cstatement of interest,\u201d in general asserting that a decision adverse to the position of the authority \u201cmight . . . seriously impair or defeat the accomplishment of . . . [the] objective\u201d of furnishing low cost housing, found in the Hnited States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1401-1435 [1958]) and in related State legislation. See G. L. c. 121, \u00a7\u00a7 261 et seq., as amended.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">1. We interpret G. L. c. 121, \u00a7 26T, as amended in 1960 (see fn. 1, <em>supra), </em>as directing the commissioner to set wage rates of the several classifications of housing authority employees \u201cat no less than eighty per cent\u201d of the wage standard prescribed under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 26 (see also \u00a7 27),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>relating to wages in public works construction. This minimum is to apply at least to each classification of housing authority employees for which there is any properly comparable classification of public works construction employees. We discuss later (part 5 of this opinion) the authority\u2019s contention that there is no close similarity, in respect of wages and working conditions (a) of janitors and maintenance workers in certain other classifications and (b) any class of construction employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">2. The provision of the United States Housing Act of 1937 bearing most directly on wage rates in housing projects is 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1416 (2) (1958).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This section seems to imply that, as to maintenance employees, the wage standards generally \u201cprevailing in the locality\u201d for such employees are to be applied, whereas, as to at least some classes of development employees, the local wage standards in the construction field (determined under the Davis-Bacon Act) are to govern. Section 1416 (2) directs PHA to determine wage standards \u201csubsequent to a determination under applicable State . . . law,\u201d but does not seem to require that PHA be controlled by such State determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Section 1416 (2) prescribes only a minimum wage rate. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>Another section (see 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1415 [5] [Snpp. III, 1962]), however, requires, in \u201corder to insure that the low-rent character of . . . projects will be preserved, and that the other purposes of . . . [the act] will be achieved, \u2019 \u2019 that contributions contracts \u201cprovide that . . . [each] project shall be [so] undertaken . . . that . . . economy will be promoted both in construction and administration.\u201d This provision amply authorizes PHA to impose PHA budgetary supervision over each project aided by it as a condition of the grant of annual contributions. See for other provisions supporting such controls, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1410, 1415 (4), 1421a, and 1435 (1958, and Supp. III, 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">The State housing authority law (G. L. c. 121, \u00a7 261 et seq.) was enacted with full legislative cognizance of the United States Housing Act. See \u00a7 26 J, as amended. Each authority has been authorized (\u00a7 26P, as amended through St. 1961, c. 188, \u00a7 1) \u201cto receive [Federal] loans, grants, and annual . . . contributions,\u201d to \u201cco-operate with the federal government in any . . . project,\u201d and \u201cto enter into . . . and carry out . . . contracts with the federal government.\u201d Section 26Y (as appearing in St. 1946, c. 574, \u00a7 1) provides that an \u201cauthority . . . with the written approval of the [State housing] board, and of the mayor of the city ... in which the project is situated, may enter into agreements with the federal government relative to the acceptance ... of funds for any low-rent housing project . . ..\u201d There is thus very direct State legislative consent to the type of contract which the authority has made with PHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">3. There seems to be conflict between (a) the commissioner\u2019s orders under \u00a7 26T and (b) the requirements of PHA, acting within the powers given to it by Congress. This conflict will become acute if PHA fails to approve revision by the authority of its present and future operating budgets to reflect the commissioner\u2019s wage rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">It may be that the Legislature, by authorizing contracts with PHA, did not foreclose itself from all subsequent exer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>cise of the police power in the narrow sense of the \u201cfundamental power to establish regulations necessary to secure the health, safety, good order, comfort, or general welfare of the community, defined \u2018with some strictness, so as not to include everything that might be enacted on grounds of mere expediency.\u2019 \u201d See <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>341 Mass. 760, 783-786. Under \u00a7 26T, however, the commissioner has purported to order the authority substantially to increase its wage expense. If PHA does not approve the increased wage rates, the orders will then direct the authority to make expenditures in excess of those in an approved operating budget. See \u00a7 507 (2), fn. 3, <em>supra. </em>Such excess expenditures would be a \u201csubstantial breach\u201d of the contributions contract, entitling PHA (see \u00a7 502) to demand possession of the projects and (\u00a7 505) to operate them. (See also 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1421a [1958].) If \u00a7 26T permits the commissioner thus to compel the authority to commit a \u201csubstantial breach\u201d of a contract which the Legislature has authorized, the question at once arises whether \u00a7 26T, and the commissioner\u2019s orders under it, impair the obligation of the contract. See U. S. Const, art. 1, \u00a7 10, cl. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Another constitutional question also may be presented. The Federal legislation already cited and proper PHA action under it cover comprehensively the whole field of such housing authority expenditures. If \u00a7 26T is applied to such projects, it will impinge sharply on an area which Federal action has largely preempted. It tends to thwart the Federal government\u2019s policy behind the contract under which a State instrumentality has accepted benefits. Cf. <em>Garner </em>v. <em>Teamsters, Chauffeurs &amp; Helpers Local Union </em>No. 776 (A. F. L.) 346 U. S. 485, 490-491, 500-501; <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>350 U. S. 497, 502-510; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Chester, </em>144 F. 2d 415, 420-421 (3d Cir.). Cf. also <em>Public Util. Commn. of Cal. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>355 U. S. 534, 540-546; <em>Paul </em>v. <em>United States, </em>371 U. S. 245, 252-263, modifying <em>United States </em>v. <em>Warne, </em>190 F. Supp. 645, 654-657 (N. D. Cal.); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Georgia Pub. Serv. Commn. </em>371 U. S. 285, 289-293.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>If a <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>substantial breach\u201d of the contract should take place and possession of the projects should pass to PHA, it could hardly be contended that PHA, during its operation of the projects, would be subject to the commissioner\u2019s wage rate orders. It is a Federal agency and would be performing a Federal function. The authority, acting under PHA supervision with the consent of the Legislature, is participating in the performance of the same Federal function. In practical aspect it stands in a similar position. Cf. <em>Schetter </em>v. <em>Housing Authy. of Erie, </em>132 F. Supp. 149, 151-152 (W. D. Pa.).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">These constitutional considerations bear strongly upon the construction of \u00a7 26T. Accordingly, so as to avoid serious constitutional doubts (see <em>Ferguson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn. </em>316 Mass. 318, 323-324; <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>341 Mass. 760, 785), we interpret \u00a7 26T as not intended by the Legislature to require action by the authority in conflict with proper explicit budgetary requirements of PHA. In the absence of much more definite statutory language, we should not regard \u00a7 26T, as amended, itself a part of the law which sanctions the PHA contract, as requiring the authority to commit a \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>substantial breach\u201d of that contract. The intention to coerce such a head on conflict with Federal authority is not lightly to be attributed to the Legislature, which must be taken to have known the existing law relating to housing projects receiving PHA contributions. See <em>Gloucester Ice &amp; Cold Storage Co. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Gloucester, </em>337 Mass. 23, 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Section 26T, thus construed, requires the authority to include (by revision or initially) in its operating budgets estimated wage expenditures in accordance with any valid wage rate orders<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> of the commissioner, and to make payments accordingly if these budget items are approved by PHA. If PHA (also charged with the duty of protecting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>labor, see fn. 9, <em>supra) </em>in fact disapproves authority expenditures budgeted in accordance with the commissioner\u2019s orders, such disapproval will relieve the authority of any necessity of compliance with the commissioner\u2019s orders under \u00a7 26T. Because of the contract the authority will not be entitled to make such expenditures until it obtains PHA approval. We assume, of course, that PHA, in passing upon authority budgets, will give all appropriate consideration to the commissioner\u2019s wage rate orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">4. The potential conflict of the commissioner\u2019s orders with PHA\u2019s expenditure control over Federal aid projects has no relevance to these orders as applied to projects in which there is no Federal participation. The legislative expectation may have been that PHA would approve budgets based on the commissioner\u2019s wage rates. Nevertheless, there is no indication in \u00a7 26T that these rates were not to apply in projects where forcing their use would not conflict with Federal policy or improperly impair the obligation of an existing contract. See <em>New Bedford </em>v. <em>New Bedford, Woods Hole, Martha\u2019s Vineyard &amp; Nantucket S.S. Authy. </em>336 Mass. 651, 656-658. The commissioner is entitled to have his orders, if otherwise valid, enforced by injunction as to projects concerning which no PHA contract is in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">5. The authority argues that \u201cjanitors\u201d are not within the coverage of the 1960 amendments of \u00a7 26T, because the term \u201claborers and mechanics\u201d as used in \u00a7 26T must be given the same meaning as those words when used in c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 26, 27, which are referred to in \u00a7 26T. We assume that a janitor is not a \u201cmechanic\u201d for present purposes. Whether a janitor is within the term \u201claborer\u201d as used in \u00a7 26T and c. 149, \u00a7 26, is a more difficult question.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">The record shows that there are no classifications in the construction industry comparable to those of janitor, fireman, junior development aide, senior development aide, and appliance man. It may be also that a \u2018 \u2018 differential in favor of the construction or heavy-type laborer compared to the janitor or custodial-type worker is common practice among <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>. . . employers.\u201d The job descriptions of \u201cjanitor\u201d and \u201cbuilding construction laborer\u201d are different. Nevertheless, the commissioner (see fn. 2) set both the construction laborers\u2019 rate and the janitors\u2019 rate at $2.20 per hour. PHA, following its \u201ccomprehensive\u201d wage \u201csurvey of the prevailing wage rates being paid by public and private employers in the . . . Boston\u201d area, fixed the janitors\u2019 rate, effective April 1, 1960, at $1.93 and the construction laborers\u2019 rate at $2.07. The commissioner set rates in other categories either on the basis of the authority\u2019s job descriptions or, in the case of firemen, on the basis of eighty per cent of those in an existing labor contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">We think that \u00a7 26T must be construed as authorizing the commissioner to set wage rates for all the lower paid employees of an authority, except as the contributions contract and PHA supervision of wage rates may preclude such action. We think also that the duties of a janitor involve sufficient manual and physical work to bring such an employee within the generic term \u201claborer\u201d as used in \u00a7 26T. The absence of a category in the construction field comparable to that of a janitor does not of itself warrant the conclusion that \u00a7 26T was not intended to apply at all to janitors.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">The Legislature has stated specifically that the commissioner is to set wage rates at \u201cno less than eighty per cent of the prevailing wage\u201d under c. 149, \u00a7 26. It was open to the Legislature to set this wage standard even though reference to a standard prevailing among maintenance workers might have been more in accordance with existing business practices. Accordingly, as to janitors, and also as to other classes of workers not found in the construction industry, the commissioner under \u00a7 26T may reasonably use a rate of eighty per cent of the prevailing wage rate of the most nearly comparable class of construction worker, giving due consideration to the differences and similarities in (a) skills required, (b) hazards undergone, (c) burdens, responsibilities, and physical effort undertaken, and (d) similar matters. On this record, we cannot say that the commissioner erred in setting the rates for janitors and for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>other classes of maintenance workers not found in the construction industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">6. The case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Since the case has involved an initial interpretation of \u00a7 26T, as well as important questions of State-Federal relationships, it may be that amendment of the pleadings and further hearings will be appropriate to avoid further controversy between the parties. If so, the Superior Court may permit such amendments and hear the case further. In the absence of such amendments, a final decree is to be entered (1) declaring the rights of the parties in a manner consistent with this opinion, (2) directing the authority to include (a) in an application to PHA for revision of existing budgets and (b) in formulating any new budgets, estimated wage expenses based upon rates not less than those set forth in the commissioner\u2019s orders, and (3) enforcing the orders in projects not aided by PHA. Any decree may provide for the retention of jurisdiction to make any adjustments in the decree that may be necessitated by further action of PHA and to supervise the performance of the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b449-14\"> Section 26T, as thus amended, reads in part, \u201cIn the development or administration of a project, a housing authority shall furnish the commissioner . . . with a list of the classifications of work performed by all architects, technical engineers, draftsmen, technicians, laborers and mechanics employed therein ....

The State Housing Board approved a revision of the authority\u2019s then current budgets to include PHA\u2019s I960 wage determinations. The authority on February 10, 1960, concluded an agreement on wages and other matters, adopting PHA\u2019s determinations as minima, with various labor organizations representing certain classes of its employees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b452-9\"> The commissioner, before making his wage determinations, did not make a survey similar to that made by PHA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b453-7\"> The statement of interest points out that increases in wage rates will result either (a) in increasing the Federal government\u2019s annual contributions, or (b) where contributions already are at the permissible maximum, will tend to increase tenants' rents \u201cat the expense of the main objective of . . . [providing] adequate housing to the lowest income group at rents which they can afford.\" Its own surveys, PHA says, show that compliance with the commissioner\u2019s orders \u201cwould result in . . . wage rates . . . considerably in excess of those paid in any comparable activity in the locality and ... in no sense \u2018prevailing.\u2019 \" PHA then contends \u201cthat the I960 amendment . . . imposed an additional arbitrary and burdensome requirement . . . not contemplated . . . when the . . . contributions contracts were entered into .... [B]oth the United States Housing Act and the . . . contract require . . . economy . . . in . . . development and administration .... Any proposal, therefore, that . . . [an] authority shall pay a higher wage than the [prevailing area] rate . . . raises the question of whether such increased payments would contravene . . . the act and the contract. ... In the absence of special market conditions . . . the PHA view is that there can be no more justification for . . . [an] authority to expend public funds for . . . wages in excess of those prevailing in the area than there would be for payment for other goods or services in excess of the market price.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b453-8\"> Section 26 (as amended by St. 1960, c. 401, \u00a7 1) reads in part, \u201c. . .
