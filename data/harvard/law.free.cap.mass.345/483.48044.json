L. c. 32, \u00a7 16 (4).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Zavaglia\u2019s application for retirement under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 7, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>denied by the Salem retirement board (Salem board). The appeal board affirmed the decision of the Salem board and dismissed the appeal. In the Superior Court a decree was entered affirming the appeal board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The case was submitted to the appeal board, to the Superior Court, and now is before us on a statement of agreed facts, which we summarize. From 1947 to April 10, 1959, Zavaglia had been employed in the school department of the city of Salem as a custodian, janitor, and fireman. Prior to his employment, he had no pulmonary trouble. On the latter date he had difficulty in breathing, was very tired, was wheezing, and felt he could not work any more. From the beginning of his employment his duties required him to shovel coal into the boilers several hours daily during the cold months of the year. Some of the school buildings where he was assigned to work were about 100 years old. The boiler rooms were small. He coughed up black coal dust. \u201c[Bjlack stuff\u201d came from his nose. In addition, when cleaning the buildings, he was exposed to chalk dust and other forms of dust. In 1948, he began to cough and could feel congestion in his chest. In 1951 he was told by a doctor, since deceased, that he had asthma. Pursuant to the doctor\u2019s suggestion he went to the allergy clinic at the Soldiers \u2019 Home where in 1951 the diagnosis of asthma was confirmed. He received medical treatment. In 1952 and again in 1957 he was admitted to the Salem Hospital because of his wheezing and coughing.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">The majority of the medical panel (designated under Gr. L. c. 32, \u00a7 6 [3]): (1) made the diagnosis that Zavaglia\u2019s condition was \u201cA. Bronchial Asthma, chronic due to allergy to dust, molds &amp; tobacco. B. Pulmonary Emphysema, severe\u201d; (2) concluded that he was physically incapacitated for further duty; and (3) determined that \u201cthe disability . . . [was] the natural and proximate result of the accident or hazard undergone on account of which the retirement is claimed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">Zavaglia\u2019s appeal to the appeal board was dismissed on the ground that he had failed to prove \u201cthat his injury oc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>curred at a definite time and at a definite place\u201d as required by Gr. L. c. 32, \u00a7 7. This decision, affirmed by decree in the Superior Court, is the subject of our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">1. The standards established by the Legislature to govern the judicial review of a decision by an administrative agency are set out in Gr. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (8). <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd. </em>342 Mass. 45, 47. In the instant case we are called upon to determine whether the decision of the appeal board was based upon an error of law (G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 [8] [c]) which has substantially prejudiced Zavaglia\u2019s rights. More precisely stated, we are to pass upon the correctness of the appeal board\u2019s interpretation of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 7 (1), which, so far as material, provides: \u201cAny member . . . who becomes totally and permanently incapacitated for further duty ... by reason of a personal injury sustained or a hazard undergone as a result of, and while in the performance of, his duties at some definite place and at some definite time . . . shall be retired . . ..\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">The appeal board did not reach the question of causation. It dismissed the appeal because of Zavaglia\u2019s failure to prove that his condition, or injury, was sustained at a definite time and at a definite place. For the purposes of this decision we shall assume that a causal connection had been established between Zavaglia\u2019s lung condition and his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">2. We think it is clear under our decisions that Zavaglia\u2019s lung condition is a \u201cpersonal injury\u201d as that term is used in Gr. L. c. 32, \u00a7 7 (1). By St. 1945, c. 658, \u00a7 1, inserting \u00a7 7 (1), the words \u201cpersonal injury sustained\u201d were substituted for the word \u201caccident\u201d formerly used in \u00a7 31 (1) as appearing in St. 1936, c. 318, \u00a7 1, the predecessor of \u00a77 (1). Similarly, with respect to the death benefit section, by St. 1941, c. 379, \u00a7 9, revising the predecessor section, \u00a7 31B as appearing in St. 1936, c. 318, \u00a7 1, the words \u201cpersonal injury sustained\u201d were substituted for the previous word \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>accident\u201d in subsection (1) of \u00a7 <em>31B; </em>and by St. 1945, c. 658, \u00a7 1, inserting the present \u00a7 9 (1), the words \u201cpersonal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>injury sustained \u2019 \u2019 were retained. In <em>Baruffaldi </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd. </em>337 Mass. 495, 500-501, it was stated that the words \u201cpersonal injury\u201d as used in present \u00a7 9 (1) are to be given a broad meaning comparable to the interpretation given to them in the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. Manifestly their meaning in present \u00a7 7 (1) of c. 32 should be the same as their meaning in present \u00a7 9 (1) of the same chapter. Under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, a lung condition which is the result of extended exposure to dust is a personal injury. <em>DeFilippo\u2019s Case, </em>284 Mass. 531, 532 (1933). <em>McKeon\u2019s Case, </em>326 Mass. 202, 205. It follows that Zavaglia\u2019s bronchial asthmatic condition, if due to extended exposure to dust and dirt, must also be considered a personal injury within \u00a7 7 (1) of c. 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">3. Another aspect of the question is presented by the appeal board\u2019s decision that Zavaglia had failed to prove that his \u201cpersonal injury\u201d was sustained \u201cat a definite time and at a definite place.\u201d The appeal board stated in summary that Zavaglia had no asthma or allergy in 1947, but did have a condition diagnosed as bronchial asthma in 1951. It therefore concluded that the condition must have arisen at some time during the four year period, \u201cand this is not at a definite time and at a definite place within the meaning of \u201d Gr. L. c. 32, \u00a7 7 (1). We think that the statement by the appeal board involves a misinterpretation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">The predecessor statute, \u00a7 31 (1), as appearing in St. 1936, c. 318, \u00a7 1, read, so far as pertinent, as follows: \u201cas the natural and proximate result of an accident or 'of undergoing a hazard peculiar to his employment, <em>in the performance and within the scope of his duty at some definite time and place </em>...\u201d (emphasis supplied). In 1941 this statute was interpreted in <em>Hough </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd. </em>309 Mass. 534, where the court said at page 538, \u201cBenefits under \u00a7 31 are based upon disability due to an <em>accident </em>or hazard peculiar to his employment incurred at some definite time and place <em>while the member was engaged in the performance of his duties\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>Thereafter, by St. 1945, c. 658, \u00a7 1, inserting present \u00a7 7 (1), the Legislature not only substituted, as earlier indicated, the words \u201cpersonal injury sustained,\u201d but changed the sequence of the words in the quoted <em>Hough </em>interpretation of the predecessor statute. Present \u00a7 7 (1) reads: \u201c. . .by reason of a <em>personal injury </em>sustained or a hazard undergone as a result of, and <em>while in the performance of, his duties at some definite place and at some definite 'time </em>...\u201d (emphasis supplied). See <em>Druzik </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Haverhill, </em>324 Mass. 129,133.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">The Legislature has made it plain by the 1945 amendment that its intention was to broaden the coverage, and that a personal injury, including one of a cumulative nature, is encompassed within the disability provisions of the statute. The personal injury need not be the product of a single event. The statutory requirements of place and time would be met by a showing that the personal injury was sustained as the result of Zavaglia\u2019s shoveling coal and cleaning school rooms in the places where he worked and during the hours of his work.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">The decision of the appeal board, in so far as it is based upon its interpretation of G-. L. c. 32, \u00a7 7, is based upon an error of law, which has substantially prejudiced Zavaglia\u2019s rights. Accordingly, the final decree affirming the decision must be reversed. The decision, however, made no finding as to the causal connection between Zavaglia\u2019s work and his injury. That question must be decided by the appeal board. <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd. </em>342 Mass. 45, 49. The case is to be remanded to the appeal board for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b525-16\"> Inserted by St. 1954, c. 681, \u00a7 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b525-17\"> As appearing in St. 1945, c. 658, \u00a7 1, and as amended by St. 1949, c. 618, \u00a7 8, and St. 1956, c. 422, \u00a7 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
