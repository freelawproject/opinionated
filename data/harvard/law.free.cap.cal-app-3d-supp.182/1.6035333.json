The store and arcade operation did not possess a business license, as required by the Los Angeles County Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-6\">The Los Angeles County Code (LACC)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> requires an adult bookstore or adult motion picture arcade in Los Angeles County to obtain a business license. The license will be denied if the building, structure or location of the building does not comply with all state and local health, zoning, fire and safety requirements. (\u00a7 7.08.070.) To obtain a license, the operator must first obtain a conditional use permit, which permit includes the condition that the use not be within 1,000 feet of other adult businesses. (\u00a7 22.28.210.)</p>\n<p id=\"b997-7\">A conditional use permit must be issued if: 1.

We assume that defendants do have standing to challenge the permit and licensing procedures. (See <em>Burton </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 684, 688 [68 Cal.Rptr. 721, 441 P.2d 281].)</p>\n<p id=\"b998-7\">\n<em>Vagueness of Standards</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b998-8\">Defendants contend that the standards for issuing a permit and license are unconstitutionally vague.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-9\">Local governments are entitled to regulate the location of bookstores and motion picture theaters which deal with adult material. <em>(Young </em>v. <em>American </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 7\">*Supp. 7</page-number><em>Mini Theatres </em>(1976) 427 U.S. 50, 62-63 [49 L.Ed.2d 310, 321, 96 S.Ct. 2440].

[Citation.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">In <em>Young </em>v. <em>American Mini Theatres, supra, </em>427 U.S. 50, the Supreme Court held valid the classification of a theater as \u201cadult\u201d and the restriction of \u201cadult\u201d theaters to areas not less than 1000 feet apart and not less than 500 feet from a residential area. Defendants have no quarrel with those portions of the Los Angeles County Code which restrict defendants\u2019\u2014 admittedly\u2014adult bookstore and movie arcade consistent with the ordinances involved in <em>Young. </em>They contend, however, that the language used in the Los Angeles County Ordinances provides no objective standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">We are obliged to construe enactments to give specific content to terms that might otherwise be unconstitutionally vague; an enactment should not be held void for uncertainty if any reasonable and practical construction can be given the enactment. <em>(Pryor </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 238, 253 [158 Cal.Rptr. 330, 599 P.2d 636].) <em>Burton </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d 684, 692, states that the issue is whether the ordinances provide \u201cprecise standards capable of objective measurement. ...\u201d  Although the bulk of the standards involved cannot be numerically quantified, we conclude that an objective but unquantified standard is not unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-8\">In examining the language which creates the standard, the question is whether the ordinance \u201cclearly and precisely delineates its reach in words of common understanding.\u201d <em>(Cameron </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1968) 390 U.S. 611, 616 [20 L.Ed.2d 182, 187, 88 S.Ct. 1335].) An ordinance is not vague or subjective if the drafters have chosen \u201cwidely used and well understood\u201d words. <em>(Kash Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 294, 304 [138 Cal.Rptr. 53, 562 P.2d 1302].)</p>\n<p id=\"b999-9\">Defendants isolate three required findings under section 22.56.190: The requested use \u201cwill not adversely affect\u201d a place of religious worship, school, park, playground or similar use within a 500-foot radius; the requested use must be \u201csufficiently buffered\u201d in relation to residentially zoned areas \u201cso as not to adversely affect\u201d those areas, and the exterior appearance \u201cwill not be inconsistent with the external appearance of commercial struc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 8\">*Supp. 8</page-number>tures\u201d within the area \u201cso as to cause blight, deterioration, or substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">Our Supreme Court analyzed comparable language in <em>Kash Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>19 Cal. 3d 294, in ruling on the constitutionality of ordinances regulating newsracks. The court concluded that phrases such as, \u201cunreasonably interferes with or impedes\u201d (19 Cal.3d at p. 303), and \u201cclean,\u201d \u201cneat\u201d and \u201cin good repair\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 305) involved common and widely used words, and were sufficiently precise to be constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">Applying the <em>Kash </em>method of analysis to this case, we construe the requirement that a use \u201cnot adversely affect\u201d another use to mean that the adult bookstore and arcade will not interfere with other uses; that sounds from the bookstore cannot be heard from other uses; that the bookstore will not be conspicuously visible from the other uses, and that the bookstore is located so that customers are not likely to inadvertently wander on the property of other uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-6\">The phrase, \u201cwill not be inconsistent with the external appearance of commercial structures\u201d also in the area, is also sufficiently clear. It means that the external design and decor of the adult bookstore and movie arcade will not be conspicuous in relation to other commercial uses; and that the exterior lighting and signs are similar to the exterior lighting and signs of other commercial establishments in the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-7\">Concededly, the phrase \u201cso as to cause blight, deterioration or substantially diminish or impair property value within the neighborhood,\u201d may lack precision, but we construe this phrase simply to restate the standard that the exterior appearance \u201cwill not be inconsistent\u201d with the exterior appearance of other commercial establishments, and thus avoid impermissible vagueness. <em>(See Kash Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>19 Cal.3d 294, 305.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-8\">The cases relied on by defendants involve ordinances in which the courts found the standards to be subjective, imprecise, and conferring on the authorities excessive discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-9\">In <em>Burton </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d 684, the defendants were charged with exhibiting motion picture films to the public without a written permit from the Board of Police Commissioners. The applicable ordinances provided that the board \u201cmay deny\u201d a permit if after an investigation the board found that the \u201coperation will not comport with the peace, health, safety, convenience, good morals, and general welfare of the public.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 9\">*Supp. 9</page-number>ordinances also provided that the board \u201cshall not issue a permit for a business which has been or is a public nuisance,\u201d or if the applicant is \u201cunfit to be trusted with the privileges granted by such permit, or has a bad moral character, intemperate habits or a bad reputation for truth, honesty, or integrity.\u201d (68 Cal.2d at p. 687.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">In <em>Ebel v. City of Garden Grove </em>(1981) 120 Cal.App.3d 399 [176 Cal.Rptr. 312], the local ordinances governing the operation of an adult book store or movie theater included a requirement that the applicant obtain a conditional use permit. The stated purpose in deciding whether to issue a conditional use permit was to \u201c \u2018assure that the degree of compatibility made the purpose of this Chapter shall be maintained with respect to the particular use on the particular site and in consideration of other existing and potential uses and improvements within the general area in which such is proposed to be located,\u2019\u201d and \u201c\u2018to recognize and compensate for variations and degree of technological processes and equipment as related to the factors of noise, smoke, dust, fumes, vibration, odors, and hazard or public need.\u2019\u201d (120 Cal.App.3d at pp. 405-406.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-6\">In <em>City of Imperial Beach </em>v. <em>Escott </em>(1981) 115 Cal.App.3d 134 [171 Cal.Rptr. 197], the local ordinances regulating adult bookstores and movie theaters also required that the applicant obtain a conditional use permit. The ordinance provided that \u201cthe Planning Commission may, by resolution, grant a conditional use permit,\u201d if the commission found that the proposed use \u201cis necessary or desirable to provide a service or facility which will contribute to the general well-being of the neighborhood or community\u201d; that the use would not \u201cbe detrimental to the health, safety, or general welfare of persons residing or working in the vicinity, or injurious to property or improvements in the vicinity\u201d; that the proposed use would comply with the \u201cregulations and conditions\u201d and that the granting of the conditional use would be \u201cin harmony with the purpose and intent of this title and the general plan of the city.\u201d (115 Cal.App.3d, at pp. 137-138.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-7\">There is, however, no comparison between the Los Angeles County Code standards, which govern exclusively the physical appearance and relationship of the adult book store and adult movie arcade to other uses, and the moralistic litany in <em>Burton </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d 684, or the rambling statements of purpose in <em>Ebel </em>v. <em>City of Garden Grove, supra, </em>120 Cal.App.3d 399 and <em>City of Imperial Beach </em>v. <em>Escott, supra, </em>115 Cal.App.3d 134, all of which, in addition, conferred on the issuing authority unlimited discretion to deny a permit or license.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-8\">In brief, the Los Angeles County zoning requirements for an adult bookstore or adult movie theater or arcade are not unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 10\">*Supp. 10</page-number>\n<em>Procedural safeguards</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">Defendants contend that even if the substance of the ordinances passes constitutional scrutiny, the procedures involved in obtaining a conditional use permit and license constitute an impermissible prior restraint. We do not agree that the procedures are unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">An operator must, as noted, apply for and obtain, first, a conditional use permit, and second, a business license. The procedures in the Los Angeles County Code are as follows: <em>Conditional use permit </em>(\u00a7 22.28.210). A public hearing must be held. (\u00a7 22.56.070.) No time limit is specified within which to hold the hearing after filing. (\u00a7 22.56.1570.) The hearing may be held by either the zoning board or the business license commission. (\u00a7 22.56.1590.) If the zoning board holds the initial hearing, that board must submit recommendations to the commission within 90 days after the hearing. (\u00a7 22.56.1610.) The commission may approve the findings of the zoning board, refer the matter back to the board for further hearing or set the matter for a de novo public hearing before itself. (\u00a7 22.56.1620.) No time limit is specified for a de novo hearing, or for the issuance of a decision after the hearing. (See \u00a7 22.56.1620, subd. A4.) A recommendation of the zoning board becomes final if the commission takes no action within 30 days. (\u00a7 22.56.1630.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-6\">A dissatisfied applicant for a conditional use permit may appeal to the board of supervisors. (\u00a7 22.60.200.) The board of supervisors may affirm the decision of the commission, refer the matter back for further proceedings or set the matter for a de novo hearing. (\u00a7 22.60.270.) No time limit is specified for action by the board of supervisors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-7\"><em>Business license. </em>Before an applicant can obtain a business license, a public hearing must be held. (\u00a7 7.06.040.) The commission may submit the matter to a referee to take testimony and report his findings. (\u00a7 7.10.020.) The referee is required within three days after the hearing to submit a written report to the commission. (\u00a7 7.10.320.) The applicant is entitled to have the matter heard by the full commission. (\u00a7 7.10.070.) In that case, the hearing must be held at the commission\u2019s next regular meeting. (\u00a7 7.10.080.) No time limit is specified for holding the next regular meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-8\">Defendants contend, relying on <em>Freedman </em>v. <em>Maryland </em>(1965) 380 U.S. 51 [13 L.Ed.2d 649, 85 S.Ct. 734], that the applicable ordinances lack constitutionally required procedural safeguards. The People contend that <em>Freedman </em>does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 11\">*Supp. 11</page-number><em>Freedman </em>involved a censorship ordinance. The court held that a \u201cnoncriminal process which requires the prior submission of a film to a censor avoids constitutional infirmity only if it takes place under procedural safeguards designed to obviate the dangers of a censorship system. First, the burden of proving that the film is unprotected expression must rest on the censor.\u201d Second, \u201cthe exhibitor must be assured, by statute or authoritative judicial construction, that the censor will, within a specified brief period, either issue a license or go to court to restrain showing the film.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 58-59 [13 L.Ed.2d at pp. 654-655].) The censorship scheme in <em>Freedman </em>applied to all films, regardless of content or classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">The People rely on <em>Bayside Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Carson </em>(M.D.Fla. 1979) 470 F.Supp. 1140, which involved a local licensing code regulating adult entertainment. The operators, relying on <em>Freedman, </em>argued that the administrative procedure for judicial review of license denials or revocations was constitutionally defective in that the burden was on the applicant to seek review of an adverse administrative decision and the procedure contained inadequate \u201cguaranties of promptness and finality.\u201d The District Court disagreed that <em>Freedman </em>applied: <em>\u201cFreedman </em>and its progeny deal with the procedures of expedited judicial review, with the burden on the censor, that must accompany governmental restraint upon the dissemination of a particular publication. . . . Under the Code ... in this case\u2014a licensee\u2019s alleged distribution of obscene materials will not furnish grounds for revoking his license, or for denying him a license to begin with. The only permissible grounds for that action would be violations in such areas as sanitation, dangerous physical conditions, or the like. In other words, official action on a license application or an existing license would flow from a failure to observe minimum standards of health and safety, and the violator would be subject to official sanction just like any other business. Under these conditions, the <em>Freedman </em>cases are simply inapposite.\u201d (470 F.Supp. at p. 1149.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-6\">We agree that the procedures approved in <em>Freedman </em>do not apply to the licensing under a zoning ordinance of a theater or bookstore. Constitutional issues aside, the simple determination by a censoring body whether a film is obscene cannot be equated with the many factors involved in determining whether a theater or bookstore complies with specified standards of health and safety. More important, the purpose of the licensing and permit procedures is not to censor the material to be exhibited or sold, but to assure that the proposed use complies with all requirements. The burden is on the applicant to present the necessary proofs that the proposed operation does comply with all lawful requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-7\">Second, although any interference with the exhibition or sale of protected material can be viewed as \u201cprior restraint,\u201d <em>Young </em>v. <em>American </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 12\">*Supp. 12</page-number><em>Mini Theatres, supra, </em>427 U.S. 50, recognized that a prior restraint on the exhibition of a film was not equivalent to a restriction through zoning on the theater which exhibits the films. In rejecting the contention that the zoning ordinances involved in <em>Young </em>were invalid as prior restraints on free speech, the Supreme Court noted that the \u201cordinances are not challenged on the ground that they impose a limit on the total number of theatres which may operate in the city of Detroit,\u201d that there was \u201cno claim that distributors or exhibitors of adult films are denied access to the market, or, conversely, that the viewing public is unable to satisfy its appetite for sexually explicit fare,\u201d and that \u201cthe market for this commodity is essentially unrestrained.\u201d (427 U.S. at p. 62 [49 L.Ed.2d at p. 321].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">More recently, <em>City of Renton </em>v. <em>Playtime Theatres, Inc., supra, </em>475 U.S. 41, \u2014 [89 L.Ed.2d 29, 42] which relied on and approved <em>Young, </em>made clear that mere economic costs in finding a lawful location do not constitute an unconstitutional infringement on the dissemination of protected material. Thus, the fact that the permit and licensing procedures may be lengthy, may inconvenience the operators of adult theaters and bookstores, and may increase the business costs for such operations will not invalidate a licensing procedure that otherwise is not unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">Finally, <em>Young </em>recognized that erotic material was not entitled to the same quantum of protection as other protected material: \u201cMoreover, even though we recognize that the First Amendment will not tolerate the total suppression of erotic materials that have some arguably artistic value, it is manifest that society\u2019s interest in protecting this type of expression is of a wholly different, and lesser, magnitude than the interest in untrammeled political debate . . . Even though the First Amendment protects communication in this area from total suppression, we hold that the State may legitimately use the content of these materials as the basis for placing them in a different classification from other motion pictures. \u201d (427 U.S. at pp. 70-71 [49 L.Ed.2d at p. 326].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-6\">Inevitably, <em>Young </em>leads to the conclusion that the procedures required by <em>Freedman </em>do not apply to the licensing under zoning laws of the adult bookstore and movie arcade involved in this case. Indeed even <em>Burton </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d 684, otherwise relied on by defendants, in acknowledging the legitimacy of regulations \u201ccompelling the theatre building to satisfy health fire and safety laws, or requiring the operation of the business to comply with the law in other specific respects\u201d (68 Cal.2d at p. 696), necessarily envisioned a procedure in which the burden would be on the exhibitor to show compliance with proper requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-7\">Concededly, permit and licensing procedures can be used to effectively prevent an undesired but lawful operation from functioning. (See <em>414 </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 13\">*Supp. 13</page-number><em>Theatre Corp. </em>v. <em>Murphy </em>(2d Cir. 1974) 499 F.2d 1155, 1159.) We recognize too that the Supreme Court still recognizes the protected position of \u201cadult\u201d material. In <em>Vance </em>v. <em>Universal Amusement Co. </em>(1980) 445 U.S. 308 [63 L.Ed.2d 413, 100 S.Ct. 1156], for example, the court held unconstitutional a Texas public nuisance statute used to shut down an adults-only motion picture theater based on a prior finding that the theater had shown obscene films. The court held that \u201cthe regulation of a communicative activity such as the exhibition of motion pictures must adhere to more narrowly drawn procedures than is necessary for the abatement of an ordinary nuisance ...\u201d (445 U.S. at p. 315 [63 L.Ed.2d at p. 420].) Also, several federal courts of appeal cases have assumed that <em>Freedman </em>applied to some degree to the licensing of adult bookstores or theaters. (See <em>Entertainment Concepts, Inc., III </em>v. <em>Maciejewski </em>(7th Cir. 1980) 631 F.2d 497, 505-506; <em>Bayou Landing, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Watts </em>(5th Cir. 1977) 563 F.2d 1172, 1176; <em>414 Theatre Corp. </em>v. <em>Murphy, supra, </em>499 F.2d 1155, 1159.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">Although the LACC permit and licensing procedures lack time limits for all the necessary steps, in the absence of a specific time limit, a reasonable time will be inferred. (See, e.g., <em>Stratton </em>v. <em>Tejani </em>(1982) 139 Cal.App.3d 204, 211 [187 Cal.Rptr. 231].) Moreover, the code does contain some time limits (see \u00a7 22.56.1630 [30 days for commission to act on zoning board recommendation]; \u00a7 7.10.320 [referee to report to commission within three days]), which provide a basis for establishing time limits as to other steps.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">More important, defendants have not provided this court with any meaningful record concerning delays in obtaining a permit and license. The reason that the owner of the arcade and bookstore does not have a permit and license is not clear. The burden is on the owner to initiate the necessary proceedings, and, on this limited record, we are not prepared to hold that the county will impermissibly delay, assuming the owner establishes his entitlement, in granting a permit and license.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-7\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-8\">Cooperman, P.

In addition to the findings required pursuant to subsections Al, A3 and A4 of Section 22.56.090, the zoning board shall recommend approval and the commission shall approve an application for a conditional use permit for an adult business where the information submitted by the applicant and/or presented at public hearing substantiates the following findings:</p>\n<p id=\"b997-10\">\u201c1. The requested use at the proposed location will not adversely affect the use of a church, temple or other place used exclusively for religious worship, school, park, playground or similar use within a 500-foot radius; and</p>\n<p id=\"b997-11\">\u201c2. The requested use at the proposed location is sufficiently buffered in relation to residentially zoned areas within the immediate vicinity so as not to adversely affect said areas; and</p>\n<p id=\"b997-12\">\u201c3. The exterior appearance of the structure will not be inconsistent with the external appearance of commercial structures already constructed or under construction within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 6\">*Supp. 6</page-number>immediate neighborhood so as to cause blight, deterioration, or substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood.

That the proposed use will not be in substantial conflict with the adopted general plan for the area. Where no general plan has been adopted, this subsection shall not apply;</p>\n<p id=\"b998-14\">\u201c3. That the proposed site is adequate in size and shape to accommodate the yards, walls, fences, parking and loading facilities, landscaping and other development features prescribed in this title, or as is otherwise required in order to integrate said use with the uses in the surrounding area; and</p>\n<p id=\"b998-15\">\u201c4.

The commission or board simply misread the ordinances under which conditional use permits are to be granted; section 22.56.190, subdivision Al, refers to a \u201c500-foot radius.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
