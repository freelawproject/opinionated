See G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B. Seven children were the complainants. Five of the eleven indictments were severed for trial. At the conclusion of the trial on the five indictments, the defendant was found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>guilty on three. On appeal from those convictions, he argues that the trial judge committed reversible error by refusing to ask potential jurors on individual voir dire whether any family member or close personal friend was a victim of sexual abuse and by allowing the complainants on the severed indictments to testify about the defendant\u2019s alleged sexual abuse of them. We affirm the judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">1. <em>Empanelment of the jury. </em>Prior to selection of the jury in the present case, the defendant requested the judge to make individual inquiry of the potential jurors as to whether they <em>or </em>any member of their family <em>or </em>any close personal friend had been a victim of any type of sexual assault. In making this request he cited <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Holloway, 44 Mass. App. Ct. 469 (1998). The Commonwealth joined in the defendant\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Expressing trial management concerns, the judge refused to expand the voir dire beyond the requirement set out in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. 348 (1994), a case involving the rape of a two year old child by her father in which the court invoked its power of general superintendence, see G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, and held that \u201cin [future] cases . . . involving sexual offenses against minors, on request, the judge must interrogate individually each prospective juror as to whether <em>the juror </em>has been a victim of a childhood sexual offense\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. at 353.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">After explaining the nature of the case to the venire, the judge asked whether any of them had any \u201cbias or prejudice for or against the defendant,\u201d whether any of them would have difficulty applying the concepts of burden of proof and presumption of innocence \u201cin a case of this nature,\u201d and whether any of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>them knew of <em>\u201cany reason whatsoever </em>why [they] could not be fair and impartial if. . . selected as a juror. . .\u201d (emphasis supplied). He next conducted individual voir dire examination of each juror in accordance with <em>Flebotte, </em>that is, he asked whether the prospective juror had been the victim of a childhood sexual offense. During the voir dire process, four potential jurors volunteered that their impartiality would be affected by the fact that they had family members who had been sexually assaulted. All four were excused from serving on the jury.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">It is the defendant\u2019s argument that we expanded upon <em>Flebotte </em>in <em>Holloway, </em>so as to require that trial judges also ask prospective jurors about sexual abuse of family members or close personal friends. The argument does not survive a careful reading of <em>Holloway, </em>a case involving an interracial rape of a child under the age of sixteen years, where the defendant requested that prospective jurors be asked on voir dire, \u201cHave you or any members of your family or a close personal friend been the victim of any type of sexual assault?\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Holloway, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. at 471. The judge denied this request and conducted individual voir dire on the sole question of racial prejudice.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We held that the judge\u2019s failure \u201cto satisfy the unequivocal requirement of <em>Flebotte </em>to examine each juror individually on the issue of sexual assault\u201d was clear error. <em>Id. </em>at 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Because <em>Flebotte </em>was based upon the Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s \u201csuperintendency powers to implement the policy set forth in G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 28, and not upon constitutional considerations,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Holloway, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. at 473, we went on to consider whether the \u201cerror affected the substantial rights of the defendant.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>in the circumstances presented (the prosecution was based on a theory of statutory rape, the judge\u2019s individual voir dire was limited to questions concerning racial bias, and the trial was \u201cessentially a credibility contest between the minor complainant and the adult defendant\u201d), the defendant had met his burden of showing that the judge\u2019s refusal to comply with <em>Flebotte </em>had \u201cpossibly weakened his case in some significant way.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 474. In doing so, we contrasted <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>402 Mass. 769, 772-773 (1988) (failure to comply with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanders, </em>383 Mass. 637, 640-641 [1981], required reversal of African-American defendant\u2019s conviction for robbery of two white females where he presented three alibi witnesses and other evidence to discredit victims\u2019 identifications of defendant), with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>A Juvenile (No. 2), </em>396 Mass. 215, 225 (1985) (error in conducting voir dire about racial prejudice did not require reversal where evidence of guilt was overwhelming and defendant\u2019s exculpatory testimony was uncorroborated).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">Even were we to conclude that <em>Holloway </em>did expand upon <em>Flebotte </em>so as to require judges also to ask prospective jurors about sexual abuse of family members or close personal friends, the applicable standard of review would require us to determine whether the judge\u2019s refusal to put such questions to potential jurors on voir dire affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. Applying this standard to the circumstances presented, we would not reverse the convictions. In the first instance, the judge did comply with <em>Flebotte. </em>More importantly, the guilty verdicts against the defendant were not based upon a credibility contest between the two victims and the defendant. Rather, the Commonwealth\u2019s case was strong, if not overwhelming. Seven children were properly allowed to testify (see part 2 of this opinion, <em>infra) </em>that they had been abused by the defendant in ways related in manner and not remote in time to the events here alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Our conclusion that there is nothing in <em>Holloway </em>that expanded upon the mandate announced in <em>Flebotte </em>leads us to the question whether the judge abused his broad range of discretion in refusing to put the requested question to the prospective jurors. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. at 355-356. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>Based upon the previously described circumstances of the case, we conclude that there was no abuse of discretion and that, even if there were, it would not require reversal of the defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">2. <em>Evidence of other had acts. </em>John and Jim were the complainants on the indictments that resulted in the convictions before us,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and Michael, Steve, Timmy, and Matt were the complainants on the severed and remaining indictments.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Sometime after the defendant\u2019s arraignment on the eleven indictments, a judge other than the trial judge was presented with two motions, that is, the Commonwealth\u2019s motion for a consolidated trial on all the indictments and the defendant\u2019s motion to sever. The judge allowed the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to join for trial five indictments and severed the remaining six. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hoppin, </em>387 Mass. 25, 32 (1982) (\u201cAs a general rule, joinder is a matter to be resolved by the judge in his discretion. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallison, </em>383 Mass. 659, 671 [1981]. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blow, </em>362 Mass. 196, 200 [1972], See Mass.R.Crim.P. 9[a], [c], [d], 378 Mass. 859 [1979]\u201d). In exercising his discretion in ruling on the motions, the judge expressly stated that \u201c[n]one of the present rulings, of course, affects the authority and discretion of the trial judge to rule upon any evidentiary questions as the trial unfolds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Immediately prior to trial, the Commonwealth sought the judge\u2019s permission to call Michael, Steve, Timmy, and Matt to testify about the defendant\u2019s sexual abuse of them. The prosecutor argued that their testimony was admissible to show modus operand! and the absence of mistake. The defendant argued that the indictments involving these four boys had been severed and that their testimony would be unduly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">After reviewing the police reports and the memoranda of counsel and noting that the motion judge had left the question of the admissibility of the boys\u2019 testimony on the various indictments to his discretion, the trial judge concluded that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>complainants on all the indictments were close in age, from five to ten years, that the place of the abusive acts occurred mostly at the defendant\u2019s karate studio where he was an instructor, and that the nature of the abusive acts against the complainants was substantially similar in nature even if somewhat different in minor respects.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Based upon these conclusions, the trial judge ruled that Michael, Steve, Timmy, and Matt could testify on the indictments alleging sexual abuse against John and Jim. We see no abuse of discretion. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>418 Mass. 788, 793-794 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Yetz, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 970, 971 (1995), the defendant argues that the acts against one of the boys on the severed indictments was so dissimilar and remote in time to the acts against John and Jim as to be inadmissible and that the testimony of Michael, Steve, Timmy, and Matt was unduly prejudicial. Whether the defendant touched the genitals of one boy or whether the boys touched the defendant\u2019s is irrelevant. In either event, the acts are not so dissimilar in nature as to make testimony about them inadmissible. Moreover, even if each of the specific acts against one of the boys could be deemed in isolation as remote in time from the acts against John and Jim, the proffered testimony demonstrated \u201cthe ongoing nature of the defendant\u2019s behavior.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hanlon, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 810, 820 (1998). We agree with the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that the evidence was not so dissimilar or remote in time as to render it inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">We accept the defendant\u2019s assertion that the challenged evidence was detrimental to his defense. Such evidence is always prejudicial to a defendant. The real question before us is whether the otherwise admissible evidence concerning the alleged acts of other misconduct by the defendant was made inadmissible because its probative value was outweighed by its potential for prejudice. Looking to the trial judge\u2019s broad range of discretion and the fact that he gave limiting instructions to the jury during and after the challenged testimony as to how they could and could not consider that testimony, we conclude that there is no basis for affording the defendant relief from his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>convictions. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Hanlon, 44 Mass. App. Ct. at 820-821.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b127-8\">As explained by the court, the rule that potential jurors are to be asked about any acts of sexual abuse committed against them was based upon G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 28 (judge must \u201cquestion prospective jurors individually when it appears that their impartiality may be affected by extraneous issues\u201d), and its observation that \u201cadult victims of childhood sexual offenses may be reluctant to come forward from a venire and discuss such a private and highly emotional event with a judge; they may be embarrassed about it, they may feel it would not affect their objectivity, or they may just not want to discuss it. Individual voir dire of these individuals would further assist the judge in uncovering signs of impaired objectivity.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. at 355-356.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b128-6\">After the first of these four jurors was excused because her granddaughter had been sexually abused, the defendant renewed his request that the prospective jurors be asked about any sexual abuse of family members or close personal friends. The judge again denied the defendant\u2019s request and empaneled a jury of fourteen.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b128-7\">The question put to the <em>Holloway </em>jurors on voir dire was, \u201cThis case . . . involves a charge of an alleged statutory rape by a black defendant. . . against a white person. . . who allegedly, was less than 16-years-old when the offenses allegedly occurred. Do you have any feelings about black or white people that might affect your judgment in this case?\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Holloway, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. at 473 n.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b130-7\">A third minor, Bob, was the complainant on an indictment that was tried with those involving John and Jim.
