L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the defendant appeals, claiming the judge committed reversible error in permitting a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>witness to testify to what the complainant, Jane,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> told the witness fifty-one months after the last alleged incident of sexual abuse. We agree with that contention and reverse the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The Commonwealth\u2019s pertinent evidence, adduced primarily through Jane\u2019s testimony, was as follows. In 1987, when Jane was six years old, the defendant moved into the campground tent occupied by Jane, her brother, and her mother in Wareham. Shortly thereafter, the defendant began to discipline Jane and her brother, by spanking them with his hands, a belt, and a paddle and threatening to make them drink his urine as punishment for bed-wetting. He also verbally abused Jane and confined her to the tent for hours in the summer heat. When the family and the defendant moved into a home in Wareham as winter approached, the defendant began sexually abusing Jane by touching her genitals with his hands and mouth. He also walked around nude in Jane\u2019s presence, masturbated in front of her, and once threw a used condom at her. At that time the defendant threatened Jane with beatings, burning her home, and running over her family with a car if she told anyone about the sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">The defendant lived with Jane\u2019s family intermittently between the summer of 1987 and December 10, 1990, first in Wareham and later in Plymouth, where he continued his sexual abuse of Jane. During that period Jane\u2019s mother gave birth to two children, the second of whom, Elaine,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was bom on April 1, 1989, and was the child of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">On December 10, 1990, in Plymouth, just before Jane\u2019s tenth birthday, the defendant fondled her breasts and vagina while she was taking a bath. Jane\u2019s mother walked into the bathroom and observed the defendant with his hands \u201cplanted\u201d on Jane\u2019s breasts. That day, Jane\u2019s mother summoned the police because the defendant locked her out in the course of an argument, but she did not report what she had observed to them. Later that day, the defendant left the house at the urging of the police. Thereafter, Jane never was alone with the defendant but was in his presence when he visited with his daughter, who was in the custody of Jane\u2019s mother. No abuse occurred after the bath <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>incident nor did the defendant threaten Jane thereafter. During the period following the bathroom episode, the defendant lived in California for approximately three years, but came into contact with Jane\u2019s family in the course of occasional supervised visits with Elaine. Jane\u2019s mother and the defendant were involved in contested proceedings in the Probate Court as to his visitation with Elaine. Jane was upset over the defendant\u2019s visits with Elaine because she was concerned for Elaine\u2019s safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">Beginning in 1993, Jane and her siblings became friendly with their mailman, Ed Hurley, who would take them and his grandchildren on recreational excursions. Hurley testified that as that friendship developed, Jane \u201copened up more,\u201d and in March of 1995, when she was fourteen years old, she told Hurley in general, nonspecific terms that the defendant had sexually abused her.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Jane was twenty years old at the time of trial. The evidence supporting her testimony of sexual abuse came from (1) Hurley, who testified to Jane\u2019s complaint to him; (2) the mother, who described what she had observed in the bathroom and stated that the defendant, some months later, in response to her question as to that incident had explained that Jane \u201casked for it\u201d; and (3) a State Police officer, who testified that when he asked the defendant in 1996 why Jane would accuse him,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> he said that she may have observed sexual activity between him and her mother and that the mother may have prompted Jane to make the accusations in order to terminate his visitations with Elaine. When asked whether the defendant described what contact he had had with Jane, the officer testified, \u201cI think he stated that [Jane] was very clingy, and on occasions she would come into his bedroom and she would lay in bed close to him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>Two guidelines loosely frame the analysis in cases involving a child\u2019s delayed disclosure of sexual abuse. They are that \u201c[t]here is no absolute rule of law as to the time within which a sexual assault victim must make her first complaint for that complaint to be admissible in evidence as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>fresh complaint\u201d and that \u201ccases involving child sexual abuse constitute a factually distinct branch of the fresh complaint doctrine that gives special consideration to the natural fear, ignorance, and susceptibility to intimidation that is unique to a young child\u2019s make-up.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amirault, </em>404 Mass. 221, 228-229 (1989). \u201c[AJnalysis in such cases should be flexible and attended by due consideration of factors which reasonably might cause a child to repress the urge to cry out to a third person.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Swain, 36 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 433, 439 (1994). Among these factors are the age and mental state of the child; fear of, and threats by, the defendant; whether the defendant is an authority figure; and whether the delay was procured by an inducement or was the result of concern for upsetting family relationships. Another factor to be considered is whether disclosure was prompted by a triggering event or a change in circumstances that \u201cinvests the disclosure with spontaneity and plausibility.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Traynor, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 527, 532 (1996). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amirault, supra </em>at 229; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dockham, </em>405 Mass. 618, 626 (1989). Also to be considered is whether the complainant spoke up when relieved of intimidating pressure. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dion, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 406, 413 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">Generally, the question whether a justifying or extenuating circumstance renders the complaint sufficiently \u201cfresh\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to be admissible is left to the considerable discretion of the trial judge in determining whether a victim\u2019s delay in disclosing is reasonable in the circumstances. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Comtois, 399 </em>Mass. 668, <em>673 </em>(1987).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> While according deference to that discretion, and recognizing the absence of absolute time lines, our appellate courts have catalogued decisional experience, noted the approximate \u201couter limits of the [fresh complaint] doctrine,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fleury, </em>417 Mass. 810, 815 (1994), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>expressed a sense that there is a \u201cborderline of admissibility.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Swain, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. at 441.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">Here, the fifty-one month time lapse between the last incident of abuse and the first complaint to a third party well exceeds the delay countenanced in any of our reported cases. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Aspen, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 259, 260-261, 265 (2001).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Given the extent of the delay in disclosure, the analysis shifts to whether extenuating circumstances are of such magnitude as to warrant judicial winking at the passage of time. Putting aside any question of the vitality of the doctrine of fresh complaint,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the possibility of mischief or mistake undoubtedly increases as the time between an alleged crime and its report grows. Therefore, as the timing of a complaint approaches or passes the \u201couter limits\u201d of the doctrine, trial judges who have the caretaker function of determining \u201cfreshness,\u201d see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dion, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. at 413, must require increasingly strong and persuasive evidence of inhibiting circumstances before permitting testimony relating to that complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Although Jane briefly testified about the defendant\u2019s threats, she did not indicate that she was intimidated by them or that they in any way influenced her once the defendant left her household. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 515, 526 (1991). It is significant that Jane never was alone with the defendant nor did he make any threats during the fifty-one month period between his leaving the household and her first complaint to a third party. In that period, her contact with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>defendant occurred only indirectly during some of his sporadic supervised visits with Elaine. To the extent that it may be inferred that the defendant\u2019s authoritarian and threatening presence had any residual effect following his departure from the household, that effect hardly could be viewed as having any significant influence during the approximately three years the defendant lived in California. While the combination of Jane\u2019s growing friendship with Ed Hurley and her concern for Elaine\u2019s safety may have triggered disclosure, those actuating circumstances occurred well after the time and opportunity for reasonably prompt disclosure had passed. Notwithstanding that those circumstances may have invested Jane\u2019s complaint with some plausibility, the determinative focus must be upon reasonable promptness if the concept of fresh complaint evidence is to have any jurisprudential justification. \u201c[T]he doctrinal purpose of fresh complaint testimony \u2014 to counteract the possible discrediting effect of the absence of evidence of a prompt report,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Swain, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. at 442 \u2014 is ill served and \u201c[t]he doctrine is mischievous unless the complaint is truly \u2018fresh\u2019. ...\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dion, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. at 412. Accordingly, we conclude it was error to permit testimony of Jane\u2019s complaint made fifty-one months after the last episode of alleged abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">The defendant made a particularized objection to the admission of Hurley\u2019s fresh complaint testimony. Consequently, we \u201cinquireQ whether there is a reasonable possibility that the error [in admitting that testimony] might have contributed to the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alphas, </em>430 Mass. 8, 23 (1999). The erroneously admitted testimony requires reversal unless we are \u201csure that the error did not influence a jury, or had but very slight effect . . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. 348, 353 (1994), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peruzzi, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 437, 445 (1983). \u201cThe burden of showing the absence of error is on the Commonwealth, . . . and the Commonwealth also bears the risk of doubt when any exists as to the error being nonprejudicial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alphas, supra </em>at 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Turning to the indictment charging indecent assault and battery in Wareham, see note 1, <em>supra, </em>the sole direct evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>criminality was Jane\u2019s testimony. The only other possibly inculpatory evidence was in the form of the State police officer\u2019s testimony that, upon questioning as to why Jane would accuse him of touching her, the defendant described Jane as being \u201cvery clingy\u201d and said that on occasions she would come into his bedroom and \u201cwould lay in bed up close to him.\u201d Although Hurley, in response to being asked whether Jane told him of any sexual abuse, testified only that she \u201ctold me that [the defendant] touched her and that he made her touch him,\u201d the prejudicial effect of even such brief and nongraphic testimony cannot be discounted.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davids, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 421, 424 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">The conviction of the defendant on the indictment charging indecent assault and battery in Plymouth, see note 1, <em>supra, </em>may have been based solely on the testimony of Jane and her mother with respect to the bathroom incident of December 10, 1990. However, in light of Jane\u2019s testimony of other sexual abuse from the time she was six until she was \u201calmost ten,\u201d which would encompass Jane\u2019s residency at both Wareham and Plymouth,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and the jury\u2019s apparent crediting of that testimony with respect to the Wareham indictment, we cannot say without reservation that the erroneous admission of Hurley\u2019s testimony may not significantly have influenced the jury as to their verdict on the Plymouth indictment. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 936, 937-938 (1990), and cases cited. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mosby, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 181, 185 n.3 (1991). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaSota, 29 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 15, 29 (1990). In any event, we cannot be certain that the error may not also have contributed indirectly to the jury\u2019s assessment of the prosecution\u2019s case relating to the bathroom incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">\n<em>Judgments reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">\n<em>Verdicts set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b210-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>Appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Permissible delay</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McKinnon, </em>35 Mass.

App. Ct. 599 (1993): abuse of children six and one-half and four and one-half by parents disclosed to foster parents approximately sixteen months later, not untimely in view of ages of children and circumstances, and lack of evidence that the statements were coerced. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 458, 459, 468-469 (1996): children, eight and nine at time of abuse and threatened with harm by the defendant father, disclosed abuse three to four months after last incident when fearing they again were in danger of harm. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lavoie, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 7-8 (1999): complaint of abuse of child between ages of four and eleven, made about twenty-six months after last incident, was timely when made two weeks after child was out of the defendant\u2019s control. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reznikow, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 330, 331-333 &amp; n.6, 334 (2001): in view of circumstances and of \u201csolid and convincing\u201d direct evidence of defendant\u2019s criminal behavior, testimony of victim\u2019s complaint about abuse when she was three to six, disclosed two years later, properly admitted. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Howell, </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. 716 (2003): factors of disclosure of alleged abuse when complainant was ten, made fifteen months after last alleged incident and eight months after victim had left counseling relationship with defendant, with no evidence of threats or coercion, and with disclosure not spontaneously made, viewed separately did not render fresh complaint testimony impermissibly admitted, although it was on the \u201cborderline of admissibility,\u201d but considered with other factors in the case required reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>Impermissible delay</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>35 Mass.

Complainant did not allege that she was in fear of the defendant or that she was told not to tell. Defendant waived objection to this evidence and, therefore, not allowed to change tactics on appeal. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perreira, </em>38 Mass.
