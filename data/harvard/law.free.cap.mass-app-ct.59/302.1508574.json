(U.S.A.) (Synthes) and avoided costly litigation. With a jury waiting in the wings, a Superior Court judge granted FHE\u2019s written motion in limine to preclude certain evidence of damages. As a consequence of that ruling, Shimer was unable to prove the essential element of damages as to the two pending counts in his legal malpractice complaint, and the judge dismissed both on FHE\u2019s oral motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At issue in this appeal is the propriety of those rulings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">1. <em>Background. </em>Shimer, a medical instruments distributor, alleges that he hired FHE to advise him concerning the interpretation of a termination provision in his written contract with Synthes, for which he served as a sales agent in the New England area. Synthes claimed the agreement was due to expire on January 1, 1994, while Shimer asserted that it would automatically renew and continue in effect after that date. According to Shimer, in the course of this dispute, Synthes offered him new, albeit less favorable, contractual terms, which he rejected based on encouraging advice he had received from FHE concerning the viability of his position on the original agreement. In a declaratory judgment action eventually brought by Synthes in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>Federal District Court in Pennsylvania to resolve the underlying contract dispute, summary judgment entered in favor of Synthes, a ruling that was upheld on appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Subsequently, at the malpractice trial, Shimer\u2019s expert was expected to testify that FHE negligently failed to advise him of the existence of legal precedents adverse to FHE\u2019s interpretation of-the contract between Shimer and Synthes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> FHE had originally evaluated Shimer\u2019s legal position and concluded that it was \u201cvery likely\u201d that Shimer\u2019s agreement with Synthes would be enforced as a self-renewing contract under Pennsylvania law<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and would be terminable only for certain limited reasons not applicable to Shimer\u2019s situation. Nonetheless, FHE told Shimer that further research would be necessary. At a later point, Shimer asked FHE to perform additional research so that he could better evaluate whether to continue defending the Federal litigation initiated by Synthes or to accept that company\u2019s offer of a new contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">FHE conducted further research that revealed two appellate cases involving facts similar to those in Shimer\u2019s case, neither of which was helpful to his position. Indeed, one of the cases<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> actually supported Synthes\u2019s position that its contract with Shimer was not self-renewing and was, in fact, terminable in the circumstances. Shimer was advised of neither the results of FHE\u2019s research nor the existence of precedent supporting the position of Synthes. Instead, Shimer was told that FHE\u2019s additional legal research revealed nothing that changed its original analysis that Shimer\u2019s legal position was sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>Shimer contends that he was denied the opportunity to reassess the strength of his position in light of the new information, which he claims indicated that the issue was less clear than FHE had led him to believe. See <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Ely, </em>423 Mass. 467, 476 (1996) (certainty of counsel\u2019s opinion unwarranted when underlying issue not conclusively resolved, thus denying plaintiffs the opportunity to evaluate different courses of action). As a result, he was unable to assess the risks associated with further litigation compared to the benefits connected to Synthes\u2019s offer of a new contract. Shimer now asserts that he would have accepted Synthes\u2019s latest contract offer had he known that, in circumstances similar to his, an appellate court had taken a position essentially supporting that of Synthes. In any event, had he accepted the offer, the Federal litigation, in which he claims to have incurred $135,000 in legal expenses, would have been rendered moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>The trial judge\u2019s allowance of FHE\u2019s motion in limine to preclude certain evidence of damages ultimately proved fatal to Shimer\u2019s case. In addition to proving that FHE failed to exercise reasonable care and skill in rendering him legal advice, <em>Pongonis </em>v. <em>Saab, </em>396 Mass. 1005 (1985); <em>Glidden </em>v. <em>Terranova, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 597, 598 (1981), it was Shimer\u2019s obligation to prove that FHE\u2019s negligence was the proximate cause of his reasonably foreseeable damages or loss. <em>Fishman </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>396 Mass. 643, 646-647 (1986). See <em>Girardi </em>v. <em>Gabriel, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 553, 558 (1995). Following an exhaustive consideration of Shimer\u2019s proof, the trial judge concluded that Shimer was unable to prove either his damages or their collectibility and dismissed the action without reaching the issue of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Shimer\u2019s complaint should not have been dismissed. Rather, his proposed evidence should have been admitted to prove not only the terms of the new contract offered by Synthes, but also the damages stemming from his rejection of the offer as well as their collectibility. Independent of the lost opportunity to accept the new contract offered by Synthes, Shimer also claims that he suffered damages in the form of unnecessary legal fees expended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>in litigating the declaratory judgment action.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Shimer was prepared to prove the amount of legal fees and costs that he paid relative to the Federal suit, a sum that could have been averted, he states, had he been provided the fruits of FFlE\u2019s legal research. We conclude that evidence of such expenditures should not have been excluded by the trial judge, with the consequence being that Shimer\u2019s complaint was improperly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">a. <em>Evidence concerning the offer of a new contract. </em>For a jury to infer that FHE\u2019s alleged negligence caused him harm, Shimer must prove not only that Synthes offered him a new contract, but also the benefits he would have realized had he accepted the proposal. The measure of his damages would thus be the value of the benefits lost when he rejected the offer based on FHE\u2019s legal analysis of his case. See; e.g., <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Nestor, </em>398 Mass. 184, 189-190 (1986) (in malpractice case in which plaintiff alleged that attorney\u2019s negligent handling of employment discrimination suit deprived her of a valuable claim for reinstatement, plaintiff\u2019s verdict set aside for failure to prove damages resulting from her rejection of her employer\u2019s reinstatement offer). Moreover, Shimer had to demonstrate that benefits offered by Synthes in its contract offer were actually collectible. See <em>Poly </em>v. <em>Moylan, </em>423 Mass. 141, 148 (1996), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1114 (1997) (plaintiff in a legal malpractice action asserting negligence in handling of his claim bears burden of showing that he would have been able to collect something had a judgment been obtained in the underlying case). See also <em>Jernigan </em>v. <em>Giard, </em>398 Mass. 721, 723-724 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">i. <em>Damages. </em>Shimer\u2019s theory of damages was that, had FHE adequately apprised him of the law, he would have accepted Synthes\u2019s last offer, thereby reaping the financial benefits of the proposed agreement and forgoing the costs of litigation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Van Brode Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bowditch &amp; Dewey, </em>36 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>App. Ct. 509, 518 (1994). Thus, Shimer\u2019s ability to prove his damages rested, in large part, on introducing the Synthes offer in evidence to show the monetary value he would have derived from the proposed settlement of his underlying dispute with Synthes. The judge, however, deemed Shimer\u2019s proof of the Synthes offer inadmissible hearsay.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Shimer argued that the Synthes offer was admissible on several theories, although he initially pressed the operative words doctrine.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The judge rejected that theory for two reasons: first, because this case was not a contract action in which the doctrine is most commonly applied, and, second, because, as she understood Shimer\u2019s argument, the Synthes offer was to be used for the truth of the matter asserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">The question, then, is whether evidence of the Synthes offer was admissible in the malpractice action as it would be in an</p>\n<p id=\"b330-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>action in which the proposed contract itself was at issue.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Had Shimer accepted the offer from Synthes, we would not hesitate to characterize evidence of the offer as proof of operative words used in the making of a contract and therefore not subject to the hearsay rule. In that context, the offer, once communicated to Shimer, would have taken on independent legal significance, giving rise to certain rights and duties between Synthes and Shimer. See <em>Telecon, Inc. </em>v. <em>Emerson-Swan, Inc., </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 671, 672-673 (1984); Young, Pollets &amp; Poreda, Evidence \u00a7 801.4(a) (2d ed. 1998). See also <em>Tenney </em>v. <em>Foss, </em>268 Mass. 69, 72-73 (1929); <em>Baldwin\u2019s Steel Erection Co. </em>v. <em>Champy Constr. Co., </em>353 Mass. 711, 715-716 (1968); Liacos, Brodin &amp; Avery, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 8.2.5 (7th ed. 1999). In a contest between Synthes and Shimer, then, the Synthes offer could appropriately be introduced in evidence through Shimer\u2019s own testimony as operative words, not for its truth, but for the fact that Synthes made it and was thus bound by it.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">But in much the same fashion, faced with the burden of proof imposed in a legal malpractice proceeding, which amounts to a \u201ctrial within a trial,\u201d see <em>Fishman </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>396 Mass. at 647, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>Shimer still had to demonstrate the probability that he would have reached a more favorable outcome, here an agreement with Synthes, had FHE exercised adequate skill and care. See, e.g., <em>Poly </em>v. <em>Moylan, </em>423 Mass. at 145; <em>Van Brode Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bowditch &amp; Dewey, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. at 518. Though the malpractice suit was not, as the trial judge observed, an action to enforce a contract, Shimer still had the burden of establishing the central issue in the underlying dispute, namely, the existence and terms of the Synthes offer which, but for FHE\u2019s negligence, Shimer claims he would have accepted, thereby forming a contract. See <em>Whiteaker </em>v. <em>State, </em>382 N.W.2d 112, 116 (Iowa 1986) (to prove he was deprived of a favorable settlement due to his attorney\u2019s negligence, former client must prove that a firm settlement offer was made and that he and the party against whom his claim was asserted would have reached an agreement).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">We conclude that proof of the underlying offer, as proposed by Synthes and rejected by Shimer allegedly in reliance on FHE\u2019s advice, was sufficiently integral to his malpractice claim and, on that basis alone, should not have been excluded. In the context of the malpractice proceeding, the offer, once communicated to Shimer, would have taken on such independent legal significance as to exempt it from application of the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The judge also ruled against the operative words theory of admissibility because Shimer sought to admit the Synthes offer for its truth, or as the judge stated it, for the fact that the offer was made and its monetary benefits, and because Shimer\u2019s attorney conceded that the evidence was being offered for such truth. But we think Shimer\u2019s testimony that Synthes made him an offer, and the terms of that offer, was admissible precisely for the fact that the offer was made and for its terms. Given Shimer\u2019s burden in the malpractice action to prove that he lost the financial benefits that he would have received had he accepted the Synthes offer, the words of that offer take on independent legal significance on the issue whether their acceptance would have produced an agreement binding on the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">Yet in addition to proving the probability of a better outcome in his dealings with Synthes, Shimer also needed to introduce in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>evidence the Synthes proposal to quantify his claim for damages caused by his rejection of the offer. See, e.g., <em>Fishman </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>396 Mass. at 647 &amp; n.l (in the trial within a trial, jury had to determine whether the client would have prevailed in his underlying personal injury claim and whether his damages would have exceeded the amount his attorney recommended he accept in settlement); <em>Atlas Tack Corp. </em>v. <em>Donabed, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 221, 226 (1999) (trial within a trial necessary to determine, first, whether the underlying defendant was negligent, and then whether the client could have obtained a better result in that case than the amount obtained by his attorney in settlement). We acknowledge the judge\u2019s dilemma, that the financial promises made by Synthes seemed, in one sense, to be offered not just for the fact that an offer was made but for the truth of Synthes\u2019s assertion that it would have paid Shimer those amounts had he accepted the offer. It is a fine distinction, but a critical one.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">We think proof of the Synthes offer, even as evidence of damages, was not dependent on the truthfulness, honesty, or sincerity of the Synthes vice president who made the proposal, on Synthes\u2019s behalf, to pay certain amounts to Shimer. Rather, for purposes of this case, once the offer was extended and it was left to Shimer to accept it, the offer and the financial benefits proposed therein took on independent legal significance. The significance of the words used by Synthes in making the offer was in the fact that they were communicated to Shimer and that he would have accepted; their import, at that point, was unrelated to whether Synthes truly meant to pay the amounts it proposed.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u201cIn particular, evidence of lost profits based on a contract is not subject to the hearsay rule because such evidence concerns the existence of the contractual terms rather than an assertion of their \u2018truth.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mueller </em>v. <em>Abdnor, </em>972 F.2d 931, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>937 (8th Cir. 1992) (proposed contracts were not hearsay when offered to show \u201cthe making of a contract and the potential loss of benefit\u201d), citing 6 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 1770, at 259-260 n.l (Chadboum rev. 1976). See <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co. </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>3 Ariz. App. 259, 261 (1996) (testimony recounting conversation about price terms in potential sales agreement was admissible to prove lost profits caused by defendant\u2019s wrongful attachment, and not for the truth of the conversation). See generally <em>Jamaica Pond Garage, Inc. </em>v. <em>Woodside Motor Livery, Inc., </em>236 Mass. 541, 542 (1920) (price stated for rental vehicle, overheard by witness who testified at trial, was not hearsay, but corroborated plaintiff\u2019s claim of agreed-upon price).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">Consequently, in the narrow circumstances of this trial within a trial framework, we view evidence of the Synthes offer and its terms as operative words admissible to show the financial benefits that Shimer might have obtained but for FHE\u2019s negligence. Dismissal of Shimer\u2019s complaint, for lack of proof of the settlement offer and its value, was therefore error.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">ii. <em>Collectibility. </em>The judge also ruled that Shimer had offered insufficient proof that he would have been able to collect from Synthes the funds derived from his acceptance of the offer. A plaintiff in a malpractice action, who asserts that his attorney\u2019s negligence prevented him from obtaining a judgment to which he was entitled, bears the burden of proving that he \u201ccould have collected something\u201d on the judgment. <em>Jernigan </em>v. <em>Giard, </em>398 Mass. at 723. See <em>Poly </em>v. <em>Moylan, </em>423 Mass. at 148. Proving collectibility derives from the requirement that the plaintiff demonstrate that the attorney\u2019s negligence caused him a loss, \u201cthat he probably would have obtained a better result had the attorney exercised adequate skill and care.\u201d <em>Jernigan </em>v. <em>Giard, </em>398 Mass. at 723, quoting from <em>Fishman </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>396 Mass. at 647. Even with admission of the evidence of the Synthes offer supporting his claim for damages, Shimer must still demonstrate that Synthes had the financial ability to pay the amounts to which it agreed in order to establish that FHE\u2019s negligence caused him an actual loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Shimer maintains that he did not have to prove collectibility because his loss here arose from his rejection of a contract proposal, rather than from a lost judgment. He urges that a less <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>stringent standard should be applied where the underlying loss is an offer extended by a willing party seeking a consensual resolution of a dispute rather than a judgment reached through adversary proceedings. Though not specifically addressed in our cases, the available authority suggests otherwise. See <em>Whiteaker </em>v. <em>State, </em>382 N.W.2d at 117 (the plaintiff, claiming he could have obtained a favorable settlement but for his attorney\u2019s negligence, failed to offer evidence that the underlying defendant had the \u201cfinancial wherewithal to fund any settlement proposal which its attorney may have thought reasonable\u201d), cited in <em>Jernigan </em>v. <em>Giard, </em>398 Mass. at 723. Collectibility is not a measure of a party\u2019s willingness to make a payment or to provide a benefit to another. Rather, it is an assessment of a party\u2019s ability to do so. Accordingly, it is appropriate to determine the ability of a party to carry out an obligation regardless whether the obligation is entered into voluntarily or ordered by the court. When it comes to the necessity to prove collectibility, we see no reason to distinguish such cases from each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">Shimer additionally argues that he should have been allowed to offer evidence of collectibility through his own testimony regarding his first-hand knowledge of Synthes\u2019s financial status, as well as through his experience as a consultant to a Synthes competitor. As previously noted, we view Shimer\u2019s evidence of Synthes\u2019s solvency under the summary judgment standard; thus, we construe the evidence most favorably to Shimer, and we afford him the benefit of all reasonable inferences. See <em>Salem Bldg. Supply Co. </em>v. <em>J.B.L. Constr. Co., </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 360, 365 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">First, Shimer proposed to testify that Synthes continued to pay him for his services under his former contractual arrangement even after he rejected Synthes\u2019s final offer made in December, 1993, and that Shimer continued to receive timely payments from Synthes until the relationship ceased, in August, 1994. The judge rejected this evidence as proof that Synthes could have funded the significant sums proposed in the Synthes offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">To be sure, Shimer\u2019s evidence fell far short of demonstrating that Synthes had sufficient income and assets to fund all amounts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>proposed in Synthes\u2019s last offer, which allegedly included $750,000 to buy out Shimer\u2019s existing business. However, Shimer argues that evidence that Synthes continued to pay Shimer for his services some eight months after he rejected its offer would tend to show that it had the ability to fund at least a portion of the offer had he accepted it in January, 1994. As we previously noted, a plaintiff in a legal malpractice suit need only show that he could have collected \u201csomething\u201d on the underlying judgment. See <em>Jernigan </em>v. <em>Giard, </em>398 Mass. at 723, and cases cited. It is that portion of the judgment that can actually be collected \u201cthat determines the financial liability and responsibility of the legal malpractice defendant, assuming professional negligence has been determined.\u201d <em>McDow </em>v. <em>Dixon, </em>138 Ga. App. 338, 341 (1976). See <em>Poly </em>v. <em>Moylan, </em>423 Mass. at 148. Hence, Shimer was not required to prove collectibility of the entire sum he might have obtained from accepting the Synthes offer, but only that he could have collected \u201csomething,\u201d thereby demonstrating the likelihood of a result better than he obtained by relying on FHE\u2019s advice. See <em>Jernigan </em>v. <em>Giard, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">Of course, evidence of Synthes\u2019s timely payments to Shimer, alone, would not prove that Synthes had the financial ability to pay Shimer additional amounts beyond what was actually paid. But Shimer also proposed to testify about his subsequent employment as a consultant for a Synthes competitor, and about market studies he conducted in the course of that employment specifically concerning Synthes\u2019s revenues and market share as of 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">It is in this respect that the nature of the underlying dispute and settlement offer between Synthes and Shimer becomes relevant to the issue of collectibility. While the judge opined that Synthes\u2019s financial status, as demonstrated by a market study in 1996, had no bearing on its ability to fund the Synthes offer extended to Shimer in December, 1993, we note from Shimer\u2019s proposed evidence that certain terms of the Synthes offer anticipated an ongoing relationship with Shimer. It allegedly included, for example, an annual salary, annual bonuses, and relocation expenses for up to two years. As a consequence, evidence of Synthes revenues and market share in 1996 could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>support a reasonable inference that it could have funded at least some portion of the proposed agreement with Shimer beyond the end of their relationship in 1994. How much, we think, would be a question for the jury. See generally <em>Taylor Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Weisensee, </em>334 N.W.2d 21, 30 (S.D. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Admittedly, Shimer\u2019s proposed proof of collectibility was thin. See, e.g., <em>McDow </em>v. <em>Dixon, </em>138 Ga. App. at 341-342 (judgment against legal malpractice defendant reduced to amount of underlying tortfeasor\u2019s insurance coverage where plaintiff failed to introduce business records, financial statements, or assets to prove collectibility over and above insurance). \u201cA toehold, however, is enough to survive a motion for summary judgment.\u201d <em>Marr Equip. Corp. </em>v. <em>I.T.O. Corp., </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 231, 235 (1982). See <em>Scotti </em>v. <em>Arrow Electronics, Inc., 31 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 954, 955 (1994). We conclude that there was enough here to go to a jury on the issue of Synthes\u2019s ability to fund at least some portion of the monetary benefits promised in its offer, had Shimer accepted it, over the subsequent course of their business relationship. Accordingly, on this record, dismissal for lack of proof of collectibility was unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">b. <em>Legal expenses as damages. </em>The judge erred, as well, when she concluded that Shimer could not recover as damages in the malpractice action his legal fees and costs incurred in the underlying Federal litigation because he could not prove the existence and terms of a new contract offer from Synthes.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">Shimer claims that FHE\u2019s failure to disclose the adverse findings of its legal research also resulted in his unnecessary defense of the declaratory judgment action. Had he been properly informed by FHE, he posits, he would have conceded the matter and brought the litigation to a close. He would have done so, he asserts, because the significant expense of legal representation would have outweighed the reduced likelihood of success in light of the adverse case law that FHE\u2019s research had revealed. Moreover, he would have taken that course of action, he states, regardless of the availability of a new contract offer from Synthes.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">In such circumstances, it was appropriate for Shimer to claim as damages in the malpractice action his legal fees and costs associated with the continued defense in the Federal litigation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>Thus, evidence demonstrating Shimer\u2019s payment of legal fees and costs would constitute competent proof of damages purportedly resulting from FHE\u2019s alleged negligence, independent of any damages stemming from Shimer\u2019s rejection of Synthes\u2019s offer.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Accordingly, his complaint should not have been dismissed on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">3. <em>Disposition. </em>We vacate the judgment of dismissal and remand counts 1 and 3 of the complaint for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Shimer\u2019s complaint originally alleged negligence (count 1), breach of fiduciary duty (count 2), and breach of contract (count 3).

Although Shimer was represented by local counsel, FHE also appeared in the action on his behalf. Whether or not FHE was negligent in its representation of Shimer in the Federal case with Synthes is not before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b326-7\">Although Shimer\u2019s complaint alleged a variety of actions on the part of FHE constituting negligence, the trial judge also allowed FHE\u2019s motion in limine to limit expert testimony, effectively restricting Shimer\u2019s expert proof to the circumstances involving FHE\u2019s purported failure to advise him of adverse legal precedents. Although Shimer includes this ruling in his notice of appeal, he does not argue it in his brief and, therefore, we do not address it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b326-8\">The parties agreed that Pennsylvania law governed the interpretation of the written agreement between Synthes and Shimer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b326-9\"><em>Nikas </em>v. <em>Hindley, 99 </em>Ga. App. 194 (1959).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b328-6\">FHE asserted before the trial judge the alleged untimeliness of Shimer\u2019s claim that his legal expenses in the Federal action were cognizable as damages in the malpractice action. As the judge did not address the issue, it is not before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b328-10\">In support of his claim for damages, Shimer indicated to the judge that he would introduce certain business records and correspondence generated by Synthes, but identified no witness from that company through whom those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>exhibits could be introduced. Upon learning that Shimer had conducted no pretrial, out-of-State depositions or any other discovery involving Synthes, the judge gave Shimer several days to contact Synthes in Pennsylvania to arrange for a Synthes witness to testify at trial. When court reconvened four days later, Shimer reported to the judge that Synthes was uncooperative and that any prospective witness from Synthes was beyond the subpoena power of the court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b329-8\">Before the start of trial, the judge considered the admissibility of certain correspondence referencing the Synthes offer and its terms; FEE objected to those documents as hearsay. Shimer\u2019s attorney argued that the terms of the offer, as stated in correspondence between Synthes and Shimer, constituted operative words. The judge denied admission of the documents. These included a November 8, 1993, letter, which sets out Synthes\u2019s original offer to resolve the dispute with Shimer; a second letter, dated December 6, 1993, from a Synthes vice president, setting forth various changes to the original offer; and a December 20, 1993, letter from Synthes\u2019s attorneys, stating that \u201cSynthes\u2019 offers remain on the table\u201d for Shimer\u2019s consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">Subsequently, the judge considered FHE\u2019s motion in limine to preclude Shimer from introducing evidence of damages through Shimer\u2019s own testimony about the Synthes offer. Shimer again pressed what amounted to an operative words argument, among other grounds, all of which the judge rejected.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b329-10\">Here, we use the phrase \u201coperative words,\u201d as used in Liacos, Brodin &amp; Avery, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 8.2.5 (7th ed. 1999), to refer to testimony or documentary evidence of the kind variously described as \u201coperative statements,\u201d see <em>Telecon, Inc. </em>v. <em>Emerson-Swan, Inc., </em>17 Mass.

When a client fails to obtain a judgment or loses some future benefit through the negligence of his attorney, the client must prove not only the monetary value of the loss, but the collectibility of the sum involved. Only in that way can the client prove that he was actually harmed by the attorney\u2019s negligence. On the other hand, in a case such as the present one, where the injury to the client arises from his payment of unnecessary legal fees and costs, evidence of such an expenditure is sufficient to establish the client\u2019s loss.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
