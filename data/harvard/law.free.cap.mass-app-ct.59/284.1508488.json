L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32[\u00bf&gt;]) and doing so within 1,000 feet of a school (G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J), the defendant was found guilty by a jury of the lesser offense of possession of heroin. He now contends that (1) his pretrial motion to suppress the heroin discovered under the driver\u2019s seat of an automobile he was operating should have been allowed because the police lacked probable cause at the time they seized him; (2) he was denied a fair trial because the prosecutor improperly cross-examined him about the alleged criminal record of the passenger in the car he was driving and because the judge refused to provide a curative instruction regarding that examination; and (3) he was denied a fair trial because of several statements made by the prosecutor in closing argument, particularly the prosecutor\u2019s vouching for the credibility of the police witnesses and presenting as facts prejudicial information not in evidence. We reverse because of the prosecutorial errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">1. <em>Motion to suppress. </em>At the evidentiary hearing on the motion to suppress, the motion judge found (based on the arresting officer\u2019s testimony, the entirety of which the judge found credible) that on the evening of November 16, 1998, police officers in an unmarked vehicle were patrolling the Maple Street area of Boston, a high crime area which the arresting officer testified was \u201cprobably one of the top three drug spots in. . . Boston,\u201d where he had made approximately one hundred arrests for drug and firearms violations, including shootings. Around midnight, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>the officers saw a station wagon pull up and park in front of 32 Maple Street, where it was approached on the passenger side by three people. One was a woman the officers recognized as \u201ca drug abuser.\u201d They observed that woman pass something (described by the officer as an unknown amount of \u201cU.S. currency\u201d) through the rolled-down front-seat passenger\u2019s window to the passenger (who was later identified as Wanda Drayton).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">Two of the officers left their vehicle<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and approached the station wagon. The arresting officer then saw the driver, subsequently identified as the defendant, make a downward motion to the floor. Fearing that it was a firearm, the officer removed his revolver from its holster (keeping it at the side of his body) and ordered the defendant out of the car. Reaching under the driver\u2019s seat to discover what had apparently been secreted there, the officer pulled out fifty glossine bags of heroin wrapped in a napkin secured by a rubber band.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">On the basis of this evidence, the judge denied the motion to suppress, ruling that the officer\u2019s testimony established \u201cprobable cause to believe that a drug transaction had recently taken place at this automobile and thus justified the removal of the passengers from the automobile and a search of the automobile since individuals involved in the narcotics trade are frequently armed. . . . [F]or the officer[\u2019]s own safety he was justified in searching the automobile within a[n] arms-length of where [the defendant] had been seated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">The defendant asserts that he was effectively seized when the police \u201cblocked\u201d him in (see note 1, <em>supra) </em>so that he was not free to leave prior to their observing his placing something under his seat, at a time when they lacked reasonable suspicion of a crime, much less probable cause for the warrantless seizure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>of the heroin. Under the relevant authorities, however, the circumstances found by the judge adequately provided the officers with probable cause to conclude that a drug transaction had occurred and to arrest him prior to their blocking his car. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>362 Mass. 74, 76-77 (1972); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>366 Mass. 790, 792-793, 798 (1975); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carrasco, </em>405 Mass. 316, 322 (1989); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santaliz, </em>413 Mass. 238, 240-242 (1992); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>426 Mass. 703, 708-711 (1998); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sweezey, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 48, 49-51 (2000); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Albert, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 377, 377-380 (2001). The protective search under the driver\u2019s seat was, accordingly, proper as a search incident to the defendant\u2019s arrest for illegal drug activity. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Toole, </em>389 Mass. 159, 162 (1983); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanchez, </em>403 Mass. 640, 646 &amp; n.4 (1988); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lantigua, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 526, 527-528 (1995); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sweezey, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. at 52-53, and cases cited. The fact that the defendant was not formally arrested until after the search is not material so long as probable cause existed to arrest at the time the police made the search for weapons or contraband. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brillante, </em>399 Mass. 152, 155 (1987).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">We agree with the Commonwealth that, in any event, \u201c[t]he scenario observed by the officers, filtered through the lens of their experience,\u201d provided them with reasonable suspicion to make a proper investigative stop of the defendant and his automobile. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sweezey, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. at 51. Based on the facts found by the judge and the uncontested testimony of the arresting officer, the police had ample reason to suspect that a drug transaction had taken or was about to take place and to conduct, at the very least, a threshold inquiry and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>therefore, a protective search for their own safety.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moses, </em>408 Mass. 136, 140-144 (1990); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stampley, </em>437 Mass. 323, 327-329 (2002); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Heughan, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 102, 104-105 (1996); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mantinez, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 513, 515-517 (1998); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Riche, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 830, 833-835 (2001); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Albert, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. at 380 n.8. The temporary blocking of his car, construed by the defendant as effecting an illegal arrest, did not invalidate the proper threshold inquiry. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moses, </em>408 Mass. at 142-143; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>427 Mass. 729, 733-734, cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1008 (1998); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitzgibbons, </em>23 Mass. App. 301, 306-309 (1986); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 208, 210-211 (2000); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ruiz, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 346, 350 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">The events subsequent to the lawful stop \u2014 the defendant\u2019s furtive gesture and his inability to produce a license or registration \u2014 easily elevated the officer\u2019s reasonable suspicion to probable cause to arrest and search the defendant and the area he had been occupying. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alvarado, </em>420 Mass. 542, 550 (1995); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Va Meng Joe, </em>425 Mass. 99, 106 (1997); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mantinez, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. at 517; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sweezey, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. at 51-52; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Albert, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. at 380 n.8. Under either analysis, therefore, the heroin found under the defendant\u2019s seat was lawfully seized and properly admitted in evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">2. <em>Improper cross-examination. </em>The defendant, a self-employed mechanic, testified that the car he was driving when arrested belonged to a friend (who was then incarcerated on account of a \u201cdrug case\u201d involving, in an undescribed way, heroin). He was test-driving the car for the friend\u2019s wife after repairing it for her when he saw an acquaintance, Wanda Dray-ton, walking on Seaver Street and offered to give her a ride to her home at 32 Maple Street. (The friend\u2019s wife also testified, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>confirming the fact of the defendant\u2019s repair and testing of the car.)</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">During cross-examination of the defendant, the prosecutor asked him whether he knew that Drayton \u201c[has] been convicted of trafficking in [a] Class A substance, heroin?\u201d Defense counsel promptly objected but was overruled by the judge. The prosecutor then asked the defendant, \u201cOr convicted of distributing Class A, heroin. Did you know that?\u201d The defendant responded by denying such knowledge. After completion of the defendant\u2019s testimony, defense counsel renewed his objections to such inquiry and requested a \u201ccurative instruction\u201d for the jury to the effect that the defendant cannot be impeached by someone else\u2019s convictions. Counsel also requested that the prosecutor be instructed not to argue the point. The judge denied the requests, eliciting another defense \u201cobjection.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">What the prosecutor did was clearly improper, and the judge\u2019s refusal to condemn the prosecutor\u2019s impropriety was an abuse of his discretion. \u201cSuch evidence tainted the defendant with guilt by association and was not relevant to prove the defendant [possessed or] distributed heroin.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Best, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 722, 725 (2001) (questions about codefendant\u2019s prior arrest for possession of heroin was improper). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>426 Mass. at 709 n.5. The prosecutor should not have been allowed to impugn the defendant\u2019s character by insinuating his knowing intimacy with a drug criminal, particularly when that alleged criminality was never established. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, </em>399 Mass. 514, 525 (1987), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 355, 364 (1985) (prosecutor\u2019s eliciting testimony that defendant, charged with assault and battery, was \u201cjello wrestler\u201d who publicly wrestled other women, had no probative value and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>illicitly \u201cfurthered the prosecutor\u2019s apparent goal of depicting [the defendant] in the minds of the jury as . . . promiscuous . . . [serving] as evidence of the defendant\u2019s bad character\u201d). A prosecutor should not be allowed to conduct a \u201ccross-examination \u2018in bad faith or without foundation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Christian, </em>430 Mass. 552, 561 (2000), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>367 Mass. 280, 285 (1975). \u201cIt is error for a prosecutor \u2018to communicate impressions by innuendo through questions which are answered in the negative . . . when the questioner has [or produces] no evidence to support the innuendo.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fordham, </em>417 Mass. 10, 20 (1994), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>367 Mass. at 284.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">Because of the irrelevance of the prosecutor\u2019s questions \u2014 the defendant\u2019s character was never in issue \u2014 and their lack of basis in the evidence, the judge erred in overruling the defendant\u2019s objections, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Howell, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 42, 49 (2000), and in refusing to cure the situation except by \u201ctardy and tepid remarks\u201d in his final instructions to the jury (which consisted entirely of the statement that \u201c[questions to the witnesses are not evidence\u201d) that were \u201cstandard, not curative.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriquez, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 370, 374 (2000) (quotation omitted). Since the defendant seasonably objected, under the applicable \u201cprejudicial error\u201d standard we must determine whether we can say with fair assurance that the error \u201cdid not influence the jury, or had but very slight effect.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. 348, 353 (1994), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peruzzi, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 437, 445 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">We have no such assurance here, where the error struck at the heart of the defense (the credibility of the defendant\u2019s \u201cinnocent\u201d explanation for being involved in the situation); where the case against him was not overwhelming (the defendant himself being unknown to the police and never having been observed dealing or handling drugs or money)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>; and where the judge\u2019s inexplicable overruling of defense counsel\u2019s objection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>may have been seen by the jury as judicial endorsement of the improper questioning and innuendo, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriquez, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. at 373, enhancing the \u201cactive danger that [the] jury could misuse the evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>409 Mass. 461, 469 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">3. <em>Factual misstatements in closing. </em>Even if the cross-examination smearing of the defendant with the purported drug misdeeds of another did not itself create undue prejudice, we are persuaded that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument exacerbated the harm to a reversibly toxic level. Apparently emboldened by his success during cross-examination, the prosecutor in closing argument derided the defendant\u2019s testimony with a renewed effort to brand him as a knowing confederate of drug criminals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-5\">\u201cThink of the circumstances that he tells you about. He just so happens to go over to a drug dealer\u2019s house to fix the drug dealer\u2019s car. And then he drives around and picks up a woman. And lo and behold, who is that woman? And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>what does she do for a living? Is she involved in the drug trade? And lo and behold they stop at 32 Maple Street, and who approaches the car? Someone the officers know to be involved in heroin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-5\">\u201cSo this poor guy, three times in one night, is surrounded by heroin users and drug dealers. And he wants you to believe it\u2019s all circumstance. 11:40 p.m. on a work night and all of sudden all his friends are either heroin users or heroin dealers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Following the prosecutor\u2019s argument, defense counsel at sidebar reminded the judge that he had earlier requested that the prosecutor be instructed not to argue that Wanda Drayton was a drug dealer or had been convicted of drug dealing because there was no evidence supporting such statements; and asked that an instruction be given the jury not to consider such argument. The judge responded, \u201cOverruled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">The prosecutor\u2019s quoted statements were devoid of evidentiary basis in every material respect. There was neither evidence nor permissible inferences from the testimony that the owner of the car which the defendant drove was a drug dealer or a heroin dealer (his incarceration following a \u201cdrug case\u201d may have been the result of heroin possession for personal use or for merely being knowingly present at a place where heroin was kept or in the company of a person possessing heroin, see G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7\u00a7 34, 35); or that Wanda Drayton was either a drug user or was involved in any way in heroin or the drug trade, much less that she did so for a living; or that the \u201cdrug user\u201d who approached the car was known to be involved with heroin or was a heroin user or was a friend of the defendant. See the authorities cited in note 6, <em>supra. </em>The manifest intention of the prosecutor was to convey to the jury the impression that the defendant was criminally implicated in heroin transactions just like and along with \u201call his friends.\u201d The remarks were not merely irrelevant to the issue of the defendant\u2019s guilt but constituted prejudicial character denigration (as discussed in the preceding section), made all the more improper because there was no evidence that the defendant himself had a criminal record involving drugs or had ever sold, used, or even touched any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>drags. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 258, 264-265 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The defendant\u2019s character was never an issue properly before the jury. The jury\u2019s sole task was to determine whether the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had possessed heroin with intent to distribute on the evening of November 16, 1998, not whether he was intimately involved with heroin dealers. A closing argument that disparages a defendant\u2019s character when it is not an issue at trial is both improper and inflammatory. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Griffith, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 784, 784-785 (1998) (prosecutor\u2019s argument calling defendant charged with single count of distributing marijuana \u201cdrug dealer\u201d was inflammatory and \u201cstepped over the boundaries of permissible advocacy\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">We reiterate the admonitions that our appellate courts have, unfortunately all too frequently, been compelled to direct to the Commonwealth\u2019s representatives: Prosecutors must hold themselves \u201cto a consistently high and proper standard,\u201d indeed \u201cto a stricter standard of conduct than are errant defense counsel and their clients\u201d held, because of the \u201cserious consequences [to the public] from improper closing argument,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, </em>399 Mass. at 519, not the least of which is a needless waste of public resources when retrials become necessary. While a prosecutor may strike hard blows, he is not at liberty to strike foul ones. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Long, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 707, 711 (1984), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Felton, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 63, 66 (1983). See <em>Berger </em>v. <em>United States, </em>295 U.S. 78, 88 (1935). In the final analysis, \u201cthe duties of a prosecutor to administer justice fairly ... go beyond winning convictions.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tucceri, </em>412 Mass. 401, 408 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">In determining whether improper argument requires reversal in any particular case, we consider whether the defendant seasonably objected, whether the error went \u201cto the heart of the case,\u201d whether the judge\u2019s instructions mitigated the error, and whether the error \u201cpossibly ma[d]e a difference in the jury\u2019s conclusions.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, </em>399 Mass. at 518. The prosecutor\u2019s closing portrayal of the defendant as a member of the heroin-dealing culture fails all of these tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>The defendant strenuously objected. The remarks were not addressed to a collateral matter but struck directly at the heart of the defense, namely, the credibility of his explanation for his activities on the evening in question \u2014 which would have been undermined by the prosecutor\u2019s manifest implication that the defendant had a propensity to commit the very kind of crime charged in this case. The judge refused to address the error at defense counsel\u2019s explicit request. He then provided an instruction that was minimally standard and entirely noncurative (being confined to eight words, \u201cArguments or statements by lawyers are not evidence\u201d). By his rulings, the judge effectively managed \u201cto give judicial endorsement to the prosecutor\u2019s improper argument,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 522, and \u201callowed the judicial imprimatur to attach to the inferences of guilt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>374 Mass. 514, 521 (1978). Finally, as noted earlier, the Commonwealth\u2019s case was far from overwhelming (see note 6, <em>supra). </em>Against this backdrop (including the harmful effect of the improper cross-examination), we cannot conclude with assurance that the improper closing remarks of the prosecutor did not tip the balance and possibly make a difference in the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">4. <em>Improper \u201cvouching.\u201d </em>Our conclusions as to the unfairly prejudicial impact of the prosecutor\u2019s conduct are further buttressed \u2014 though they require no such support \u2014 by the prosecutor\u2019s inappropriate closing remarks regarding his two police witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Defense counsel\u2019s closing argument had emphasized that the defense witnesses (especially the defendant, by virtue of his taking the stand to assert his innocence) were credible; that the police witnesses conceded they never saw the defendant touch any drugs or receive any money; that the prosecution had failed to produce any of the drug money the police had testified to seeing; that the police witnesses had exaggerated what they saw the defendant doing as they approached the car (from \u201clean-ting] down slightly\u201d at the suppression hearing to \u201cshoulder dipping\u201d at trial); and that the officers\u2019 memories were not trustworthy (they had forgotten whether they had ever determined who owned the car).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Counsel concluded his closing with the exhortation that: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>\u201cThey\u2019re making a mountain out of a molehill because they have nothing to connect [the defendant] with the drugs. They\u2019re asking you to make a leap from leaning down, shoulder dip, to yes, he did possess the drugs and he was distributing drugs. . . . The truth remains [the defendant] did not own that car. . . never touched the drugs . . . [and] is innocent because he did not know drugs were kept in that car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">This argument by defense counsel did not insinuate, much less aver, that the police witnesses were liars. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simmons, 20 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 366, 368-369 (1985); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murchison, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 269, 274-275 (1993), <em>S.C., </em>418 Mass. 58 (1994). It rather properly focused on comparative credibility, communicating to the jury that they should believe the defendant\u2019s plausible version of his involvement, not the factually unsupported \u201cleap\u201d that the police were asking them to make.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">In response, the prosecutor immediately declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-6\">\u201cLadies and gentlemen of the jury, what you just heard from [defense counsel] as he politely \u2014 what he was doing \u2014 and I grant you he was doing it very politely \u2014 he was just calling somebody a liar. . . . He\u2019s saying those two police officers, with a combined twenty-six years of experience in the various neighborhoods protecting the streets of the City of Boston, came in here, walked up to that stand, took the oath, and lied. That\u2019s what he\u2019s saying. They came in here and lied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">After several rhetorical questions in the same vein (\u201cThey came in here and lied to you? Made the whole story up? . . . Did they make that up [that the defendant bent over], too? Both of them?\u201d), the prosecutor concluded this line of argument with a final foul flourish: \u201cAgain, [if] you believe them [referring to the defendant and his counsel], you\u2019re calling those two police officers liars. That\u2019s the fact of the matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">These remarks were multiply objectionable. They not only constituted improper, if implicit, vouching<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> but also exceeded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>the bounds of fair, corrective response, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. at 370-371; impermissibly appealed to the jury\u2019s emotional concern for crime-free streets by inferentially urging their trust in the police witnesses who had long protected those streets, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vuthy Seng, </em>436 Mass. 537, 556, cert. denied, 537 U.S. 942 (2002); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>28 Mass.

Instead, he improperly suggested to the jury that it was impermissible for defense counsel to question the credibility of police officers. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grandison, </em>433 Mass. 135, 143 (2001). His argument was plainly intended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>bolster police credibility, which was the crux of the Commonwealth\u2019s case and was, therefore, particularly harmful to the defense. Although the defendant did not object to those remarks, when they are considered in conjunction with the previously discussed prosecutorial improprieties and judicial missteps, we have no hesitation in concluding that, at the very least, a substantial risk of miscarriage of justice resulted.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">\n<em>Verdict set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b308-7\">The driver of the police cruiser acknowledged that he had pulled alongside the defendant\u2019s vehicle in such a way as effectively to prevent it from moving.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b308-8\">The officer testified that he identified himself as he approached the defendant and first asked for the defendant\u2019s license and registration.

Whatever criminal record she may have had, including the purported convictions, was never introduced in evidence during the defendant\u2019s trial.

Mere presence does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>amount to possession even if one knows that drugs are there. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Booker, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 435, 437 (1991). \u201cNor is possession proved simply through the defendant\u2019s association with a person who controlled the contraband.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>While presence may \u201ctip the scale in favor of sufficiency\u201d when \u201csupplemented by other incriminating evidence,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>401 Mass. 745, 747 (1988), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Albano, </em>373 Mass. 132, 134 (1977), evidence that the driver and passenger bent forward after realizing the presence of police officers \u201cdoes not support an inference that [either] the defendant [or his passenger had] placed [contraband, in that case a firearm] under the passenger seat.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 748.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">That the jury did not find the defendant guilty of the more serious charge of possession with intent to distribute in a school zone \u2014 a fact the dissent regards as indicative of lack of prejudice to the defendant \u2022 \u2014 \u25a0 is (to the extent it is not an entirely speculative consideration) largely irrelevant in the evaluation of prejudice from objected-to improper questioning and closing argument under the \u201cprejudicial error\u201d standard. However pertinent that factor might be for purposes of the \u201csubstantial risk of miscarriage of justice\u201d (or ineffective assistance of counsel) analysis, it has little significance here, not only because the applicable review standard is a possibility, rather than a significant and material risk, of having made a difference to the jury; but also because the burden of disproving such a possibility is upon the Commonwealth, which has failed to do so. See and compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schulze, </em>389 Mass. 735, 741-742 (1983); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>427 Mass. 642, 644-645 (1998); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alphas, </em>430 Mass. 8, 13-14 &amp; n.7, 21-23 (1999). Indeed, the fact that the jury here could not render a verdict of guilty on the graver charges can be seen as another indicium that the Commonwealth\u2019s case was far from overwhelming.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b317-9\">We agree with the dissent that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks did not precisely fall within the most commonly disapproved types of vouching, i.e., directly expressing his personal belief in his witness\u2019s credibility or indicating his possession of extra-evidentiary knowledge (see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>427 Mass. 336, 352 [1998]). We also are aware that the line between arguing for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>and vouching for a witness\u2019s credibility is all too often a fine one. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ciampa, </em>406 Mass. 257, 265 (1989). Nonetheless, \u201c[w]hile not vouching in the most familiar sense, [the prosecutor\u2019s argument] does invite the jury to rely on the prestige of the government and its agents rather than the jury\u2019s own evaluation of the evidence; to this extent, the argument presents the same danger as outright vouching.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Torres-Galindo, </em>206 F.3d 136, 142 (1st Cir. 2000). We do not find it difficult to conclude that an average juror would construe the quoted comments and rhetorical questions as communicating (even if indirectly, obliquely, and implicitly) the prosecutor\u2019s personal endorsement of the proposition that the experienced police witnesses who had for many years kept Boston\u2019s streets safe \u2014 inferably, from the likes of the defendant and his \u201cheroin dealer\u201d friends who were now impugning police integrity \u2014 could be trusted to tell the truth. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ciampa, </em>406 Mass. at 265; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Griffith, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. at 788-789; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zavala, </em>52 Mass.

Drayton was the middleman in a drug transaction. Indeed, this fact helped establish probable cause to arrest. The jury, having heard of her involvement in selling heroin, could not have been adversely affected by a single question concerning the same general subject matter. Further, the response to the question was in the negative. In his final instructions, as in his preliminary instructions, the judge properly instructed the jury that such questions are not evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Lastly, the jury\u2019s acquittal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>of the defendant on the two serious charges demonstrates their ability to assess properly the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">3. <em>Factual misstatements in closing. </em>The defendant testified to a somewhat implausible story \u2014 a self-employed mechanic, driving around, late at night, at approximately 11:40 p.m., taking the car he is allegedly working on for a test ride, when he happens to bump into Wanda Drayton, out walking, whom he agrees to drive home. Just as he was pulling up to drop Drayton off, the police happen to stop him, search the car and surprisingly find fifty bags of heroin and money under the seat. A defense witness testified that she had hired him to fix her car,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which belonged to her husband who was, at the time of the incident, incarcerated for a \u201cdrug case\u201d involving heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">A prosecutor can remark on the defendant\u2019s theory of the case, as long as the statements and inferences are based in evidence and do not represent the prosecutor\u2019s personal beliefs on the credibility of the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bradshaw, </em>385 Mass. 244, 272 (1982); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sleeper, </em>435 Mass. 581, 595 (2002). Where a defendant testifies, a prosecutor can properly refer to the defendant\u2019s lies. See <em>ibid. </em>(based in part on theory that defendant\u2019s testimony was preposterous, prosecutor\u2019s reference to defendant\u2019s lies was proper). Additionally, \u201c[i]t is not improper for the prosecutor to suggest to the jury that the defendant attempted to \u2018fool\u2019 them.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>412 Mass. 375, 388 (1992). Nor is there \u201cerror in permitting the prosecutor to argue that the defense was contrived. The question of credibility of the witness was fundamental to the trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cameron, </em>385 Mass. 660, 669 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">The prosecutor handled with skepticism, properly I submit, the tale spun by the testifying defendant. The prosecutor stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-8\">\u201cThink of the circumstances that he tells you about. He just so happens to go over to a drug dealer\u2019s house to fix <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>the drug dealer\u2019s car. And then he drives around and he picks up a woman. And lo and behold, who is that woman? And what does she do for a living? Is she involved in the drug trade? And lo and behold they stop at 32 Maple Street, and who approaches the car? Someone the officers know to be involved in heroin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-4\">\u201cSo this poor guy, three times in one night, is surrounded by heroin users and drug dealers. And he wants you to believe it\u2019s all circumstance. 11:40 p.m. on a work night and all of a sudden all his friends are either heroin users or heroin dealers. And it\u2019s a circumstance. Do you believe it?\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">While the majority finds neither evidence nor permissible inferences to support the prosecutor\u2019s closing, both are clearly evident. Wanda Drayton, who was involved in the drug sale which helped create probable cause to arrest, is a drug dealer.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The person approaching the car, who passed money to Drayton, ostensibly to purchase the drugs, is a drug buyer.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The car\u2019s owner, as testified to by the defense, was at the time, serving a sentence for a \u201cdrug case\u201d involving heroin. As fifty packets of heroin were found in the car and no other drug, it is permissible to infer that the drug dealers were heroin dealers and the drug purchaser was a heroin buyer. The prosecutor\u2019s closing on this point was permissible. To conclude that \u201c[t]he prosecutor\u2019s quoted statements were devoid of evidentiary basis in every material respect\u201d is simply wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Moreover, the jury were instructed, both at the preliminary and final stages, that the closing arguments of counsel were not to be considered as evidence, which minimized any possible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>prejudicial effect.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ortiz-Soto, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 645, 650 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">4. <em>Improper vouching. </em>The police testified that, as they approached the car from the front, the defendant made a gesture as if placing something under the seat, which when searched revealed fifty bags of heroin and $184. The defendant asserted that he did not make the gesture. The defendant, in his closing, intimated that the police were being less than candid.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">In response, the prosecutor, in his closing, characterized this argument as calling the police liars.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant, although vigilant and objecting to other evidence, chose not to object <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>here. The majority characterizes this unobjected-to argument as prosecutorial vouching.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">\u201cImproper vouching can occur if an attorney expresses a personal belief in the credibility of a witness, or indicates that he or she has knowledge independent of the evidence before the jury.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>427 Mass. 336, 352 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Here the prosecutor did not vouch for the credibility of the police officers. There was no expression of personal belief in the credibility of the police or an indication that the prosecutor had knowledge independent of the evidence before the jury. The prosecutor simply made an accurate statement of fact: that if the jury believed the defendant, they could not also believe the police. It is axiomatic that when there are two conflicting versions of events and one side is found, by a jury, to be true, the other side has to have been found to be not true.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cIn a case that essentially reduces to which of two conflicting stories is true, it may be reasonable to infer, and hence to argue, that one of the two sides is lying.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murchison, </em>418 Mass. 58, 60 (1994), quoting from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Molina, </em>934 F.2d 1440, 1445 (9th Cir. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">5. <em>Conclusion. </em>A defendant is entitled to a fair trial, not one free from all error. While missteps were made here, including some aspects of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, none resulted in the defendant receiving anything other than the trial to which he was entitled. That the jury were intelligent and sophisticated, moving beyond puffery and rhetoric, is evidenced by their finding the defendant not guilty of the serious charges facing him (drag trafficking in a school zone) and finding him guilty only of so much of the first indictment as alleged simple possession. That militates, in part, against finding both prejudicial error and a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. As such, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b319-10\">It appears the question was asked, not to disparage the defendant\u2019s character as the majority indicates, but rather to shed light on the knowledge element of the crime. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Supplee, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 265, 268 (1998) (\u201cWe do not discount the possibility that a case might arise in which a judge, within discretion, could permit the use of someone else\u2019s conviction in cross-examination to test the accuracy of a witness\u2019s perception\u201d).

App. Ct. 257, 260-261 (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b319-11\">The majority characterizes the jury instruction as \u201ctardy and tepid\u201d and \u201cstandard, not curative.\u201d How then does a jury respond to such an instrac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>tian?

And if you remember, I had him read his own statement, which he reviewed for some time, to confirm. And he read it to you. A couple of months ago, he wasn\u2019t so sure, he says \u2014 and that was at a hearing before a judge, under oath \u2014 \u2018I guess, I guess he would have to lean down slightly.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">\u201cThat has now progressed to, I saw his shoulder dipping.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">\u201cAnd just think about what the officers said about where he found the drugs; under the center of the seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-11\">\u201cWe\u2019ve all been in cars before.

He\u2019s saying those two police officers, with a combined twenty-six years of experience in the various neighborhoods protecting the streets of the City of Boston, came in here, walked up to that stand, took the oath, and lied. That\u2019s what he\u2019s saying. They came in here and lied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-14\">The prosecutor later asserted, arguably coming close to, if not stepping over the line, \u201cAgain, [if] you believe them, you\u2019re calling those two police officers liars. That\u2019s the fact of the matter.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Some cases, of course, may call into question the possibility of a good faith mistake being made, as opposed to a lie. As veteran trial counsel know, it is rare to call a witness a liar, preferring the more subtle route. A trial judge must listen closely to ensure that the arguments made are warranted by the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
