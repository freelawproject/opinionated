The service included putting pictures of the clients and other information they provided about themselves on Rainbow\u2019s website. In return, the clients were given the names of those who expressed an interest, as well as other information that those people, who appear to be mostly \u201cWestern\u201d men, sent by electronic mail (e-mail) to Rainbow. Rainbow also agreed to facilitate communications between the clients and those interested in them.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">The clients agreed to pay Rainbow a nonrefundable registration fee of 5,800 yuan (U.S. $700). The agreement also provided that the client \u201cagrees to pay Rainbow US $7,500 . . . following his/her marriage with a person introduced by Rainbow, that if such payment is not made within 60 days following such marriage there shall be an annual interest rate of 18% paid by client on all payments overdue.\u201d The agreement further states that \u201csettlement of any disputes regarding this agreement shall be settled in that country in which (1) [the] client holds legal residency and in which [the] client\u2019s spouse hold nationality or in that country in which [the] client\u2019s spouse holds nationality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">On May 20, 1995, Ping Cui signed the agreement and paid the registration fee. Ping Cui was thereafter listed and profiled on the website. Her age and employment were provided, as was her picture.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">On November 28, 1997, John Choma responded to Rainbow\u2019s website expressing interest in Ping Cui. He also included personal information about himself, such as his residence in Massachusetts, his age, height, education, and that his work was in \u201cclothing material design.\u201d Rainbow relayed all of this information, without verification or other background checks, to Ping Cui on December 13, 1997. Between December 13, 1997, and May 18, 1998, Ping Cui and Rainbow had no further communications.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-17\">In March and April, 1998, Choma sent e-mail to Rainbow, describing his ongoing correspondence with Ping Cui, his inten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>tian to meet her and her family in China, and her arrangements for wedding photographs. He also asked Rainbow for \u201cinformation and procedures . . . required for marriage registration\u201d in China. On May 18, 1998, Ping Cui wrote a letter to Rainbow that stated: \u201cI want to first tell you that I didn\u2019t marry any person you introduced to me. The information you gave me about the man you introduced was not the same. He is not an engineer and he doesn\u2019t have a regular job. . . . From Sept. 1997 I lost my job and so don\u2019t have a regular job income. If you continue to give me service and if someone will marry me, I will not be able to pay your service fee. ... I want us to stop our contract. I suggest you return my photos and information. Please do as I require.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Approximately one year later, on April 24, 1999, Ping Cui and Choma were married in Attleboro. The marriage certificate indicated that she was 37 years old and he was 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">Ping Cui did not make the $7,500 payment required by the agreement \u201cfollowing marriage.\u201d Rainbow thereafter brought a breach of contract action in District Court in Massachusetts based on Massachusetts law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial judge concluded that Ping Cui had received the full benefit of the bargain. He reasoned that \u201c[wjhile this Court has no doubt that contracts which are by design intended to produce fraudulent marriages or produce mistaken marriages violate public policy, here, this is not the case.\u201d In a carefully researched opinion, the Appellate Division of the District Court reversed, concluding that the contract at issue violated the longstanding common law prohibition against the enforcement of marriage brokerage contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>Although there are no Massachusetts cases that directly decide the validity of a marriage brokerage contract, there is clear and consistent case law and commentary to turn to for guidance. Marriage brokerage contracts are defined as contracts to pay a third person for negotiating, procuring or bringing about a marriage. See, e.g., Restatement (First) of Contracts \u00a7 582 (1932); Pollock, Principles of Contract at Law and in Equity 464 (3d ed. 1906); 2 Pomeroy, Equity Jurispru<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>dence \u00a7 931, at 1952 (4th ed. 1918); 52 Am. Jur. 2d Marriage \u00a7 120 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">Such contracts have been condemned and declared unenforceable in American jurisprudence without exception or equivocation. <em>See Morrison </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>115 Cal. 252, 253 (1896); <em>Hellen </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>83 Ill. App. 506, 509 (1899); <em>Muflahi </em>v. <em>Musaad, </em>205 Mich. App. 352, 353 (1994); <em>Duval </em>v. <em>Wellman, </em>124 N.Y. 156, 160 (1891); <em>Singh </em>v. <em>Singh, </em>81 Ohio App. 3d 376, 381 (1992); <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Goins, </em>187 S.W.2d 415, 417 (Tex. App. 1945); Restatement (First) of Contracts, supra; 15 Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 1475, at 546 (interim ed. 2002) (courts have declared that \u201c[t]he business of a marriage broker is illegal\u201d). In Massachusetts, although there are no decisions ruling on the question, the Supreme Judicial Court nonetheless has referred in dicta to marriage brokerage contracts as belonging in the category of contracts void as against public policy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b834-12\">The rationale and rule are encapsulated in the words of Justice Story: \u201cThe pernicious tendency of such contracts is so great that enforcement of them by the courts will be refused regardless of the propriety or expediency of the particular marriage.\u201d 1 Story, Commentaries on Equity Jurisprudence \u00a7 375, at 353 (14th ed. 1918). See <em>Boynton </em>v. <em>Hubbard, </em>7 Mass. 112, 118 (1810) (marriage brokerage contracts, although \u201cnot fraudulent on either party, are yet void, because they are a. . . public mischief, as they have a tendency to cause matrimony to be contracted on mistaken principles\u201d). Despite inevitable changes in societal mores and the marriage brokerage business since Story wrote his treatise, there remains ample basis for concern regarding \u201cpernicious\u201d tendencies in the twenty-first century world of international matchmaking and marriage brokerage contracts out of which this case arises. These concerns have only been heightened as this business booms over the Internet. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>See, e.g., International Matchmaking Organizations: A Report to Congress (Report)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (although calling for more study, Report recognizes that a virtually \u201cunregulated international matchmaking industry presents numerous opportunities for exploitation\u201d). See also Chun, The Mail-Order Bride Industry: The Perpetuation of Transnational Economic Inequalities and Stereotypes, 17 U. Pa. J. Inti. Econ. L. 1155, 1183-1187 (1996) (identifying potential problems faced by Internet mail-order brides); Jackson, To Honor and Obey: Trafficking in \u201cMail-order Brides,\u201d 70 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 475, 476-480 (2002) (describing deception and exploitation associated with intemational matchmaking organizations in the Internet age); Lee, Mail Fantasy: Global Sexual Exploitation in the Mail-Order Bride Industry and Proposed Legal Solutions, 5 Asian L.J. 139, 141 (1998) (focusing on the problems arising from the \u201corganized business of capitalizing on women\u2019s disadvantaged positions in pursuit of profit\u201d from marriage); Lloyd, Wives for Sale: The Modem International Mail-Order Bride Industry, 20 Nw. J. Inti. L. &amp; Bus. 341, 353-354 (2000) (identifying particular vulnerabilities of the immigrant, Internet-ordered bride and commenting on problems potentially arising out of the marriage brokerage debt).</p>\n<p id=\"Ayd1\">The undisputed facts here establish that the agreement at issue is a marriage brokerage contract. The company, whose full name was Rainbow International Marriage Service, agreed \u201c[t]o introduce suitable prospective marriage partners on a continuing basis until such time as the client is married.\u201d As previously noted, the services were advertised as \u201ca personal and convenient way to meet your marriage partner.\u201d With the exceptian of the $700 up-front, nonreimbursable fee, the remainder of the compensation Rainbow would receive was due only upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>the client\u2019s marriage. The amount due upon marriage was more than ten times the amount of the registration fee.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">The plaintiff argues that the agreement is not a marriage brokerage contract because his business is providing other services and he is not being paid for the marriage, just the services leading up to the marriage, should the marriage occur. His argument ignores the letter and spirit of the contract, which is tightly focused on procuring and paying for marriage. His agreement, or at least the $7,500 marriage payment provision at issue, is also not a dating services and support contract, as he contends. The agreement does not even refer to dating or social referral services. Dating or social referral services contracts that do not contain provisions for payment based on marriage are not marriage brokerage contracts. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Leifer, </em>89 Misc. 2d 724, 725-726 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1976) (interpreting N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law \u00a7 349-c [McKinney 1988] and granting Attorney General\u2019s request to eliminate marriage brokerage fee provision from \u201csocial referral services\u201d contract on public policy grounds).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">The plaintiff also seeks to define narrowly what makes a marriage brokerage contract void as a matter of public policy. He suggests that only contracts to procure a marriage with an identified person or agreements to bring about marriages for improper reasons are prohibited. He also argues that because he is paid only \u201cfollowing\u201d the marriage, he is not interfering with the spouse\u2019s free choice of partner. This ignores the breadth of the prohibition as defined by the common law, which, as stated earlier, is concerned with the \u201cpernicious\u201d tendencies of these contracts in general and does not draw distinctions based on the different types of marriage being brokered, the motives of the marriage partners or broker, the situation of the spouses, or the propriety of the particular marriage.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We conclude that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>agreement falls squarely within the categorical prohibition against marriage brokerage contracts and is therefore void as against public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">\n<em>Decision of the Appellate Division of the District Court affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b831-16\">Rainbow was the original plaintiff in District Court.
