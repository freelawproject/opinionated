(RicMer), filed an application with the defendant board of health of the city of Revere (board) seeking site assignment of a waste disposal facility under G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 150A. Pursuant to that statute, an applicant who wishes to operate a solid waste facility must submit an application to the local board of health and simultaneously submit copies to the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and the Department of Public Health. If, as was the case here, the DEP issues a favorable report indicating that the siting criteria in G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 150A V2, have been met, the local board must hold a public hearing and issue its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>decision. See generally <em>Wood Waste of Boston, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Everett, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 330, 332 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">After the board held the statutorily required public hearing, it denied RicMer\u2019s application. RicMer sought review in the Superior Court pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, and, following a hearing, a judge of that court affirmed the board\u2019s decision and ordered judgment dismissing RicMer\u2019s complaint. In this appeal, RicMer claims that the board\u2019s decision should be reversed because the hearing was tainted by unlawful procedure when the mayor and city council of Revere together were allowed to intervene as a party; RicMer further claims that the board\u2019s findings that the proposed facility would pose a danger to public health, safety, and the environment were not supported by substantial evidence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\"><em>The proposed facility. </em>RicMer proposed a solid waste transfer and recycling operation of up to 1,000 tons per day of municipal waste, including garbage from households and commercial establishments, and construction and demolition debris. The site comprises approximately 3.75 acres in a general industrial zone in Revere, and is approximately 1.6 miles north of Logan International Airport. It was planned that trucks would deliver materials to, and remove them from, a building to be constructed on the site, entering and leaving through a proposed quick-opening industrial door system.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\"><em>The city\u2019s intervention. </em>On July 15, 1999, a preliminary hearing, conducted by counsel for the board, was held to establish rules of procedure, to consider any motions to intervene or participate, and generally to establish the rules for the subsequent substantive public hearings. RicMer was represented at the public hearing. A hearing officer was appointed without objection. Counsel for the board described the roles of parties and participants, indicating that there had been substantial public interest in the project, and that a number of local and State elected officials had expressed interest in presenting statements.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">The hearing officer then accepted the suggestion of counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>for the board that motions to intervene or participate be considered. Counsel for the city of Revere (city) stated he wished formally to intervene on behalf of the city, and filed a notice of appearance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Following consideration of the requests of a number of individuals who identified themselves and requested designation as parties or participants, counsel for Ric-Mer stated his objection that there was no record of the city filing a registration under 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 16.20(9)(b) (1994) prior to the hearing. There was no request made of the hearing officer for any ruling or action. The hearing officer overruled the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">The substantive public hearing was held in sessions over thirteen days between July 15 and October 7, 1999. RicMer presented four expert witnesses. The city presented five experts. Both parties submitted a number of reports, studies, and plans as exhibits. Counsel for the city and for RicMer engaged in cross-examination of each witness. In their briefs, the parties do not cite any objections at the hearings to the testimony or the exhibits. A final hearing session was held on February 9, 2000, for the presentation of closing arguments from the several parties and participants. The mayor declined to make a statement, stating he would defer to counsel for the city. Two members of the city council made statements, as did one State representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">A fair review of the public hearing process indicates that there was no prejudice to RicMer\u2019s procedural due process rights. RicMer\u2019s parsing of the regulations in an attempt to support counsel\u2019s objection at the hearing reveals, at most, an immaterial noncompliance by the city with certain formal requirements set forth in 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 16.20(9)(b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">RicMer also argues that the city, in asserting its entitlement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>to intervention, neither made a showing of good cause nor stated how it would be \u201cspecifically and substantively affected by the hearing.\u201d The term \u201cgood cause\u201d is not defined in the regulations,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 16.20(9)(a) (1994) does not explicitly require that the hearing officer enter on the record how a determination of good cause has been made, or how a person will be \u201cspecifically and substantively\u201d affected before intervention is allowed. Moreover, \u201cdetermination]\u201d is not defined. For these reasons, and because these regulations appear to have been based upon the more formal requirements of G. L. c. 30A,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we consider analogous practice under that chapter.</p>\n<p id=\"Akr\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>The regulations with respect to intervention in this case parallel the Standard Adjudicatory Rules of Practice and Procedure, where intervention is allowed at the discretion of the presiding officer or the agency.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Compare <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Util., </em>375 Mass. 1, 45, cert. denied, 439 U.S. 921 (1978); <em>Cablevision Sys. Corp. </em>v. <em>Department of Telecommunications &amp; Energy, </em>428 Mass. 436, 437, 439 (1998); <em>Selectmen of Stockbridge </em>v. <em>Monument Inn, Inc., </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 158, 161-162 (1979), <em>S.C., </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 957 (1982) (a judge is allowed a \u201cfull range of reasonable discretion in determining whether the requirements of intervention [under Mass.R.Civ.P 24(a)(2), 365 Mass. 769 (1974),] have been met\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">The actions of the hearing officer and the parties on this record indicate that the intervention decision by the hearing officer was within the permissible bounds of discretion. Compare <em>Wilmington </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Util., </em>340 Mass. 432, 434-435, 437 (1960) (intervention either expressly or impliedly permitted where town counsel entered an appearance in a G. L. c. 30A proceeding, presented evidence, cross-examined the other party\u2019s witnesses, presented oral argument, and filed a brief). The city\u2019s participation in this case did not constitute a substantive violation of the regulations. To the extent that there were any procedural deficiencies, they were inconsequential in view of the city\u2019s obvious and overriding interest in the location of a waste disposal site within its borders and of the hearing officer\u2019s implicit recognition of that interest by his allowing the city to participate as a party in the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">There is no merit in RicMer\u2019s assertion that the participation of the \u201cMayor and City Council\u201d as a party invited them to advance their political agenda.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although counsel for the city <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>stated he was appearing on behalf of the city \u201cat the direction of the Mayor and the City Council,\u201d there is no indication in the record that counsel\u2019s presentation of evidence and witnesses, or his conduct in cross-examination and argument, in any way represented solely the views of the mayor or of the council members as individuals.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The city\u2019s presentation of evidence through five experts, not objected to by RicMer, focused on issues of air traffic hazards related to birds being attracted to the proposed facility; adequacy of size of the facility; impacts on traffic; noise; groundwater; attraction of vermin; odors; and air quality standards. In such well-known matters of public concern, municipalities may be in a significantly superior position to individual citizens in representing the public interest. Compare <em>Sudbury </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Util., </em>351 Mass. 214, 218 (1966) (in an analogous proceeding for land talcing proposed by a public utility, the court stated that \u201ccities and towns are the only entities which can be expected to offer a real, practical, and adversary representation of the public interest\u201d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Moreover, while the mayor and three city councillors testified, RicMer has not specifically identified what, if anything, constitutes a \u201cpolitical agenda\u201d in any of their statements, nor has it done more than characterize their views in opposition to the application as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>such an agenda.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The city\u2019s intervention, rather than advancing a political agenda, benefitted the proceedings by expanding the evidentiary record on which the board could base its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"AOo\">Lastly, RicMer has not identified what \u201csubstantial rights\u201d may have been prejudiced, see G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, by any procedural error. It had ample opportunity to present its case. There is no indication in this record that the procedure was in any way so unfair as to raise a question of procedural due process. Compare <em>Marmer </em>v. <em>Board of Registration of Chiropractors, </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 162, 168-169 (1974), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"AQB\"><em>Substantial evidence. </em>There is no merit in RicMer\u2019s sweeping assertion that the board\u2019s denial was not supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Pursuant to G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 150A, \u201cthe DBF\u2019s site suitability determination is not binding on the local board which must make an independent determination whether the proposed site complies with the criteria [of \u00a7 150A <em>*l!i </em>and 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 16.40 (1994)].\u201d <em>TBI, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Health of N. Andover, </em>431 Mass. 9, 11-12 (2000).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The board conducted an extensive de nova proceeding, the report of which covers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>over 1,700 pages of transcript, most of it the testimony of the nine experts produced by the parties. It also received over two hundred exhibits. There is no claim by RicMer that the submission of evidence at the hearings should have been limited in any way. Cf. <em>TBI, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Health of N. </em>Andover, <em>supra </em>at 14-15. Much of the board\u2019s decision expressly was based on its detailed analysis and conclusions concerning the credibility of the experts and its reliance on the testimony of the city\u2019s witnesses.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201cUnder the substantial evidence test, a reviewing court is not empowered to make a de nova determination of the facts, to make different credibility choices, or to draw different inferences from the facts found by the [agency].\u201d <em>Pyramid Co. of Hadley </em>v. <em>Architectural Barriers Bd., </em>403 Mass. 126, 130 (1988). See <em>Hotchkiss </em>v. <em>State Racing Commn., </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 684, 695-696 (1998), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b196-9\">There are several indications in the record that RicMer was well aware of the substance of the city\u2019s challenges to the proposed facility, beginning with the report of its engineering consultant submitted to the DEP for consideration during the DEP review process.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b197-7\">The handwritten notice states: \u201cPlease take notice that the undersigned hereby appears on behalf of the City of Revere at the direction of the Mayor and the City Council.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b197-8\">Section 16.20(9)(b) states in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\"><em>\u201cRegistration. </em>The registration of an abutter, group of abutters or ten citizen groups as a Party or the petition of a person to be an intervener to the public hearing shall be valid only if submitted prior to the commencement of the hearing.

(Counsel stated he was \u201cformally intervening on behalf of the City of Revere at the direction of the Mayor and the City Council, and . . . filing herewith the Notice of Appearance to that effect.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">The city was not an individual or a group of individuals, and it therefore was not necessary to provide a statement indicating how the city \u201cwill be substantially and specifically affected by the proposed facility,\u201d as requested in item 5. Because this hearing was preliminary to the substantive or evidentiary hearing, the city\u2019s request properly may be deemed to have been made \u201cprior to the commencement of the hearing.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b198-9\">Title 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 16.20(9)(a) (1994) states in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"AyA\"><em>\u201cIntervention. </em>Any Person who with good cause wishes to intervene in a public hearing shall file a written request (petition) for leave to intervene.

RicMer calculates that about 847 of the total of 1,755 pages of transcript reflect the presentation of the city\u2019s evidence, related cross-examination, and the city\u2019s cross-examination of RicMer\u2019s witnesses. Compare <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub.

No basis in our jurisprudence has been cited, nor are we aware of any, which suggests that such implied and undifferentiated political influence is a proper subject of judicial notice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"AqjQ\">The board determined that: \u201c[Sjiting of the proposed facility would constitute a danger to the public health, safety or the environment because bird hazards from the facility would create a danger to air traffic using Logan Airport, the size of the facility is insufficient, traffic impacts from operations would constitute a danger, and there would be a danger posed by rats, noise, odors and other nuisance problems to adjacent dwellings, apartments and other sensitive receptors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ab\">The board also concluded that no violations of State or Federal air quality standards or danger to groundwater bodies were demonstrated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"A10\">While this opinion was published after the board\u2019s hearing in this case, the board cited it in its final decision, and also referred to the Superior Court\u2019s decision of December, 1998, underlying our opinion in <em>Wood Waste of Boston, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Everett, </em>52 Mass.
