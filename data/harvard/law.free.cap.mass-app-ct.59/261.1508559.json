L. c. 268, \u00a7 32B, the defendant claims that the evidence was insufficient. The relevant portions of the statute are set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant argues that his behavior subjecting him to the charge (a) occurred after his arrest had already been effected, and (b) in any event was so innocuous that it was not contemplated by the statute, i.e., that the statute does not reach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>conduct that interferes with an arrest but poses no threat to the bodily integrity of the arresting officer, let alone a substantial risk of bodily injury. In support of both arguments the defendant relies upon <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grandison, </em>433 Mass. 135 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">1. <em>Background. </em>In the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 676-678 (1979), the judge at the bench trial could have found as follows: while investigating a traffic accident, a uniformed West Springfield police officer, Brian Duffy, recognized the defendant as the subject of an outstanding arrest warrant, notified-him that he was being arrested under the outstanding warrant, handcuffed him, and led him to the marked police cruiser. The defendant complied to that point, but when Officer Duffy opened the door and asked the defendant to get in, he refused several times, became defiant and uncooperative, and bantered back and forth with the officer. Officer Duffy\u2019s right hand was on the defendant\u2019s left arm as the officer tried to move the defendant into the cruiser. The defendant stood rigid, upright, \u201calmost like a plank of wood,\u201d and refused to bend or get into the cruiser. The defendant began to pull away, starting a \u201ctug of war.\u201d The officer gave him a \u201cquick spray\u201d of a substance that is \u201cused to control subjects who are either under arrest or trying to be under arrest or to break up certain acts of violence,\u201d after which the defendant entered the cruiser.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The judge, in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, stated that the defendant \u201cthrough physical movement did engage in an act of force ... by going with his body in the direction opposite from which the officer sought to take him to place him in the back of the cruiser,\u201d violating G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 32B(a)(l). In announcing the ultimate guilty finding, the judge stated that he found the defendant guilty because of \u201chis mechanical going in the direction opposite to what the officer sought to put him toward the back of the cruiser.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>First, we conclude that for purposes of the statute the defendant\u2019s recalcitrant behavior occurred while the police officer was \u201ceffecting\u201d his arrest and before the arrest was complete. Contrary to the defendant\u2019s claim, his arrest was not complete at the point that he was handcuffed. Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>certainly he had been \u201cseized\u201d at that time in the constitutional sense, the defendant\u2019s arrest here had not been \u201ceffect[ed],\u201d within the specific meaning of G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 32B, at least until he was fully detained in the cruiser. His resistant conduct, immediately after being handcuffed, prevented and preceded the conclusion of the sequence of events that consummated his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The defendant\u2019s reliance upon <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grandison, supra, </em>is unpersuasive. While the court in <em>Grandison </em>held that a conviction for resisting arrest \u201ccan, in no way, rest on post-arrest conduct,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 145, the court was addressing a defendant\u2019s behavior once he had been transported to the station, a separate and distinct location from the place he had been handcuffed and taken into custody. Indeed, the court noted that, \u201cin different circumstances, the \u2018continuing course of conduct\u2019 principle could conceivably factor into the prosecution of a resisting arrest charge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 146. The court further commented that \u201c[w]here, as here, the two alleged incidents of resisting arrest constitute separate, distinct factual episodes occurring at different locations, and the arrest was \u2018effected\u2019 at the scene, the \u2018continuing course of conduct\u2019 principle clearly does not apply.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We conclude that the instant case resembles the \u201cdifferent circumstances\u201d anticipated by the court in <em>Grandison.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Second, we hold that the trial judge properly concluded that the defendant\u2019s conduct was of a type prohibited by G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 32B(a)(l). Under that subsection, a suspect commits the crime of resisting arrest when he uses or threatens to use physical force or violence against the police officer or another. There is no requirement under \u00a7 32B(o)(l) that the Commonwealth show a substantial risk of causing bodily injury to the police officer or another. The judge found that the defendant used force in opposition to the officer when refusing to enter the cruiser. This conduct met the plainly stated statutory criteria for resisting arrest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">Thus, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>Commonwealth, the judge could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant resisted arrest when he attempted to prevent Officer Duffy from effecting the arrest by using physical force against the officer. The defendant\u2019s motions were correctly denied both at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case and at the close of all the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b283-16\">\u201c(a) A person commits the crime of resisting arrest if he knowingly prevents or attempts to prevent a police officer, acting under color of his official authority, from effecting an arrest of the actor or another, by:</p>\n<p id=\"b283-17\">\u201c(1) using or threatening to use physical force or violence against the police officer or another; or</p>\n<p id=\"b283-18\">\u201c(2) using any other means which creates a substantial risk of causing bodily injury to such police officer or another.\u201d G.
