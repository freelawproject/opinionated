L. c. 93A complaint alleging unfair and deceptive claim settlement practices by the claims facilitation department of a self-insuring company. Applying the principles set forth in <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Risk Mgmt. Foundation of the Harvard Med. Insts., Inc., </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 411 (1994), we determine that the summary judgment dismissal of the complaint was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>error of law. As <em>Miller </em>established, there is an independent right of action under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9, for unfair settlement practices by (1) a self-insuring corporate entity engaged in trade and business, (2) which has established a risk management processing entity to facilitate claims settlement \u2014 both of which elements apply to Toys \u201cR\u201d Us in this case. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">1. <em>Procedural and factual background. </em>While shopping in a Toys \u201cR\u201d Us store in Kingston, the plaintiff, Susan Morrison, was struck on the head and face by a falling sign. She suffered significant injuries.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She brought suit against Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, Inc., Massachusetts, a wholly owned subsidiary of the holding company, Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, Inc. (hereinafter both entities will be collectively referred to as Toys \u201cR\u201d Us). A risk management and claims facilitation department (risk management claims department) in the parent holding company conducted the settlement negotiations with Morrison. By an initial letter, the risk management claims department offered $15,000 to settle the claim. Morrison, whose demand was for $250,000, rebuffed the offer. In light of what appeared to be a case of largely indisputable liability, serious injury, and substantial medical bills (see notes 1 and 2 accompanying text), Morrison forwarded to Toys \u201cR\u201d Us a written notice, pursuant to G. L. c. 93A and G. L. c. 176D, alleging bad faith settlement practices. At this point, the Toys \u201cR\u201d Us risk management claims department counteroffered at $30,000. Morrison stood firm on her demand for $250,000. It was not until the morning of trial that another settlement offer in the amount of $45,000 was advanced. This, too, was rejected by Morrison.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">The record reflects that early in the claims review process, the underlying liability of Toys \u201cR\u201d Us was clearly presented to the risk management claims department. Tellingly, following an independent medical examination, the expert retained by Toys \u201cR\u201d Us opined both that Morrison\u2019s injuries were serious <em>and </em>were caused by the Toys \u201cR\u201d Us falling sign, stating that \u201c[t]he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>etiology is the trauma experienced on May 30, 1996.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Against the backdrop of strong evidence concerning liability developed in the pretrial claims review process, at trial commencement Toys \u201cR\u201d Us essentially admitted liability in its opening statement. The central contested issue concerned damages, for which the jury awarded $1.2 million. Ultimately, the trial judge allowed Toys \u201cR\u201d Us\u2019s motion for remittitur and the judgment was reduced to $250,000 plus interest. Morrison thereafter commenced the present action alleging unfair claim settlement practices in violation of G. L. c. 93A and G. L. c. 176D.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Toys \u201cR\u201d Us moved to dismiss the complaint. The judge treated the motion as one for summary judgment and analyzed the issues presented as follows. First, the judge noted that there was no independent right of action under G. L. c. 176D. Next, the judge determined that because the toy company was not engaged in the business of insurance, Toys \u201cR\u201d Us was not subject to the unfair insurance claim settlement prohibitions in c. 176D, \u00a7 3(9)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>; accordingly, the aforesaid unfair practices were not relevant to Morrison\u2019s complaint. Finally, the judge dismissed the G. L. c. 93A claim, based on a determination that the right to litigate for unfair claims settlement practices set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>forth in c. 93A, \u00a7 9(1), was inextricably intertwined with, and limited to, claims asserted against insuring entities, the activities of which fell within the general insurance regulatory provisions of G. L. c. 176D, and the specific prohibitions against unfair insurance practices set forth in c. 176D, \u00a7 3(9). Because Toys \u201cR\u201d Us was not so engaged in the business of insurance and subject to c. 176D, the judge concluded, Morrison had no separate and independent right of action under c. 93A, \u00a7 9, generally.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">We are in accord with the points of law that Toys \u201cR\u201d Us is not an insuring entity within the meaning of c. 176D,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and that the unfair practices defined in c. 176D, \u00a7 3(9), do not, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>their own force and effect, give rise to a private right of action.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, there was error of law in that part of the summary judgment analysis that concluded that <em>only </em>entities engaged in the business of insurance and subject to the provisions of c. 176D may confront liability for unfair claim settlement practices in a private right of action under c. 93A, \u00a7 9. There was also error in that part of the summary judgment analysis that, in effect, denied relevance to the unfair insurance settlement practices defined in G. L. c. 176, \u00a7 3(9), in reviewing whether a G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9, violation may be provable. We turn to each of these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">2. <em>The independent c. 93A, \u00a7 9, right of action for allegedly unfair claims settlement practices. </em>The summary judgment determination that this business entity is not engaged in the business of insurance within the meaning of c. 176D, \u00a7 3(9), does not end the inquiry as matter of law and, contrary to the motion judge\u2019s ruling, does not automatically render a complaint, pleaded under G. L. c. 93A alleging unfair claims settlement practices, subject to dismissal. Rather, there is an independent sustaining cause of action in c. 93A, \u00a7 9, for unfair claims settlement practices (apart from the incorporation of unfair insurance-based claims settlement practices predicated exclusively on c. 176D). A complaint under c. 93A, \u00a7 9, that seeks damages for unfair claims settlement activities conducted by a risk management processing entity established to facilitate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>claims settlement by a self-insuring corporate entity engaged in trade or commerce is not subject to dismissal, simply because no insurance company regulated under c. 176D is a named defendant. Put another way, given the aforesaid requisite elements, this c. 93A right of action for unfair claims settlement practices is not limited to entities engaged in the business of insurance and subject to the entire insurance-based regulatory scheme of G. L. c. 176D.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">These legal principles are controlled by <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Risk Mgmt. Foundation of the Harvard Med. Insts., Inc., </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 411 (1994). As Justice Kaplan wrote for the court in <em>Miller.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-6\">\u201cRisk Management [here, the risk management claims department of Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us] is prompted to argue that if, because it is a noninsurer, no direct action can be brought against it under the special provision of c. 93A, \u00a7 9, which authorizes an action against an insurance company that violates c. 176D, \u00a7 3(9), there must be some mistake in using against it, in this ordinary c. 93A, \u00a7 9, action, standards drawn from c. 176D, \u00a7 3(9).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-7\">\u201cThe argument is perverse. Risk Management, [here, the risk management claims department of Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us] as claims negotiator and potential settler, has been interposed between the [self] insurer CRICO [here, Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us] and the claimant, and nothing seems more appropriate than to apply to it the standards of fair dealing expressed in c. 176D, \u00a7 3(9). This reference, moreover, is consistent with the broad policy of the courts, in defining what is or is not unfair or deceptive for purposes of c. 93A, to go for fruitful analogy to standards established by cognate statutes, common law rules, or other sources.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 417-418 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">As in <em>Miller, </em>the risk management claims facilitation department, as the sole agent of the self-insuring corporate entity Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, conducted negotiations that involved assessing the merits of Morrison\u2019s claim, determining potential litigation exposure on the claim, engaging in claims facilitation and advancing settlement offers to Morrison. Accordingly, such claims settlement practices fall within the domain of the general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>consumer protections of c. 93A and, if conducted in an unfair and deceptive manner, may give rise to potential liability and sound in a sustainable complaint under that statute irrespective of the applicability of the c. 176D insurance regulatory scheme of oversight.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This independent c. 93A right of action for alleged unfair claims settlement practices is consistent with \u201cthe commonplace ethical view that a claims facilitator ought not wear out the claimant by unduly delaying settlement when liability is clear.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. at 418.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">We note that the legislative history and principles of statutory construction support this independent right of action under c. 93A. First, as noted in <em>Miller, </em>the application of c. 93A rights and remedies to such unfair settlement practices (as distinct from cases exclusively involving insurance companies subject to c. 176D) is supported by the case law preexisting the 1979 amendments, which created the c. 93A, \u00a7 9(1), private right of action for c. 176D, \u00a7 3(9), violations. <em>Miller, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. at 418 n.12. That is to say, even before this statutory amendment, it was the state of the law that \u201cc. 93A, \u00a7 <em>2(a), </em>coverfed] insurance practices in its prohibition of unfair or deceptive acts or practices in any trade or commerce.\u201d <em>Dodd </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>373 Mass. 72, 78 (1977). See <em>Noyes </em>v. <em>Quincy Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 1 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 723, 726 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Second, while a specific statute (here, c. 176D, covering an entity engaged in the business of insurance) may be deemed to displace a more general statute (here, c. 93A, covering general unfair trade and business practices), that principle of statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>construction is inapplicable here. The amendment that created the c. 93A, \u00a7 9(1), cause of action for c. 176D, \u00a7 3(9), unfair claims practices does not evince a legislative intent to preclude the general c. 93A unfair and deceptive trade practices liability vis-a-vis corporate enterprises and business entities that are not engaged in the business of insurance but that are nonetheless conducting unfair claims settlement negotiations through a risk management claim facility established by a self-insurer. Viewed another way, c. 176D carved out a limited sphere within which are captured entities in the insurance business. However, that specific statute does not encompass within its sphere of potential insurance-based liability entities engaged in trade and commerce but not specifically engaged in the business of insurance. Thus, the c. 176D sphere does not eclipse c. 93A with respect to unfair claims settlement practices. \u201cThe mere existence of one regulatory statute does not affect the applicability of a broader, nonconflicting statute, particularly when both statutes provide for concurrent coverage of their common subject matter.\u201d <em>Dodd, </em>373 Mass. at 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">Third, that unfair claims settlement practices by a claim processing entity, albeit not an insurance entity under c. 176D, fall within the reach of c. 93A comports with the latter as \u201ca statute of broad impact which creates new substantive rights and provides new procedural devices for the enforcement of those rights.\u201d <em>Slaney </em>v. <em>Westwood Auto, Inc., </em>366 Mass. 688, 693 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">3. <em>The relevance of the G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3(9), prohibitions. </em>In light of the reinstatement of Morrison\u2019s complaint, which will give rise to further proceedings, we also address a related error in the lower court\u2019s decision that may be pertinent to those proceedings. \u2018That is the summary judgment decision dismissing the complaint denied any relevance of the c. 176D, \u00a7 3(9), criteria to this case. This ruling is error because, when considering whether an independent c. 93A claim for unfair claims settlement practices is sustainable against a business entity engaged in claims facilitation and risk management, <em>Miller </em>held that it is appropriate to consider and afford deference to these c. 176D unfair insurance claims settlement practices. This is so because the criteria in c. 176D, \u00a7 3(9), provide a frame of reference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>\u201cconsistent with the broad policy of the courts, in defining what is or is not unfair or deceptive for purposes of c. 93A, to go for fruitful analogy to standards established by cognate statutes, common law rules, or other sources.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. at 418.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">The grant of summary judgment dismissing the complaint is reversed, and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b636-7\">The injuries to Morrison\u2019s head and face were deep and exceptionally painful and gave rise to substantial medical bills of approximately $12,000.

Persons being sued generally have the right to take the case to trial and to let the jury decide. Massachusetts Constitution, art. 15. Even if liability is clear, ordinary defendants in Massachusetts have the right to let the jury decide the damages. <em>It is only persons \u2018engaged in the business of insurance\u2019 who have the statutory duty to effectuate prompt, fair settlements when liability has become reasonably clear. . . . </em>[Ujnder G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7\u00a7 1(a) and 3, and the applicable case law, a self-insurer is not subject to the statutory duty to effectuate a fair settlement unless it is a self-insurer \u2018engaged in the business of insurance.\u2019 ... As a tort defendant not engaged in the business of providing insurance services to persons other than itself, Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us had no legal duty to the plaintiff under G. L. c. 93A and 176D to make a settlement offer\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b638-7\">General Laws c. 176D, \u00a7 1(a), as amended by St. 1974, c. 473, in pertinent part, defines as insuring entities subject to the act \u201cany individual, corporation, association, partnership, . . . and any other legal entity <em>or self insurer </em>which is <em>engaged in the business of insurance, </em>including agents, brokers, and adjusters. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b638-8\">The business of insurance, it has been said \u201cinvolves profit driven business decisions about premiums, commissions, marketing, reserves and settlement policies and practices.\u201d <em>Poznik </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Med. Professional Ins. Assn., </em>417 Mass. 48, 51 (1994). Toys \u201cR\u201d Us does not fall within this definition, notwithstanding that the record reflects that Toys \u201cR\u201d Us established a national office for risk management to make decisions about \u201csettlement policies and practices.\u201d Moreover, even though Toys \u201cR\u201d Us is a self-insurer, that fact does not, standing alone, render the business enterprise subject to c. 176D. See note 5, <em>supra </em>(excluded from c. 176D are self-insurers except if engaged in the business of insurance). See <em>Anzalone </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Authy., </em>403 Mass. 119, 122 (1988). The essential point remains that Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>and its toy stores throughout the nation, derive their profits from the sale of toys, not from engagement in the business of insurance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b639-8\">General Laws c. 176D does not itself provide a private right of action for unfair or deceptive insurance claim settlement practices. <em>Dodd </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. </em>Co., 373 Mass. 72, 75 (1977). General Laws c. 93A was amended in 1979 to add \u00a7 9(1), in order to provide such a right of action for such violations. See St. 1979, c. 406, \u00a7 1. As so amended, G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9(1), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-9\">\u201cAny person, other than a person entitled to bring action under section eleven of this chapter, who has been injured by another person\u2019s use or employment of any method, act or practice declared to be unlawful by section two or any rule or regulation issued thereunder or any person whose rights are affected by another person violating the provisions of clause (9) of section three of chapter one hundred and seventy-six D may bring an action . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b641-6\">The risk management claims facilitation entity in <em>Miller </em>acted as a third party claims facilitator in conducting settlement negotiations on behalf of CRICO, an offshore self-insurance corporation that provided medical malpractice insurance for certain teaching hospitals. <em>Id. </em>at 416. The motion judge distinguished this case on that basis. However, the particular corporate structure for CRICO and Risk Management Foundation was not the turning point for the independent c. 93A liability. Rather, the turning point as to Risk Management Foundation in <em>Miller, </em>and the nationwide risk management claims department for Toys \u201cR\u201d Us in this case, is that both entities were established for the purposes of investigating and negotiating claims and conducted these activities in an allegedly unfair manner in violation of c. 93A, even though neither entity was engaged in the business of insurance and thus subject to c. 176D. <em>Id. </em>at 418.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
