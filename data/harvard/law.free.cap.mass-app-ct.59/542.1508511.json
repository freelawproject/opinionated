A Juvenile Court judge suppressed \u201call statements\u201d a juvenile made to Larry Brown, a Springfield police lieutenant. In its interlocutory appeal, see Mass.R.Crim.P. 15(a)(2), as appearing in 422 Mass. 1501 (1996), the Commonwealth claims that none of the three \u201ccategories\u201d of statements at issue here constituted custodial interrogation and therefore should not have been suppressed. We reverse the judge\u2019s findings as to the first two statements and affirm as to the third.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\"><em>Governing legal principles. \u201cMiranda </em>safeguards come into play whenever a person in custody is subjected to either express questioning or its functional equivalent.\u201d <em>Rhode Island </em>v. <em>Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 300-301 (1980). \u201cThe term \u2018functional equivalent\u2019 encompasses \u2018any words or actions on the part of the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rubio, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 506, 512 (1989), quoting from <em>Rhode Island </em>v. <em>Innis, </em>446 U.S. at 301. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>427 Mass. 117, 123 (1998). \u201c[An] \u2018incriminating response\u2019 . . . [is] any response \u2014 whether inculpatory or exculpatory \u2014 that the <em>prosecution </em>may seek to introduce at trial.\u201d <em>Rhode Island </em>v. <em>Innis, </em>446 U.S. at 301 n.5 (emphasis in original). \u201c[A]nalysis under <em>Innis </em>\u2018turns upon the objective purpose manifested by the police.\u2019 Interrogation is present \u2018if an objective observer (with the same knowledge of the suspect as the police officer) would . . . infer that the [officer\u2019s speech or conduct was] designed to elicit an incriminating response.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rubio, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. at 512, quoting from White, Interrogation Without Questions: <em>Rhode Island </em>v. <em>Innis </em>and <em>United States </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>78 Mich. L. Rev. 1209, 1231-1232 (1980). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sheriff, </em>425 Mass. 186, 198 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">In reviewing a judge\u2019s findings in ruling on a motion to suppress, we \u201caccept[] the judge\u2019s subsidiary findings of fact absent clear error, give[] substantial deference to the judge\u2019s ultimate findings and conclusions of law, but independently review[] the correctness of the judge\u2019s application of constitutional principles to facts found.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Magee, </em>423 Mass. 381, 384 (1996), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mello, </em>420 Mass. 375, 381 n.8 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number><em>Discussion. </em>We review the statements in chronological order, setting out the facts relevant to that statement, followed by the analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">1. <em>The telephone call. </em>The judge made the following undisputed findings of fact as to the first \u201ccategory\u201d of statements. On January 4, 2001, Lieutenant Brown interviewed the victim of a home invasion. As a result of that interview, the juvenile became the \u201cfocal point\u201d of the investigation. Later that day, the lieutenant met with the juvenile\u2019s grandmother. The juvenile was not home.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Five days later, Lieutenant Brown received a telephone call at the police department assessment center from someone who identified himself as \u201cClark.\u201d At first, the lieutenant assumed it was a friend of his, but the caller corrected the lieutenant and identified himself as Clark C., the juvenile. The lieutenant had never spoken to the juvenile before. The lieutenant told the juvenile that he had talked to the juvenile\u2019s grandmother. The juvenile responded, \u201cI didn\u2019t do all that lady said I did, I just hit her.\u201d The caller then asked Lieutenant Brown whether he should confess. The lieutenant declined to advise the caller, but asked the juvenile if he would turn himself in. The caller said he would call at 8:30 a.m. to be picked up or come to the assessment center the next morning. After including these facts in her findings, the judge made no further comment about the admissibility of the telephone call. Ultimately, however, she ordered that all statements the juvenile made to the lieutenant should be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">The Commonwealth argues that these statements should not have been suppressed because the juvenile was not in custody. We agree. The juvenile initiated the telephone call and was free to end the call at any time. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ryan, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 906, 907 (1981). Indeed, even the juvenile argues only that it would have been \u201cbetter practice\u201d for the lieutenant to have given him Miranda warnings over the telephone. The judge swept too broadly when she explicitly suppressed \u201call statements\u201d (although without specific comment about the telephone call). The telephone call did not constitute custodial interrogation. It should not have been suppressed on Miranda grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>2. <em>Service of the arrest warrant. </em>The second and third statements occurred the next day. When the juvenile did not call the lieutenant or appear at the assessment center the next morning, the lieutenant went to the juvenile\u2019s home around 10:30 a.m. with an arrest warrant he had apparently obtained some days before. A woman answered the door. According to Lieutenant Brown\u2019s testimony, she was either the juvenile\u2019s aunt or older sister. After the lieutenant identified himself and said he had an arrest warrant for the juvenile, the woman acknowledged that the juvenile was there and led the police to the juvenile\u2019s bedroom where he was still sleeping. The lieutenant woke the juvenile, told him he had a warrant for his arrest, and instructed the juvenile to get up, get dressed, and come with him. The juvenile responded to this instruction by asking, \u201c[D]id my grandmother turn me in?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">The Commonwealth argues that this statement was spontaneous because it was not made in response to interrogation. Again we agree. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gittens, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 148, 150 (2002). The lieutenant did nothing to provoke the juvenile\u2019s question other than inform him that he was under arrest. See <em>Rhode Island </em>v. <em>Innis, </em>446 U.S. at 301 (1980) (Miranda warnings requirement does not apply to words or actions of police normally attendant to arrest and custody); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 602, 608-609 (1984) (same; nothing about a request to see an arrest warrant again should have alerted officers that the defendant might make an incriminating statement).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">3. <em>Officer\u2019s answer to juvenile\u2019s question. </em>In response to the juvenile\u2019s question as to whether his grandmother had turned him in, the lieutenant replied, \u201cNo.\u201d The judge further found that the lieutenant told the juvenile, \u201cYou said you were going to turn yourself in yesterday when I spoke to you, you said you were going to turn yourself in at 8:00 in the morning.\u201d The juvenile then stated that he was afraid because he had had \u201ca previous bad experience with police officers.\u201d There is no dispute that having been informed of the warrant for his arrest and told to accompany the lieutenant, the juvenile was in custody when he made this statement. The issue then, as the judge correctly pointed out, is whether the lieutenant\u2019s com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>ment and the juvenile\u2019s response constituted interrogation or its functional equivalent, requiring Miranda warnings. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rubio, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. at 511-512, citing <em>Rhode Island </em>v. <em>Innis, </em>446 U.S. at 300-301.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">The judge\u2019s findings on this point are somewhat difficult to follow. At the hearing on the juvenile\u2019s motion to suppress, counsel for the juvenile established that the lieutenant had never spoken to the juvenile prior to the telephone call the day before the arrest, and that \u201cthe only reason why [the lieutenant] thought [the caller was the juvenile] was because the individual identified himself as [Clark C.].\u201d Continuing with cross-examination, counsel asked the lieutenant about the lieutenant\u2019s conversation with the juvenile on the day of the arrest regarding the telephone call the day before, and the juvenile\u2019s statement in that call that he would turn himself in. Counsel asked the lieutenant, \u201c[D]idn\u2019t you think that [your comment would lead the juvenile to] corroborate the phone call?\u201d The lieutenant denied that his remark to the juvenile was a question, and said that it was \u201ca form of a statement.\u201d In an effort to establish that the lieutenant was attempting to insure the admissibility of the telephone call, counsel then asked the lieutenant, \u201c[T]he statement that you made[] directly supports the phone call that you had the day before, is that right?\u201d While continuing to deny that such was his intent, the lieutenant acknowledged that \u201c[i]t could be interpreted like that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">In her subsequent findings and order, the judge adopted the correct legal standard \u2014 that the \u201c \u2018functional equivalent\u2019 test turns on whether the officer\u2019s statements and conduct would be perceived as an interrogation by a reasonable person in the same circumstances.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sheriff, </em>425 Mass. at 198 (\u201cin order to determine whether a suspect has been subjected to custodial interrogation, the primary focus is on the suspect\u2019s perceptions rather than the police officer\u2019s intent\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rubio, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. at 512; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>985 F.2d 3, 7 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 508 U.S. 944 (1993). Taking into account all of the circumstances, including the fact that Clark C. was a juvenile, the judge found that the lieutenant\u2019s statement \u201cwas reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response .... The officer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>consciously or unconsciously, attempted to verify a voice that he heard, but did not recognize, on the phone the previous day.\u201d The judge further found that \u201c[the lieutenant\u2019s] topic was the information necessary to substantiate [the] earlier phone call for evidentiary purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">Although the judge set out these rulings in her conclusions of law, they were findings of fact. See Smith, Criminal Practice &amp; Procedure \u00a7 1948, at 287 (2d ed. 1983) (a finding is a finding of fact \u201cif it calls for the application of the reasoning powers of the Judge as to the facts or involves weighing of evidence\u201d). See also <em>Gauvin </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>404 Mass. 450, 453 n.4 (1989) (what a reasonable person should know is a question of fact). The judge\u2019s findings were not clearly erroneous. We therefore defer to her subsequent conclusion that the lieutenant\u2019s remark was the functional equivalent of \u201cexpress questioning].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">The Commonwealth argues that the lieutenant\u2019s comment was not an attempt to confirm that it was the juvenile who made the telephone call because there was no need for such a confirmation. Lieutenant Brown testified that he recognized the juvenile\u2019s voice when the juvenile asked whether his grandmother had turned him in. According to the Commonwealth, that voice recognition plus the circumstantial evidence that the person on the telephone was the juvenile was sufficient to authenticate the telephone call. See Liacos, Brodin &amp; Avery, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 12.4, at 743 (7th ed. 1999). The Commonwealth contends that since no additional authentication was necessary, it was \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d for the judge to conclude that the lieutenant\u2019s \u201canswer to the juvenile\u2019s question constituted the functional equivalent of interrogation.\u201d The Commonwealth also contends that the judge\u2019s failure to make an explicit finding that the lieutenant recognized the juvenile\u2019s voice was clearly erroneous. We disagree with this analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">That the Commonwealth might successfully introduce the statements the juvenile made during the telephone call without his later statement essentially confirming that it was he who made the call, does not change the status of that later statement. The later statement would likely ensure the introduction of the telephone call and thus clearly strengthen the Commonwealth\u2019s case. The juvenile\u2019s explanation of why he did not carry through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>on the arrangement he made with Lieutenant Brown on the telephone was an \u201c \u2018incriminating response\u2019 . . . by an accused . . . which [could] be used at trial to help prove [his] guilt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rubio, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. at 513, citing <em>Rhode Island </em>v. <em>Innis, </em>446 U.S. at 301 n.5. The judge heard the testimony, and her conclusion that the lieutenant\u2019s statement eliciting the juvenile\u2019s response was the functional equivalent of custodial interrogation is \u201cbinding in the absence of clear error.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cao, </em>419 Mass. 383, 384, cert. denied, 515 U.S. 1146 (1995), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Correia, </em>381 Mass. 65, 76 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">This case is distinguishable from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Figueroa, </em>56 Mass. App. Ct. 641. (2002), in which we recently affirmed <em>a </em>Superior Court judge\u2019s denial of a defendant\u2019s motion to suppress on somewhat similar facts. In <em>Figueroa, </em>the defendant, who was not a juvenile, maintained a \u201ccongenial conversation\u201d with police while being driven from New York to Massachusetts. <em>Id. </em>at 644. The trial judge found that it was the defendant who initiated the conversation and asked the questions to which the police only responded. <em>Id. </em>at 645. (The Commonwealth did not attempt to introduce at trial any statements concerning the defendant\u2019s whereabouts while a fugitive.)</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">In the case before us, while it was the recently awakened juvenile who asked the question about his grandmother, the lieutenant did more than answer the juvenile\u2019s question in the negative. He went on to raise the issue of the arrangements made in the telephone call. Although the lieutenant testified that he was trying to protect the grandmother, the judge was not required to credit this testimony. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>376 Mass. 885, 898 (1978) (credibility of witnesses\u2019 testimony is within the province of the trier of fact even when the proof offered is in support of a constitutional claim and the evidence is uncontradicted). Moreover, it is not the officer\u2019s professed purpose in making the remark that controls, but rather the perception of an objective observer. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rubio, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. at 512.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">4. <em>Voluntariness of juvenile\u2019s statement. </em>Since the judge did not err in determining that the lieutenant\u2019s remark was in effect a question, the safeguards of <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>(1966), were required. See <em>In re Gault, </em>387 U.S. 1, 55 (1967). No Miranda warnings were given. In their absence, we need not consider whether the juvenile\u2019s statements were otherwise voluntary. In any case, on these facts, the Commonwealth could not sustain its heavy burden. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mark M., ante </em>86, 89 &amp; n.3 (2003). The juvenile\u2019s statement explaining his failure to turn himself in was therefore correctly suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">5. <em>Conclusion. </em>The judge\u2019s order as applied to the juvenile\u2019s statements on the telephone and to his question the next morning asking whether his grandmother turned him in is reversed. Those statements should not have been suppressed on Miranda grounds. We express no opinion as to whether there may be other grounds for objection to the admission of the first two statements. The judge\u2019s order suppressing the statement of explanation for the juvenile\u2019s failure to turn himself in is affirmed. That statement may not be introduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
