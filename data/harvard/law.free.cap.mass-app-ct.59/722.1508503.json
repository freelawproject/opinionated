The diocesan bishop asserted control over the parish, replaced the leaders and when the displaced leaders refused to surrender the church keys, commenced an action seeking injunctive and declaratory relief. A judge of the Superior Court entered summary judgment in favor of the Diocese in that action, and two related actions were thereafter dismissed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">Because (i) PECUSA is a hierarchical religious organization, see <em>Parish of the Advent </em>v. <em>Protestant Episcopal Diocese of Mass., </em>426 Mass. 268, 281 (1997), and (ii) the parties\u2019 dispute principally concerns the scope of diocesan authority over a subordinate parish, we are required under settled law to defer to the determination of diocesan authority within the hierarchy of the religious organization. We accordingly affirm the judgment of the Superior Court recognizing the Diocese\u2019s rights of access to the church property, and enjoining the defendants from interfering with such access.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-9\">I. <em>Background. </em>Organized in 1789, PECUSA traces its roots to the earliest days of post-revolutionary America. Within PECUSA are 113 discrete geographically defined dioceses. Within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>each diocese are separate parishes and missions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> PECUSA and its affiliated dioceses and parishes are governed by a national constitution and canons, and each diocese is also governed by its own diocesan constitution and canons. Further descriptive background of PECUSA and its hierarchical relationship to the subordinate dioceses, and to the parishes and missions within each diocese, appears in <em>Parish of the Advent </em>v. <em>Protestant Episcopal Diocese of Mass., supra </em>at 270-271.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-11\">St. Paul\u2019s Episcopal Church in Brockton (St. Paul\u2019s) formed as a mission of PECUSA in 1882, and incorporated in 1890 under P.S. 1882, c. 38 \u00a7\u00a7 24-25.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As adopted on May 5, 1890, and revised on January 14, 1935, its bylaws provided (i) that St. Paul\u2019s \u201caccedes to the Constitution, Canons, doctrine, discipline and worship of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America, and to the Constitution and Canons of the Diocese of Massachusetts, and acknowledges their authority\u201d; and (ii) \u201cthat no amendment shall ever be made which shall in any degree release the Parish from its allegiance to the authority of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America or the Diocese within the limits of which the Parish may be . . . .\u201d Those provisions remained untouched until 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-24\">Beginning in 1994, out of disagreement with the Diocese and PECUSA on various doctrinal matters,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> St. Paul\u2019s parish leaders took a series of steps to distance the parish from PECUSA and the Diocese. In 1994, St. Paul\u2019s voted to withhold diocesan assessments, a determination it reaffirmed the following year. In 1996, St. Paul\u2019s (i) ceased filing annual reports with the Diocese and (ii) voted (by its then leaders and members present at a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>special meeting) to adopt new articles of organization and bylaws, which omitted any statement of allegiance to the Diocese or PECUSA. St. Paul\u2019s did not submit the new articles or bylaws to the Diocese for approval, and (not surprisingly) the Diocese took no action to approve them. The restated articles of organization were filed with the Secretary of the Commonwealth on April 19, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"AsCp\">On October 29, 1998, the then leaders of St. Paul\u2019s incorporated St. Paul\u2019s Columbarium Trust, Inc. (Columbarium Trust) to \u201cprovide a sacred, serene, secure, and perpetual place of internment of cremated remains . . . within Saint Paul\u2019s.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> By lease dated October 26, 1997,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> St. Paul\u2019s leased to the Columbarium Trust for a term of twenty years (with four successive options to renew of twenty years each), at an annual rent of one dollar, an area of approximately 120 square feet within the St. Paul\u2019s church building (columbarium lease).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AR3\">On November 7, 1998, the Diocese adopted a canonical amendment empowering it to reclassify as a mission any parish which had not paid in full its diocesan assessments and, pursuant to that authority, reclassified St. Paul\u2019s as a mission. In early 1999, the diocesan bishop informed the congregation of St. Paul\u2019s of the appointment of a new vicar, and the appointment of a number of individuals to serve on the mission\u2019s executive committee in replacement of the former parish vestry. By letter dated January 26, 1999, the bishop asked the former vestry members to turn over all keys, property, books, and records for St. Paul\u2019s, but he received no response. Anticipating resistance to its efforts to gain control over the church property, the Diocese filed a complaint in the Plymouth Superior Court (first action) on March 5, 1999, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to gain possession and control of the property. The two related actions, initiated by the leaders displaced by the Diocese, followed shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-32\">II. <em>Disposition of Diocese\u2019s Complaint. </em>After hearing argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>ment on cross motions for summary judgment filed in the first action, and issuing a thorough memorandum of decision, the motion judge entered a judgment declaring that the Diocese and the leaders of St. Paul\u2019s installed by the bishop are entitled to the control and use of St. Paul\u2019s property, and enjoining the former parish leaders from interfering with such access and control.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In her memorandum of decision, the motion judge recognized the question of the court\u2019s jurisdiction over a dispute between members of a religious organization, concluding that jurisdiction was proper on the facts presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-12\">The question of jurisdiction arises because the \u201cFirst Amendment prohibits civil courts from intervening in disputes concerning religious doctrine, discipline, faith, or internal organization.\u201d <em>Parish of the Advent </em>v. <em>Protestant Episcopal Diocese of Mass., supra </em>at 280, quoting <em>Fortin </em>v. <em>Roman Catholic Bishop of Worcester, </em>416 Mass. 781, 785, cert. denied, 511 U.S. 1142 (1994). Massachusetts courts traditionally have resolved the question of jurisdiction by examining the structure of the religious organization to determine whether it is hierarchical or congregational, or a combination of both. <em>Parish of the Advent, supra </em>at 280-281, and cases cited. If the religious organization is hierarchical in structure, courts presented with an internal church dispute generally are without authority to set aside the determination of the matter by the highest ecclesiastical authority within the church. <em>Id. </em>See <em>Serbian E. Orthodox Diocese </em>v. <em>Milivojevich, </em>426 U.S. 696, 709 (1976). Indeed, \u201c[i]t is in disputes involving hierarchical churches that civil courts must tread more cautiously, for the First Amendment \u2018permits hierarchical [churches] to establish their own rules and regulatians for internal discipline and government, and to create tribunals for adjudicating disputes over these matters.\u2019 \u201d <em>Parish of the Advent, supra </em>at 280, quoting <em>Antioch Temple, Inc. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number><em>Parekh, </em>383 Mass. 854, 861 (1981).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Based on our review of the record we conclude, consistently with the motion judge, with <em>Parish of the Advent </em>and (as applicable to St. Paul\u2019s itself) with <em>Hiles </em>v. <em>Episcopal Diocese of Mass., </em>437 Mass. at 508, that the Episcopal Church is hierarchical and that St. Paul\u2019s is a subordinate mission within it.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A_yh\">Under a constitutionally permissible alternative approach, where a dispute directly concerns a purely secular matter (such as rights to church property) and does not implicate matters of church doctrine, discipline, or authority, a court may exert jurisdiction over, and resolve, the dispute by the application of neutral principles of law. See <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Wolf, </em>443 U.S. 595, 602-603 (1979); <em>Fortin </em>v. <em>Roman Catholic Bishop of Worcester, </em>416 Mass. at 787. However, as noted in <em>Parish of the Advent, </em>426 Mass. at 283-286, it is often difficult to separate matters of religious doctrine or discipline entirely from a dispute between competing church factions. The present dispute, similar to that in <em>Parish of the Advent, </em>arose out of a disagreement over the Diocese\u2019s authority to reclassify St. Paul\u2019s as a mission and to replace its leaders. See <em>id. </em>at 284. Though the Diocese sought by its complaint to establish its right to control the church <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>property, the action was precipitated by the displaced leaders\u2019 refusal to recognize the bishop\u2019s authority to remove them and their unwillingness to surrender keys to the property. Because the question of the right to use and possess the St. Paul\u2019s church property is inextricably intertwined with the question of which individuals hold authority to act on behalf of St. Paul\u2019s (a questian that essentially depends on the authority of the Diocese and its bishop over the mission or parish), we consider the matter to be inappropriate for determination by application of neutral principles of law.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b750-13\">That we are without authority to intervene in a nonsecular dispute within a hierarchical religious organization does not mean that we are entirely without jurisdiction over the Diocese\u2019s complaint.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Unlike the posture in <em>Parish of the Advent, </em>the present case arises on a request by the Diocese for civil enforcement of the rights determined by ecclesiastical authority. \u201cThe State has an obvious and legitimate interest in the peaceful resolution of property disputes, and in providing a civil forum where the ownership of church property can be determined conclusively.\u201d <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Wolf, </em>443 U.S. at 602. It is one thing to defer to the determination of religious matters by ecclesiastical authorities, or even to decline jurisdiction over a request by dissident church members to reexamine or to set aside that determination. It is quite another to refuse jurisdiction over a request by the ecclesiastical authorities themselves for civil enforcement of their resolution of matters subjected, by church structure, to their control. Other courts have exercised jurisdictian within that limited scope where necessary to enforce ecclesiastical determinations within a hierarchical church. See, e.g., <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>80 U.S. 679 (1871) (affirming declaratory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>judgment enforcing determination of highest ecclesiastical authority of hierarchical church); <em>Tea </em>v. <em>Protestant Episcopal Church in the Diocese of Nev., </em>96 Nev. 399 (1980) (same); <em>Protestant Episcopal Church in the Diocese of N.J. </em>v. <em>Graves, </em>83 N.J. 572 (1980) (same). We accordingly conclude that it was proper for the lower court to exercise jurisdiction over the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint for the purpose of entering the declaratory and injunctive relief necessary to enforce the ecclesiastical determination of the parties\u2019 dispute over the governance of St. Paul\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">III. <em>Related Actions. </em>Following the judge\u2019s order allowing the Diocese\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the two related actions commenced by the displaced leaders on behalf of St. Paul\u2019s were dismissed. In the bequest action, judgment entered on the allowance of a motion to dismiss; in the columbarium action, a judgment of dismissal entered on the parties\u2019 cross motions for summary judgment. Consistent with the analysis in the preceding section, we agree that the bequest action, and the property claims asserted on behalf of St. Paul\u2019s in the columbarium action, were properly dismissed, if for no other reason than a lack of subject matter jurisdiction. See <em>Parish of the Advent, supra </em>at 286.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">The claim by the Columbarium Trust of rights under the columbarium lease is in a somewhat different posture. The motion judge considered the question of the columbarium lease subsumed within her determination in the first action that St. Paul\u2019s holds its property in trust for the Diocese and PECUSA, and therefore treated the claim by the Columbarium Trust of rights under the columbarium lease as barred on grounds of issue preclusion. As we have observed, however, though the first action sought to determine who had rights to control the church property, the controversy framed in that ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>tian concerned the authority of the diocesan bishop to designate the individuals authorized to act on behalf of St. Paul\u2019s rather than the question of title to the property itself. Moreover, unlike the bylaws of St. Paul\u2019s, there has never been any provision within the corporate documents that established the Columbarium Trust subjecting the trust to the authority of the Diocese or PECUSA. Finally, the columbarium lease appears to have been executed before the bishop reclassified St. Paul\u2019s from a parish to a mission and discharged and replaced the dissident leaders.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Therefore, though we agree with the motion judge\u2019s conclusion that the Columbarium Trust holds no rights under the columbarium lease, we reach that conclusion by a slightly different analytical route.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-15\">As a threshold matter, we agree that St. Paul\u2019s holds its property in trust for the Diocese and PECUSA, for substantially the same reasons stated by the motion judge in her analysis of the question under neutral principles of law in the first action. That trust exists principally and most clearly by virtue of PECUSA\u2019s adoption, in 1979, of Canon 1.6.4 (the so-called \u201cDennis Canon\u201d),<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> in combination with the statement in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>bylaws of St. Paul\u2019s that it accedes to the Canons of PECUSA.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Various other factors also support the same conclusion. For example, PECUSA Canon 1.7.3 provides that no vestry or other body authorized by civil or canon law to hold real property for any parish may alienate or encumber the property without the approval of the bishop and \u201cstanding committee\u201d of the diocese of which the parish is a part.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">To identical effect is the Diocese\u2019s cognate Canon IV.3.6 prohibiting the alienation or encumbrance of any property held by or for any parish without diocesan approval. The property at issue here had been held since its acquisition in 1887 and 1913 by the diocesan Trustees of Donations under an express trust for the benefit of the Diocese. The 1957 deed conveying the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>property from the diocesan Trustees of Donations to St. Paul\u2019s stated that the conveyance was free of the trust imposed by the original deeds. However, that conveyance occurred within a relatively few years after the Diocese\u2019s adoption of Canon IV.3.6. In light of the then-existing requirement for diocesan approval of any transfer and the statement in the bylaws of St. Paul\u2019s stating its accession to the diocese in all matters of governance, the fact that in 1957 the property was placed in the name of St. Paul\u2019s free of the trust imposed by the deeds appears less a determination to release the property to the autonomous control of St. Paul\u2019s than a matter of administrative convenience.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-15\">The conclusion that St. Paul\u2019s holds its property in trust for the Diocese and PECUSA establishes that St. Paul\u2019s officers violated the terms of that trust (as well as the diocesan canon prohibiting transfer of property without diocesan approval) when they conveyed a leasehold interest in a portion of the church to the Columbarium Trust. However, as we have described, the trust in favor of the Diocese arises under the provisions of the bylaws of St. Paul\u2019s and the canons of PECUSA and the Diocese, rather than under any recorded instrument. There would accordingly be some question of its effeet on the interest claimed by the Columbarium Trust, were it not for the fact that the officers and directors of the Columbarium Trust were St. Paul\u2019s congregation members, and included Deirdre DeVine (a named defendant in the first action and the apparent leader of the displaced group). Since the Columbarium Trust is fairly charged with actual knowledge of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>the limitations on the right of St. Paul\u2019s to convey any interest in its property, it may not claim to be an innocent transferee so as to avoid invalidation of its claimed rights under the columbarium lease on grounds that it was conveyed in violation of the trust, or in the face of canonical prohibitions against transfer.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aks\">IV. <em>Conclusion. </em>The judgment in the first action shall be modified to delete the declaration that St. Paul\u2019s in Brockton holds its real and personal property in trust for the Diocese and PECUSA and, as so modified, is affirmed.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> So much of the judgment in the columbarium action that dismissed the claim for rights under the columbarium lease is vacated, and a new provision is entered to declare that the columbarium lease is invalid and creates no rights in the Columbarium Trust; the remainder of the judgment in that action is affirmed. The judgment dismissing the bequest action is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"A2C\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b745-10\">The two related actions were (i) an action characterized as one by St. Paul\u2019s Parish (the verified complaint was signed by Deirdre DeVine, one of the displaced leaders) seeking a declaration that the parish is entitled to the bequest from the estate of Robert W. Palm and seeking to enjoin the executrix of the estate from disbursing the proceeds to the Diocese (bequest action); and (ii) an action characterized as one by St. Paul\u2019s Parish and an incorporated trust, St. Paul\u2019s Columbarium Trust, Inc., seeking, inter alla, to enforce a lease of church property for a columbarium (columbarium action).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b746-31\">As described in the affidavit of the diocesan bishop, M.

However, the question of the scope of St. Paul\u2019s interest in the property is relevant to determining the validity of the lease to the Columbarium Trust. See part HI, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"A1y\">If the religious organization is congregational rather than hierarchical, a civil court may give effect to an authoritative resolution by the governing church body within a local congregation. See <em>Antioch Temple, Inc. </em>v. <em>Parekh, supra </em>at 860. In either case, however, the role of the court is not to become involved in disputes over religious doctrine or internal church organization; instead, the court is to examine how the church has elected to govern itself, and to defer to the determinations of the official or body within the church imbued with authority over the matter in dispute. See <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston, </em>378 Mass. 58, 61 &amp; 64 n.5, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 899 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"AHp\">As we have noted, the present dispute does not involve the question of title to the church property as such, but instead concerns the bishop\u2019s authority to designate the individuals authorized to act on behalf of St. Paul\u2019s.

Similarly, since diocesan canons (to which St. Paul\u2019s acceded under its bylaws) required diocesan approval of any amendments to the articles of organization and bylaws of the parish corporation, the 1996 amendments to the articles of organization and bylaws purporting to eliminate the allegiance of St. Paul\u2019s to PECUSA and the Diocese were of no effect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b750-33\">Indeed, if the individuals installed as mission leaders by the bishop are recognized to hold the authority to act on behalf of St. Paul\u2019s, there is no actual controversy (as required to support entry of a declaratory judgment) over the Diocese\u2019s claim that St. Paul\u2019s holds its property in trust for the Diocese.

The record does not reveal when in 1979 PECUSA adopted the Canon, but appellants\u2019 counsel confirmed at oral argument that it was after the issuance (on July 2, 1979) of the opinion in <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Wolf. </em>See <em>Bishop &amp; Diocese of Colo. </em>v. Mote, 716 P.2d 85, 105 n.15 (1986) (stating that Dennis Canon was adopted in September of 1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"AzY\">The appellants attempt to avoid the effect of the Dennis Canon by pointing to an expert affidavit submitted in opposition to the Diocese\u2019s motion for summary judgment, which states that the Dennis Canon is of prospective force only. At the very least, they argue, the effect of the Dennis Canon presents a disputed question of fact, making the case unsuitable for disposition on summary judgment. We disagree. Interpretation of the effect of the Dennis Canon under the bylaws of St. Paul\u2019s is a question of law, which the court is as well equipped as the expert to determine. In any event, as found in many of the cases in other jurisdictions which have considered similar property disputes within PECUSA, it would appear that the Dennis Canon merely confirmed the preexisting relationship between PECUSA, its subordinate dioceses, and the parishes thereunder. See, e.g., <em>Bishop &amp; Diocese of Colo. </em>v. <em>Mote, supra; Rector, Wardens &amp; Vestrymen of Trinity-St. Michael\u2019s Parish, Inc. </em>v. <em>Episcopal Church in the Diocese of Conn., </em>224 Conn. 797, 821-822 (1993); <em>Bennison </em>v. <em>Sharp, </em>121 Mich. App. 705, 725 (1982); <em>Bishop &amp; Diocese of Colo. </em>v. <em>Mote, supra </em>at 105; <em>Protestant Episcopal Church in the Diocese of N.J. </em>v. <em>Graves, supra </em>at 581. Contrast <em>Protestant Episcopal Church in the Diocese of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Barker, </em>115 Cal. App. 3d 599, 625 (1981) (concluding that no trust existed in favor of PECUSA or local diocese as to parishes whose articles of incorporation did not subject property to control of national church); <em>Bjork-man </em>v. <em>Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America of the Diocese of Lexington, </em>759 S.W.2d 583, 586-587 (Ky. 1988) (finding no express trust in dispute arising prior to Dennis Canon).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b754-31\">The appellants suggest that in 1973 St. Paul\u2019s sold a parcel of land formerly used as a curate\u2019s residence, without seeking or obtaining approval of the Diocese. None of the affidavits in the record before the motion judge, however, make such an assertion based on personal knowledge; the affidavit of Deirdre DeVine merely observes that no reference to a request for such approval appears in the minutes of the parish vestry, and asserts that such a request would have been reflected in the minutes if it had been made. However, even if that property was conveyed without diocesan approval as claimed, that single instance would not call into any significant question the conclusion compelled by the weight of the other factors we have noted that the relationship among St. Paul\u2019s, the Diocese, and PECUSA was one in which the church property was held in trust for the national church, and not autonomously by the local parish.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b755-19\">Our conclusion that the lease is invalid leaves the leased premises within the property owned by St. Paul\u2019s. The question whether the ashes held within the columbarium are \u201cowned\u201d by St. Paul\u2019s is not sufficiently developed on the record and arguments in this appeal for us to express a view on that subject.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b755-20\">There is no merit to the appellants\u2019 claims that the portion of the judgment enjoining them from using the corporate names of St. Paul\u2019s is contrary to the order of the single justice that vacated an earlier, broader, injunction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
