The plaintiff\u2019s exceptions to the hearing officer\u2019s report have been briefed, and oral arguments were heard on January 22, 1998. The review panel has carefully considered the entire record, including the plaintiff\u2019s exceptions, and adopts the hearing officer\u2019s report.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The panel advises Congress that any award to the plaintiff would constitute a gratuity.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-22\">\n<em>Factual Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b783-23\">Only a summary of the facts pertinent to the instant report will be set forth herein. The detailed facts are recited in the hearing officer\u2019s report, <em>Kanehl v. United States, </em>38 Fed.Cl. 89 (1997). A comprehensive background of the circumstances leading to the instant case is incorporated in <em>Merchants National Bank v. United States (\u201cMerchants </em>/\u201d), 5 Cl.Ct. 180 (1984), and <em>Merchants National Bank v. United States (\u201cMerchants II\"), </em>7 Cl.Ct. 1 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>The plaintiff was the president and majority shareholder of Dri-Mix Products Corporation (\u201cDri-Mix\u201d). In 1976, Dri-Mix entered into contracts with the Defense Logistics Agency (\u201cDLA\u201d). The contracts called for Dri-Mix to assemble prepackaged, Government-furnished items into Meal, Combat, Individuals (\u201cMCIs\u201d). The contracts also called for the Government to supply, at set intervals, the items to be incorporated into the MCIs.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">The DLA did not deliver the items in the orderly manner that had been contemplated in the contracts. Dri-Mix could not assemble an MCI until each of 41 individual items had been received from the DLA. Some of those items were not furnished until several months after contract performance was to have begun. Dri-Mix was required to rent additional warehouse space in order to store some items while awaiting the arrival of the delinquent components.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">Because Dri-Mix could not produce any MCIs until all 41 items had been received, the company did not receive any progress payments. Consequently, Dri-Mix was required to abandon its plan of using progress payments to finance later MCI production. The company turned to its primary financier, Merchants National Bank of Mobile (\u201cMerchants\u201d or \u201cBank\u201d), for operating capital.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">The increased costs of performance exceeded the credit that Merchants was willing to extend. Dri-Mix sought a Government-guaranteed V-Loan<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to obtain additional credit through Merchants. Upon recommendation by the Federal Reserve Bank (\u201cFed\u201d), administrator of the V-Loan program, the DLA approved the loan guarantee. The Fed, acting as fiscal agent for the DLA, then entered into the V-Loan agreement with Merchants. Merchants advanced funds to Dri-Mix pursuant to the V-Loan agreement, enabling Dri-Mix to produce MCIs once the DLA had supplied the final component.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">After most of the guaranteed amount of the loan had been disbursed to Dri-Mix, the DLA revoked the loan guarantee, leaving Merchants exposed for the entire amount of the funds advanced to Dri-Mix. After reassessing the statute governing V-Loans, the DLA decided that it never had the authority to enter into V-Loans. The DLA advised Merchants that the only way to remedy the situation was to have Congress earmark money specifically for V-Loans.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-12\">The DLA assured Merchants that it would stand by the Bank, .and the agency provided the necessary language for the 1978 Defense Appropriations Act that would give the DLA the authority to enter into V-Loans. The DLA also entreated Merchants to continue financing Dri-Mix until a new loan guarantee could be authorized, citing the armed services\u2019 urgent need for MCIs. Merchants cooperated with the Government by continuing to finance Dri-Mix\u2019s production of MCIs.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-13\">In fiscal year 1978, Congress appropriated $5 million for V-Loans and Merchants applied for a new V-Loan. By that time, however, Dri-Mix had delivered enough MCIs to alleviate the worldwide shortage. The DLA reneged on its assurances that it would stand by Merchants and offered a guarantee for 55 percent of the $2 million that the Bank had already extended to Dri-Mix. Under duress, the Bank accepted the terms of the guarantee, reasoning that an inadequate guarantee was better than none at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-14\">Dri-Mix soon reached the limit of the unguaranteed funds that Merchants was willing to extend. Out of operating capital in February 1978, it filed for Chapter 11 reorganization. Merchants attempted to negotiate with the DLA in order to continue production of MCIs, but to no avail. The Dri-Mix reorganization was converted to a liquidation bankruptcy, and, in May 1978, the Government terminated the MCI contracts for default. Dri-Mix\u2019s trustee in bankruptcy filed claims in the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals to have the terminations changed to terminations for the convenience of the Government and for damages. The DLA counterclaimed for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-15\">Merchants, the Government, and DriMix\u2019s trustee in bankruptcy resolved the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>claims by entering into a settlement agreement, which was approved by the bankruptcy court on November 20, 1980. The pertinent provisions of that agreement provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-5\">1. <em>COMPROMISES WITH DLA</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-6\">A. At closing, DLA shall pay Trustee $880,000.00 and withdraw Claim No. 851 filed herein for $5,858,573.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-7\">B. The compromise settlement between DLA and the Trustee is, in part, arrived at by setoff by DLA against the Trustee for the- amounts of the damages to government furnished materials caused by leaking roofs while in storage in facilities leased by the Bankrupt from Teledyne Industries, Inc. and from Havatampa Corporation. Court approval and closing hereunder shall constitute, without further documentation, a transfer and set over by DLA of the said offset damages to the Trustee with the Trustee having the right to recover such damages from Teledyne Industries, Inc. and Havatampa Corporation. Promptly following closing, all documents and information establishing such damages in the possession and knowledge of DLA will be furnished by DLA to the Trustee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-8\">C. Court approval and closing hereunder shall constitute, without further documentation, a mutual release between the Bankrupt estate and the Trustee, on one hand, and DLA on the other hand, of all legal and equitable claims and matters of every type, kind and nature whatsoever, EXCEPT as herein provided.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-9\">D. Court approval and closing hereunder shall constitute without further documentation, a mutual release, concurrence and approval, between DLA and the Bank of all claims and matters of every type, kind and nature whatsoever, EXCEPT the Bank reserves its right to relief as provided under Title 28 U.S.C. including \u00a7\u00a7 1492 and 2509 and as set forth in Paragraph 4 herein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-10\">E.

The Bank reserves their rights against third parties (i.e. non-parties to these compromise settlements) and further reserves the Bank\u2019s right to relief as provided under Title 28 U.S.C., including \u00a7\u00a7 1492 and 2509.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b785-21\">In the settlement agreement, the Bank expressly reserved the right to seek further relief, via a congressional reference ease, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1492, 2509 (1976). The Bank did actually seek such relief, and, in <em>Merchants I, </em>the hearing officer recommended that Congress authorize payment <em>o\u00ed </em>$809,609 to Merchants in full settlement of all of the Bank\u2019s legal and equitable claims against the United States. In <em>Merchants II, </em>a panel of three judges of the United States Claims Court affirmed the recommendation of the hearing officer and recommended that the chief judge advise Congress that Merchants had an equitable, but not legal, claim against the Government for $809,609, the payment of which would <em>not </em>constitute a gratuity.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-22\">On September 21, 1993, the United States Senate passed Senate Resolution 108, which referred S. 974, entitled \u201cFor the relief of Richard Kanehl of Mobile, Alabama,\u201d to the chief judge of the United States Court of Federal Claims. The bill for relief provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGN\">For the relief of Richard Kanehl of Mobile, Alabama.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-23\">\n<em>Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-24\">Section 1. The Secretary of the Treasury shall pay, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, the sum of $6,563,000 to Richard Kanehl of Mobile, Alabama, for damages incurred by the said Richard Kanehl and the Dri-Mix Products Corporation of Mobile, Alabama, when such corporation incurred involuntary bankruptcy under chapter 7 of title 11, United States Code, resulting from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>termination of three related contracts with the Federal Government.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-4\">Sec. 2.

Violation of the provisions of this section is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine not to exceed $1,000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">S. 974, 103d Cong. (1993). On October 4, 1994, the United States Senate passed Senate Resolution 258 as a supplement to Senate Resolution 108. The supplemental resolution provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-8\"><em>Resolved, </em>That, as a supplement to S.

The chief judge shall proceed with the same in accordance with the provisions of sections 1492 and 2509 of title 28, United States Code, notwithstanding the bar of any statute of limitations, laches, res judicata, collateral estoppel, or bar of sovereign immunity, and report thereon to the Senate, at the earliest practicable date, giving such findings of fact and conclusions thereon as shall be sufficient to inform the Congress of the nature and character of the demand as a claim, legal or equitable, against the United States or a gratuity and the amount, if any, legally or equitably due to the claimants from the United States. In complying with this resolution, the Court of Federal Claims is requested to consider the records of any previous trial of the issues in this case, including the records of <em>Merchants National Bank v. United States, </em>7 Cl.Ct. 1 (1984).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b786-11\">S. Res. 258, 103d Cong., 140 Cong. Rec. \u00a7 14077 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-12\">Pursuant to the congressional reference, the plaintiff filed his Complaint in this Court and subs\u00e9quently filed a motion for partial summary judgment, requesting that the hearing officer grant the plaintiff summary judgment on the issue of liability. The defendant filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. The motions were briefed, and oral arguments were heard. The hearing officer, in a thorough and well-reasoned opinion, denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment, granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and advised that any award given to the plaintiff would constitute a gratuity. <em>Kanehl, </em>38 Fed.Cl. at 106. The plaintiff filed exceptions to the hearing officer\u2019s report, which have been fully briefed and argued.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-13\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b786-14\">I. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b786-15\">In reviewing the hearing officer\u2019s report, this review panel serves in a role analogous to that of an appellate court. <em>Bear Claw Tribe, Inc. v. United States (\u201cBear Claw II), </em>37 Fed.Cl. 633, 636 (1997). In this capacity, the panel reviews the hearing officer\u2019s findings of fact under a \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard. <em>Merchants I, </em>7 Cl.Ct. at 7. The hearing officer\u2019s legal conclusions are reviewed <em>de novo. Id. </em>at 9. Because entitlement to summary judgment is a legal conclusion, this panel reviews the hearing officer\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Costain Coal, Inc. v. United States, </em>126 F.3d 1437, 1440 (Fed.Cir.1997); <em>Bear Claw II, </em>37 Fed.Cl. at 636.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-16\">Summary judgment is appropriate if there are no material facts in dispute and if the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Rules of the United States Court of Federal Claims, Rule 56(c); Anderson. <em>v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 250,106 S.Ct. 2505, 2511, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). A motion for summary judgment \u201ccan intercede and prevent trial if the motion demonstrates that trial would be useless be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>cause additional evidence, beyond that available in connection with [the] motion, could not reasonably be expected to change the result.\u201d <em>INSLAW, Inc. v. United States (\u201cINSLAW I\u201d), </em>35 Fed.Cl. 295, 303 (1996). The mere fact that a case is before the Court upon congressional reference does not preclude a grant of summary judgment if such disposition is otherwise appropriate. <em>Bear Claw Tribe, Inc. v. United States (\u201cBear Claw I\u201d), </em>36 Fed.Cl. 181,187 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">II. <em>The Plaintiff\u2019s Exceptions to the Report of the Hearing Officer</em></p>\n<p id=\"AWJ\">The plaintiffs exceptions challenge the hearing officer\u2019s report on two fronts. First, the plaintiff contends that the hearing officer erred in granting summary judgment on the basis of the settlement agreement that was entered into by the Government, the Bank, and Dri-Mix\u2019s trustee in bankruptcy. Second, the plaintiff argues that the hearing officer erred in granting summary judgment on the basis of the defendant\u2019s defenses of laches and statute of limitations. The panel will address each of these challenges in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">A. <em>The Settlement Agreement</em></p>\n<p id=\"A4n\">The congressional reference statute directs the hearing officer to determine the facts surrounding a claimant\u2019s demand and to reach conclusions sufficient to inform Congress whether the demand constitutes a legal or equitable claim, or a gratuity. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2509(c) (1994). The hearing officer appropriately considered the facts proffered by both parties. The plaintiff directed the hearing officer to the reported decisions in <em>Merchants I </em>and <em>Merchants II </em>for his version of the facts. The plaintiff asserted that the cases represented uncontroverted facts and moved for summary judgment on the issue of liability, apparently theorizing that the two reported decisions set forth a <em>prima facie </em>case of Government liability to the plaintiffs) <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in the instant congressional reference case.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-9\">The fact that this case was even referred to this Court, however, reveals that liability is not as clear as the plaintiff asserts. Congress can act directly upon a private bill for relief; \u201c[a] bill is sent to the court under the reference statute only in those situations where there is a serious question as to the merit of the claim.\u201d <em>Paul v. United States, </em>20 Cl.Ct. 236, 265 (1990). The most beneficial function of this Court in the congressional reference process \u201cis the clarification and determination of the many tenuous and frequently complex facts that a claimant alleges to apply to equities in the claim.\u201d <em>Sneeden v. United States, </em>33 Fed.Cl. 303, 309 (1995). Indeed, in the instant case, the hearing officer discovered that the facts pertinent to the plaintiff\u2019s claim were more tenuous and complex than the plaintiff had alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-10\">Adhering to the statutory mandate to determine facts sufficient to advise Congress as to the validity of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, the hearing officer received further undisputed facts from the defendant. The hearing officer discovered what proved to be the dispositive fact in his report: the existence of a settlement agreement. The defendant appended the settlement agreement to its cross-motion for summary judgment and argued that the agreement barred the plaintiffs claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-11\">The settlement agreement served as the linchpin of the hearing officer\u2019s grant of summary judgment. The plaintiff does not dispute the fact of the agreement\u2019s existence. The plaintiff offers as his ground for error his legal conclusion that the agreement binds only the trustee in bankruptcy, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>Dri-Mix or the plaintiff, and thus the hearing officer erred in granting summary judgment on the basis of the agreement. Alternatively, the plaintiff asserts that, even if the agreement does bind him and Dri-Mix, it was inequitable for the hearing officer to grant summary judgment in favor of the Government. After careful review of the record, the panel concludes that the plaintiffs exceptions with respect to the settlement agreement are without merit and that the hearing officer properly granted' summary judgment in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">1. <em>The Settlement Agreement Binds DriMix and the Plaintiff</em></p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">The plaintiffs assertion that the trustee\u2019s actions are not binding on Dri-Mix or its shareholders fails as a matter of law. The hearing officer cited appropriate law, unrebutted in the plaintiffs exceptions, supporting his conclusions that a trustee in bankruptcy is authorized to act on behalf of the corporate debtor and that shareholders of the bankrupt entity are bound by the agreements entered into by the trustee. <em>Kanehl, </em>38 Fed.Cl. at 102-03; <em>see also Vincel v. White Motor Corp., </em>521 F.2d 1113 (2d Cir. 1975) (affirming district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment against shareholders of bankrupt corporation on the basis that the corporation\u2019s claims were settled by the trustee in bankruptcy); <em>Astron Indus. Assocs., Inc. v. Chrysler Motors Corp., </em>405 F.2d 958 (5th Cir.1968) (rejecting owner of bankrupt corporation\u2019s claim that the owner should not be bound by a settlement agreement entered into by the trustee in bankruptcy). The panel finds that the hearing officer was correct in concluding that DriMix and its shareholders, including the plaintiff, are bound by the settlement agreement entered into by Dri-Mix\u2019s trustee in bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">Interpretation of the settlement agreement is a matter of law that is amenable to disposition by summary judgment. <em>Muniz v. United States, </em>972 F.2d 1304, 1309 (Fed.Cir.1992); <em>INSLAW I, </em>35 Fed.Cl. at 303. On its face, the settlement agreement constitutes \u201ca mutual release between the Bankrupt estate [Dri-Mix] and the Trustee, on one hand, and DLA on the other hand, of all legal and equitable claims and matters of every type, kind and nature whatsoever.\u201d The plain terms of the agreement reveal that there is no claim that now may be asserted by, or on behalf of, Dri-Mix. Dri-Mix released <em>all </em>claims against the Government in 1980. The bankruptcy trustee, represented by competent counsel, executed the agreement on behalf of Dri-Mix, as he was authorized to do. The Government gave substantial consideration in return for the release of all claims by Dri-Mix; it paid the trustee in bankruptcy $880,000, withdrew its $5.8 million counterclaim against Dri-Mix, and transferred its claims against third parties to the trustee. The settlement was approved by the bankruptcy court and was not challenged by Dri-Mix, Mr. Kanehl, or any other interested party. As the settlement agreement reveals, the Government has already compensated Dri-Mix for the damages that may have been occasioned by the Government\u2019s probable breach of the MCI contracts. Consequently, Dri-Mix is not entitled to further legal or equitable relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">That the parties intended the agreement to preclude Dri-Mix from asserting any future legal and equitable claims, including claims via congressional reference procedures, is further evidenced by comparing the settlement language pertaining to Dri-Mix to that pertaining to Merchants. Section l.C. of the settlement agreement recites that the settlement constitutes \u201ca mutual release between the Bankrupt estate and the Trustee, on one hand, and DLA on the other hand, of all legal and equitable claims and matters of every type, kind and nature whatsoever.\u201d The very next sentence in the agreement, section I.D., recites that the settlement constitutes \u201ca mutual release, concurrence and approval, between DLA and the Bank of all claims and matters of every type, kind and nature whatsoever, EXCEPT the Bank reserves its right to relief as provided under Title 28 U.S.C. including \u00a7\u00a7 1492 and 2509.\u201d It is apparent from the plain terms of the agreement, and through application of the maxim <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius, </em>that the Bank negotiated to release all legal and equitable claims in the juridical sense, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>while preserving its right to assert claims via congressional reference procedures. DriMix, on the other hand, negotiated to release all claims \u201cof every type, kind and nature whatsoever,\u201d which by its terms necessarily encompasses claims of a juridical type as well as claims of a congressional reference type. To adopt the plaintiffs view that Dri-Mix did not relinquish its right to claims via congressional reference procedures would be to adopt an interpretation that renders meaningless the express reservation of the Bank\u2019s right to bring a congressional reference case. The panel rejects such an unreasonable construction. <em>See W.M. Schlosser Co. v. United States, </em>767 F.2d 870, 874 (Fed.Cir.1985) (deeming unreasonable an interpretation that would render contract language superfluous); <em>United States v. Johnson Controls, Inc., </em>713 F.2d 1541, 1555 (Fed.Cir.1983) (reciting the maxim that \u201can interpretation that gives a reasonable meaning to all parts of the contract will be preferred to one that leaves portions of the contract meaningless.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">Because Dri-Mix and the Government resolved all legal and equitable claims arising out of the alleged breach of the MCI contracts, no further claims may successfully be asserted against the Government by, or on behalf of, Dri-Mix. The plaintiff, nonetheless, has steadfastly contended that he is seeking relief on behalf of Dri-Mix for the damage done to Dri-Mix. <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Mot. for Partial Summ. J. at 31 (asserting that the Court should \u201climit the remaining proceedings in this case to determining the amount of compensation, if any, Dri-Mix should receive as a result of these Government actions\u201d); PL\u2019s Opp. to Def.\u2019s Cross Mot. for Summ. J. and Mot. to Correct Caption, and Reply to Def.\u2019s Resp. to PL\u2019s Mot. for Partial Summ. J. at 24 (asserting that \u201cthe Court must make a broad inquiry to determine whether, under the facts and circumstances of this case, it would be fair for Congress to provide compensation to Dri-Mix\u201d); PL\u2019s Exceptions to Hearing Officer\u2019s Rep. (\u201cPL\u2019s Exceptions\u201d) at 9 (contending that the panel \u201cmust address the merits of Dri-Mix\u2019s case\u201d). As explained above, these claims for damages on behalf of Dri-Mix must fail. Dri-Mix\u2019s damages have already been resolved, the settlement agreement bars any further legal or equitable claim by or on behalf of Dri-Mix, and thus any further payment made by the Government to the plaintiff on behalf of DriMix would constitute a gratuity.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">The plaintiff disavowed any claim to personal damages in oral arguments before the hearing officer. <em>Kanehl, </em>38 Fed.Cl. at 106. Before this panel, however, the plaintiff asserts that, in addition to claiming relief on behalf of Dri-Mix, he is also seeking equitable relief for the loss in value of his corporate presidency and his stock ownership in DriMix. <em>See </em>PL\u2019s Exceptions at 18-19. These damages, however, were also settled when the agreement was approved by the bankruptcy court in 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-8\">The diminution in value of the plaintiff\u2019s interests in Dri-Mix were derivative of the damages suffered by the corporate entity. By settling the legal and equitable claims of Dri-Mix with the Government, the trustee in bankruptcy necessarily settled claims of the shareholders that were derivative of the damages suffered by the corporation. <em>See Vincel, </em>521 F.2d at 1118 (reciting the general rule that recovery by a corporation restores the value of the entity\u2019s stock and affirming the district court\u2019s holding that a settlement entered into by the corporation\u2019s trustee in bankruptcy bound the shareholders, even though they received nothing by way of the settlement). Consequently, any further payment to the plaintiff based upon the diminution in value of his investment in Dri-Mix would also constitute a gratuity.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-9\">For these reasons, the panel\u2019s independent review brings it to the same conclusion that was reached by the hearing officer: the settlement agreement settled all of Dri-Mix\u2019s legal and equitable claims. All damages inflicted upon Dri-Mix, and derivatively upon its shareholders, by the Government\u2019s alleged breach of the MCI contracts have already been legally and equitably resolved. Consequently, any further payment to the plaintiff would constitute a gratuity. Because introduction of further factual evidence could not change either the fact of the settlement agreement\u2019s existence or the legal effect of the terms therein, the hearing officer properly granted the Government\u2019s motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>for summary judgment. <em>See INSLAW I, </em>35 Fed.Cl. at 303 (noting that a motion for summary judgment can properly be granted \u201cif the motion demonstrates that trial would be useless because additional evidence, beyond that available in connection with [the] motion, could not reasonably be expected to change the result.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">2. <em>It Is Not Inequitable to Hold the Plaintiff to the Settlement Agreement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">The plaintiff asserts that, even if he is bound by the settlement agreement, it would be inequitable to hold him to the terms of the agreement because the Government did not raise the defenses of accord and satisfaction, waiver, and release in its initial answer. The panel agrees with the hearing officer\u2019s conclusion that the absence of these defenses in the Government\u2019s answer did not prejudice the plaintiff and that it is not inequitable to consider the settlement agreement in evaluating the plaintiffs equitable claim. Substantial evidence in the record supports the hearing officer\u2019s factual finding that the plaintiff \u201cwas aware of the settlement negotiations prior to the settlement, and of the terms of the settlement agreement subsequent to execution.\u201d <em>Kanehl, </em>38 Fed.Cl. at 101. Moreover, the Joint Preliminary Status Report filed with the hearing officer on June 6, 1994, related that both parties to this action believed that the settlement agreement and the doctrines of accord and satisfaction, release, and payment were relevant issues. The plaintiff has long been aware that issues surrounding the settlement agreement would impact his claim for equitable relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">The hearing officer correctly cited this Court\u2019s prevailing view that the availability of equitable relief in a congressional reference case is restricted to those situations in which governmental wrongdoing causes harm to the claimant. <em>Id. </em>at 99; <em>see also Sneeden, </em>33 Fed.Cl. at 309. Because all allegations of governmental wrongdoing relating to the MCI contracts were resolved by the settlement agreement, the plaintiff could now maintain an equitable claim only if there was some governmental wrongdoing involved in procuring the settlement agreement. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 310 (plaintiff shareholders alleged that the Government coerced company into an unfair settlement by which the company released all claims against the Government). The plaintiff, however, did not contend before the hearing officer that the Government had engaged in any actionable wrongdoing in settling all legal and equitable claims arising out of the MCI contracts. <em>Kanehl, </em>38 Fed. Cl. at 102. Consequently, the hearing officer correctly concluded that the settlement agreement must be considered in evaluating the plaintiffs equitable claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">By entering into the settlement agreement in good faith, the Government paid for all damages allegedly caused by the defendant\u2019s wrongdoing with respect to the MCI contracts. It would be inequitable to compel the Government to pay again for damages that have already been settled in good faith. The Government bargained.in 1980 for the release of all legal and equitable claims of DriMix against the Government. Dri-Mix\u2019s trustee in bankruptcy, represented by competent counsel and authorized to act on behalf of Dri-Mix and its officers and shareholders, bargained to release <em>all </em>of Dri-Mix\u2019s legal <em>and </em>equitable claims in return for the Government\u2019s payment of $880,000 and the release of all of the Government\u2019s claims against Dri-Mix. Unlike Merchants, DriMix did not reserve any right to further legal or equitable relief. Therefore, Dri-Mix and its shareholders, including the plaintiff, have definitively resolved all legal and equitable claims against the Government. The panel agrees with the hearing officer\u2019s observation that, if the plaintiff has any claim at all, it is against the trustee in bankruptcy, not against the Government. <em>See id. </em>at 102-03.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-9\">Contrary to the plaintiff\u2019s contention, denial of the plaintiff\u2019s equitable claim will not result in the Government\u2019s avoidance of liability for its probable breach of its contracts with Dri-Mix. The facts developed by the hearing officer make it abundantly clear that the Government has already paid substantial compensation to settle allegations of governmental wrongdoing and to obtain a release of all further legal and equitable claims. <em>Id. </em>at 104. The panel agrees with the hearing officer\u2019s rejection of the plaintiff\u2019s equitable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>claim and finds that any and all equitable interests of the plaintiff were fully satisfied 18 years ago. Payment of anything further would constitute a gratuity.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">B. <em>Statute of Limitations and Laches</em></p>\n<p id=\"A_V\">The plaintiffs exceptions raise two related challenges with respect to the hearing officer\u2019s consideration of the affirmative defenses of statute of limitations and laches. First, the plaintiff contends that the hearing officer disregarded his obligation, under the congressional reference statute and the Senate resolutions relating to this case, to advise Congress whether or not the plaintiff would be entitled to recovery in the absence of the defenses of laches and statute of limitations. Second, the plaintiff asserts that the hearing officer erroneously granted summary judgment on the grounds of laches and statute of limitations. The panel finds both arguments to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">1. <em>Statutory and Congressional Directives</em></p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">The congressional reference statute clearly spells out the hearing officer\u2019s responsibilities in a congressional reference case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-8\">The hearing officer to whom a congressional reference case is assigned by the chief judge shall proceed in accordance with the applicable rules to determine the facts, <em>including facts relating to delay or laches, facts bearing upon the question whether the bar of any statute of limitar tion should be removed, </em>or facts claimed to excuse the claimant for not having resorted to any established legal remedy. He shall append to his findings of fact conclusions sufficient to inform Congress whether the demand is a legal or equitable claim or a gratuity, and the amount, if any, legally or equitable [sic] due from the United States to the claimant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b791-9\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2509(c) (emphasis added). The hearing officer diligently adhered to this statutory mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-10\">The hearing officer properly assessed the facts relating to the statute of limitations and, in accordance with the congressional reference statute, advised that \u201c[a]ny possible legal claim by the plaintiff would have accrued, at the latest, in late 1980,\u201d and that the \u201c[p]laintiff, therefore, would be barred at law from bringing a claim against the government.\u201d <em>Kanehl, </em>38 Fed.Cl. at 104 (citing the six-year statute of limitations established by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2501). The panel adopts the hearing officer\u2019s pointed findings and conclusion with respect to the statute of limitations, except to the extent that his discussion may be construed to mean that the statute of limitations would bar the plaintiff\u2019s equitable claim. <em>See INSLAW v. United States (\u201cIN-SLAW II\"), </em>39 Fed.Cl. 307, 327-29 (1997) (concluding that the statute of limitations bars legal claims, but does not bar consideration of equitable claims). The panel agrees that the statute of limitations would bar any legal claim asserted by the plaintiff against the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-12\">The plaintiff maintains, however, that he is only asserting an equitable claim in this case. Although the statute of limitations does not apply to equitable claims, the doctrine of laches does apply. <em>See id. </em>Pursuant to the statutory requirement, the hearing officer assessed the facts relating to laches and advised that the plaintiffs equitable claims should be barred by that doctrine. <em>Kanehl, </em>38 Fed.Cl. at 105-06. The panel fully agrees with and adopts the hearing officer\u2019s findings and conclusion in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-13\">The settlement agreement bars any equitable claims brought by, or on behalf of, Dri-Mix. Neither Dri-Mix nor the plaintiff objected to the settlement agreement when it was executed in 1980. The panel agrees with the hearing officer\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[n]ot having taken the opportunity [to vacate the settlement agreement] in sixteen years, it would be inequitable to require the government to defend against a claim founded upon facts occurring in the late 1970\u2019s.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 106. Laches would thus apply to bar the plaintiffs equitable claim on behalf of Dri-Mix, as the inexcusable 16-year delay in challenging the settlement agreement would significantly prejudice the defendant. <em>See id. </em>at 105-06.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-14\">Laches would also bar the plaintiffs equitable claim for the diminution in value of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>investment in Dri-Mix. While the plaintiff intimates that he has continuously sought relief for Dri-Mix over the past 18 years (relief that is nonetheless barred by the terms of the settlement agreement), he has not even alleged that he attempted to seek relief on his own behalf during that time. For 16 years after the settlement agreement was approved by the bankruptcy court, he neither objected to the settlement agreement\u2019s alleged impact on his interests in DriMix nor otherwise challenged the actions of Dri-Mix\u2019s trustee in bankruptcy, who owed a fiduciary duty to the plaintiff and to the other shareholders. <em>See Commodity Futures Trading Comm\u2019n v. Weintraub, </em>471 U.S. 343, 355, 105 S.Ct. 1986, 1994, 85 L.Ed.2d 372 (1985); <em>Kanehl, </em>38 Fed.Cl. at 103. The plaintiffs inexcusably delayed equitable claim for loss of the value of his stake in Dri-Mix would thus also be barred by laches.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">In addition to the congressional reference statute, the hearing officer was required to adhere to the Senate resolutions which referred the plaintiffs claim to this Court. Particularly important is the language of Senate Resolution 258, which, in pertinent part, requests that this Court evaluate the plaintiffs claim \u201cnotwithstanding the bar of any statute of limitations [or] laches.\u201d Despite the plaintiffs protestations that the hearing officer violated this instruction, the panel concludes that the hearing officer fully complied with the Senate resolution at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">In compliance with the congressional reference statute, the hearing officer made findings regarding the statute of limitations and laches. He advised that, were those bars allowed to operate, they would preclude the plaintiffs legal and equitable claims. In compliance with the Senate resolution, the hearing officer also examined the undisputed facts and considered the plaintiffs claim \u201cnotwithstanding the bar of any statute of limitation [or] laches.\u201d Apart from the bars of statute of limitations and laches, the hearing officer correctly concluded that the plaintiffs claims were nonetheless precluded by the settlement agreement and the merit-based defenses of accord and satisfaction, waiver, and release. <em>See supra </em>Part II.A. Accordingly, the panel rejects the plaintiffs argument that the hearing officer failed to fulfill his duties under the congressional reference statute or the applicable Senate resolutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">2. <em>Summary Judgment Was Not Based on Statute of Limitations or Laches</em></p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">The plaintiffs final exception asserts that the hearing officer improperly based his grant of summary judgment on the grounds of laches and the statute of limitations. As discussed above and in the hearing officer\u2019s report, summary judgment was granted on the basis of the undisputed facts surrounding the existence of the settlement agreement, not on laches or the statute of limitations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Consequently, the panel finds that this exception also lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b792-10\">The plaintiffs exceptions to the hearing officer\u2019s report are without merit. The hearing officer properly determined facts regarding statute of limitations and laches, as he was required to do by statute. In addition, the hearing officer complied with the applicable Senate resolutions, which instructed him to determine whether or not the plaintiff had a valid legal or equitable claim notwithstanding the bars of statute of limitations and laches. Apart from the findings relating to statute of limitations and laches, the hearing officer nonetheless determined from the undisputed facts presented by both parties that the plaintiff has no legal or equitable claim, based on the existence of the settlement agreement and the merit-based doctrines of accord and satisfaction, waiver, and release. As there were no disputed issues of material fact regarding the existence of the settlement agreement, and as the hearing officer gave the correct legal import to the terms of the agreement, the hearing officer properly granted summary judgment. The undisputed facts provided by the parties gave the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>hearing officer sufficient information upon which to make an informed report to ConS1\u2019688'</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">Accordingly, after its <em>de novo </em>review of the hearing officer\u2019s grant of summary judgment, the panel affirms the hearing officer\u2019s grant of summary judgment, adopts the report of the hearing officer, and advises Congress that the plaintiff has neither a legal nor an equitable claim against the United States. The panel unanimously holds that any award made to the plaintiff would be a gratuity.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b783-13\">. The panel makes one modification to the hearing officer\u2019s conclusions with respect to the statute of limitations. <em>See infra </em>Part H.B. 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b784-8\">. The term \u201cV-Loan\u201d derived from Regulation V of the Armed Services Procurement Regulations, which described the program under which the Government would guarantee loans for working capital. <em>See Merchants I, </em>5 Cl.Ct. at 187.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b787-7\">. The identity of the plaintiffs) has been confusing. The Senate report referring this case to the Court speaks only of Richard Kanehl. The Complaint filed by the plaintiffs) in this case, however, lists Richard Kanehl as the complainant filing on behalf of the \"Dri-Mix Group (Rev. David Barney, A.D. Barrett, Dr. Richard Barrett, William M. Lyon, and Richard V. Williams).\u201d The hearing officer correcdy noted that the Senate Resolutions relating to this case do not \"contemplate payment to Richard Kanehl on behalf of anyone other than Richard Kanehl,\u201d <em>Kanehl, </em>38 Fed.Cl. at 96, and thus only Richard Kanehl would be considered a plaintiff in this case. The exceptions filed before this panel list only Richard Kanehl as plaintiff; however, counsel of record still signs his name as Attorney for the Plaintiffs. The panel makes note of this to advise Congress that it is unclear, in the event Congress authorizes payment of a gratuity in this case, exactly who the actual beneficiaries might be.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b792-11\">. In this regard, it is noted that the hearing officer reported that the statute of limitations <em>would </em>bar the plaintiff's legal claims, had any been asserted, and that laches <em>should </em>bar the plaintiff\u2019s equitable claims. <em>See Kanehl, </em>38 Fed. Cl. at 104-05.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
