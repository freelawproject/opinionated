We need not consider to what extent there has been compliance for, in the nature of the matter, enforcement of the Board\u2019s order will be effective only to the extent that compliance has not been completed. We perceive in this no reason for modifying the proposed decree, which is in the usual form, especially as the Examiner\u2019s recommended order, which was adopted by the Board,, was not excepted to by Threads, Incorporated.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-21\">Enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
