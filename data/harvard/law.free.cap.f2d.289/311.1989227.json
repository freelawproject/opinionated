There was a jury trial, at which the case was submitted to the jury upon interrogatories. These were answered by the jury favorably to the contention of the plaintiffappellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-19\">The jury found that the appellee, Baird, had completed and performed the duties incumbent upon him as required by the contract. As a result of the jury\u2019s findings, the United States District Court entered judgment in favor of the appellee for the total sum of $14,192.60, constituting $10,000 due for services rendered pursuant to the contract and the balance of the judgment being for interest and expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-20\">The court dismissed a counter-claim of the defendant Marlowe against plaintiff Baird.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-21\">Upon review of the record, we find the answers of the jury to the interrogatories to be supported by substantial evidence; and that the trial judge, Honorable H. Church Ford, properly applied the pertinent law and committed no prejudicial error in the trial of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-22\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
