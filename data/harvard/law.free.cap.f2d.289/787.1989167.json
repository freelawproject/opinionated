A similar suit filed by plaintiff in 1956 was dismissed by the District Court for failure to substitute indispensable parties and was appealed unsuccessfully to this court. Hicks v. Summerfield, 1958, 104 U.S.App.D.C. 286, 261 F.2d 752. That action did not terminate until the Supreme Court denied certiorari. 1959, 359 U.S. 959, 79 S.Ct. 798, 3 L.Ed.2d 766. Thereafter, the present action naming the proper parties was filed in the District Court, plaintiff contending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>there, as here, that his dismissal was unlawful because he was not afforded the procedural safeguards of the Lloyd-La Follette Act, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 652. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court granted the motion of defendants [appellees] and denied that of plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">Plaintiff has spent a number of years in Government service. He first acquired civil service competitive status in the War Department in 1938, from which position he resigned in 1943. He again acquired competitive status as a patent examiner in 1947 and served in that capacity until he transferred to the Veterans Administration in 1952. In 1954 he resigned from the last named position. Later in that year, he was given an indefinite appointment with the Post Office, in lieu of reinstatement. The notice of appointment contained the following statements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-5\">\u201cIndefinite Appointment</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5e\">(in lieu of reinstatement)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-6\">\u201cThis action * * * may be subject to investigation. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-8\">\u201cProbationary period completed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b836-9\">In 1955, plaintiff\u2019s indefinite appointment was converted to a career appointment by virtue of Executive Order No. 10577, 19 Fed.Reg. 7521 (1955), 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 631 note, which reads in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-10\">\u201cPart I \u2014 Civil Service Rules. Sec. 5.2 Authority of the Commission to make investigations</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-11\">\u201cThe Commission may make appropriate investigations to secure enforcement of the Civil Service Act, Rules, and Regulations, including investigation of the qualifications and suitability of applicants for positions in the competitive service. <em>It may require appointments to be made subject to investigation to enable the Commission to determine, after appointment, that the requirements </em>* -x- * i!ave been met * * *.\u201d [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-12\">\u201cPart II \u2014 Special Provisions For Transition From Indefinite Appointment System To Career-Conditional Appointment System</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-14\">\u201cSec.' 201(a) <em>Under such conditions as the Civil Service Commission may prescribe, </em>all employees serving under indefinite appointments * * * shall * * * have their appointments converted to career-conditional appointments if they have had less than three years of creditable service * * *. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-15\">\u201c(b) <em>The Commission may prescribe the conditions under which employees who are serving under indefinite appointments </em>* * * <em>may be examined </em>* * *. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-16\">\u201c(c) AH employees * * * who * * * are serving under indefinite appointments * * * based upon prior service with a competitive status shall * * * have their appointments converted * * * to career appointments if they have had three or more years of [creditable] service * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b836-18\">The notice of conversion to career appointment read in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-19\">\u201cThis action is subject to all applicable laws, rules, and regulations and may be subject to investigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGP\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9o\">\u201cSubstantially continuous creditable service from 7-21-47 to 5-9-54.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Als\">Later in 1955, plaintiff received notification of suspension for an indefinite period and appealed to the Board of Appeals &amp; Review of the Civil Service Commission. He was subsequently advised by letter that his intra-agency appeal from suspension had been determined adversely to him \u201c[b]ecause of the nature of the offenses leading up to the issuance of charges against you by the Veterans Administration and evidence of difficulties in previous Government employments. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b836-20\">The Government urges three grounds \u00f3n which it is contended the judgment of the District Court should be affirmed: (1) that the action is mooted by plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>tiff's physical disability (for which he is receiving a pension), which prevents his reinstatement;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>. (2) that plaintiff is barred by laches; and (3) that, in any event, plaintiff is not within the coverage of the Lloyd-La Follette Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">Since we agree with the Government on the merits of this case, we pass over the first two grounds urged.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">In urging the third ground, the Government contends that plaintiff\u2019s indefinite appointment was subject to an eighteen-month period of investigation, as prescribed by Civil Service Regulations, 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.112, and that the subsequent conversion from \u201cindefinite\u201d to \u201ccareer\u201d status did not remove this condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">Plaintiff contends that the Civil Service Commission was without power to retain this period of investigation after \u25a0conversion. He points to the language \u25a0of the executive order and notes that \u00a7 201(e), under which the conversion was made, makes no provision for Commission regulations and conditions, while \u00a7 201, subsections (a) and (b) expressly authorize the Commission to make such conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-8\">We think plaintiff\u2019s contentions must fail, not only by virtue of the language of the executive order itself but also by virtue of the very nature of career and career-conditional appointments. Executive Order No. 10577, \u00a7 5.2 quoted supra, expressly empowers the Commission to make appointments subject to investigation. We agree with plaintiff that the silence of \u00a7 201(c) of the order supports an inference that the President did not intend the Commission to make conditions thereunder; however, we think that an examination of the nature of the two types of appointment (career and career-conditional) and of the conditions pertinent thereto made by the Commission clearly shows that the \u201cconditions\u201d expressly referred to in \u00a7 201, subsections (a) and (b) are something other than the \u201cinvestigation\u201d authorized by \u00a7 5.2.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-10\">\u201cCareer-conditional appointment. * * * (2) Upon completion by the appointee of three years of creditable service, his career-conditional appointment shall be automatically converted to a career appointment. * * * (3) An eligible given a career-conditional appointment shall be required to serve a probationary period of one year. * * * \u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.301(a) (Supp.1960).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-15\">\u201cAppointments are made subject to investigation to continue the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction to investigate the qualifications and suitability of an applicant after appointment. * * * <em>The condition \u2018subject to investigation\u2019 shall not be construed as requiring any employee to serve a new probationary or trial period or as extending the probationary or trial period of any employee.\u201d 5 C. </em>F.R. \u00a7 2.107(d) (Supp.1960). [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-17\">We note that plaintiff\u2019s notice of indefinite appointment in lieu of reinstatement contained the notation \u201cprobationary period completed.\u201d We think the \u201cconditions\u201d referred to in the executive order refer to this probationary period of the career-conditional appointment during which the Commission determines the appointee\u2019s competence and bear no relation to the investigation which looks to the character of the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-18\">It is to be further noted that, ante-dating the executive order, the Commission had adopted certain regulations which expressly stated that all appointments were subject to investigation, stating the purpose to be retention of Commission jurisdiction to investigate after appointment rather than to require prospective ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>pointees to await completion of the investigation before commencing Government employment. Since these regulations were in effect when Executive Order No. 10577 was handed down, and since that order expressly reaffirms, in \u00a7 5.2, the Commission\u2019s power to make appointments subject to investigation, we must conclude that the Commission acted properly in plaintiff\u2019s case. Therefore, since plaintiff\u2019s appointment was expressly made subject to an eighteen-month period for investigation, and since the suspension as a result of investigation was made within that eighteen-month period, plaintiff was not entitled to a hearing under the Lloyd-La Follette Act. See Civil Service Regulations, 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.112 and \u00a7 5.2 (1949); see also Civil Service Regulations, 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.107(a) (Supp. 1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">The judgment of the District Court is</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b837-19\"><em>. </em>Any money judgment for back pay must be rendered by the Court of Claims. \u25a0 In any event, the only money judgment to \u25a0which plaintiff makes claim is predicated on the interval of the 68 days which elapsed between his suspension and the award of the disability annuity, and 539 hours of sick leave. Remuneration for the sick leave would have been at full rate; the disability annuity, at a lower rate, would have commenced to run only when the sick leave was exhausted.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
