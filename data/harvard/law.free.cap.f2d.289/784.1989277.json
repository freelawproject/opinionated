These are the salient facts. The employer furnished Richard A. Williams, its employee herein, with a motor truck for full-time use in servicing and repairing household appliances in the homes of employer\u2019s customers and in transporting himself between his home and the employer\u2019s place of business. The employee\u2019s regular hours were from 8:15 a. m. until 5:05 p. m., but on occasions he was required to work overtime.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On March 10, 1959, after performing work orders in Virginia in a workmanlike manner, Williams left the home of the last customer \u201csometime after 6:00 p. m.\u201d According to the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s compensation order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-17\">\u201c* * * a few minutes after 11:00 p. m., the employer\u2019s truck, being operated by the employee, was observed proceeding in the general direction of his home at a point in the State of Virginia between the area wherein the employee performed services for the employer, as found above, and his said home; that at such time the employee was operating the said truck in an orderly manner and at a reasonable speed; that, thereafter, the employee continued to operate the said truck in an orderly manner and at a reasonable speed in the direction as found above for a distance of approximately two and one-half miles when, at a few minutes before 11:30 p. m. on the said day, the said truck crashed through the railing of a bridge over a ravine to the right of the direction in which it was proceeding, swerved to the left and ran through the opposite railing of the bridge and fell with the employee, as a consequence of which he sustained personal injury resulting in death on the same day* * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-19\">\u201cThat following the employee\u2019s death an examination of his blood by a physician showed it to contain alcohol, but that his injury and death were not occasioned solely by intoxication; that the employee was operating the employer\u2019s truck <em>on a direct route between the area in which he performed work duties for the employer and his home, </em>in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>manner required of him by the employment, when he sustained the fatal injury; that the employee was not engaged in a frolic of his own at such time. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9y\">\u201cThat the death of the employee arose out of and in the course of the employment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">Appellants attack the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s findings that Williams\u2019 death (1) arose out of and in the course of employment, and (2) was not occasioned solely by intoxication.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">Workmen Compensation laws are construed liberally in favor of injured employees and their dependents. Voris v. Eikel, 1953, 346 U.S. 328, 74 S.Ct. 88, 98 L.Ed. 5; Pillsbury v. United Engineering Co., 1952, 342 U.S. 197, 72 S.Ct. 223, 96 L.Ed. 225; Baltimore &amp; Philadelphia Steamboat Co. v. Norton, 1932, 284 U.S. 408, 52 S.Ct. 187, 76 L.Ed. 366; Associated General Contractors of America v. Cardillo, 1939, 70 App.D.C. 303, 106 F.2d 327. This court also has held that doubts should be resolved in favor of the employee or his dependent family. Travelers Insurance Co. v. Donovan, 1955, 95 U.S.App.D.C. 331, 221 F.2d 886; Robinson v. Bradshaw, 1953, 92 U.S.App.D.C. 216, 206 F.2d 435, certiorari denied 1953, 346 U.S. 899, 74 S. Ct. 226, 98 L.Ed. 400. \u201cIf supported by evidence and not inconsistent with the law, the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s inference that an injury did or did not arise out of and in the course of employment is conclusive. No reviewing court can then set aside that inference because the opposite one is thought to be more reasonable; nor can the opposite inference be substituted by the court because of a belief that the one chosen by the Deputy Commissioner is factually questionable.\u201d Cardillo v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., 1947, 330 U.S. 469, 477-478, 67 S.Ct. 801, 806, 91 L.Ed. 1028; O\u2019Leary v. Brown-Pacific-Maxon, Inc., 1951, 340 U. S. 504, 71 S.Ct. 470, 95 L.Ed. 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-9\">In light of our sharply limited review function, the present record affords no basis for disturbing the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s determination that Williams\u2019 death \u201carose out of and in the course of the employment.\u201d The Deputy Commissioner\u2019s finding that Williams\u2019 \u201cinjury and death were not occasioned <em>solely </em>by intoxication\u201d (emphasis supplied) must also stand.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The evidence supports the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s finding that a complexity of factors entered into the cause of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b833-15\">.
