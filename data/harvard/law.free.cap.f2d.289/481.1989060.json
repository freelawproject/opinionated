It does not reach back and relieve the carrier from liability for hauling a defective ear from the time the defect occurs to the time the defect is discovered. See Southern Pacific Company v. United States, 8 Cir., 1927, 23 F.2d 61; St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co. of Texas v. United States, 5 Cir., 1928, 29 F.2d 568; Alabama Great Southern R. R. Co. v. United States, 5 Cir., 1956, 233 F.2d 520.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-18\">Furthermore, the allegations in appellee\u2019s second answer to paragraph II of appellant\u2019s complaint are insufficient to bring the case within the exception contained in Section 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-19\">Accordingly, our opinion is modified by striking therefrom our direction to the district court to grant a new trial. The district court is directed to cause a judgment to be entered in favor of the appellant, and against the appellee, in the amount of $250.00. In view of our modification of the original opinion as herein set forth, appellant\u2019s petition for rehearing is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
