Appellant contends that, although required, the Commission failed to make a detailed comparison of the applicants\u2019 specific program proposals. The Commission concedes that it made no such comparison, but it urges that none is necessary here. The Commission asserts that its function with respect to program proposals is to ascertain whether the applicants\u2019 over-all program balance and structure meet the needs of the service area and whether the applicants have made an effort to determine these needs, and that it is required to make a detailed comparison of individual programs only in cases where significant differences in entire fields of programming are made to appear.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We cannot say that this view of the Commission\u2019s role is unreasonable or otherwise precluded by the Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b804-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>Here the Commission found, upon substantial evidence, that no significant differences existed between the applicants\u2019 program proposals. Hence we agree that further detailed comparison of program content was unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">Appellant\u2019s other contentions also provide no basis for disturbing the Commission\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b803-14\">. Of course, if it should appear to the Commission that the program proposals of no applicant meet the needs of the service area and that, consequently, the award of a license would not be in the public interest, the Commission may not grant a license to any of the applicants.
