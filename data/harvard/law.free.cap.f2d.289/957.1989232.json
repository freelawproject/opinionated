Use since June 4, 1957, is alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-26\">Opposition is based on appellant\u2019s prior use and registration of \u201cServo\u201d as a trademark for electrical connectors<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and \u201cServo\u201d in conjunction with a design for control actuating servomechanisms;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for control equipment, measuring instruments and testing devices; <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and for engineering and consulting services related to electronics and servomechanisms, <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> all preceding three registrations being registered under Section 2(f) of the Lanham <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>Act. Appellant has also incorporated \u201cServo\u201d as a prefix in an alleged family of trademarks including \u201cServoseope,\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cServosync,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cServoflight,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Servo-therm,\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and \u201cServoflex,\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> for various apparatus, machines and supplies, including servomotor operated or assisted mechanisms. There is no question that both parties apply their marks to similar goods, classifiable as servomechanisms, or equipment closely related thereto, and that appellant is the first user. The sole issue is whether the marks so resemble one another that their concurrent use would be likely to confuse purchasers within the meaning of Section 2(d) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1052 (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">It is appellant\u2019s contention that, because it is the exclusive owner of all registered trademarks containing the term \u201cServo,\u201d and because of its long use of that term in identifying its goods and services, it has a vested proprietary interest in \u201cServo\u201d and has established a legal family of trademarks using \u201cServo\u201d as a prefix therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">The board found that appellant had established no proprietary interest in \u201cServo,\u201d and that concurrent use of the mark by the parties would not be likely to cause confusion of purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-6\">The issues here closely parallel those in a companion appeal, Servo Corp. of America v. Servo-Tek Products Co., Cust. &amp; Pat.App., 289 F.2d 955, involving appellant\u2019s opposition to registration of \u201cServospeed\u201d for use on servomechanisms. There we held that appellant did not have an exclusive proprietary interest in \u201cServo\u201d as applied to servomechanisms ; that it had not created a legal family of marks; and that confusion of purchasers was not likely. For the reasons given there we reach the same conclusion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-7\">The decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1005-27\">. Reg.
