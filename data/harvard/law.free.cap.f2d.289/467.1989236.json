The latter paid $8500 on account. Tracy sued for the balance. At the trial the balance was admitted due but Goldberg counterclaimed for (1) money allegedly advanced Tracy totaling $2,694.41 (2) for alleged services in connection with difficulties arising out of a building enterprise, for these Goldberg claimed $50,000. (3) for alleged services regarding purchase of Tracy\u2019s interest in the building corporation. Goldberg asked $100,000 on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-29\">The jury found in favor of the plaintiff on his complaint and for him against Goldberg on the counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>The first proposition argued is that the trial judge overstated the quality of proof appellant needed in order to establish his counterclaim. Appellant was allowed exceptions to the points on behalf of the plaintiff read by the court to the jury. Appellant states that one of these covered the now objected to language. The joint appendix contains 573 pages. Why appellant did not print the point to which he refers and on which he must rely is not readily apparent. His only other stated basis of objection in this connection is the language of his attorney when he said, \u201cI also take an exception about your instruction to the jury about the burden of proof, where it is equally balanced, sir.\u201d The present contention has nothing to do with that particular <em>segment o\u00ed </em>the charge. However, to eliminate any kind of doubt as to whether the question should have been considered by us we have examined it at length.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">We find that the judge presented this phase of the case to the jury accurately and fully. He .started off by saying, \u201cIn a civil case, such as this, the party who has the burden of proof must produce evidence of greater persuasive power than the other party on the factual issues on which he has the burden.\u201d Speaking of the questions submitted to the jury within this rule he said: \u201cThe party who has the affirmative of the issue has the burden of proof on each of these questions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">He then in a common sense statement said to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-6\">\u201cNow, this burden of proof is often expressed by saying, the party having this burden of proof must establish these facts by the weight or the fair preponderance of the evidence. The law expects you to go through the process of sorting out in your minds, according to persuasive power, the evidence on each issue, and you put the evidence for the plaintiff on one side and the evidence for the defendant on the other. If the evidence for the plaintiff has a greater persuasive power, then you decide for him and you don\u2019t have to bother about the burden of proof. If the evidence for the defendant has the greater persuasive power, you decide for him, and you don\u2019t have to bother about the burden of proof. The only time you have to bother about the burden of proof is when there is .such doubt in your mind that you don\u2019t know how to decide. When the evidence seems equally balanced in your mind, and we describe it as, your mind is in equilibrium, then if that is so you must decide against the party having the burden of proof or give the \u2018No\u2019 answer to the question. It is like the scale in the grocery store, you go in and you buy three or four pounds of apples and the grocery man puts a four-pound weight on one side, and he tries to get the four pounds of apples to exactly balance, and it is only when they exactly balance like that, that this becomes important. You know how hard it is to get the exact balance. If there is just a little more evidence of a little more persuasive power in your mind, then you decide according to that persuasive power and you don\u2019t bother about this burden of proof. It is only when your mind is in equilibrium you decide against the party having the burden of proof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">Following that he told the jury the plaintiff had the burden on the complaint and regarding the counterclaim, \u201cOn these other questions, they are all on the counterclaim. The defendant has the burden of proof on those, and if you decide that he has not sustained that burden you give the \u2018No\u2019 answer, or you give the smaller amount of damages, if you decide to answer Questions 5 and 7.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-11\">Still dealing with counsel\u2019s points for charge the judge commented, \u201cWhile the burden rests upon the party who asserts the affirmative by a preponderance of the evidence, this rule does not require a demonstration or such degree of proof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>that allows absolute certainty, since in human affairs absolute certainty is seldom possible. In this case, defendant Goldberg carries the burden of proving the allegations of his counterclaim by a clear preponderance of the credible evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">It is noted that in the last above quoted sentence the court said, \u201c * * * a clear preponderance of the credible evidence.\u201d This inadvertence, resulting apparently from the word \u201cclear\u201d appearing in one of the requests, was so inconsequential after the elaborate instruction which had just preceded it that neither counsel noticed it. As it happened, immediately after the burden of proof points had been disposed of, the court called both attorneys to side bar for the purpose of noting their objections to the charge. The attorney for the defendant went first, objected to three items and as to his fourth and last .said, as has been mentioned, \u201cI also take an exception about your instruction to the jury about the burden of proof, where it is equally balanced, sir.\u201d There was simply no objection to the use of the word \u201cclear\u201d or even mention of it made to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">We are satisfied that on the whole charge the mistake was de mini-mus; the jury was not left with the impression that there was a higher grade of proof needed for the counterclaim than for the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">Appellant\u2019s next point is that, \u201cThe Court erred in instructing the jury that Earnest and Fine were not interested witnesses and had no reason not to tell the whole truth.\u201d Here admittedly no objection was made on behalf of the defendant. Despite this, in view of appellant\u2019s protestations, we have scrutinized the charge to see if there was prejudicial error in this instance. There is nothing called to our attention or revealed by the transcript to indicate that the .statement that these people were not interested was inaccurate. Irrespective of that, the charge turned over the credibility of the testimony squarely to the jury. Said the judge, \u201cIt is also your function to evaluate the testimony * * And as to witnesses, \u201c * * * whether you think they testified with frankness and candor, or otherwise, * * *. * * * But you must consider all those things in determining what you believe were the facts. What is the truth; what really happened here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-11\">Finally after the judge had referred to the disinterest of Earnest and Fine he specifically instructed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-12\"><em>\u201cIt is the quality of the testimony which is important and this must be determined by each juror for himself and herself upon the tendency of the evidence to persuade you or not to persuade you.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied) .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-13\">Not only from the above but on the whole record in this trial of sharply defined issues and proof, we conclude that the district court\u2019s above characterization resulted in no substantial prejudice to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-14\">Appellant\u2019s third point is that the trial court erred in admitting into evidence a letter dated May 2,1949. The exhibit, a letter from plaintiff to defendant, receipt of which was never denied, was objected to as a self-serving declaration. It was properly allowed by the judge because as he stated to counsel, \u201cYou see, there is still in issue the question of when the debt was to be repaid and this letter, it seems to me, has relevance on that question. You admit now the obligation.\u201d As to it being a self-serving declaration, the court said: \u201cThat is for the jury to consider, but it does show a demand for payment, at least as of this date in May of 1949.\u201d It is now argued that the claim of plaintiff in the letter to be in a \u201cstrapped\u201d financial condition was brought before the jury to arouse sympathy for him and prejudice the defendant. This argument loses whatever little force it may have possessed when an examination of Goldberg\u2019s testimony develops that he on at least two separate occasions related how during that period plaintiff had told him \u201c * * * that he had nothing * * * <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>he was being terribly mistreated * * * he had no income and he is broke\u201d; \u201c * * * he was just in very, very bad and horrible shape and he was wearing ragged clothes, he had nothing, he had nothing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">The only other point needing special notice was the acceptance into evidence of an office memorandum of Mr. Earnest, the Washington attorney who represented one Stevens with whom plaintiff was in litigation in 1948. It was for alleged services in connection with the Stevens affair that Goldberg sued Tracy on counts 2 and 3 of his counterclaim. Part of Tracy\u2019s defense to those claims was that Goldberg had nothing to do with the Stevens matter after August 5, 1948. Goldberg admitted in his testimony that he had not rendered any services once the Tracy-Stevens controversy had been turned over to the lawyers to draw up an agreement between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Earnest testified that on August 5, 1948, he conferred with Katz, the representative of his client Stevens, as to drafting a settlement agreement between him and Tracy. The next day he prepared a memorandum of that conference. After that he talked with Tracy\u2019s representative. He testified that as a result of that conversation and his memorandum of August 6, 1948, he prepared a formal written agreement for execution by the parties. That agreement was executed August 13, 1948.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">The objection to the admission into evidence of the memorandum was that it was used to refresh the recollection of the witness. On behalf of plaintiff it was urged as competent \u201c * * * to establish the time that the people got down to Washington and gave the instructions to counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">It seems to us that the exhibit was correctly accepted as a business record made by Mr. Earnest in the regular course of his practice and serving not only as his record of his conference with Katz for his client but as his base for the agreement which he drew.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b518-12\">The most that is urged against the memorandum going into evidence is that no need for it was shown. That was a matter of judgment for plaintiff\u2019s attorney. The record does support appellee\u2019s contention that the contents of the memorandum simply outlined the general terms of the contemplated settlement which was not contrary to defendant\u2019s general account of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-13\">The remaining contentions of appellant have all been examined. They are without merit. This was an angry, hard fought trial which the district judge made sure was conducted with fairness to both sides. There is no error here in any way warranting reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-14\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b518-8\">. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1732; Lind v.
