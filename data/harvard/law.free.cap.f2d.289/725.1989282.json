From a denial of the motion, defendant appeals. The burden of defendant\u2019s argument is that a government witness testified falsely that no promises had been made by the government in return for his testimony; that such perjurious testimony, elicited by the prosecutor, was known by him to be false, and that despite such knowledge the prosecutor permitted it to stand uncorrected.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-22\">The trial judge who had heard the case without a jury, although entertaining doubts as to the sufficiency of the Section 2255 petition, \u201cin view of the serious nature of the charges\u201d and \u201cin the interest of the administration of justice and the full protection of petitioner\u2019s rights\u201d granted a hearing at which all persons who might shed light on the factual issues testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-23\">The court concluded that the witness \u201cdid not give false or perjurious testimony upon the trial\u201d and that \u201cthere is no substance to the serious accusation made against the trial assistant that he knowingly permitted false testimony to be given and to go by unchallenged.\u201d The court\u2019s finding that there was \u201cnot a scintilla of evidence\u201d in support of such a charge is completely justified by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-24\">The order denying the motion is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
