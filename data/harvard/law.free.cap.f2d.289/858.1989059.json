A. \u00a7 51 et seq. can be brought in federal court where the amount involved is less than $10,000. The plaintiff in this case sought damages for a sprained ankle and reduced earnings during the time he was recovering. In a non jury trial he recovered a judgment for $500. At the defendant\u2019s request the trial judge made a finding that the amount in controversy was at all times less than $10,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-16\">The defendant makes two points. The first has to do with Section 6 of the FELA which provides that: \u201can action may be brought in a district court of the United States, in the district of the residence of the defendant, or in which the cause of action arose, or in which the defendant shall be doing business at the time of commencing such action. * * * \u201d 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-17\">The railroad contends that this is a venue provision and does not have anything to do with jurisdiction. It was called a venue provision by the Supreme Court in Baltimore &amp; O. R. Co. v. Kepner, 1941, 314 U.S. 44, 62 S.Ct. 6, 86 L.Ed. 28. The legislative history furnished us by the appellant\u2019s careful research and discussed in the case just cited shows pretty clearly that what Congress had in mind was an amendment to the statute following the decision of Cound v. Atchison, T. &amp; S. F. R. Co., C.C.W.D.Tex.1909, 173 F. 527. The holding of the Court in that case required an injured plaintiff to sue his employer in the state of incorporation, an obvious hardship in some cases. So we agree with the appellant that Section 6 is a venue provision only even though very eminent authority has implied it has wider significance.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b907-18\">The argument then turns to Section 1337 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C. The relevant language follows: \u201cThe district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action or proceeding arising under any Act of Congress regulating commerce or protecting trade and commerce against restraints and monopolies.\u201d Here the railroad argues that the phrase \u201cacts regulating commerce\u201d should be given a narrow meaning limited to statutes where the Congress has laid some positive regulations imposing a duty or prescribing some conduct. It points out that words in the Constitution and a statute do not necessarily carry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>the same meaning and calls our attention to Professor Wechsler\u2019s language in Federal Jurisdiction and the Revision of the Judicial Code, 13 Law &amp; Contemporary Problems 216, 224-25.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We need not disagree with that general proposition but do not see how it affects us here. It is also urged that statutes conferring jurisdiction on federal courts who are, of course, courts of limited jurisdiction, should be narrowly interpreted and such narrow interpretation would lead us to impose the $10,000 requirement for foundation of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">Appellant concedes that very eminent authority has taken a position contrary to its view. Thus Professor Charles Bunn, in the Jurisdiction and Practice of the Courts of the United States 71-72 (1949) says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-5\">\u201cWhen the words were used in 1911 \u2018acts regulating commerce\u2019 pretty clearly meant \u2018The Act to Regulate Commerce\u2019 * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-6\">\u201cWhether this was the original meaning or not, recent cases make it clear that it is not the present one. \u2018Acts regulating commerce\u2019 are coming rapidly to mean all acts whose constitutional basis is the commerce clause.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">Still later and more' specifically he adds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANz\">\u201cAn action by an employee of an interstate railroad against his employer for personal injury incurred in the line of duty depends on (and therefore \u2018arises under\u2019) the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act * * * which is \u2018an Act regulating commerce.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 133.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b908-8\">See also, Barron &amp; Holtzoff, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 38 (1950); S. Rep. No. 1830, 85th Cong. 2d Sess. (1958), 2 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Adm.News p. 3103 (1958) (reporting the 1958 amendments to \u00a7\u00a7 1331, 1332 of 28 U.S. C. \u2014 federal question and diversity jurisdiction).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-9\">That the statute is considered by the Supreme Court to be an act regulating commerce is shown in the discussion in both the employers\u2019 liability cases. Howard v. Illinois Cent. R. Co., 1908, 207 U.S. 463, 28 S.Ct. 141, 52 L.Ed. 297; Mondou v. New York, N. H. &amp; H. R. Co., 1912, 223 U.S. 1, 32 S.Ct. 169, 56 L.Ed. 327.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-10\">We think that the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act is based on the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce. If it is not that, there seems to be no basis for such legislation. Nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>do we think that a remedial statute of this kind should be so narrowly interpreted as to jurisdiction to oust federal courts of a type of litigation in which they necessarily become expert because they have so much of it. We think that there is jurisdiction in the federal district courts regardless of the amount claimed under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act and we think such jurisdiction is in furtherance of the purpose of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">All that we are deciding in this case is that a suit under the FELA is based upon a statute which is a regulation of interstate commerce coming under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1337 and that the jurisdictional amount of Section 1331 is not required. The impact of Section 1337 on the Jones Act cases will be considered when the problem presents itself. See Wade v. Rogala, 270 F.2d 280 (3d Cir.1959); Jordine v. Walling, 185 F.2d 662 (3d Cir.1950); Branic v. Wheeling Steel Corp., 152 F.2d 887 (3d Cir.1945), cert. denied, 327 U.S. 801 (1946). In those cases the application of \u00a7 1337 to the Jones Act was not raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b907-21\">.
