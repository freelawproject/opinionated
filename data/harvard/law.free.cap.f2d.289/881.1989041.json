Appellants\u2019<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> primary contention is that the District Court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on the doctrine of last clear chance.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-12\">Appellant\u2019s version of the accident is that, while she was crossing the street with the traffic light in her favor, the light changed and she turned back and walked towards the streetcar loading platform, proceeding in the crosswalk. About three to five seconds after she turned, and before she reached the platform, she was struck by the appellee\u2019s automobile. Appellee\u2019s version is that appellant was standing on the loading platform and that she stepped or fell into the side of his car as he passed. There was also evidence that the point of impact was two feet off the platform and outside the crosswalk.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-13\"> Application of the doctrine of last clear chance \u201cpresupposes a perilous situation created or existing through the negligence of both the plaintiff and the defendant, but assumes that there was a time after such negligence had occurred when the defendant could, and the plaintiff could not, by the use of means available, avoid the accident.\u201d Dean v. Century Motors, Inc., 1946, 81 U.S.App. D.C. 9, 10, 154 F.2d 201, 202. From the appellee\u2019s testimony that he was unsure of his whereabouts and was looking for street signs immediately preceding the accident, the jury could have found that he was negligent in failing to keep a proper lookout or in not giving full time and attention to the operation of his vehicle. Similarly, the jury could have found that the appellant was contributorily negligent from evidence that she was not in the crosswalk when struck and that she failed to see appellee\u2019s approaching vehicle. Consequently, the jury could have found appellee to have been negligent and appellant to have been contributorily negligent under circumstances in which appellee should have been aware of the appellant\u2019s danger and taken the proper precautions to avoid the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-16\">Appellee contends, however, that since, under the appellant\u2019s version of the accident she was in the crosswalk and hence not contributorily negligent, and since under his version of the accident she fell into the side of his car and he had no opportunity to avoid the accident, the elements of last clear chance could not have been present and the instruction was properly denied. Appellee relies on Hocheisen v. Smith, 1946, 81 U.S.App. D.C. 323, 158 F.2d 100, in which we affirmed the denial of a last clear chance instruction, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b930-17\">\u201cThe jury could believe either version of the incident. If they believed plaintiff, the collision was due to the negligence of defendant-driver and to nothing else. If they believed defendant-driver, the collision was due to the act of plaintiff, and the facts recited by defendant-driver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>left no room for applying the doctrine of last clear chance.\u201d 81 U.S. App.D.C. at page 323, 158 F.2d at page 100.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">This, says appellee, implies that the jury can rely on either the appellant\u2019s or the appellee\u2019s story but not upon a combination of the two. We do not agree. In Hocheisen the facts were such that no combination of the two versions presented a last clear chance situation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Here, however, since a synthesis does present such a situation, the court was required to give the instruction upon request.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-8\">This is clearly illustrated by our recent decision in Richardson v. Gregory, 1960, 108 U.S.App.D.C. 263, 281 F.2d 626. In that case, plaintiff\u2019s version of the accident was that he was struck by the overhang of defendant\u2019s car while he was standing on a loading platform; defendant\u2019s version was that plaintiff suddenly stepped off the platform into the side of his vehicle. Plaintiff\u2019s version negated contributory negligence; defendant\u2019s version tended to establish it in a manner which excluded the application of last clear chance. Neither party contended that the plaintiff had strayed off the platform and that there was sufficient time for defendant to have seen him and avoided the accident. Yet we held that, since the jury could have found these to be the facts by accepting some of the evidence of each litigant, the last clear chance instruction was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-9\">Appellee further contends that, even if the evidence supports an instruction on the last clear chance, the instruction was properly refused because the issue was not raised in the pre-trial statements or at any other time before appellant requested such an instruction at the close of the trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We think, however, that, although appellant\u2019s pre-trial statement does not use the precise words \u201clast clear chance,\u201d it does raise that issue, \u201cwith sufficient certainty and clarity to apprise the trial court and the opposing defendant of what they may expect in the course of the trial.\u201d Johnson v. Geffen, 110 U.S.App.D.C. - , - F.2d - . In their statement, appellants assert in pertinent part: \u201cThe defendant was negligent in failing to use due care <em>under the circumstances when he kneiv or should have known that the female plaintiff was oblivious to the impending danger.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.) And the pre-trial order states that plaintiff claims defendant failed \u201cto use due care under the circumstances * * * <em>when he knew or should have known that the female plaintiff was oblivious to the impending danger </em>* * (Emphasis supplied.) The key words \u201coblivious to the impending danger\u201d are central to the last clear chance doctrine; in effect, they concede contributory negligence and give notice that the evidence may cast a greater burden of care on the defendant. We think that this language in the pretrial statements should have apprised the appellee that appellants intended to rely on the doctrine, so that any surprise expressed on the offer of the instruction was unwarranted.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b931-15\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-16\">WILBUR K. MILLER, Chief Judge, dissents without opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b930-14\">. Appellants are husband and wife. She sues to recover for injuries sustained and for loss of wages. He sues to recover medical expenses and loss of consortium. As used hereinafter, \u201cappellant\u201d will refer only to Mrs. Conlon.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b931-17\">. In that case defendant struck plaintiff\u2019s car from behind. Plaintiff testified that he had been stopped at a red light for almost a minute before the collision. Defendant said that the plaintiff\u2019s car had suddenly cut in front of her and stopped. Thus the only conceivable theory of contributory negligence in that case excluded last clear chance since there would have been no time for defendant to avoid the accident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b931-18\">. In Meadow Gold Products Co. v. Wright, 1960, 108 U.S.App.D.C. 33, 278 F.2d 867, we stated that we would not be lenient with counsel who, after utilizing the pretrial procedures, fail to reveal the theory of their case until all the evidence is closed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b931-21\">. Appellants raise two other matters on this appeal. First they contend that it was reversible error for the trial court to admit testimony of the police officer who investigated the accident concerning which appellant was walking at the time. If there was error, it was not prejudicial since this testimony merely repeated evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>deuce already placed in the record by the appellants. Secondly, appellants contend the District Court erred in denying his motion to compel discovery of the extent of appellee\u2019s automobile liability insurance. However, matters of discovery are in large measure discretionary with the trial court. This court will not disturb the point of impact and the direction in the action of that court unless it was improvident and affected the substantial rights of the parties. In the posture of this case, we think it unnecessary to further consider this issue. Cf. Carter v. Baltimore &amp; O. R. Co., 1945, <em>80 </em>U.S.App. D.C. 257, 152 F.2d 129.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
