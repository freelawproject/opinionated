The plaintiff-appellee recovered a judgment in said court in the sum of $25,000 against the defendants-appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-33\">Upon consideration of the record, the oral arguments and briefs of counsel, the Court finds that the question of negligence of George Parris was properly submitted to the jury; that there was substantial evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding of negligence against the defendants-appellants and that such negligence was the proximate cause of the injury to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>the plaintiff-appellee; the Court further finds that the plaintiff-appellee was not guilty of negligence as a matter of law and that the finding of the jury that there was no negligence on the part of the plaintiff-appellee, which contributed to his injury, is not contrary to the weight of the evidence. And the Court finds further that there is no merit to the claim of the defendants-appellants that the Ohio Casualty Insurance Company should have been made a party to the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">It is therefore ordered, adjudged and decreed that the judgment of the District Court be and it is hereby affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
