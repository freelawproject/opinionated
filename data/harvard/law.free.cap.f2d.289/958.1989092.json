The opposition is based on opposer\u2019s prior registration and use of \u201cWm. Penn,\u201d in association with a portrait of William Penn, as a trademark for cigars.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-6\">Since the goods are identical, the only issue is whether the trademarks are so similar that the use of \u201cWILLIAM TELL\u201d on applicant\u2019s cigars is likely to cause confusion or mistake, or to deceive purchasers. We do not think there is such likelihood.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-7\">In the first place, cigar smokers are most discriminating in their purchase of cigars. This fact has been confirmed by the president of the <em>opposer </em>corporation. In answer to a question as to whether cigar smokers are discriminating people he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-8\">\u201cThey are very discriminating smokers and have great brand loyalty. It is much higher in cigars than cigarettes. A man does not walk into a store, asking for a Perfecto, but he will walk into a store and ask for a \u2018Wm Penn\u2019 Perfecto, or a \u2018WM. TELL\u2019 Perfecto.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1007-11\">As to the trademarks themselves, \u201cWm Penn\u201d and \u201cWILLIAM TELL,\u201d although there are some similarities such as the first name and the double consonants preceded by \u201ce\u201d in the last name, there are also definite dissimilarities. Opposer\u2019s trademark is the name of the founder of the Pennsylvania colony and, as registered, includes a picture of the gentleman, whereas applicant\u2019s mark is the name of a legendary Swiss archer. Those purchasers who have sufficient education to realize the significance of the names would not confuse the two characters, while the uneducated purchasers who consider the names per se are not likely to mistake one for the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-12\">Appellant relies greatly on evidence of alleged confusion which appears in the record to substantiate its position. However, the incidents to which appellant refers do not relate to purchaser confusion but involve the mistakes of a writer for a trade magazine and employees<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of shops where the products of the parties are sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-13\">In view of the discrimination of the cigar smokers and the differences in the two marks, we do not believe that the use of the trademark by appellee on its goods is likely to cause confusion or mistake, or deceive purchasers. Therefore, the decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"A1s\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1007-14\">. Whether the writer or the employees are cigar smokers is not revealed in the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
