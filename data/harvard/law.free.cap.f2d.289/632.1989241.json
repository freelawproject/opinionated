The central issue in both is the interpretation of the distribution contracts; both contracts were prepared by Kable, the distributor, and are identical. It will be convenient to treat the two cases as one. The crucial contractual provisions are set out in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b681-23\">******</p>\n<p id=\"b681-24\">Plaintiffs-publishers brought these actions, contending that Kable credited itself for the price of millions of comic books which nonetheless were sold to the public in competition with the publishers\u2019 subsequent issues. The complaint sought in successive counts: (1) the purchase price (5{S per copy) of all magazines delivered to Kable less payments actually made by Kable; (2) the purchase price of all magazines returned to Kable by its wholesalers which it did not destroy; (3) the purchase price of all magazines returned from wholesalers and then sold to other wholesalers; (4) the purchase price of all magazines which Kable did not return to Four Star after having been requested to do so;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (5) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>damages for fraud.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The aggregate purchase price claimed as wrongfully withheld amounted to some $1,800,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">Kable interposed three counterclaims, only one of which is in issue here. That counterclaim was based on the periodic statements sent to the publishers by Kable. These statements constituted an account stated under paragraph 3(e) of the distribution contract. Note 1 supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">The district court interpreted paragraph 2(b) of the contract to entitle Kable to a credit of the purchase price for all copies which were returned to it from its wholesalers within the specified period. According to the district court\u2019s interpretation this right was absolute, no matter what happened to the magazines thereafter; fraud or any other possibility would not alter the situation. The court understood subparagraphs 3(c) and 3(e) of the contract to imply a duty in Kable to destroy or return to publishers those magazines which its wholesalers did not sell, but ruled that Kable\u2019s right to a credit under paragraph 2(b) was wholly independent of Kable\u2019s duty to return to the publishers or destroy. This interpretation of the contract apparently was based on the view that although the references to \u201cunsold copies,\u201d \u201creturns,\u201d \u201creturn,\u201d and \u201cfull copy returns,\u201d in paragraphs 3(c) and (e) meant, and impliedly required, returns from Kable <em>to the publishers, </em>of all copies \u201cunsold\u201d in the sense of \u201cnever sold to the public,\u201d the deduction from the purchase price provided by paragraph 2(b) \u201cfor all returned and unsold copies\u201d became fully accrued upon <em>return to Kable, </em>the distributor.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">Accordingly, the district court granted summary judgment to Kable on its counterclaim, since nothing was brought forward to show that Kable had taken credits for any magazines other than thos\u00e9 \u201creturned\u201d to it by the wholesalers to whom they were originally sent. And since the contract was so interpreted that the publishers were not entitled to the purchase price of copies returned to Kable, irrespective of what disposition was made of them thereafter, the complaint, which was based on claims for the purchase price, was thought not to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Consequently, Kable\u2019s motion to dismiss the purchase price claims of the complaint was granted. Notwithstanding, since paragraph 3 of the contract demonstrated Kable\u2019s duty to return to the publisher or destroy, the district court allowed the publishers to go to the jury to recover \u201cconsequential damages\u201d for breach of that duty. By its answers to interrogatories propounded by the court, the jury found that Kable failed to destroy a substantial number of the magazines returned to it and that a substantial number of these were recirculated and sold to the public, with the effect of reducing the sales of each of the publishers\u2019 subsequent issues by 300,000 copies. The court took 5$S per copy as the measure of damages (that being the sale price to the distributor under the contract). The resulting figure was set off against Kable\u2019s damages under its summary judgment on its counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-10\">Publishers appeal from the dismissal of their purchase price claims and from the entry of the summary judgment for Kable. Kable cross-appeals from the set-off to its judgment measured by the jury\u2019s special verdict, on the ground that there was insufiicient evidence to support the set-off.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-11\">We hold that the district court erred in interpreting the contract, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>particularly paragraph 2(b) thereof, to mean that the distributor was entitled to a deduction for all copies returned to the distributor. Consequently, its dismissal of the purchase price claims and its entry of summary judgment on the counterclaim must be reversed, and the case remanded for a new trial. It is therefore unnecessary for us to deal with the questions presented by Kable\u2019s cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"AQzi\">The contract itself, we think, contains solid internal evidence of the error in the interpretation adopted below. It is in three paragraphs. Paragraph 1 is headed \u201cThe Publisher Agrees\u201d; Paragraph '2 is headed \u201cThe Distributor Agrees\u201d; and Paragraph 3, \u201cBoth Parties Agree.\u201d Looking to paragraph 2(b), on which the interpretation below rested, it will be noted that the distributor\u2019s promise to pay the stipuated price is there stated to extend to \u201call copies * * * delivered to \u2018Distributor\u2019s\u2019 designated wholesalers and not returned to \u2018Distributor\u2019 * * * after making deductions [for several generally stated categories and] for all returned and unsold copies * * To understand the reach of all these several deductions one must turn to other provisions in the contract. Thus the deduction of paragraph 2(b) for \u201cadvances\u201d is evidently referable to paragraph 3(g); that for \u201cadjustments\u201d to 1(c); that for \u201callowances\u201d to 1(f) and l(i), and that for \u201cindemnities and guarantees herein above provided for\u201d to l(j).</p>\n<p id=\"AiT\">By a similar process we must go outside paragraph 2(b) to find the definition of the deduction \u201cfor all returned and unsold copies.\u201d The 2(b) \u201cdeduction\u201d which the distributor may make from his payments for returned copies is plainly referable to, and indeed reciprocal with, the publisher\u2019s promise in paragraph 1(e) \u201cto credit the \u2018Distributor\u2019 for all returned and unsold full copies, front covers and/or headings * * *\" which is there stated as a qualification of the agreement \u201cto bill the \u2018Distributor\u2019 for copies \u2022* * * delivered to \u2018Distributor\u2019s\u2019 wholesalers at the rate of five . (5?0 cents per copy.\u201d This subparagraph [1(e)] apparently contemplates that, just as the billing shall extend to all copies <em>delivered by the publisher </em>to the distributor\u2019s wholesalers, the credit is to cover all copies <em>returned to the publisher </em>unsold. Indeed, it would scarcely be appropriate in the context of paragraph 1(e) to speak of copies \u201creturned\u201d by the original wholesalers to the <em>distributor </em>because the wholesalers had not received them from the distributor.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-10\">That the 1(e) \u201ccredit,\u201d and hence the 2(b) \u201cdeduction,\u201d extends only to returns <em>to the publisher </em>is further indicated by the language of 1(e) extending the credit not only to the return of \u201cfull copies\u201d but also to \u201cfront covers and/or headings at the rate of five (5j\u00e9) cents per copy.\u201d To understand the reason for these alternative forms of return we must look to paragraphs 3(c), (e) and (f). Paragraph 3(e) speaks expressly of returns \u201cto the Publisher\u201d: these are the returns that qualify for the \u201ccredits\u201d provided in 1(e) and again referred to in 3(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-11\">Moreover, we think of some weight in support of our interpretation is the provision of paragraph 3(d) \u201cthat the relationship between the \u2018Publisher\u2019 and the \u2018Distributor\u2019 is that of creditor and debtor.\u201d This scarcely accords with the ruling below that as to part of the copies delivered by the publisher the distributor is a debtor but as to the remainder it is obligated not to pay the stipulated price but is only under some contractual duty to return. Instead, we hold, the provision contemplates that the distributor is a debtor for all copies delivered by the publisher but with an option to obtain a credit or make a deduction for those returned to the publisher.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-12\">All in all we are satisfied that the deduction provided in paragraph 2(b) extends only to unsold copies (or the contract equivalent) returned to the publishers.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>We think the publishers are right in insisting that the contract contemplates a scheme of distribution along the following steps:</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">1. Shipment by publisher to Kable\u2019s wholesaler; then</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">2. Debit of Kable\u2019s account of 50 per magazine shipped; then</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">3. (a) Either sale by wholesaler to retailer to public, in which case Kable\u2019s duty to pay 50 per magazine becomes absolute,</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">(b) Or failure to sell within contractual period followed by return to Kable by wholesaler,</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">(c) Or return to Kable within contractual period and reshipment' to second wholesaler, in which case step 3 begins again.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-9\">If the event delineated in 3(b) occurs, then</p>\n<p id=\"b684-10\">4. (a) Either return by Kable to publisher, in which case Kable\u2019s right to a credit becomes absolute,</p>\n<p id=\"b684-11\">(b) Or destruction by Kable when permitted by the contract as a substitute for return, in which case Kable\u2019s right to a credit becomes absolute.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-12\">The internal evidence so fully supports this scheme of distribution that there is no occasion to invoke the familiar rule that when \u201cthe remaining doubt as to the proper interpretation is merely as to which of two possible and reasonable meanings should be adopted, the court will adopt that one which is the less favorable in its legal effect to the party who chose the words.\u201d 3 Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 559 at 262.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-13\">The fact that Kable\u2019s accounts constituted accounts stated is not conclusive. For notwithstanding, the publishers, in spite of their prior tacit assent, may attack the accounts by evidence of errors therein, but have the burden of showing in what manner the accounts are incorrect. 6 Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 1310 at 193.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-14\">Judgments in so far as appealed from are reversed and cases remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b681-11\">. \u201cWitnesseth:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-12\">1.
