The complainant picked appellant as his attacker in a police lineup when he was arrested five months after the attack and unequivocally identified him at the trial. Appellant makes a vigorous attack on the complainant\u2019s credibility relying on inconsistent prior statements of the complainant. Complainant freely admitted prior statements which were inconsistent with his testimony on trial. Appellant was near the scene at about the time of the attack. The credibility of his alibi witness, who placed him in a tourist home nearby, must be considered in the light of the fact she had become appellant\u2019s wife after the date of the alleged robbery. At best her testimony, if believed, did not rule out the possibility that appellant could have taken part in the robbery and gone to the tourist home immediately thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-27\"> Viewing the entire record we conclude that while the conflict in the testimony and the prior inconsistent statements of the complainant were such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>as to permit some degree of doubt, they do not compel a reasonable doubt about guilt. \u201cIn our jurisprudence the credibility of witnesses and the derivation of the truth from oral testimony are reposed in the hearer of the witnesses.\u201d Wigfall v. United States, 1956, 97 U.S. App.D.C. 252, 253, 230 F.2d 220, 221. Hinton v. United States, 1952, 91 U.S. App.D.C. 13, 196 F.2d 605 is not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">We have considered the contentions and the record relating to rulings of the District Court and find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
