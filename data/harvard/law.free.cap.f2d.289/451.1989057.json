Such conduct and such purposes, if established, might be assumed to constitute an unfair labor practice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>as an interference with the employees\u2019 section 7 rights, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 157, but we are not called, upon so to decide.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">The Board in June, 1956, had certified the Union as the collective bargaining representative in the appropriate unit. Negotiations for a contract went forward over a period of many weeks, the Union\u2019s proposals including provisions for a union shop and a check-off. The latter terms were omitted from the Company\u2019s counterproposals, and a stalemate was reached on September 18, 1956. The Union then called a strike and began picketing the Company\u2019s plant. Negotiations went forward, notwithstanding, until sometime in December, 1956. The picketing continued in 1956 and 1957 and at least until February 5, 1958, it was stipulated, when a hearing before the Examiner commenced. It was further stipulated at that time that since about July 8, 1957, seven months after bargaining had ceased, the Union had placed the Company on an \u201cUnfair List\u201d posted at the Union halls and on a \u201cWe do not patronize\u201d list, published in a Union newspaper.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Meanwhile, a petition for decertification having been filed, a Board-ordered election had been held on September 25, 1957. Only one vote had been east for the Union, one ballot was void, 14 were challenged, and 90 were against the Union. The Board decertified the Union as of December 16, 1957, but the picketing and the listing continued, as noted.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">The Examiner\u2019s findings in the foregoing and other respects had been based upon stipulated or undisputed evidence. He recommended that the Union be ordered to cease and desist from restraining or coercing the employees of the Company in the exercise of their section 7 rights by picketing the Company\u2019s premises and by placing the Company\u2019s name on the Union\u2019s \u201cunfair\u201d and \u201cwe do not patronize\u201d lists. The Board, one member dissenting, adopted the Examiner\u2019s findings, conclusions and recommendations,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and on October 3, 1958, issued its order accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-13\">The Examiner and the Board largely had relied upon the Board\u2019s decision in Curtis Brothers, Inc.,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> wherein we later denied enforcement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thereupon the Board amended its order of October 3, 1958, in view of the holding by this court that picketing for recognition by a minority union does not violate section 8(b) (1) (A) of the Act. The latter element thus is out of the case, yet it had been the \u201cprincipal legal issue,\u201d without which, we may suspect, the complaint might not have been lodged in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-14\">That the Union, while still certified, attempted when it so was lawful, to cause the Company to accord it recognition and to induce a union security agreement, we have no doubt. To presume that the Union\u2019s picketing and listing <em>after </em>decertification were continued for purposes which had become illegal is another matter. The Board argues that the Union did nothing to signify an abandonment of the original objectives, which its order proscribed. \u201cIt did not claim that it wanted less, after the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>certification, than it had demanded earlier. It did not suggest to the Company, or evince by its conduct, that the earlier demand for a union security provision was no longer extant.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It is thus urged that the Board was justified in concluding that some form of union shop was still an object of the Union\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">This argument reflects ordinary experience that once a particular condition is shown to have existed, it is reasonable to conclude that it persists and may be presumed to continue at a later critical date.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We are persuaded that this principle, however valid ordinarily, can not here apply in view of the intervening circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">The Board\u2019s case, stemming from the Examiner\u2019s findings, may be said to run thus. The Union in 1956 definitely asserted its objectives in support of which the strike was called. A year later, the Board conducted the decertification election on September 25, 1957, the results of which were certified on December 16, 1957. The General Counsel then filed his complaint on January 8,1958, alleging as unlawful conduct, <em>inter alia, </em>the picketing and \u201cunfair\u201d listing. The Union\u2019s answer affirmatively alleged that the Union\u2019s conduct was lawful in all respects, a position which the Examiner and the Board rejected. \u201cDespite its loss of the election and its decertification the Union continued to picket the premises of the Company and to engage in other conduct [listing],\u201d the Examiner found. Had there been no more, we might have accepted the presumption upon which the Board relied, that the original objectives persisted and that the supporting coercive conduct was illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-14\">But most important circumstances were interposed which negated the continuity of inference. Not only this court, but the Supreme Court found, as the Union\u2019s answer had here alleged, that the Union\u2019s picketing conduct in Curtis was lawful. Thus as to the section 8(b) (1) (A) aspect of the charges here pending, no presumption of illegality could properly flow simply because of the continuous picketing. We see no basis upon which the very same picketing can be said to support an \u201cattempt to cause\u201d violation of section 8(b) (2). Had there been, in addition, some evidence of the use of threats and coercion, a very different case would be presented.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As it is, the record here is no stronger as related to the section 8(b) (2) charge than in the respect upon which the courts have sustained the Union on the section 8(b) (1) (A) charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-15\">As to the listing, the case is even weaker and may shortly be disposed of. The Union addressed itself to its own members in the Union\u2019s halls and to the subscribers to the Union\u2019s paper. The use of such propaganda would seem to come squarely within the rationale and the legislative history upon which National Labor Relations Board v. Drivers, Chauffeurs, Helpers Local Union No. 269 <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> had turned.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-16\">We find no adequate basis presently remaining in this record to support the Board\u2019s findings and conclusions. Enforcement is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b499-17\">. The petitioners collectively herein described as the Union include the International Association of Machinists, AFL-CIO, I.A.M.
