The order, based on a stipulation of facts, (1) revoked D\u2019Antoni, Inc.\u2019s registration with the Commission as a broker and dealer in securities, naming Mr. D\u2019Antoni as a cause of the revocation, (2) denied the request of D\u2019Antoni, Inc. for withdrawal of its registration, and (3) denied both Mr. D\u2019Antoni\u2019s application for registration and his request to withdraw his application. In large measure, the case is controlled by Peoples Securities Company et al. v. Securities and Exchange Commission, 289 F.2d 268, decided today. We affirm the Commission\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-24\">November 3, 1955, D\u2019Antoni, Inc., registered with the Commission under Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 78o(b), as a broker and dealer in over-the-counter securities. Mr. D\u2019Antoni has been president, a director, and the principal shareholder of the company since its organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-25\">SEC Rule X15c3-1, 17 C.F.R. 240.-15c3-1, provides that no broker or dealer shall permit his aggregate indebtedness to exceed 2000 per cent of his net capital. From time to time the Commission warned D\u2019Antoni, Inc., that it was not complying with the net capital rule. In October 1959 an investigator for the Commission, in the course of examining the company\u2019s books, ascertained that from April 30 to October 9, 1959, the company had engaged in a number of transactions in over-the-counter securities at times when its net capital was impaired. The examination showed that the company had closed and settled in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>full all accounts with its customers and other brokers, had ceased its activities as a broker-dealer, and had made plans for an orderly liquidation of its assets. The investigator advised D\u2019Antoni, Inc. to file a formal notice of withdrawal of its registration as a broker-dealer and to resign from the National' Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. October 9, 1959, the company did so. Mr. D\u2019Antoni, however, then filed a personal application for registration as a broker and dealer. The Commission notified D\u2019Antoni, Inc., and Mr. D\u2019Antoni, that action on the company\u2019s withdrawal and Mr. D\u2019Antoni\u2019s application for registration would be held up, pending the determination at a hearing whether D\u2019Antoni, Inc. and Mr. D\u2019Antoni had engaged in willful violation of the Securities Exchange Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">At a hearing before an examiner for the Commission, Mr. D\u2019Antoni submitted a letter purporting to withdraw his personal application for registration. The parties agreed to a stipulation of facts, and waived further hearings. The Commission, limiting its findings to the occurrences between April 30 and October 9, 1959, held that the company, aided and abetted by D\u2019Antoni, had willfully violated the net capital rule. Accordingly, the Commission revoked the registration of D\u2019Antoni, Inc. and denied its request for withdrawal; and also denied Mr. D\u2019Antoni\u2019s application for registration and his request for withdrawal.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Mr. D\u2019Antoni contends that he had an absolute right to withdraw his application for registration at any time before it became effective. We denied the existence of such a right in Peoples Securities Company et al., v. S.E.C., 289 F.2d 268; the act of filing creates a public interest that precludes an absolute right of withdrawal.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">D\u2019Antoni, Inc. contends that the order revoking its registration is so harsh and punitive as to constitute an abuse of the Commission\u2019s discretionary powers. The company argues that the bare violation of a Commission rule does not justify so severe a punishment, especially where, as here, the volume of business was small, the transactions were mostly with the D\u2019Antoni family or with close friends, no losses were suffered by customers or other brokers or dealers, the affairs of the company have been settled in full, and the company has ceased to do business. The facts show that D\u2019Antoni, Inc.\u2019s noncompliance with the net capital rule is not a \u201cbare violation\u201d. The financial impairment became increasingly more serious, and it was not inadvertent but a willful disregard of repeated warnings by the Commission\u2019s staff. The net capital rule is one of the most important weapons in the Commission\u2019s arsenal to protect investors. By limiting the ratio of a broker\u2019s indebtedness to his capital, the rule operates to assure confidence and safety to the investing public. The question is not whether actual injuries or losses were suffered by anyone. Hughes v. S.E.C., 1949, 85 U.S.App.D.C. 56, 174 F.2d 969. D\u2019Antoni, Inc., improperly \u2014 and willfully \u2014 subjected its customers to undue financial risks by conducting its business in violation of this rule. Furthermore, even members of the D\u2019Antoni family and close friends are entitled to the same protection as the general public.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\"> In view of the company\u2019s violations in the past, the Commission was not unreasonable in attempting to protect the investing public against future violations. Shuck v. S.E.C., 1958, 105 U.S.App.D.C. 72, 264 F.2d 358. The Commission\u2019s order is not punitive; it is not a penalty imposed on the broker. Revocation and denial of registration are but means to protect the public interest. Pierce v. Securities and Exchange Commission, 9 Cir., 1956, 239 F.2d 160, 163. See Flemming v. Nestor, 1960, 363 U.S. 603, 80 S.Ct. 1367, 4 L.Ed. 2d 1435.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">We hold that the Commission\u2019s order was not unlawful, improper, or an abuse of discretion. The order is</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
