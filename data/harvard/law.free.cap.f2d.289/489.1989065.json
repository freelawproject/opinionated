August, Asst. U. S. Atty., Detroit, Mich., Lawrence Gubow, U. S. Atty., Detroit, Mich., on brief, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b537-14\">Before MILLER, Chief Judge, and MARTIN and McALLISTER, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b537-15\">ORDER.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-16\">Following trial by jury, appellant was found guilty of bank robbery in the course of which he put in jeopardy the life of a person by the use of a dangerous weapon, in violation of Section 2113(d), Title 18 U.S.Code. He received a sentence of 15 years imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-17\">On this appeal it is contended that appellant was deprived of a fair and impartial trial because of the failure of his trial attorney (1) to move for a change of venue, and (2) to use as a witness another defendant who had pleaded guilty to the indictment and who, it is claimed, had given the trial attorney a written statement that appellant was in no way a participant in the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-18\">We find no evidence whatsoever to support appellant\u2019s contention that he was entitled to a change of venue, or that his attorney would have been justified in making such a motion. There is no merit in this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-19\">The written statement of the other defendant was not made a part of the record, but even assuming that appellant\u2019s trial attorney had in his possession such a statement, the, decision of the trial attorney not to use. such a witness, without more, does not constitute lack of due process of law or sustain appellant\u2019s contention that he was deprived of a fair and impartial trial. O\u2019Malley v. United States, 6 Cir., 285 F.2d 733.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-20\">It is ordered that the judgment be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
