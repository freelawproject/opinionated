After fully considering the case upon presentation of the appeal, however, we conclude that the Municipal Court of Appeals did apply the proper standard and that its opinion was correct.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The judgment of the Municipal Court of Appeals is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b802-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b802-16\">. 156 A.2d 678 (1959). We agree with the Municipal Court of Appeals that Giant Food Stores, Inc. v. Fine, 1959, 106 U.S.App.D.C. 95, 269 F.2d 542, is distinguishable. There we held that the jury could reasonably find negligence from evidence that the floor upon which plaintiff fell was left, after mopping, wet and therefore dangerous. Here there is no evidence of what had been done in repairing the floor. Hence there is no basis upon which the jury could have found that the floor was negligently left in a dangerous condition.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b802-19\">FAHY, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AJQ\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-20\">Not being able to distinguish in any significant respect the situation presented by plaintiff\u2019s evidence and that which was before this court in Giant Food Stores, Inc. v. Fine, 106 U.S.App.D.C. 95, 269 F.2d 542, I would reverse upon the authority of that case .</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
