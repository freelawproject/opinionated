The District Court sat without a jury. After hearing plaintiff\u2019s evidence, the court found that the contract provisions entitling appellees to retain the deposit upon appellant\u2019s failure to complete the transaction did not constitute a penalty, and dismissed the complaint. We find no reversible error. Plaintiff-appellant did not make a prima facie case that the contract provision was unreasonable or unconscionable, or that any other ground existed for the grant of relief. While we reach the merits of the claim in the interests of avoiding circuity of action, we express no opinion as to whether, or if so under what conditions, a suit for a declaratory judgment is an appropriate remedy in controversies of the present sort.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-28\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
