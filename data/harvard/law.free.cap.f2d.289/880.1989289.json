Randall fell on the sidewalk near the corner of 12th Street and Independence Avenue, S. W. Apparently she stumbled over a piece of wire, perhaps one similar to that wrapped around newspapers as they are delivered to sidewalk vendors. Attributing the presence of the wire on the sidewalk to the negligence of the Evening Star Newspaper Company, and Robert Chambers, its distributor who delivered papers to the nearby corner, she sued them to recover damages for the injuries she sustained. She appeals from the judgment entered pursuant to a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-17\">We agree with the trial judge that her evidence, construed most favorably to her, would not have justified or supported a verdict in her favor. Jackson v. Capital Transit Co., 1938, 69 App.D. C. 147, 99 F.2d 380, certiorari denied 1939, 306 U.S. 630, 59 S.Ct. 464, 83 L. Ed. 1032.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-20\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
