The victim told them that three young men, each masked and armed, had entered her house, stolen a large amount of cash and a quantity of personal property, and that one of them had raped her. Some time between 5:00 and 9:00 p. m. that evening, from pictures at police headquarters, she identified Burroughs as her assailant and Hair as one of the robbers. She tentatively identified Reese Blakeney as the third robber.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b943-7\">At about 9:50 that evening, four officers converged upon Hair\u2019s residence. One officer was stationed at the back of the house to guard against escape, and the other three approached the front gate. Although they had neither an arrest nor a search warrant, their admitted purpose was to arrest Hair who, they had reason to believe, was at home.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> When they were approximately seven or eight feet from the front door, a man opened the door, began to step out, and then turned and ran up the stairs towards the second floor. The officers, without giving notice of their authority or purpose in seeking entrance, immediately gave chase. They threw open the door, chased him up the stairs, and fired several shots at the man who then dived through the window and eluded the officer stationed behind the house. One of the officers then stated that he had recognized the man as Reese Blakeney whom he knew and whom the victim had identified as one of the robbers. He was subsequently apprehended and so identified by the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-18\">While rushing out of Hair\u2019s home in pursuit of Blakeney, the officers passed an open door of a room in which they observed several items which fitted the descriptions of the goods stolen in the robbery. Based upon this observation, they procured the search warrant under which these goods were subsequently seized.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> *The trial court denied Hair\u2019s pre-trial efforts to suppress this evidence and overruled his objections to their admission at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-19\">We shall deal first with appellant Hair\u2019s claim that the entry into his home was unlawful. If Hair is correct, the evidence seized under the warrant issued on the basis of observations derived from that entry was erroneously admitted. Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, 1920, 251 U.S. 385, 40 S.Ct. 182, 64 L.Ed. 319; Somer v. United States, 2 Cir., 1943,138 F.2d 790. Hair contends not only that the initial night-time entry without a warrant was unlawful but also that the manner of entry was illegal under the rule of Miller v. United States, 1958, 357 U.S. 301, 78 S.Ct. 1190, 2 L.Ed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>2d 1332; and our recent decision in Keiningham v. United States, 109 U.S. App.D.C. 272, 287 F.2d 126. We need not consider whether an entry without a warrant could have been valid since we hold that the manner of entry was illegal in any event and required exclusion of the evidence thereby observed.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">The Government does not seriously dispute that Miller requires police officers who seek to invade the privacy of an individual\u2019s home to announce their authority and their purpose in demanding entrance before \u201cbarging in,\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and that no such announcement was given here. It seeks to justify the absence of announcement, however, on the ground that it would have been a useless gesture because it was a virtual certainty that the officers\u2019 purpose was known.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">In Miller the Supreme Court indicated that \u201cit may be that, without an express announcement of purpose, the facts known to officers would justify them in being virtually certain that the petitioner already knows their purpose so that an announcement would be a useless gesture.\u201d 357 U.S. at page 310, 78 S.Ct. at page 1196. But rather than creating a \u201cvirtual certainty\u201d of such knowledge, the Court considered the facts in Miller to be ambiguous. Nothing less can be fairly said of the circumstances disclosed by this record. In Miller, Federal officers knocked upon petitioner\u2019s door at about three in the morning. When asked who was there, one officer replied in a low voice, \u201cpolice.\u201d Petitioner then opened the door on an attached chain and asked the officers what they wanted. Before they replied, he attempted to close the door. The officers then ripped the chain off the door and forced their way inside. If the attempted closing of the door after the officers had announced their presence and identity was ambiguous in Miller, Blakeney\u2019s opening and closing the door when the officers had made no announcement and were a distance of seven or eight feet away at the time cannot be otherwise characterized.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-10\">Nor does the Government\u2019s characterization of Blakeney\u2019s running up the stairs as flight change the picture. In Williams v. United States, 1960, 107 U.S.App.D.C. 276, 276 F.2d 522, the trial court refused to exclude evidence obtained from a dwelling without announcement of purpose on the ground that the appellant\u2019s running upstairs after seeing the officers was evidence of flight and made it virtually certain that further announcement would have been futile. We reversed per curiam citing Miller. Cf. Accarino v. United States, 1949, 85 U.S.App.D.C. 394, 179 F.2d 456.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b944-11\">Nor do we think that any claims of necessitious circumstances can justify the officers\u2019 entry without announcement in this case. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the Miller rule admits of such an exception,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Accarino v. United States, supra, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>answers the Government\u2019s contention that Blalceney\u2019s supposed \u201cflight\u201d necessitated instantaneous action. There, as here, the Government pointed to such conduct as constituting the need for entry without a warrant or announcement. In that case we said the conduct could not be considered flight which justified unannounced and warrantless intrusion since \u201cthe suspect had not been arrested, and the officers did not notify him that they wanted to arrest him.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> No less can be said about Blakeney\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">It may also be noted that Miller and Acearino dealt with forcible \u201cbreaking\u201d into a home. The record in this case does not disclose whether the door to Hair\u2019s home was locked, closed but unlocked, or merely left ajar. But even if we were to assume that the door was left open, only the sheerest sophistry would describe as \u201cpeaceable\u201d the charge of three police officers with drawn weapons across the threshold of a home. As we said in Keiningham, \u201ca person\u2019s right to privacy in his home * * * is governed by something more than the fortuitous circumstance of an unlocked door * * *<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\"> Appellant Burroughs contends that his convictions must also be reversed</p>\n<p id=\"b945-14\">because the illegally obtained evidence was admitted against him as well as Hair. The property seized was not Burroughs\u2019, and he had no interest in the premises unlawfully invaded. Ordinarily one seeking to challenge the legality of a search or seizure must establish that he was the victim of the alleged invasion of privacy. Jones v. United States, 1960, 362 U.S. 257, 261, 80 S.Ct. 725, 4 L.Ed. 2d 697. But we read McDonald v. United States, 1948, 335 U.S. 451, 69 S.Ct. 191, 93 L.Ed. 153, to recognize another ground for exclusion. There, evidence unlawfully seized from McDonald\u2019s room was admitted in the trial of McDonald and his co-defendant, Washington. The Court reversed McDonald\u2019s conviction and Washington\u2019s as well, reasoning that the denial of McDonald\u2019s motion to suppress was prejudicial to Washington because, had the motion been granted, the evidence would not have been available for use at the trial.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Judge Fahy and the writer are of the opinion that admission of the illegal evidence was sufficiently prejudicial to Burroughs on the housebreaking and robbery charges to warrant reversal of those convictions for a new trial under McDonald.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b946-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>Only the writer would grant Burroughs a new trial on the rape charge. The writer\u2019s views are that the illegal evidence had probative value for the rape charge. In instructing the jury on the lack of consent required to convict for rape, the trial judge stated, \u201cYou may also consider the circumstances of whether there were two armed confederates of the alleged rapist in the house at the time. * * * \u201d That confederates were present was substantiated by Hair\u2019s possession of the stolen goods which were erroneously admitted in evidence. No one can say with certainty that the admission of this evidence was prejudicial to Burroughs, but the risk of prejudice seems sufficiently great to warrant a new trial under McDonald. See Kotteakos v. United States, 1946, 328 U.S. 750, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">In Judge Fahy\u2019s view, however, while the evidence seized was a major aspect of the Government\u2019s proof of the housebreaking and robbery, this was not the case with regard to the rape charge. Considering the evidence as a whole, the risk of prejudice arising from the seized evidence he thinks was not sufficient to warrant reversal of that conviction. Since Judge Miller also votes to affirm Burroughs\u2019 conviction for rape, that conviction is affirmed.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Because the 7 to 21 year sentence for that conviction was imposed to run consecutively after the concurrent sentences for housebreaking and robbery, the District Court will be required to resentence Burroughs.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">No. 15878 is reversed and remanded for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">No. 15890 is reversed and remanded for new trial in part; and affirmed in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b943-8\">.

During the trial he withdrew his plea of not guilty and entered a plea of guilty to the robbery charge which was accepted by the trial judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b943-12\">. The Government contended during oral argument that the officers were merely engaged in a \u201cstake-out\u201d of Hair\u2019s home for surveillance purposes. However, the officers testified at the hearing on the motion to suppress that they went to Hair\u2019s house for the purpose of placing him under immediate arrest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b943-21\">. The officers made a second warrantless entry of the Hair dwelling at about 2:00 a. m., on January 5, for the ostensible purpose of arresting Hair. We need not consider the legality of this entry since the Government concedes the validity of the warrant is not dependent upon the second entry, but stands solely on the legality of the initial entry.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b944-6\">. Keiningham v. United States, 287 F.2d at page 129.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b944-7\">. Judge Fahy adds: It is of some significance in determining the question of validity of the entrance of the officers without demand and announcement of purpose that they knew the premises belonged to Hair and not to Blakeney, yet no opportunity was given to Hair to respond in any way to a demand and announcement which would have complied with the statute. That the officers knew Blakeney was not the owner of the premises is also a circumstance to be considered in determining whether the officers could be \u201cvirtually certain\u201d that a demand and announcement would be useless.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b944-12\">. It may be doubted whether Miller is susceptible to such an exception. In Accarino v. United States, supra, we declared that, absent a warrant, intrusion into a man\u2019s dwelling for purposes of arrest can be justified only by necessities of the moment. We went on to state that, in any event, \u201cbefore an officer can break open a door to a home, he must make known the cause of his demand for entry.\u201d 85 U.S.App.D.C. at page 403, 179 F.2d at page 465.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-13\">A survey of recent cases in this court involving the legality of police entries without warrants will indicate that it is a rare case indeed in which the police cannot point to \u201cimmediate necessities\u201d as justification for dispensing with what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>the Government\u2019s brief characterizes as \u201cthe niceties of usual police procedure.\u201d Necessitous circumstances may justify dispensing with a warrant issued upon a magistrate\u2019s determination of probable cause. But proper announcement is required where entry is sought under a valid warrant. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3109 (1958); Keiningham v. United States, supra. Surely less is not to be demanded of an officer seeking entry without a warrant. Of course, we agree with the Government that there may be situations in which express announcement would be futile and even dangerous to the officer. But we think that such cases are only those, unlike this one, in which there exists a virtual certainty that the officer\u2019s authority and purpose are already known to the occupant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b945-10\">. 85 U.S.App.D.C. at pages 402-403, 179 F.2d at pages 464-465.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b945-11\">. 287 F.2d at page 130.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b945-15\">. Compare Anderson v. United States, 1943, 318 U.S. 350, 356, 63 S.Ct. 599, 87 L.Ed. 829. It might be argued that McDonald does not apply where, as here, the unlawfully seized materials cannot be returned to the defendant upon his timely motion to suppress. Such a view may perhaps be implied from the statement in the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion that \u201cif the property had been returned to McDonald, it would not have been available for use at the trial [against Washington].\u201d 335 U.S. at page 456, 69 S.Ct. at page 193. We think this implication unsound and do not understand the Supreme Court to have meant McDonald to apply only in those cases in which the property could have been returned rather than suppressed as evidence. For discussion of this aspect of the case, see 1949, 62 Harv.L.Rev. 1229, 1230-31.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b945-17\">. The present case is unlike Agnello v. United States, 1925, 269 U.S. 20, 46 S.Ct. 4, 70 L.Ed. 145, in which the illegally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>obtained evidence was submitted only against the victim of the illegal search and seizure and not against his co-defendants. The Supreme Court expressly recognized this distinction in McDonald.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b946-21\">.
