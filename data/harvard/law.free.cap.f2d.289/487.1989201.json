He was sentenced to six months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-22\">The constitutionality of the regulation has been previously upheld by this Court. Di Santo v. United States, 6 Cir., 93 F.2d 948, certiorari denied, 303 U.S. 662, 58 S.Ct. 829, 82 L.Ed. 1121. See also: United States v. Tishman, 7 Cir., 99 F.2d 951, certiorari denied, 306 U.S. 636, 59 S.Ct. 485, 83 L.Ed. 1038.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-23\">It is admitted by appellant that no report was made by him of the transaction relied upon by the Government, but it is contended that the Government\u2019s evidence failed to show that the bag which was loaded from appellant\u2019s storeroom into the trunk of an automobile, which constituted the transaction under consideration, contained sugar. There was no direct evidence that it contained sugar, or what it contained, but we are of the opinion that the circumstantial evidence introduced by the Government was sufficient to take the case to the jury and to support the verdict. Circumstantial evidence, if strong enough to convince a jury of defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, is sufficient to sustain a verdict. Holland v. United States, 348 U.S. 121, 139-140, 75 S.Ct. 127, 99 L. Ed. 150; United States v. Comer, 6 Cir., 288 F.2d 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-24\">We find no prejudicial error in the admission of certain evidence, com-</p>\n<p id=\"b536-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>plained of by appellant. Nor were the instructions, considered in their entirety, such as to improperly cause the jurors to return a verdict of guilty. Allen v. United States, 164 U.S. 492, 501, 17 S.Ct. 154, 41 L.Ed. 528; Logsdon v. United States, 6 Cir., 253 F.2d 12, 15-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
