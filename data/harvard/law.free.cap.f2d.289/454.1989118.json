The Commissioner had found, <em>inter alia, </em>that after an argument arising in the course of decedent\u2019s employment in the employer\u2019s place of business between the employer\u2019s customer and the employee, a \u201cgunshot wound suffered by the employee was willfully inflicted upon him by the employer\u2019s customer because of his employment.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District Judge in granting summary judgment for the Commissioner has dealt adequately with this aspect of the case. National Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Britton, D.C.D.C.1960, 187 F.Supp. 359. It has further been argued before us that the Commissioner could not properly have found that a valid marital relationship had been established between the deceased employee and the claimant widow, and therefore the District Court had erred in sustaining the awards.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-21\">We are. satisfied that the findings do not lack support by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b502-13\">. Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 902 provides that the term \u201cinjury\u201d as used in the Act \u201cincludes an injury caused by the willful act of a third person directed against an employee because of his employment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
