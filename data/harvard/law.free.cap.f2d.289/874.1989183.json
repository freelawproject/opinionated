The sale of non-network time for national or regional advertising is known in the trade as \u201cnational spot sales,\u201d and the representatives who sell such time for individual stations as \u201cnational spot representatives.\u201d Such sales compete with those of network time offered by the networks.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-18\">The National Broadcasting Company (NBC) through its television network sells network time of its owned stations and of the stations which are not owned but are affiliated with the NBC network. NBC also acts as national spot representative in the sale of non-network time for its owned stations and for six of the independently owned stations affiliated with the NBC television net-, work. In these petitions NBC and four of the independently owned affiliates for whom it acts as national spot representative assert the regulation is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-19\">In the main, petitioners urge that (1) the Commission has no statutory authority to promulgate the regulation; (2) the regulation is an unreasonable exercise of the Commission\u2019s rule-making authority; and (3) the Commission is not justified in compelling \u201cdivestment\u201d of valuable existing contractual rights. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>We shall deal with these contentions separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">(1) We think it clear from National Broadcasting Co. v. United States, 1943, 319 U.S. 190, 63 S.Ct. 997, 87 L.Ed. 1344 that \u00a7 4(i) and subsections (f, g, i) of \u00a7 303 of the Communications Act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> provide statutory authority for the instant regulation. In that case, these provisions were held to authorize the Commission\u2019s chain broadcasting regulations forbidding certain practices which the Commission determined to be inimical to the public interest. Here the Commission made a similar determination based upon conclusions that \u201ca great many instances [exist] where the networks, because of their control over affiliation, can influence affiliates in their choice of spot representative and thus restrain competition and interfere with the independent responsibilities of the station licensees involved\u201d ;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that the networks\u2019 dual role in representing affiliates for sales of non-network national spot time as well as network time enables them \u201cto restrain competition between network and national spot television in a manner which can restrict the licensee\u2019s freedom and independence of action.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We cannot say that these conclusions, based upon findings supported by substantial evidence, were erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">(2) Nor can we agree that the regulation in dispute is unwarranted on the basis of petitioners\u2019 claim that its promulgation is rested merely on a potential evil of restraint upon the independent responsibilities of licensees affiliated with the network and not upon a violation of the antitrust laws. We need not decide whether the evil may fairly be characterized as \u201cpotential.\u201d For it is settled that practices which present realistic dangers of competitive restraint are a proper consideration for the Commission in determining the \u201cpublic interest, convenience, and necessity.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> National Broadcasting Co. v. United States, supra; Mansfield Journal Co. v. Federal Communications Comm., 1950, 86 U.S.App.D.C. 102, 180 F.2d 28. And the elimination of this danger is consistent with the Commission\u2019s duty under the Act to \u201cencourage the larger and more effective use of radio in the public interest.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b924-18\">(3) We must also reject petitioners\u2019 further contention that the regulation\u2019s requirement of \u201cdivestment\u201d of the existing national spot representation contracts with NBC is, in any event, unduly harsh since less drastic means are available to effectuate the Commission\u2019s policy determination. Alternatives proposed by the petitioners were considered and rejected by the Commission on the ground that they would require an excessive and impractical degree of day-today supervision. It also concluded that the alleged hardships of divestiture are far outweighed by the public interest in the remedy effected by the regulation. Since the Commission considered the alternatives presented and since we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>cannot say that the basis for their rejection is unreasonable, its action must stand.
