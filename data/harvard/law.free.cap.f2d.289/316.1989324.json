That company had a contract with the United Stat\u00e9s Steel Corporation for cleaning the windows in the corporation\u2019s building in Vandergrift, Pennsylvania. The injury suffered by the plaintiff took place while he was cleaning a window on the fourth floor of the building. His safety belt was supplied by his employer, not the Steel Corporation. He fell from a window sill when a lug of his safety belt slipped from the bolt on which it was put during the cleaning process. It was found after the accident that the lug had an opening of th of an inch whereas the standard size is %oth of an inch. At the close of all the evidence the trial judge directed a verdict for the defendant. It is agreed by the parties that the scope of the defendant\u2019s duties is accurately set out in Volume 2 of the Torts Restatement, Section 343. This rule has been adopted in Pennsylvania, Hon v. Percy A. Brown &amp; Co., 1955, 380 Pa. 191, 110 A.2d 375. The trial judge was correct in concluding that the plaintiff\u2019s case developed no liability on the part of the defendant under the rules stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b365-16\">. The jurisdiction of this action is founded on diversity of citizenship. The complaint was filed February 18, 1957. Section 1832 of 28 U.S.C. prior to the 1958 amendment applies. Cf. Kelly v. United States Steel Corp., 3 Cir., 1960, 284 F.2d 850.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
