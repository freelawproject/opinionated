While the panel adheres to its original view that this case was appropriate for summary calendar disposition, we also recognize that the concerns expressed by our colleague are reasonable, and that the appropriate course to follow when reasonable doubts are raised is to permit reconsideration which would eliminate those doubts.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-28\">Accordingly, we withdraw the opinion dated July 14, 1993, 995 F.2d 82; and instruct the clerk to withdraw the mandate issued herein; and classify this case as III for further consideration by an oral argument panel.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
