After a jury trial, he was convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of sixty-three months to be followed by a five-year term of supervised release. Garcia appeals his conviction. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-10\">In August 1990, Texas authorities in San Antonio began surveillance of Alejos Garcia and numerous other individuals who were suspected to be marijuana traffickers. In particular, the authorities observed various activities in and around a particular house in San Antonio. The authorities observed Ale-jos Garcia and another man, Carlos Garcia,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> go in and out of the residence. Appellant and Carlos Garcia were eventually approached by police officers at a location other than the residence. According to police, when questioned, appellant appeared quite nervous and told numerous falsehoods regarding his prior activities. Appellant consented to a search of his automobile. Police found traces of marijuana scattered all over the trunk of the car. Appellant was at that point arrested. Police also recovered a pager and $1,000 in cash from his person.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-13\">The police then transported appellant and Carlos Garcia to a location where surveillance officers had observed the two men park a truck. Carlos Garcia admitted that the truck belonged to him. A search revealed that marijuana and wood chips were scattered in the truck. Police then searched the aforementioned residence. There police discovered a number of large wooden crates containing wood chips similar to the type found in Carlos Garcia\u2019s truck. One of those crates contained several bundles of marijuana wrapped in plastic. Other bundles were located throughout the house. A total of 250 pounds of marijuana was seized by police.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-14\">At trial, the owner of the house, Norma Satterlund, testified that Matilde Benavides, one of Garcia\u2019s co-conspirators, had approached Satterlund and offered to pay her if she would permit Benavides to store marijuana at her house. On several occasions, Sat-terlund testified, Benavides and other men would bring crates of marijuana to be stored at her house. According to Satterlund, the men would employ a legitimate packing company to ship the crates to San Antonio, but would use fictitious names on the shipping documents.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Satterlund testified that she observed Alejos Garcia at her house on several occasions and that, in particular, Garcia was present during conversations about marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-16\">A. Speedy Trial Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b664-17\">A grand jury in San Antonio, Texas, indicted Garcia and his co-defendants on November 28, 1990, for conspiring to possess marijuana with the intent to distribute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Garcia was not arrested until almost a year later, on November 20, 1991. On December 17,1991, Garcia waived his right to personal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>ly appear at his arraignment. His trial was scheduled to occur on April 6, 1992. On April 3, 1992, Garcia moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that he was denied a speedy trial. The district court denied this motion. Almost seventeen months later, on April 13, 1992, Garcia\u2019s trial began. Garcia argues that the district court erred in not dismissing the indictment on the ground that the Government denied Garcia his right to a speedy trial under Rule 48(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(c)(1),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">i) \u00a7 3161(c)(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">The Government, in its response to Garcia\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment, conceded that sixty-nine days had passed between the date of Garcia\u2019s non-appearance at his arraignment,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> December 19, 1991, and the proposed date of trial, April 6, 1992. Garcia argues that the time between his arrest on November 20, 1991,'and the arraignment on December 19, 1991, should be also counted in calculating whether \u00a7 3161(c)(l)\u2019s seventy-day period was exceeded by the Government. We disagree. When an indicts ment precedes an arresC \u2014 as occurred in Garcia\u2019s case \u2014 the first appearance before a judicial officer of the court in which the indictment has been filed is the triggering event. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(c)(1). ' In this ease, therefore, the time between Garcia\u2019s arrest and his non-appearance at the arraignment should be excluded in computing the seventy-day period.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Although the trial was scheduled to occur on April 6, 1991, the district .court granted the Government a one-week continuance, which tolled \u00a7 3161(c)(l)\u2019s seventy-day clock during the period of the continuance. According to Garcia, the continuance was unjustified and, thus, wrongly extended \u00a7 3161(c)(l)\u2019s time-period beyond seventy days. The Government appeared at docket call on Friday, April 3, 1992, and announced ready for trial to commence the following Monday. On April 6, however, the Government announced to the district court that it had discovered over the weekend that an essential witness was unavailable to testify. The Government requested a continuance to secure the presence of the witness. An evi-dentiary hearing was held on the Government\u2019s motion, and the district court granted a one-week continuance of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-10\">Any period of delay resulting from the absence or unavailability of an \u201cessential witness\u201d is excluded in computing the seventy-day period. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(h)(3)(A). An essential witness shall be considered absent \u201cwhen his whereabouts are unknown and, in addition, he is attempting to avoid apprehension or prosecution or his whereabouts cannot be determined by due diligence.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(h)(3)(B). Ralph Sramek, the law enforcement officer who had been in charge of securing the Government\u2019s witnesses, testified that his procedure for communicating with Norma Satterlund had been by leaving a phone message at her residence with a relative and then receiving a return call from Satterlund.' Prior to April 3, 1992, Sramek had not experienced any difficulty in having Satterlund return his calls. During the week prior to April 3, Sramek spoke with Satterlund on three separate days. On Thursday, April 2, Sramek made arrangements with Satterlund to meet on the following day, Friday, April 3, in San Antonio, Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>During their April 2 conversation, Satter-lund informed Sramek that she had been continuously receiving a great deal of pressure not to cooperate with the Government following her testimony at the trial of Ma-tilde Benavides, a coconspirator. According to Sramek, Satterlund claimed that her house had been \u201cshot up\u201d with a firearm and that her car had been set on fire. She nevertheless told Sramek that she would appear on April 3 in San Antonio to testify at Garcia\u2019s trial. After Satterlund failed to appear at the appointment scheduled for the afternoon of April 3, Sramek attempted to contact her on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, but Satter-lund never returned the calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">In granting the Government\u2019s motion to continue the trial for one week, the district court explicitly found that Satterlund was unavailable and impliedly found that she was an \u201cessential witness\u201d for purposes of the Speedy Trial Act. We believe that the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting the Government\u2019s motion for a continuance. Accordingly, there was no violation of the Speedy Trial Act because the trial took place within the seventy-day period.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">ii) \u25a0 The Sixth Amendment</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Garcia further argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the indictment because, as he alleges, he was denied a speedy trial as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Sixth-Amendment right to a speedy trial attaches at the time of arrest or indictment, whichever comes first, and continues until the date of trial. <em>United States v. Walters, </em>591 F.2d 1195, 1200 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>442 U.S. 945, 99 S.Ct. 2892, 61 L.Ed.2d 317 (1979). Constitutional speedy-trial claims are resolved by examining the following four factors: (i) the length of the delay; (ii) the reason for the delay; (iii) when the defendant asserted his right; and (iv) the prejudice to the defendant resulting from the delay. <em>See Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514, 530, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 2192, 33 L.Ed.2d 101 (1972). In assessing prejudice, a court should look to the following three policies behind the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of a speedy trial: (i) preventing oppressive pretrial incarceration; (ii) minimizing a defendant\u2019s anxiety and concern; and (iii) assuring that a delay does not impair the defense. <em>See Millard v. Lynaugh, </em>810 F.2d 1403, 1406 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 838, 108 S.Ct. 122, 98 L.Ed.2d 81 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">The first <em>Barker </em>factor \u2014 whether the delay is of sufficient length to be deemed \u201cpresumptively prejudicial,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1406 \u2014 is a threshold consideration. In this case, the delay from the time of the first formal federal charge, November 20, 1990, to the date of trial, April 13, 1992, was almost seventeen months. This court has ruled that a thirteen-month delay between indictment and trial is \u201cpresumptively prejudicial.\u201d <em>See Davis v. Puckett, </em>857 F.2d 1035, 1040-41 (5th Cir.1988). Accordingly, the delay in this case was also \u201cpresumptively prejudicial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">Therefore, we turn to the other <em>Barker </em>factors: the reason for the delay, the point at which the defendant asserted his rights, and the prejudice (if any) to the defendant resulting from the delay. <em>See Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 530, 92 S.Ct. at 2192. The principal reason for the delay resulted from the Government\u2019s inability to apprehend Garcia, who was believed to be located in Laredo, Texas. During the hearing on Garcia\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment, Sergeant Sramek testified concerning the efforts by the Govern^ ment to locate and arrest Garcia. According to Sramek, he informed narcotics officers in Laredo, Texas, of the pending warrant for Garcia\u2019s arrest. Furthermore, \u201con numerous occasions,\u201d Sramek testified, he telephoned the narcotics officers in Laredo and requested them to look for Garcia. The officers in Laredo would then report back to Sramek regarding their lack of success. The evidence reflects that the delay in arresting Garcia was not caused by the Government\u2019s lack of diligence. In addition, once Garcia was arrested, there was no significant delay in commencing trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">With respect to the next <em>Barker </em>factor, Garcia did not complain about any trial delay until April 3,1992, when he filed a motion to dismiss the indictment. In addition, on February 27, 1992, Garcia himself moved to continue the trial. With respect to the final <em>Barker </em>factor, Garcia argues that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>prejudiced by the delay because his key witness was unable to recall accurately \u201cevents of the distant past.\u201d The record, however, does not indicate that the Government attempted any deliberate dilatory tactics in order to hamper the defense, which militates against a finding of prejudice. <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 531, 92 S.Ct. at 2192. Finally, we observe that Garcia has not alleged that he was subjected to oppressive pretrial incarceration or that he was anxious or concerned while awaiting trial. Indeed, he would be hard pressed to make such an argument in view of the fact that he was at large for an entire year following the return of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\">Taking into account all of the <em>Barker </em>factors, we believe that Garcia has failed to show that his constitutional right to a speedy trial was violated. The district court, therefore, did not err in denying Garcia\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment on constitutional grounds.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">B. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"A_V\">Garcia contends that the only evidence to support the conviction was \u201cimpeached testimony from Norma Satterlund,\u201d an accomplice witness. In addressing a claim of insufficient evidence, we must ask \u201c \u2018whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019\u201d <em>Guzman v. Lensing, </em>934 F.2d 80, 82 (5th Cir.1991) (citing <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">In effect, Garcia is arguing that the evidence is constitutionally insufficient because Satterlund should not have been believed. This court, however, is concerned only with the sufficiency \u2014 not the weight \u2014 of evidence. <em>See United States v. Greenwood, </em>974 F.2d 1449, 1458 (5th Cir.1992) (\u201cwhether judges doubt the credibility of a witness, even an accomplice witness cooperating with the Government, is beside the point in reviewing a sufficiency claim such as this\u201d). The credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence is the exclusive province of the jury. <em>Id. </em>Particularly in view of the corroborating evidence in this case, <em>see supra </em>Part I, we believe that a rational jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that Garcia was a member of the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">C. Alleged Hearsay Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b667-10\">Finally, Garcia argues that Satterlund\u2019s testimony regarding Garcia getting paid by a co-conspirator was improperly admitted. Satterlund\u2019s testimony reflects that she heard a discussion in which one of the co-conspirators demanded money to pay himself and others, including Garcia. At trial, Garcia failed to object to this testimony on hearsay grounds. If there is no contemporaneous objection to testimony whose admissibility is contested on appeal, the \u201cplain error\u201d standard of review applies. <em>See United States v. Lechuga, </em>888 F.2d 1472, 1480 (5th Cir.1989). In order to constitute plain error, the error must have been so fundamental as to have resulted in a miscarriage of justice. <em>Id. </em>A statement by a eoeonspirator made \u201cduring the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy\u201d is not hearsay. Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). Statements regarding the payment of money, for services rendered in accomplishing the illegal goals of a conspiracy can be considered to be \u201cin the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy.\u201d <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>664 F.2d 94, 98-99 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 854, 103 S.Ct. 121, 74 L.Ed.2d 106 (1981); <em>United States v. McGuire, </em>608 F.2d 1028, 1032-33 (5th Cir. 1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1092, 100 S.Ct. 1060, 62 L.Ed.2d 782 (1980). Thus, there was no error in admitting the testimony, plain or otherwise.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM Garcia\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b664-11\">. The record does not indicate whether the two Garcias are related.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b664-12\">. A representative of the shipping company, Basse Truck Lines, testified at trial and corroborated Satterlund's testimony about the defendants' employment of the shipping company, which was unaware of the illicit product that was being shipped.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b664-18\">.A superseding indictment was returned by the grand jury on April 24, 1991, although the superseding indictment simply added charges against Garcia\u2019s co-defendants and in no way altered the original charges against Garcia.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b665-7\">. Rule 48(b) provides, in pertinent part, that \"if there is an unnecessary delay in bringing the defendant to trial, the court may dismiss the indictment, information or complaint.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b665-8\">. Section 3161(c)(1) provides that a trial \"shall commence <em>within seventy days </em>from the filing date (and making public) of the information or indictment, <em>or </em>from the date the defendant has appeared before a judicial officer of the court in which such charge is pending, whichever date last occurs\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b665-11\">. The Sixth Amendment provides a defendant with a right to a \"speedy trial.\u201d <em>See Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 33 L.Ed.2d 101 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b665-12\">. Because Garcia waived his right to appear at his arraignment, we must treat his waiver as tantamount to a first appearance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b667-7\">. Because there was nothing approaching a Sixth Amendment violation in this case, we likewise believe that there was no violation of Rule 48(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. This court has held that Rule 48(b) does not <em>require </em>dismissal absent a Sixth Amendment violation, <em>see United States v. Hitt, </em>622 F.2d 900, 908 (5th Cir.1980), and that a district court has extremely broad discretion regarding whether to dismiss under Rule 48(b), <em>see United States v. Novelli, </em>544 F.2d 800, 803 (5th Cir. 1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b667-14\">. We note that Garcia\u2019s attorney makes a reference in Garcia's appellate brief to alleged \"outrageous conduct\u201d by the Government in this case. Because of Garcia\u2019s counsel\u2019s failure to ade<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>quately articulate his argument, we are unable to assess this claim. However, our independent review of the record reveals no such misconduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
