Young appeals the district court affirmance of the bankruptcy court\u2019s ruling that his debt to National Union Fire Insurance Co. of Pittsburgh, Pa. was nondis-chargeable. National Union cross-appeals the vacating and remand of an award of attorney\u2019s fees. We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-10\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b654-11\">Young\u2019s indebtedness to National Union arises from his investment in a Texas limited partnership known as Emerald Park Apartments, Ltd. (the \u201cPartnership\u201d). To purchase his interest, Young executed a promissory note to the Partnership in the principal amount of $92,500. To secure payment of their notes Young and other Partnership investors applied to National Union for a financial guarantee bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-12\">National Union required Young to execute the following documents: an \u201cInvestor Application \u2014 Financial Guarantee Bond for Limited Partnerships,\u201d an \u201cIndemnification and Pledge Agreement,\u201d and a supplemental application which stated that there had. been no material adverse change in his financial condition and that the financial information previously submitted remained true and correct. Young attached a financial statement to his application. On the strength of this data, National Union issued the requested bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-16\">Young defaulted on the note. National Union paid the defaulted note and looked to Young for indemnity, securing a state court judgment against him. Young filed for bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-17\">National Union asked the bankruptcy court for an order that Young\u2019s debt was nondischargeable under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(2)(B) because it was based on a materially false written statement of Young\u2019s financial condition. Following a trial, the bankruptcy court found the debt nondis-chargeable and awarded National Union $6,125 in attorney\u2019s fees. Young appealed to the district court, challenging the nondis-ehargeability determination and the bankruptcy court\u2019s factual conclusions that he had made intentional misrepresentations and that National Union reasonably had relied upon them. He also appealed the award of attorney\u2019s fees. The district' court affirmed the nondischargeability and vacated and remanded for additional findings on the attorney\u2019s fees. Young and National Union appeal the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-18\">\n<em>Analysis.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b654-19\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b654-20\">A bankruptcy court\u2019s findings of fact are subject to the clearly erroneous standard of review and will be reversed only if, considering all the evidence, we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Strict application of this standard is particularly appropriate when the district court has affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s findings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We are particularly mindful of \u201cthe opportunity of the bankruptcy court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Conclusions of law, of course, are reviewed <em>de novo.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-21\">\n<em>Nondischargeability</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b654-22\">A debt may be nondischargeable in bankruptcy under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(2)(B):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-23\">(2) ... to the extent obtained by\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>(B) use of a statement in writing\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-4\">(i) that is materially false;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-5\">(ii) respecting the debtor\u2019s or an insider\u2019s financial condition;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-6\">(iii) on which the creditor to whom the debtor is liable for such money, property, services, or credit reasonably relied; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-7\">(iv) that the debtor caused to be made or published with intent to deceived]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">The burden is on the creditor to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the debt is nondischargeable.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">Admitting that much of the financial information submitted to National Union was false, Young contends that he did not make those false representations. He testified that he filled out an application and submitted it to the Partnership, but someone else substituted false information in the application which was submitted to National Union.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He also contends that, although it is in his handwriting, he did not give the Partnership the financial statement included with the application; he claims a complete lack of knowledge about how the financial statement got into the packet of materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">The bankruptcy court, after hearing several hours of testimony, found: \u201cI find not credible Mr. Young\u2019s claim that he did not do most of the pages which are in [the application], and did not cause them to be delivered to National Union.\u201d The district court found that this finding was not clearly erroneous. Our review of the trial testimony persuades that the bankruptcy court\u2019s finding was not clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Having determined that Young submitted false financial information, his \u201cintent to deceive may be inferred from use of a false financial statement to obtain credit.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> '</p>\n<p id=\"b655-15\">Young also challenges the bankruptcy court\u2019s finding that National Union reasonably relied on his financial information. We recently have determined that the reasonableness of a creditor\u2019s reliance, for purposes of section 523(a)(2)(B), is a question of fact subject to review only for clear error.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The bankruptcy court received uncontroverted testimony that the relevant practice in the industry was to rely solely on the documentation presented by the applicant. Whether a creditor\u2019s reliance is reasonable is to be determined from the totality of the circumstances.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The only purportedly questionable circumstance Young points to is the existence of whiteouts and handwritten additions to the financial statement, most of which was typed. This is not such a \u201cred flag\u201d as to invoke a duty to investigate. All things considered, we are not left with the definite and firm conviction that the bankruptcy court made a mistake in finding that National Union reasonably relied on the financial information in Young\u2019s application, or in its ultimate conclusion that Young\u2019s debt was nondischargeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-16\">\n<em>Attorney\u2019s Fees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b655-17\">The bankruptcy court awarded National Union $6,125 in attorney\u2019s fees based upon the indemnity agreement provision that the debtor would be liable therefor. The district court vacated that award and re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>manded for additional fact findings required by New York law.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">Under New York law, when a contract provides for attorney\u2019s fees, \u201cthe court will order the losing .party to pay whatever amounts have been expended by the prevailing party, so long as those' amounts are not unreasonable.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The court\u2019s determination whether the fees requested are reasonable is informed by various factors, including: \u201cthe difficulty of the questions involved; the skill required to handle the problem; the time and labor required; the lawyer\u2019s experience, ability and reputation; the customary fee charged by the Bar for similar services; and the amount involved.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">National Union\u2019s attorneys estimated their expenses to be $30,000. They presented evidence of the time and various types of work performed in this litigation, as well as evidence about their general level of experience. Thereafter, the bankruptcy court made the following findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-6\">I\u2019m taking an extremely conservative view of the attorneys\u2019 fees which might be appropriate in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-7\">Noting that the amount of time spent with regard to participation in this trial will clock in at a minimum of about ten hours, including the activity yesterday and today. And granting twenty-five hours for preparation, which I believe to be low, considering the extremely high degree of preparation exhibited by the plaintiffs in this case, but again taking a conservative view.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQfc\">And conservatively allowing $175 per hour. I am familiar with attorneys\u2019 rates in this region and in the bankruptcy field, and believe that to be a reasonable if somewhat low hourly fee to be awarded for the degree of competence, which was high, exhibited by plaintiffs counsel in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">This yields a total amount of $6,125. We find that this reflects sufficient consideration of the factors required under New York law. In fact, the bankruptcy court\u2019s approach mirrors the \u201clodestar\u201d method approved in <em>Krear </em>\u2014 \u201cthe hours reasonably spent by counsel, as determined by the Court, [are] multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The determination that $6,125 is a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-13\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the determination of nondischargeability, REVERSE the order regarding attorney\u2019s fees, and REINSTATE the bankruptcy court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $6,125.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b654-13\">. <em>In re Allison, </em>960 F.2d 481 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b654-14\">. <em>Wilson v.

Young contends that the bankruptcy court improperly relied upon inconsistencies between his trial testimony and testimony about the application documents given at a deposition in 1988.. In the 1988 deposition, Young offered explanations for information on the application which he now disavows ever having made. He asserts that because he was uncounseled when he gave the deposition, the court should not have relied on that testimony. There is no rubric requiring a court to ignore sworn prior inconsistent testimony simply because it was uncounseled; we decline to create one. The bankruptcy court, having heard all the testimony, was in the best position to evaluate Young\u2019s credibility and we find no clear error in that credibility assessment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b655-18\">. <em>In re Pryor, </em>93 B.R. 517, 518 (Bankr.S.D.Tex. 1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b655-19\">. <em>In re Coston, </em>991 F.2d 257 (5th Cir.1993) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b655-20\">. <em>Coston.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b656-10\">.
