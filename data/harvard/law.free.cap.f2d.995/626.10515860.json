Contending that Lindsey did not meet Chapter 12\u2019s eligibility requirements, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) moved for relief from the automatic stay against property of the estate and for dismissal of the ease. The bankruptcy court granted FDIC\u2019s motions. Lindsey appealed to the district court, which affirmed. Lindsey now appeals the district court\u2019s judgment to this court. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-31\">I. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b732-32\">Since 1982 Lindsey has been a family partnership whose principal business consists of grain farming and leasing. On September 16, 1985, Lindsey\u2019s partners executed a non-recourse note to Panhandle Bank &amp; Trust Company for the principal amount of $1,069,-612.17. As with any nonrecourse obligation, the note limited possible remedies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-33\">The undersigned shall not be personally liable for the payment ... it being understood that the payee shall look only to the collateral as and to the extent provided by those certain Deeds of Trust and Security Agreements entered into by the under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>signed and PANHANDLE BANK &amp; TRUST COMPANY....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">The collateral on the note included partnership property located in Hutchinson, Randall and Deaf Smith Counties, Texas. When Panhandle failed in December, 1986, FDIC was appointed as its receiver and subsequently purchased the note in its corporate capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">In February, 1988, Lindsey made its last payment on the note. FDIC commenced a judicial foreclosure action in September, 1990. Three months later Lindsey filed for Chapter 12 protection. Its creditors at the time included only FDIC and taxing entities. This appeal focuses entirely on Lindsey\u2019s obligation to FDIC.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">In bankruptcy court, FDIC contended that Lindsey does not qualify for Chapter 12 protection. Under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(18)(B)(ii), in order to qualify for Chapter 12 protection, a partnership must have no more than $1,500,-000 of aggregate debt. Moreover, at least eighty percent of the debt must arise from farming operations. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(18)(B)(ii). At trial the parties stipulated that the remaining balance on the FDIC note exceeded $1,500,000. The parties also stipulated that more than twenty percent of the balance due on the note arose from nonfarming' operations. The proceedings then focused on whether a nonrecourse note should be included in. the calculation of aggregate debt.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The bankruptcy court held that Lindsey\u2019s total debt did inel\u00fcde the FDIC note and accordingly granted relief from the stay and dismissed the case. Lindsey appealed to the district court, which affirmed. Lindsey now appeals the district court\u2019s decision to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">Lindsey contends that principles of statutory interpretation compel the conclusion that nonrecourse obligations should be excluded from the calculation of the aggregate debt of parties seeking Chapter 12 protection. The argument hinges on the Bankruptcy Code\u2019s definition of \u201cdebt\u201d as \u201cliability on a claim.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(12). Because the FDIC note stipulates no \u201cpersonal liability,\u201d Lindsey argues that there is no \u201cliability on [the] claim\u201d and therefore no \u201cdebt.\u201d If the FDIC note does not qualify as \u201cdebt\u201d under the Bankruptcy Code, then it should not be calculated in Lindsey\u2019s aggregate debt. Lindsey would then qualify for Chapter 12 protection, as long as at least eighty percent of its remaining debt arose from farming operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-11\">This appeal raises a question of law. The parties have stipulated the amount of the note and the percentage arising from farm operations. We must determine only the legal issue of whether nonrecourse notes qualify as \u2018fdebt\u201d under the Bankruptcy Code. We accordingly review the case <em>de novo. In re Missionary Baptist Foundation of America, </em>712 F.2d- 206, 209 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-12\">A. The FDIC note as a \u201cclaim\u201d under the</p>\n<p id=\"b733-13\">Bankruptcy Code</p>\n<p id=\"b733-14\">It is undeniable, as Lindsey \u201creadily agrees,\u201d that the FDIC note constitutes a \u201cclaim\u201d for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Code. Under the Code, \u201cclaim\u201d means:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-15\">(A) right to payment, whether or not such right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured, or unsecured; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-16\">(B) right to an equitable remedy for breach of performance if such breach gives rise to a right of payment, whether or not such right to an equitable remedy is reduced to judgment, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, secured, or unsecured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-17\">11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(5). Nonrecourse notes clearly fall within this definition. At the very least, a creditor\u2019s right 'to act against collateral is a \u201cright to an equitable remedy\u201d for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>debtor\u2019s breach of obligation. Moreover, the Bankruptcy Code explicitly incorporates non-recourse loans as \u201cclaims.\u201d It provides that a \u201cclaim against the debtor\u201d includes a \u201cclaim against property of the debtor.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(2). The legislative history of the Code emphasizes that bankruptcy claims include nonrecourse loans:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-4\">This paragraph [\u00a7 102(2) ] is intended to cover nonrecourse loan agreements where the creditor\u2019s only rights are against property of the debtor, and not against the debtor personally. Thus, such an agreement would give rise to a claim that would be treated as a claim against the debtor personally, for the purposes of the bankruptcy code.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">H.R.Rep. No. 595, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 315-16 (1977); S.Rep. No. 989, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 27-28 (1978). As established by the above language, the FDIC note patently constitutes a \u201cclaim\u201d under the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Recent Supreme Court decisions support the interpretation of nonrecourse loans as \u201cclaims.\u201d In <em>Pennsylvania Dept of Public Welfare v. Davenport, </em>495 U.S. 552, 110 S.Ct. 2126, 109 L.Ed.2d 588 (1990), the Court concluded that Congress intended to adopt the broadest possible definition of the term \u201cclaim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 558, 110 S.Ct. at 2130. More specifically, the Court has held that a mortgage interest, <em>as a kind of nonrecourse loan, </em>constitutes a \u201cclaim\u201d for bankruptcy purposes. <em>Johnson v. Home State Bank, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 111 S.Ct. 2150, 2155, 115 L.Ed.2d 66 (1991) (emphasis added). We therefore conclude that the FDIC nonre-course note undeniably qualifies as a \u201cclaim\u201d under the Bankruptcy Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">B. The FDIC note as a \u201cdebt\u201d under the Bankruptcy Code</p>\n<p id=\"b734-10\">Lindsey argues that although the FDIC note is a \u201cclaim,\u201d it is not a \u201cdebt,\u201d as \u201cclaim\u201d and \u201cdebt\u201d are distinguishable under the Bankruptcy Code. To support its assertion, Lindsey first points to the Code\u2019s definition of \u201cdebt\u201d as \u201cliability on a claim.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(12). It then contends that because nonrecourse claims stipulate no personal liability, they do not qualify as \u201cdebt.\u201d To support its conclusion, Lindsey relies heavily on <em>In re Lands, </em>85 B.R. 83 (Bankr. E.D.Ark.1988), in which the court excluded from its calculation of aggregate debt a non-recourse note which the parties seeking Chapter 12 relief had not themselves executed, but which nonetheless encumbered their land.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-12\">We disagree with the argument that, by definition, nonrecourse notes do not constitute \u201cdebt.\u201d The <em>Lands </em>case is not apposite for two reasons. First, the parties there were not the makers of the nonrecourse note. In this case, by contrast, Lindsey executed the FDIC note. Moreover, <em>Lands </em>predates two Supreme Court decisions which interpret \u201cclaim\u201d and \u201cdebt\u201d as coextensive. The Supreme Court has determined that under the plain language doctrine, there is no distinction between \u201cdebt\u201d and \u201cclaim\u201d for the purpose of the Bankruptcy Code:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-13\">Our construction of the term \u201cdebt\u201d is guided by the fundamental canon that statutory interpretation begins with the language of the statute itself.... [T]he Bankruptcy Code defines \u201cdebt\u201d as a \u201cliability on a claim.\u201d This definition reveals . Congress\u2019 intent that the meanings of \u201cdebt\u201d and \u201cclaim\u201d be coextensive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-14\"><em>Davenport, </em>495 U.S. at 557-58, 110 S.Ct. at 2130 (citation omitted); <em>see also Johnson, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-n. 5, 111 S.Ct. at 2154 n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-15\">The legislative history of the Code further weakens Lindsey\u2019s contention that \u201cdebt\u201d and \u201cclaim\u201d are distinguishable: \u201cThe terms \u2018debt\u2019 and \u2018claim\u2019 are coextensive: a creditor has a \u2018claim\u2019 against the debtor; the debtor owes a \u2018debt\u2019 to'the creditor.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 595, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 310 (1977); S.Rep. No. 989, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 23 (1978). Because FDIC undeniably has a \u201cclaim\u201d against Lindsey, as established above, the FDIC note constitutes part of Lindsey\u2019s \u201cdebt.\u201d We agree with both the bankruptcy court and the district court that the note should be included in Lindsey\u2019s aggregate debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-16\">Lindsey attempts to distinguish <em>Davenport </em>and <em>Johnson </em>on the grounds that neither specifically applies to Chapter 12 eligibility. However, the Code defines \u201cclaim\u201d and \u201cdebt\u201d for the purposes of the entire title, not individual sections. Chapter 12 itself does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>not redefine either term for the sake of its eligibility requirements. We accordingly reject Lindsey\u2019s argument. Moreover, even if it appeared that in some circumstances \u201cclaim\u201d could have a broader meaning than \u201cdebt\u201d for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Code, we would not base the distinction purely on recourse/nonrecourse grounds. The Code defines \u201cdebt\u201d as \u201cliability on a claim,\u201d not <em>\u201c'personal\u201d </em>liability on a claim. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(12). \u201cPersonal liability\u201d is a subeategory of \u201cliability.\u201d Although a nonre-course note stipulates no personal liability,- it <em>does </em>impose a legal obligation. If the maker of the note fails to meet that obligation, the note holder has a remedy in the form of action against the collateral specified for the loan. Despite the fact that the remedy is limited, assuming the note is valid, it is legally enforceable. Even under this more liberal reading of Lindsey\u2019s arguments, then, we conclude that the FDIC note composes part of the partnership\u2019s aggregate debt and disqualifies it from Chapter 12 relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">For the foregoing reasons we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b733-9\">. FDIC also argued that more than twenty percent of Lindsey\u2019s obligations beyond the note in question arose from non-farming operations. Because both the bankruptcy court and the district court held that Lindsey's aggregate debt included the FDIC note, neither addressed the issue of whether the remaining debt (taxes amounting to substantially less than $1,500,000) derived from non-farming operations. In view of our discussion here, we too find no need for further examination of the issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
