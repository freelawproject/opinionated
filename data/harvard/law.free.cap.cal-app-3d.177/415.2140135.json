Minor failed to submit any payment. Many attempts were made in 1984 to persuade minor to honor his restitution obligations, all of which failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">A supplemental petition filed on October 31, 1984, alleged that minor came within the provisions of Welfare and Institutions Code section 777, subdivision (a),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in that he violated probation by failing to pay restitution as previously ordered by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Ultimately, Angel admitted the allegations of the supplemental petition, and he was committed to the California Youth Authority (CYA) for a period not to exceed four years, less four hundred fifty-seven days credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">In 1982 at the time the restitution order herein was made, section 731 authorized the juvenile court to order a ward to pay restitution as part of his rehabilitation. (See also \u00a7\u00a7 729.6 and 730.6 added by Stats. 1983, ch. 940, \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4, respectively.)</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">While juvenile court proceedings are not criminal proceedings (\u00a7 203), \u201cthe \u2018 \u201ccivil\u201d label-of-convenience\u2019 <em>(In re Gault, </em>387 U.S. 1, 50 [18 L.Ed.2d 527, 558, 87 S.Ct. 1428]) cannot obscure the quasi-criminal nature of juvenile proceedings, involving as they often do the possibility of a substantial loss of personal freedom.\u201d <em>(Joe Z. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 797, 801 [91 Cal.Rptr. 594, 478 P.2d 26]; <em>In re Brian S. </em>(1982) 130 Cal.App.3d 523, 529, fn. 2 [181 Cal.Rptr. 778].) As in <em>In re Brian S., </em>for purposes of our discussion, the restitution order must be deemed part of the quasi-criminal nature of juvenile proceedings. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">Since a possible result of a supplementary proceeding under section 777 is that of commitment to CYA (as, indeed, happened in the instant case), the proceeding must meet the constitutional due process standards of criminal proceedings. <em>(In re Donna G. </em>(1970) 6 Cal.App.3d 890, 894 [86 Cal.Rptr. 421].) Section <em>111 </em>requires the supplemental petition to contain \u201c. . . a concise statement of facts sufficient to support the conclusion that the previous disposition has not been effective in the rehabilitation or protection of the minor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>The only facts alleged in the instant supplemental petition were that Angel had failed to pay restitution in the amount of $285.24 by August 14, 1984, as previously ordered by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">At the dispositional hearing held on April 24, 1985, the juvenile judge stated: \u201cThe Court: Well, I believe that one has to earn trust. What Angel has done here, and his background is committing two burglaries that we know of\u2014he has failed to pay restitution and he failed to report to his probation officer. He failed to appear for a revocation hearing that was scheduled that he was aware of. He finally gets caught prowling on school grounds. He has done poorly in school and he\u2019s been to the Kern Youth Facility twice and Camp Irwin Owen once. Because of assault of [sz'c] conduct at Camp Owen they don\u2019t want him back up there. With that kind of background Angel, you have not earned the trust of this Court to give you the kind of chance that you are asking for here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">In committing Angel to CYA it is apparent the court relied on many factual matters which were not alleged in the supplemental petition nor adjudicated, e.g., (1) \u201che failed to report to his probation officer,\u201d (2) \u201cHe failed to appear for a revocation hearing that was scheduled that he was aware of,\u201d (3) \u201cHe finally gets caught prowling on school grounds,\u201d (4) \u201cHe has done poorly in school,\u201d and (5) \u201cBecause of assault of [sz'c] conduct at Camp Owen . . . .\u201d This was error. While these matters were contained in the probation officer\u2019s reports, \u201cif the court were to consider the <em>facts </em>contained in those reports, due process, and section <em>111, </em>require that they be at least summarized in the petition and regularly proven at the hearing.\u201d <em>(In re Donna G., supra, </em>6 Cal.App.3d at p. 895.)</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">In support of the CYA commitment, plaintiff lists as a proper factor for the court\u2019s consideration the fact that \u201cthree separate Camp Erwin Owen spokesmen \u2018emphatically requested th\u00e1t the minor not be considered for a second commitment there, as he was considered assaultive, possessing limited intelligence and believed to be gang oriented.\u2019\u201d However, not only were these matters not set forth in the supplemental petition, there was no factual basis in the probation report or anywhere in the record upon which the juvenile court could rely to accept the opinion that minor was assaultive, of limited intelligence and gang oriented. Indeed, although the probation officer also believed the minor was prone to involvement in gang activity, he conceded that \u201c[tjhus far, there is no documented evidence to support this opinion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">Plaintiff also relies on the probation officer\u2019s conclusion in his report stating, \u201cIt is this officer\u2019s opinion that the minor has learned little or nothing from counseling and supervision provided by agencies, institutions, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>individuals on the county level during what has already been a lengthy period of probationary status. Angel continues to exhibit contempt and disregard for court orders and is suspected of ongoing delinquent activity, including street gang involvement.\u201d Again, there is no factual basis for the probation officer\u2019s suspicion of ongoing delinquent activity, to the extent he refers to criminal conduct if committed by an adult, or gang involvement. As to the former, it appears that the juvenile court may have relied on the probation officer\u2019s speculation. In stating grounds for the CYA commitment, the court stated, \u201c[minor\u2019s] background is committing two burglaries <em>that we know of. . . </em>.\u201d Since no facts were established to support the probation officer\u2019s suspicions, it was improper for the court to rely on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">It thus appears that the only factual finding which could arguably support the section 777 adjudication and the subsequent commitment of Angel to CYA was his failure to pay restitution as previously ordered by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Subdivision (e) of section 730.6 provides in pertinent part: \u201cHowever, probation shall not be revoked for failure of a person to make restitution pursuant to Section 729.6 as a condition of probation unless the court determines that the person has willfully failed to pay or failed to make sufficient bona fide efforts to legally acquire the resources to pay.\u201d In the instant case, there was no finding by the juvenile court that Angel \u201chas willfully failed to pay or failed to make sufficient bona fide efforts to legally acquire the resources to pay\u201d restitution as ordered.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Furthermore, even absent subdivision (e) of section 730.6, without a finding that the failure was willful, a finding that Angel violated his probation by failing to pay restitution as ordered and his subsequent commitment to CYA for that reason would be violative of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \u201cAn indigent defendant cannot be imprisoned because of his inability to pay a fine, even though the fine be imposed as a condition of probation.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kay </em>(1973) 36 Cal.App.3d 759, 763 [111 Cal.Rptr. 894, 73 A.L.R.3d 1235], citing <em>In re Antazo </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 100, 116 [89 Cal.Rptr. 255, 473 P.2d 999].)</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>In this context, an order to pay restitution as a condition of probation is no ditferent than an order to pay a fine. (See <em>In re Brian S., supra, </em>130 Cal.App.3d 523, 532.)</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">By admitting the allegations of the supplemental petition Angel admitted only the factual allegation that he had failed to pay restitution as previously ordered by the court. As we have noted, this admission was legally insufficient to support a finding that he had violated the terms of his probation. The additional factual matters relied upon by the court to support its order committing Angel to CYA were neither alleged in the supplemental petition nor adjudicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Under these circumstances, the order sustaining the section 777 petition must be, and is, set aside and the commitment order appealed from is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">Martin, Acting P. J., and Hamlin, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b326-11\"> All statutory references are to the Welfare and Institutions Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b328-7\"> Even if we were to accept plaintiff\u2019s contention that the minor had the burden of proving both a bona fide effort to pay the restitution and indigency, the only evidence before the juvenile court sufficiently established both requirements. The probation officer\u2019s report indicates the minor explained his unsuccessful efforts at obtaining employment. Also, minor apparently established indigency at the inception of the juvenile court proceedings since he was represented by the public defender below and by appointed counsel on appeal. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Feagley </em>(1974) 39 Cal.App.3d 772, 775 [114 Cal.Rptr. 663].) No evidence was presented to rebut either showing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
