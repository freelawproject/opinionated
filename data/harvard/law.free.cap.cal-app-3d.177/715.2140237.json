Code, \u00a7 220), assault with intent to commit rape (Pen. Code, \u00a7 220) and rape with a foreign object (Pen. Code, \u00a7 289). We affirm his conviction because a finger is a \u201cforeign object\u201d within the meaning of Penal Code section 289. [. . .<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>]</p>\n<p id=\"b586-12\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b586-13\">On November 27, 1983, at approximately 1 p.m., Valerie W. was alone in her home when Wilcox, her roommate\u2019s ex-husband, arrived. After some conversation, Wilcox partially removed Ms. W.\u2019s clothing despite her resistance. He inserted his finger in her vagina and attempted further sexual assaults. An interruption by someone knocking at the door enabled Ms. W. to take refuge in the bathroom where she held Wilcox at bay with a curling iron.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>Wilcox admitted placing his finger in Ms. W.\u2019s vagina, but claimed Ms. W. at first consented, but then changed her mind after the interruption. Wilcox presented testimony from a clinical psychologist, who is a sex therapist, that almost every area of the body is considered a sexual organ, particularly the fingers. Therefore, Wilcox claimed that a finger is not a \u201cforeign object\u201d within the meaning of Penal Code section 289.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">We reject Wilcox\u2019 contention that a finger is not a foreign object within the meaning of Penal Code section 289. Section 289 as amended in 1982 prohibits forcible penetration of the genital or anal openings by a foreign object including \u201cany part of the body, except a sexual organ.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 289, subd. (c).)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As the People point out, if any external part of the body may be a sexual organ, then the exclusion of sexual organs in subdivision (c) would be meaningless and the amended section would mean the same thing as the former version of section 289.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">Penal statutes are to be construed \u201caccording to the fair import of their terms, with a view to effect [their] objects and to promote justice\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 4; <em>Keeler </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 619, 632 [87 Cal.Rptr. 481, 470 P.2d 617, 40 A.L.R.3d 420]). The \u201csexual organ of a male\u201d refers to his \u201cpenis\u201d or \u201cphallus\u201d (4 Schmidt, Attorneys\u2019 Dict. of Medicine and Word Finder (1983) p. 1261). Wilcox committed his acts by using other parts of his body. Although different organs may be used for sexual purposes, that does not make them sexual organs.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">In reviewing the legislative history concerning the 1982 amendment to section 289 we examined the digest of the amendment prepared by the Assembly Committee on criminal justice. The digest specifically states that \u201cforeign objects\u201d include \u201cparts of hands or entire fists.\u201d Thus Wilcox\u2019 conduct fell within Penal Code section 289.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">Wilcox also argues that since the testimony of his expert that the hands or fingers are sexual organs was uncontradicted, his conviction must be reversed.  An \u201cexpert remains only a witness, to whose opinion the trier of fact need give no more acceptance than is compelled by the reasons upon which it is based.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Davaney </em>(1970) 7 Cal.App.3d 736, 749 [86 Cal.Rptr. 778] citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Bassett </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 122, 144 [70 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>Cal.Rptr. 193, 443 P.2d 777].) A jury may properly reject an expert\u2019s conclusion if there is doubt as to the material upon which the expert\u2019s conclusions are based. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Coogler </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 153, 166 [77 Cal.Rptr. 790, 454 P.2d 686].)  Here, the trier of fact was not compelled to accept the expert\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Stone, P. J., and Abbe, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">A petition for a rehearing was denied March 12, 1986, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above. Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied May 7, 1986.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b586-14\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 715.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b587-10\"> The former version of section 289 provided that a foreign object does \u201cnot include any parts of the body\u201d (Stats. 1978, ch. 1313, \u00a7 1, p. 4300).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b587-11\"> If every external organ of the body is a sexual organ as the defense expert suggests, then what is left? The People aptly point out the statute cannot mean that internal organs are foreign objects. This includes the brain, which bears responsibility for acts prohibited by the statute, and which also devises ingenious arguments to escape that responsibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\" orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"b588-7\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 715.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
