Code, \u00a7 451), and filing a fraudulent insurance claim (Ins. Code, \u00a7 556, subd. (a)(1)). And she had thereafter admitted, or was found to have suffered, two prior convictions of assault with a deadly weapon. She appeals from a judgment which was entered upon the jury\u2019s verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">The first of defendant Means\u2019 two appellate contentions follows: \u201cThe trial court improperly denied appellant\u2019s motion to preclude use of her prior convictions for assault with a deadly weapon for impeachment purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-10\">On a so-called <em>Beagle (People v. Beagle </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 441 [99 Cal.Rptr. 313, 492 P.2d 1]) motion, the trial court ruled that one of defendant\u2019s prior felony convictions of assault with a deadly weapon might be used for impeachment, were she to take the witness stand on her own behalf. That ruling is the basis of the instant contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-11\">The issue is whether such a prior conviction involved \u201cmoral turpitude.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-12\">The question is answered by <em>People </em>v. <em>Castro </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 301, 315 [211 Cal.Rptr. 719, 696 P.2d 111], which announced a rule that a felony indicating its perpetrator\u2019s <em>\u201cgeneral readiness to do evil,\u201d </em>involves <em>\u201cmoral turpitude. </em>\u201d Few would agree that an unlawful assault upon a fellow human being with a deadly weapon, indicates other than a \u201cgeneral readiness to do evil.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-13\">We find the instant contention meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-14\">(The remainder of this opinion will not be published.
