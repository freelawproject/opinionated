Code, \u00a7 245, subd. (a)), with an enhancement for use of a firearm (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022.5) on the following evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">Appellant drove past the family home of the victim, Larry Johnson, on December 18, 1982, while the latter was working on his car. According to Johnson, appellant momentarily stopped and asked if he wanted to buy some speakers. Johnson replied, \u201cHell no! Get the hell away from my house!\u201d The two men then exchanged scurrilous epithets,- after which they squared off to fight.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">Appellant\u2019s version of the incident was that, while speaking to a mutual acquaintance, Tyrone Gibson, about the sale of speakers, Johnson interrupted the negotiations by exclaiming, \u201cGet the shit away from my mother\u2019s house!\u201d complemented by a threat to \u201cbeat [appellant\u2019s] ass.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-10\">Following the squabble appellant left the scene, to return about half an hour later accompanied by his brother and a loaded shotgun. Appellant allegedly placed the shotgun behind the seat of his brother\u2019s truck for his own protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-11\">Shouting abusive expletives, appellant challenged Johnson to a fist fight. The latter then approached appellant who in turn ran back to the truck and retrieved the shotgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-12\">Appellant testified that when the two men were four to five feet apart, Johnson pulled a knife from his rear pocket, holding it at his side but pointed it at appellant. It was at this point that appellant ran to fetch the shotgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-13\">Upon observing the weapon, Johnson fled up the stairs to his residence. Appellant fired the gun three times. A buckshot charge hit the exterior wall of the apartment, not injuring Johnson, although his mother testified that appellant was aiming up the stairs at Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>Appellant testified that he fired twice into the air only to scare Johnson, and had no intent to hit him. He fled after firing the shots, knowing that he had done \u201csomething wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Officer Carmichael of the Richmond Police Department found two discharged shotgun shells in the street and one on the sidewalk.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">Appellant complains that the trial court committed prejudicial error by denying his motion to exclude evidence of prior robbery and forgery convictions suffered while he was a minor. Appellant\u2019s contention is predicated upon Welfare and Institutions Code section 1772, which provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[ejvery person honorably discharged from control by the Youthful Offender Parole Board who has not, during the period of control by the authority been placed by the authority in state prison shall thereafter be <em>released </em>from <em>penalties </em>and <em>disabilities </em>resulting from the offense or crime for which he or she was committed . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) The parties entered into a stipulation that a valid order of dismissal had been entered as to appellant\u2019s prior convictions pursuant to section 1772.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">The initial inquiry is whether impeachment is a <em>penalty </em>or <em>disability </em>within the meaning of Welfare and Institutions Code section 1772, thus precluding use of a qualifying prior felony conviction for that purpose. Section 1772 does not define the term \u201cpenalties and disabilities,\u201d and consequently we must look to the purpose and objectives of the statute to determine its meaning. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Grubb </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 614, 620 [47 Cal.Rptr. 772, 408 P.2d 100].)</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">Section 1772 is contained in the Youth Authority Act (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1700-1906), the goal of which is to rehabilitate rather than punish youthful offenders. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 1700; <em>People </em>v. <em>Redman </em>(1981) 125 Cal.App.3d 317, 323 [178 Cal.Rptr. 49]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Getty </em>(1975) 50 Cal.App.3d 101, 113 [123 Cal.Rptr. 704].) Thus, the objectives of the Act are to be served, section 1772 must be liberally construed to protect the youthful offender from any subsequent adverse impact resulting from use of a conviction. The goal of rehabilitation might very well be compromised if a prior conviction imposes any burden upon the youthful offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">In our view, while the use of a prior conviction to impeach the credibility of a witness may not amount to a \u201cpenalty,\u201d at least in terms of having a punitive effect, a \u201cdisability\u201d results when the youthful offender cannot testify free from the taint of such an offense. The use of the offense, then, surely may hinder presentation of a defense in a criminal prosecution by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>dissuading the defendant from testifying on his own behalf, thus causing a form of legal incapacity and disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">No published case has yet defined the term \u201cpenalties and disabilities\u201d in Welfare and Institutions Code section 1772. However, the effect of identical language in former Penal Code section 1203, paragraph (5) upon admissibility of a prior conviction for impeachment purposes was treated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Mackey </em>(1922) 58 Cal.App. 123 [208 P. 135]. Prior to 1927, paragraph (5) of Penal Code section 1203 provided that every defendant who \u201cfulfilled the terms of his probation . . . shall thereafter be released from all <em>penalties </em>and <em>disabilities </em>resulting from the offense or crime of which he has been convicted.\u201d (Italics added.) Noting that it dealt with \u201cstrong and direct\u201d language requiring \u201cbroad and far reaching construction,\u201d the court concluded that \u201cthe legislature intended by the enactment of section 1203 that no convicted person discharged after probation thenceforth should be regarded as one possessed of the degree of turpitude likely to affect his credibility as a witness.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 129-131.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">We similarly conclude that by releasing defendants from all \u201cpenalties and disabilities\u201d attached to the offense committed, section 1772 precludes use of a prior conviction under that statute for purposes of impeachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">The recent enactment of Proposition 8, the so-called \u201cVictim\u2019s Bill of Rights,\u201d now codified in article I, section 28 of the California Constitution, does not change this result. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Castro </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 301 [211 Cal.Rptr. 719, 696 P.2d 111], our high court recently attempted to reconcile the dilemma presented by apparently contradictory language in subdivisions (d) and (f) of section 28<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by deciding \u201cthat\u2014always subject to the trial court\u2019s discretion under section 352\u2014subdivision (f) authorizes use of any felony conviction which necessarily involves moral turpitude, even if the immoral trait is one other than dishonesty.\u201d While the court failed to list such qualifying felonies, it is concluded that when a prior conviction is found to exhibit \u201cmoral turpitude,\u201d the trial court must exercise its discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>tion under Evidence Code section 352 and exclude such evidence if it is marginally relevant and unduly prejudicial. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 306, 312; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Boyd </em>(1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 36, 45 [212 Cal.Rptr. 873].)</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Assuming that appellant\u2019s prior robbery and forgery convictions evince the requisite \u201creadiness to do evil,\u201d to qualify them for admission under Castro\u2019s nebulous \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d standard, the prejudice attached to the admission of such evidence is sufficiently onerous to require its exclusion under a section 352 analysis. Welfare and Institutions Code section 1772 manifests a strong public policy that those persons honorably discharged from the Youth Authority have been rehabilitated and should no longer suffer the \u201cpenalties and disabilities\u201d of past indiscretions, including, as discussed, impeachment by former offenses. We find nothing in Proposition 8 indicating an intent to abrogate the effacement provisions of Welfare and Institutions Code section 1772. As noted in <em>Castro, </em>the preamble of the initiative\u2014subdivision (a) of section 28\u2014describes as a goal of \u201chighest importance\u201d the ensuring that \u201c \u2018persons who commit felonious acts causing injury to innocent victims will be appropriately detained in custody, tried by the courts, and sufficiently punished so that the public safety is protected and encouraged,\u2019 \u201d but plainly also contemplates that \u201c \u2018broad reforms in the procedural treatment of accused persons and the disposition and sentencing of convicted persons are necessary and proper as deterrents to criminal behavior. . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(Castro, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d 301, 310.) We believe that the rehabilitation of youthful offenders, as fostered by section 1772, is consistent with the objectives of Proposition 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Hence, although recognizing that subdivision (d) of section 28 does not specifically exempt Welfare and Institutions Code section 1772 from the effect of the remainder of Proposition 8, as it does Evidence Code sections 352, 782 and 1103, we nevertheless conclude that use of a prior conviction extinguished by section 1772 is unduly prejudicial and accordingly subject to exclusion in a subsequent criminal proceeding in the exercise of the trial court\u2019s discretion. We therefore find that the trial court erred by admitting the prior convictions for impeachment purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">Even so, the error does not require reversal. This is not a case in which the evidence is so closely balanced that the error must be deemed prejudicial. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Briggs </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 385, 407 [24 Cal.Rptr. 417, 374 P.2d 257].) The prosecution presented overwhelming evidence to support the guilty verdict. While appellant\u2019s testimony was certainly important to the defense, the case was not, as appellant suggests, a simple credibility contest between himself and the victim. Appellant\u2019s testimony that he shot into the air and never intended to hit Johnson was plainly contradicted both by the physical evidence\u2014e.g., the fact that the buckshot hit the exterior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>wall of the apartment near Johnson\u2019s path of flight\u2014and in the testimony of Johnson\u2019s mother. Such evidence was far more damaging to appellant\u2019s credibility than the prior conviction. Looking at the record in its entirety, we do not find it reasonably probable that the jury would have embraced appellant\u2019s implausible version of the incident and acquitted him of the assault charge had the prior conviction been excluded. Thus, the error did not result in a miscarriage of justice. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Sanchez </em>(1985) 170 Cal.App.3d 216, 220 [216 Cal.Rptr. 21].)</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Appellant\u2019s sole remaining contention is that the trial court erred by giving instructions on the lesser included offenses of simple assault and exhibiting a firearm. Appellant does not object to the fact that instructions on lesser included offenses were given; rather, he argues that by also defining such offenses as misdemeanors the trial court improperly prompted the jury to consider penalty. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mendoza </em>(1974) 37 Cal.App.3d 717, 727 [112 Cal.Rptr. 565]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Allen </em>(1973) 29 Cal.App.3d 932, 936-937 [106 Cal.Rptr. 43].) Appellant contends that: \u201cIt is probable that [the jury] chose to convict on the felony rather than the misdemeanor because they were aware that it carried a greater sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">While the jury is riot permitted to consider punishment or penalty in determining guilt or innocence <em>(People </em>v. <em>Moore </em>(1968) 257 Cal.App.2d 740, 750 [65 Cal.Rptr. 450]), there is no indication from the record that the trial court\u2019s instructions on lesser included offenses, as requested by appellant, had such an effect. Simply because the trial court characterized the lesser offenses as misdemeanors does not mean that the jury for that reason convicted appellant of the greater charge. In fact, the trial court specifically admonished the jury: \u201cIn your deliberations, the subject of penalty or punishment is not to be discussed or considered by you. That is a m\u00e1tter which must not in any way affect your verdict.\u201d We must presume that the jury followed this instruction. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Romo </em>(1975) 47 Cal.App.3d 976 [121 Cal.Rptr. 684].) We find no such error as is charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">Racanelli, P.
