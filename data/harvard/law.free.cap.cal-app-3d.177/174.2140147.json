J.</author>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">Statement of the Case</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">Appellant was charged in two separate cases by amended informations with burglary (Pen. Code, \u00a7 459),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> receiving stolen property (\u00a7 496) and possession of a controlled substance (heroin) (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11350). Prior felony convictions of attempted theft of an automobile (Veh. Code, \u00a7 10851), robbery (\u00a7 211), burglary (\u00a7 459) and twice receiving stolen property (\u00a7 496) were alleged for enhancement purposes. The cases were subsequently consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-10\">Appellant pleaded not guilty to the charges and successfully moved for a bifurcated trial on the issue of the prior conviction allegations. Appellant was unsuccessful in his motion to suppress evidence of the heroin pursuant to section 1538.5. Appellant was similarly unsuccessful in his motion to prevent his impeachment through use of the prior felony convictions; he did not testify at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-11\">A jury found appellant guilty of the charges of possession of heroin and receiving stolen property and not guilty of the burglary charge.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At a separate trial, and after the robbery prior was stricken on the People\u2019s motion, the trial court found the prior convictions true. Appellant was thereafter sentenced to six years in state prison. A timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>Statement of the Facts<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">I*</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">\n<em>The motion to exclude felony priors for impeachment.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">Appellant contends that his prior felony convictions (1979 and 1980 receiving stolen property, 1980 burglary, 1977 attempted theft of an automobile and 1973 robbery) should have been excluded for impeachment purposes.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Specifically, he contends that the trial court committed prejudicial error in failing to exercise its Evidence Code section 352 discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">The People contend that any error committed by the trial court was harmless as tested under the Watson<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> standard of review of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-11\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Castro </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 301 [211 Cal.Rptr. 719, 696 P.2d 111], the Supreme Court interpreted Article I, section 28, subdivision (f) of the state Constitution. It held that subject always to the trial court\u2019s discretion under Evidence Code section 352, a prior felony conviction that necessarily involves moral turpitude may be used to impeach a witness in a criminal proceeding. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 306.)</p>\n<p id=\"b141-12\">\u201cMoral turpitude\u201d means a general \u201creadiness to do evil.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 314.)  The determination of whether a given felony involves \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d is not a matter of extrinsic proof. Rather, \u201ca witness\u2019 prior conviction should only be admissible for impeachment if the least <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>adjudicated elements of the conviction necessarily involve moral turpitude. \u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 317.)</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Once it is determined the prior felony involves moral turpitude, the trial court must affirmatively show on the record that it did in fact weigh prejudice against probative value. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 1, 25 [164 Cal.Rptr. 1, 609 P.2d 468].) If the trial court fails to exercise its discretion, error occurs. Appellate courts will then reverse only if the record discloses that it is reasonably probable that a result more favorable to appellant would have occurred absent the error. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Castro, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at p. 319, citing Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 13; <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson, supra, </em>46 Cal.2d at p. 836.)</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">The threshold question is whether the prior felonies in this case necessarily involve moral turpitude. Since robbery and burglary each necessarily involve a specific intention to commit a theft, or in the case of burglary, a theft or a felony within a protected structure, each involves elements of dishonesty and a readiness to do evil. Several post <em>-Castro </em>opinions have so held. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Boyd </em>(1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 36, 44 [212 Cal.Rptr. 873] [burglary]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hunt </em>(1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 668, 675 [215 Cal.Rptr. 429] [burglary]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 800, 805 [215 Cal.Rptr. 494] [robbery]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Stewart </em>(1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 59, 66 [215 Cal.Rptr. 716] [robbery].)</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Several post <em>-Castro </em>cases have also held that the felony of automobile theft necessarily involves moral turpitude.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Since attempted automobile theft requires a specific intent to steal and a direct but ineffectual act done toward its commission (\u00a7 664; Witkin, Cal. Crimes (1963) \u00a7\u00a7 93, 94, pp. 90-91), it follows that the \u201cleast adjudicated elements\u201d of the crime of attempted automobile theft also necessarily involves moral turpitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">On the question whether receiving stolen property necessarily involves moral turpitude, we note that section 496 provides in pertinent part: \u201cEvery person who buys or receives any property which has been stolen or which has been obtained in any manner constituting theft or extortion, <em>knowing the property to be so stolen or obtained, </em>or who conceals, sells, withholds or aids in concealing, selling, or withholding any such property from the owner, <em>knowing the property to be so stolen or obtained </em>[is guilty of the crime of receiving stolen property]. \u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>Although it is not a specific intent crime, a necessary element of the offense of receiving stolen property is actual knowledge of the stolen character of the property. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jolley </em>(1939) 35 Cal.App.2d 159, 162 [94 P.2d 1011].) One who unlawfully acts in disregard for the property rights of others, whether known or unknown, demonstrates moral laxity and to some degree a \u201creadiness to do evil.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Thus, each of the felony priors involved moral turpitude; they were each relevant for the purpose of impeaching appellant had he elected to testify. Error occurred when the trial court failed to exercise its discretion in a manner compelled by <em>People </em>v. <em>Green, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d 1. In ruling on the motion to exclude the prior convictions for impeachment purposes, the trial judge indicated that \u201cany and all priors are admissible for impeachment purposes\u201d in light of Proposition 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">In passing on the question whether the trial court\u2019s error in failing to exercise its Evidence Code section 352 discretion was prejudicial under the test set out in <em>Watson, supra, </em>46 Cal.2d 818, focus should be drawn to the relative strengths of the prosecution and defense cases with particular attention given to the possible testimony appellant would have given if he were not to have been impeached by the prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">There was overwhelming evidence of appellant\u2019s possession of a controlled substance. That appellant was found possessing heroin could not have been controverted.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">Appellant\u2019s conviction of receiving stolen property is also strongly supported by circumstantial evidence. A Mexican male, as is appellant, was at the Culbertson house at the time of the residential burglary. The car in Culbertson\u2019s driveway at the time of the burglary was the very car appellant was driving later that day. The unique items missing from Culbertson\u2019s house were found in the trunk of that car. Appellant\u2019s apparent defense, as presented through his two witnesses, was that he was not driving the suspect car at the time of the residential burglary. Appellant\u2019s sister testified that she was driving the car at the time of the burglary. The defense was unbelievable given the eyewitness and circumstantial proof that the suspect car was in fact at the Culbertson residence at the time of the burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">The only possible thing that appellant could have offered in his defense if he had testified was that he did not know that the items in his trunk were stolen. But such knowledge may be, and almost always must be, presented by circumstantial evidence. (Witkin, Cal. Crimes, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>\u00a7 427.) All the circumstances must be considered together in determining whether the inference of guilt may be found. When so considered, there is ample <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>evidence to support the judgment, and we cannot say it is probable that a result more favorable to appellant would have occurred had he been allowed to testify without the threat of being impeached by his prior felony convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">III<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Hanson (P.
