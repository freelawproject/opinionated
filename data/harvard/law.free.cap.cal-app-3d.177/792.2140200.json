Plaintiff advances a host of contentions directed at demonstrating the demurrers should not have been sustained. We discern no error in the court\u2019s rulings and therefore affirm the judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">\n<em>Facts and Procedural Setting</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b646-10\">On January 6, 1983, plaintiff, a six-year-old first grade student at Ramona Elementary School in Hemet, was struck by an automobile and injured as she walked home after school. The accident occurred in the middle of a block on Girard Street north of Whittier Avenue at a site which was often utilized by school children as a \u201cshort cut.\u201d The accident site was not part of nor directly contiguous to the school grounds; it was in fact between one-quarter and one-half mile from the school grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-11\">Plaintiff\u2019s second amended complaint named the driver of the vehicle, Dorothy Susan Gibbel, and the driver\u2019s employer, True Cast Concrete, in its count based upon a theory of vehicular negligence. Named as defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>in other counts were School District, CHP, the County of Riverside (County) and the City of Hemet (City). Plaintiff asserted the following theories of liability against these public entities:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-4\">1. Failure to remedy or cause to be remedied an allegedly dangerous condition<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in the road along plaintiff\u2019s route home\u2014School District, CHP, County and City;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-5\">2. Negligent creation and/or maintenance of this dangerous condition\u2014 County and City;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-6\">3. Failure to promulgate and enforce safety standards\u2014CHP and County;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-7\">4. Failure to utilize crossing guards\u2014School District, County and City;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-8\">5. Failure to teach and develop materials for teaching safety education\u2014 School District, CHP and County; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-9\">6. Failure to provide adult supervision for plaintiff\u2019s trip home the day of the accident\u2014School District.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">School District and CHP demurred to each of plaintiff\u2019s counts against them, contending principally that any duty to act was discretionary in nature and could not give rise to tort liability. (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 815.2, subd. (b), 820.2.) The trial court sustained the demurrers and granted judgments of dismissal in favor of School District and CHP. Defendants Gibbel, True Cast Concrete, County and City are not parties to the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-11\">On appeal, plaintiff does not challenge the trial court\u2019s rulings as to School District\u2019s failure to provide adult supervision for plaintiff\u2019s trip home or CHP\u2019s failure to administer safety education and enforce safety standards. Thus, only the following questions remain for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-12\">1. Did School District or CHP have potential tort liability to plaintiff for failure to remedy a dangerous condition?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-13\">2. Did School District have potential tort liability to plaintiff for failure to provide an adequate course of safety education or for failure to employ a crossing guard or cause a crossing guard to be employed at the site of the accident?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">At the outset it must be noted that, in California, all governmental tort liability is dependent upon the existence of an authorizing statute or \u201cenactment.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 815, subd. (a), 815.6; <em>Tolan </em>v. <em>State of California </em>ex rel. <em>Dept. of Transportation </em>(1979) 100 Cal.App.3d 980, 983 [161 Cal.Rptr. 307]; <em>Morris </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1979) 89 Cal.App.3d 962, 964 [153 Cal.Rptr. 117].)</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">1. <em>School District Neither Owns Nor Controls the Property Alleged to Be in Dangerous Condition</em></p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">Plaintiff first attempts to ground School District\u2019s liability upon Government Code section 835, which provides in relevant part: \u201c. . . A public entity is liable for injury caused by a dangerous condition of its property . . . .\u201d \u201cProperty of a public entity\u201d in turn means real or personal property <em>owned or controlled </em>by that public entity. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 830, subd. (c).) Although School District\u2019s ownership of the property alleged to be in dangerous condition was pled in the complaint, plaintiff has acknowledged in her opening brief that School District does not own the property. Instead, plaintiff argues School District\u2019s authority to affect safety conditions so as to increase the safety of pupils traveling to and from school constitutes \u201ccontrol\u201d of the property<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> within the meaning of Government Code section 830, subdivision (c). Not so.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">The case of <em>Low </em>v. <em>City of Sacramento </em>(1970) 7 Cal.App.3d 826 [87 Cal.Rptr. 173] upon which plaintiff places reliance is not on point. The plaintiff in <em>Low </em>was injured when she fell into a water-filled depression in a \u201cparking strip\u201d of land between a sidewalk and a street curb outside a County of Sacramento hospital facility. The parking strip was part of the public street easement owned by the City of Sacramento on county land. The court was called upon to interpret that part of Government Code section 830, subdivision (c) which states: \u201c[\u2018Property of a public entity\u2019 and \u2018public property\u2019] ... do not include easements, encroachments and other property that are located on the property of the public entity but are not owned or controlled by the public entity.\u201d In affirming the trial court\u2019s finding of joint liability between the city and county, the court concluded the county retained extensive control over maintenance of the parking strip and the remedying of dangerous conditions upon it. The court stated, \u201cWhere the public entity\u2019s <em>relationship to the dangerous property is not clear, </em>aid may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>sought by inquiring whether the particular defendant had control, <em>in the sense of power to prevent, remedy or guard against the dangerous condition; </em>whether his ownership is a naked title or whether it is coupled with control; and whether a private defendant, having a similar relationship to the property, would be responsible for its safe condition. \u201d <em>(Low, supra, </em>7 Cal.App.3d at pp. 833-834, italics added; see also <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>City of Oakland </em>(1968) 260 Cal.App.2d 378 [67 Cal.Rptr. 197] (holding a city liable under Government Code section 835 to a child injured by a train, where the city had reserved extensive powers to regulate and inspect the railroad company\u2019s easement) and <em>Warden </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 297 [118 Cal.Rptr. 487, 530 P.2d 175] (holding a city liable for a dangerous condition caused by a submerged municipal sewer pipe in federal waters).)</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">Citing several statutes concerning the role school districts play in student safety, plaintiff asserts, in the parlance of <em>Low, </em>that School District possessed the \u201cpower to prevent, remedy or guard against the dangerous condition,\u201d i.e., it had control for the purposes of section 835 liability. Included in plaintiff\u2019s statutory recitation are Education Code section 39607, which gives school districts permissive authority to construct and maintain \u201c. . . pedestrian walks, footbridges, and pedestrian tunnels when required for the safety of pupils attending the schools of the district,\u201d and Vehicle Code section 21373, which authorizes school districts to request city, county and state agencies to install traffic control devices. Plaintiff also cites the guidelines in the School Area Pedestrian Safety manual promulgated in 1979 by the California Department of Transportation pursuant to Vehicle Code section 21372<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (see fn. 4, <em>post). </em>Without enlarging the authority of school districts over traffic safety along student transportation routes, these guidelines only recommend standards and procedures aimed at bringing about desirable safety conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Not having been drafted by School District, however, the guidelines in the School Area Pedestrian Safety manual are not internally binding upon the District. (Cf. <em>Clemente </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 202, 214-216 [219 Cal.Rptr. 445, 707 P.2d 818].)  Moreover, we cannot agree the authority of school districts to influence traffic control measures and effectuate student safety found in these sources provides the kind or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>degree of control necessary for section 835 liability. Unlike the situation in <em>Low, </em>the present case does not involve contiguous land parcels or property concerning which there are overlapping or conflicting layers of authority. Instead, the property over which plaintiff contends School District had control is located a considerable distance from the school grounds. The complaint specifies no authority which empowers or requires School District to manage the property on an ongoing basis or to erect barriers or traffic controls that might control pedestrian and vehicular traffic over the property. (See, e.g., <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1975) 51 Cal.App.3d 926, 947 [125 Cal.Rptr. 586].) The Low-type inquiry and result are only appropriate \u201c. . . [w]here the public entity\u2019s relationship to the dangerous property is not clear. ...\u201d (Low v. <em>City of Sacramento, supra, </em>7 Cal.App.3d at p. 833.) Here, it is clear that School District lacks the kind and degree of nonownership control over the property sufficient to give rise to liability under Government Code section 835.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">2. <em>Neither the School District nor the CHP Has A Mandatory Duty under Statute to Remedy or Cause the Remedy of the Allegedly Dangerous Condition</em></p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Plaintiff next posits potential liability of School District on Government Code section 815.6, which provides in relevant part: \u201cWhere a public entity is under a <em>mandatory </em>duty imposed by an enactment that is designed to protect against the risk of a particular kind of injury, the public entity is liable for an injury of that kind proximately caused by its failure to discharge the duty unless the public entity establishes that it exercised reasonable diligence to discharge the duty.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Plaintiff contends several passages from the School Area Pedestrian Safety manual, described <em>ante, </em>place a mandatory duty upon School District to remedy the dangerous condition alleged in this case. We set out the relevant portions of this manual in the margin.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Plaintiff also argues that these same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>guidelines from the traffic safety manual, along with Vehicle Code sections 21372 (requiring the Department of Transportation and \u201clocal authorities\u201d to promulgate traffic control guidelines for school areas) and 21373 authorizing school districts to request other agencies to install traffic control devices, impose a mandatory duty on CHP.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s contentions are not persuasive. The recommendatory, non-mandatory quality of the traffic control <em>guidelines </em>in the safety manual is self evident. (See fn. 3, <em>ante.) </em>Although these advisory materials can be utilized by governmental agencies to improve student safety, the authority they provide is discretionary; they do not impose mandatory duties upon School District or CHP within the meaning of Government Code section 815.6.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (See, e.g., <em>Vedder </em>v. <em>County of Imperial </em>(1974) 36 Cal.App.3d 654, 661-662 [111 Cal.Rptr. 728].) Moreover, both Vehicle Code sections cited by plaintiff are inapplicable either to CHP or School District in this case. Neither of them is a part of the Department of Transportation or a \u201clocal authority\u201d within the meaning of section 21372 (Veh. Code, \u00a7 385).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Even if Vehicle Code section 21373 were construed to require CHP to install traffic control devices if requested to do so by School District there is no allegation in the complaint that such an interagency request was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Plaintiff separately attempts to establish mandatory duties on the part of School District and CHP by alleging on information and belief that there exist \u201cother and additional duly adopted enactments\u201d and other unspecified \u201cenactments.\u201d These unspecified and unidentified sources of law are alleged to create mandatory duties upon School District and/or CHP concerning the reporting or correction of dangerous conditions, the hiring of crossing guards, and the provision of safety instruction. Plaintiff urges the facial uncertainty of the complaint as to the identity of these enactments should not undermine her statutory cause of action under Government Code section 815.6, because the complaint\u2019s uncertainty \u201c. . . was capable of resolution by reference to facts presumptively within the knowledge of [School District and CHP] . . . .\u201d (See <em>Green </em>v. <em>City of Livermore </em>(1981) 117 Cal.App.3d 82, 90 [172 Cal.Rptr. 461].) We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>In the first place, \u201cenactments\u201d are generally a matter of public record, and facts that are ascertainable from public records may not properly be pleaded on information and belief. <em>(Art Metal Const. Co. </em>v. <em>A. F. Anderson Co. </em>(1920) 182 Cal. 29, 33 [186 P. 776]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Birch Securities Co. </em>(1948) 86 Cal.App.2d 703, 708 [196 P.2d 143]; <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Nelson </em>(1928) 95 Cal.App. 144, 149-150 [272 P. 610]; <em>William Wilson Co. </em>v. <em>Trainor </em>(1915) 27 Cal.App. 43, 45 [148 P. 954].)</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">Secondly, in California all government tort liability is dependent on the existence of an authorizing statute or \u201cenactment\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 815, subd. (a), 815.6; <em>Tolan </em>v. <em>State of California </em>ex rel. <em>Dept. of Transportation, supra, </em>100 Cal.App.3d 980, 983; <em>Morris </em>v. <em>State of California, supra, </em>89 Cal.App.3d 962, 964; <em>Susman </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1969) 269 Cal.App.2d 803, 808 [75 Cal.Rptr. 240]), and to state a cause of action every fact essential to the existence of statutory liability must be pleaded with particularity, including the existence of a statutory duty. <em>(Susman </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>269 Cal.App.2d 803, 809.) Duty cannot be alleged simply by stating \u201cdefendant had a duty under the law\u201d; that is a conclusion of law, not an allegation of fact. The facts showing the existence of the claimed duty must be alleged. <em>(Id.; </em>see also <em>Rubinow </em>v. <em>County of San Bernardino </em>(1959) 169 Cal.App.2d 67, 71 [336 P.2d 968].) Since the duty of a governmental agency can only be created by statute or \u201cenactment,\u201d the statute or \u201cenactment\u201d claimed to establish the duty must at the very least be identified.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">It may be that in <em>Green </em>v. <em>City of Livermore, supra, </em>117 Cal.App.3d 82, 90, the court could rightly say the undesignated police regulations were presumptively within the knowledge of the city. Here that is not the case and thus plaintiff cannot successfully allege the existence of a mandatory duty on the basis of information and belief alone. To the extent our conclusion may be at odds with the <em>Green </em>decision, we do not agree with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Some reference is made in plaintiff\u2019s briefs to the possibility of unidentified \u201cjoint powers agreements\u201d between the County of Riverside and School District. The second amended complaint does allege the existence of \u201can agreement, or series of agreements\u201d of this kind, but without any identification whatsoever. Such an allegation places nothing in issue for the same reasons the allegations of unidentified and unidentifiable \u201cenactments\u201d fail to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s reliance on <em>Hoyem </em>v. <em>Manhattan Beach City Sch. Dist. </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 508 [150 Cal.Rptr. 1, 585 P.2d 851] is wholly unwarranted. It is true that in <em>Hoyem </em>the California Supreme Court recognized potential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>liability on the part of a school district where a student was injured when struck by a motorcycle away from school grounds. However, the basis for potential liability was the district\u2019s allegedly negligent failure to supervise the injured student during school hours on school premises, allowing the student to leave the school grounds during the hours he was supposed to be attending classes. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 518, 523.) The court plainly stated: \u201cContrary to defendant\u2019s assertions, our holding in no way expands the supervisory obligations of school districts and does not place a new duty upon school authorities to control the conduct of students when they are off school premises. As we have explained, defendant\u2019s liability in this case is posited not on an alleged failure to supervise Michael when he was off the school premises, but rather on an alleged failure to exercise due care <em>in supervision on school premises. </em>Defendant will be held liable for Michael\u2019s injuries only if the jury concludes that defendant\u2019s on-site supervision was negligent and that such negligence was a proximate cause of those injuries.\u201d <em>{Id., </em>at p. 523, orig. italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">3. <em>Special Relationship Doctrine Not Applicable to School District or CHP</em></p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s final contention regarding the alleged dangerous condition which purportedly caused her injury involves the special relationship doctrine of <em>Tarasoff </em>v. <em>Regents of University of California </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 425 [131 Cal.Rptr. 14, 551 P.2d 334, 83 A.L.R.3d 1166],  This doctrine creates an exception to the common law rule that one person owes no duty to control the conduct of another or to warn those endangered by conduct of third persons. A duty may be found under this exception where the defendant stands in some special relationship to either the person whose conduct needs to be controlled or to the foreseeable victim of that conduct. <em>(Tarasoff, supra, </em>17 Cal.3d at p. 435.)</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">Under Government Code sections 815.2, subdivision (a), and 820, subdivision (a),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> plaintiff theorizes that School District and CHP employees, named in the complaint as \u201cDoe\u201d defendants, owed plaintiff a duty under the special relationship doctrine and that School District and CHP vicariously share liability for the breach of that duty. Plaintiff asserts School District shared a special relationship with her which justifies the imposition of a duty to inspect her route to and from school for dangerous conditions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>and to warn other public entities of any danger discovered. Plaintiff separately alleges a special relationship between CHP and the County of Riverside, requiring CHP to warn County and/or School District of known dangerous conditions along her route to and from school. We believe not.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">The special relationship doctrine may serve as the basis for establishing negligence and liability on the part of a school district for breach of the long-established duty of schools to supervise students in their charge and protect them against harm from others on school premises during the school day. (See, e.g., <em>Bartell </em>v. <em>Palos Verdes Peninsula Sch. Dist. </em>(1978) 83 Cal.App.3d 492, 499 [147 Cal.Rptr. 898]; see also Prosser &amp; Keeton on Torts (5th ed. 1984) \u00a7 56, p. 383, fn. 11 and cases there cited.)  But plaintiff cites no case in which the special relationship doctrine was found to impose a protective duty where none otherwise existed, as when a student had departed homeward after school hours.  School districts and their employees are not insurers of the physical safety of their students <em>(Dailey </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Unified Sch. Dist. </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 741, 747 [87 Cal.Rptr. 376, 470 P.2d 360]), notwithstanding their discretionary authority to influence conditions affecting the safety of students\u2019 transportation to and from school. In light of California\u2019s statutory scheme of limited governmental liability, the special relationship doctrine can impose no greater duty of protection on school districts for off-school-grounds hazards than the Legislature has authorized by statute. (See Ed. Code, \u00a7 44808; see also <em>Hoyem </em>v. <em>Manhattan Beach City Sch. Dist., supra, </em>22 Cal.3d 508, 517.)</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">As to CHP, plaintiff\u2019s special relationship contention is specious. Even if such a duty could be imposed independently of statute or \u201cenactment,\u201d County and CHP clearly do not occupy the kind of relationship that would trigger a duty under <em>Tarasoff. </em>(See generally <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>County of Alameda </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 741, 749-758 [167 Cal.Rptr. 70, 614 P.2d 728, 12 A.L.R.4th 701].)</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">4. <em>School District Has No Mandatory Duty to Employ Crossing Guards or Teach Safety Education</em></p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">As a general rule school districts are under no obligation to supply traffic protection to students en route to and from school. (Ed. Code, \u00a7 44808; <em>Hoyem </em>v. <em>Manhattan Beach City Sch. Dist., supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at pp. 517-518; see also <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Arcade School Dist. </em>(1964) 230 Cal.App.2d 272 [40 Cal.Rptr. 812].) However, plaintiff once again seeks to manufacture a mandatory duty by arguing School District\u2019s discretionary powers to hire crossing guards (see Ed. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 45450 through 45452; see also Sts. &amp; Hy. Code, \u00a7 2118.5), require it to do so. Irrespective of extrinsic arguments concerning public policy and legislative intent, these statutes merely dele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>gate authority and budgetary power to effect a school safety program and no mandatory duty to employ a crossing guard at a particular location arises therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">For similar reasons, we do not discern in statutes such as Education Code sections 44805, 51050, and 51202,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which set out curricular responsibilities and recommendations, any legislative intent to create a mandatory duty to instruct students on the particulars of how and where to cross public thoroughfares and, in turn, to impose governmental tort liability for failure to d\u00f3 so. (See <em>Peter W. </em>v. <em>San Francisco Unified Sch. Dist. </em>(1976) 60 Cal.App.3d 814 [131 Cal.Rptr. 854].)</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">\n<em>Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">Morris, P.
