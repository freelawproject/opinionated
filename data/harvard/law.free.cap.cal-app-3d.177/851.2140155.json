Otherwise the statute has scant relevance to the issue of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>It is section 9324, subdivision (a), upon which plaintiffs really rely; as here relevant it recites (the italics are ours):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-5\">\u201c(a) In each county the nominee of the party <em>for State Senator, </em>the nominees of the party <em>for the Assembly, . . . </em>and the nominee of the party <em>for Representative in Congress </em>shall be ex officio members of this committee [here the Republican County Central Committee]. <em>... Ex officio members shall be entitled to all the rights and privileges, including the right to vote, and shall have </em>the. <em>same standing in every way as other members of this committee, </em>except they shall not be entitled to a ballot designation of incumbent upon seeking election to this committee in the next direct primary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">Each of the five plaintiffs was a duly elected member of the county\u2019s Republican County Central Committee. Additionally, plaintiffs Woods, Silvestri, and Dolson were the county\u2019s Republican Party nominees \u201cfor the Assembly,\u201d and plaintiff Spinosa was such a nominee \u201cfor Representative in Congress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">It was the dual basis of their Republican County Central Committee membership, upon which plaintiffs Spinosa, Woods, Silvestri and Dolson claim each of their entitlements to <em>two votes.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">We note initially that it is the essence of our democratic and political institutions that in such affairs, each person entitled to vote and regardless of status or position, shall have but <em>one vote. </em>Had the Legislature, in the context of the case before us, intended otherwise it may reasonably be inferred that it would have said so.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">Moreover, plaintiffs\u2019 suggestion that Elections Code section 9324 <em>implies </em>that persons situated as were plaintiffs Woods, Silvestri, Dolson and Spinosa, are entitled to two votes is rejected by <em>First M. E. Church </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Co. </em>(1928) 204 Cal. 201, 204 [267 P. 703]: \u201c[A]n intention to legislate by <em>implication </em>[our italics] is not to be presumed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b695-10\">But here, perhaps more importantly, section 9324, subdivision (a), expressly gives such persons \u201cthe right to vote\u201d without mention of the dual right claimed by them, <em>and </em>states that they \u201cshall have the same standing <em>in every way </em>as other members of [the] committee.\u201d Other members of the committee concededly, have but one vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-11\">Nothing is found in Elections Code sections 9321 and 9329, and in <em>Azevedo </em>v. <em>Jordan </em>(1965) 237 Cal.App.2d 521 [47 Cal.Rptr. 125], relied upon by plaintiffs of aid to them on their appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-12\">We accordingly find the appeal meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>It becomes unnecessary for us to consider other of the points and contentions of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Racanelli, P. J., and Holmdahl, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
