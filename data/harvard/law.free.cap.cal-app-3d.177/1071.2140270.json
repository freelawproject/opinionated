Nicholas (hereafter Nicoli) and daughters Eugenie Nicholas Murdock (hereafter Murdock) and Maria Nicholas Kelly (hereafter Kelly). William left his entire estate to Bank of America in trust until his youngest child, Maria, reached the age of 40 years. The will directed the trustee to operate the Nicholas Ranch in Sutter County and to employ Nicoli as ranch manager subject to the trustee\u2019s absolute discretion and control. Other relevant provisions of the will granting powers to the trustee are discussed in the body of the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">The will also provided that \u201cThis trust shall cease and terminate when my youngest child . . . shall attain the age of 40 years. My said trustee shall then distribute and deliver all of the remaining trust estate to my three children in equal one-third shares . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">Fourteen days before the trust was scheduled to terminate (on Kelly\u2019s 40th birthday) Kelly filed a petition for partition of the Nicholas Ranch. Nicoli filed a response opposing the partition and Murdock filed objections to the partition. Because the trust was near termination the successor trustee had filed his fourth and final account and report and had petitioned the court for his fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">On May 17, 1982, with the express agreement of the beneficiaries, the trial court ordered that the trust continue under supervision and control of the trustee until further order of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-8\">The trust had operated for more than a year after its scheduled demise when on October 28, 1983, the trustee filed a petition for instructions and for authority to sell a herd of livestock located on and owned by the Nicholas Ranch. The herd included both ordinary \u201csale cattle\u201d and apparently rare Cebullaise cattle raised for breeding purposes. The trustee alleged in his verified petition that he \u201cbelieves it is in the best interests of the Trust Estate that the livestock be sold\u201d and that the two beneficiary sisters, Murdock and Kelly, had requested that the livestock be sold as soon as possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-9\">The trustee alleged that he \u201cis informed and believes, and therefore alleges that a registration of the livestock would be advantageous to the trust and could result in a maximization of sales proceeds.\u201d He also alleged that \u201call of the records and documents necessary for registration of the livestock are in possession of the ranch manager, Nicoli Nicholas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b907-10\">Nicoli filed verified objections to the petition for instructions in which he alleged that sale of the breeding cattle was not in the best interest of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1080\">*1080</page-number>trust for a variety of reasons.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nicoli also alleged the breeding herd of cattle was unique, irreplaceable, and especially valuable due to a special breeding program he had undertaken for 30 years. Nicoli asserted he personally owned the \u201cregistration privileges\u201d for much of the breeding herd. He based his claim on the fact he personally owned all but one of the original bulls which fathered the herd.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">At the hearing on the petition for instructions, Nicoli strenuously opposed the trustee\u2019s request that Nicoli be ordered to register the breeding herd without compensation for his \u201cpersonal\u201d contribution to the herd. Nicoli requested that he be allowed to brief the issue and present evidence on the cattle industry\u2019s registration custom and practice which allegedly supported his position. The trial court denied this request.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">At the conclusion of the hearing the trial court granted the petition. A formal order was subsequently entered directing the trustee to sell all cattle belonging to the trust and ordering Nicoli to register the cattle without receiving personal compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">Nicoli appeals, claiming: (1) the trial court\u2019s order is void because the trustee failed to send statutory notice of the hearing on requested instructions to children, including Nicoli\u2019s son, who would receive their parent\u2019s share of the trust corpus should their parent die before termination of the trust; (2) the trial court\u2019s order authorizing sale of the cattle is not supported by substantial evidence in the record; and (3) the trial court\u2019s order directing Nicoli to register the cattle cannot stand because it exceeds the court\u2019s jurisdiction and deprives Nicoli of property without due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">We conclude Nicoli waived any objection to notice but the trial court\u2019s orders directing registration and sale of the breeding cattle must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b908-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b908-10\">Nicoli first contends the trial court had no jurisdiction to make its order of instructions because no proper notice had been given of the hearing at which instructions were determined. (See <em>Estate of Jenanyan </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 703, 708 [183 Cal.Rptr. 525, 646 P.2d 196].) Nicoli asserts that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1081\">*1081</page-number>various sections of the Probate Code<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> required that notice be given to children who would share in the trust corpus only upon their parent\u2019s death if the trust corpus had not been previously distributed.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">\u201cThe trial court is without jurisdiction to make an order which has not been properly noticed, <em>unless the right to notice has been </em>waived. \u201d (Id., at p. 708, italics added.) \u201cEven where improper notice . . . would otherwise deprive a court of jurisdiction to make an order or pronounce judgment, the order or judgment will not be declared void if the complaining party has waived the defect.\u201d <em>(Estate of Poder </em>(1969) 274 Cal.App.2d 786, 791 [79 Cal.Rptr. 484].)</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">Here, Nicoli does not contend <em>he </em>received improper notice. Rather, he asserts an alleged failure of the trustee to give notice to contingent beneficiaries voids the proceedings. For present purposes we assume arguendo the contingent beneficiaries were entitled to notice. However, any defects in notice to the beneficiaries were readily discoverable by Nicoli at the hearing. Having made no objection in the trial court to any improper notice, and having allowed the court to adjudicate the matters at issue, Nicoli may not now complain that notice to others was defective. <em>(Gilmour </em>v. <em>Gilmour </em>(1930) 105 Cal.App. 372, 373 [287 P. 534].) \u201cTo hold otherwise would impermissibly permit a party to gamble without risk by allowing proceedings to continue to conclusion without objection, claiming reversible error only if the conclusion were unfavorable.\u201d <em>(Trail </em>v. <em>Cornwell </em>(1984) 161 Cal.App.3d 477, 484 [207 Cal.Rptr. 679].)</p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b909-8\">We next consider Nicoli\u2019s contention the trial court\u2019s order authorizing the trustee to sell the breeding cattle is unsupported by substantial evidence in the record. However, in order to determine whether the record contains substantial evidence, we must first discover what the trustee had to show. The first question is: substantial evidence <em>of what?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b909-9\">A. <em>No Special Rules Applied Because the Trust Was in the Process of Winding Up.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b909-10\">Under section 1120, the superior court retains jurisdiction over certain testamentary trusts to pass upon acts of the trustee.  Among the purposes of a petition for instructions under section 1120 are (1) to allow the trustee to protect himself from liability for his acts and (2) to provide speedy resolution of disputes between beneficiaries and trustees. (3 Scott on Trusts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1082\">*1082</page-number>(3d ed. 1967) \u00a7 259, p. 2214; <em>Copley </em>v. <em>Copley </em>(1978) 80 Cal.App.3d 97, 104-106 [145 Cal.Rptr. 437].)</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">The law applicable to the supervision of a trust by a court may depend upon whether a trust is in the process of winding up.  Where the terms of a trust fix the period of its duration, the trust terminates on the expiration of that period. (60 Cal.Jur.3d, Trusts, \u00a7 242, pp. 372-373.) The trust continues for the purpose of winding up. The period for winding up the trust is the period after the time for termination has arrived and before the trust is terminated by the distribution of the trust property. (Rest.2d Trusts, \u00a7 344, com. <em>a, </em>p. 191.) The winding up process involves distribution and conveyance of the trust property to those entitled to it. (60 Cal.Jur.3d, Trusts, \u00a7 249, pp. 379-380.)</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\"> Here the trust had terminated by its own terms in 1982 and was in the process of winding up at the time the court heard and determined the questions before us. The powers of a trustee during winding up are not always the same as those powers before termination.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, if the beneficiaries consent to the trustee\u2019s holding and administering the trust property after the expiration of the trust term, the life of the trust will be deemed extended and the powers and duties of the trustee continue un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>changed. (Bogert, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>\u00a7 1010, p. 463.) Here, as Nicoli acknowledges in his brief, all beneficiaries expressly agreed that the trustee could continue administration of the trust after termination. No party has contended any special rules of winding up apply. We shall therefore measure the trustee\u2019s powers by rules applicable to the duties of the trustee managing an active trust before termination. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">B. <em>The Trust Instrument Did Not Give the Trustee Absolute Discretion to Sell the Cattle.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">In passing on a request for instructions respecting the administration of an active trust, the extent and nature of the powers afforded a trustee depend primarily upon the intention of the settlor, which is to be gathered from the trust instrument as a whole.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>(Estate ofFerrall </em>(1953) 41 Cal.2d 166, 176 [258 P.2d 1009]; <em>Estate of Marre </em>(1941) 18 Cal.2d 184, 188 [114 P.2d 586]; Rest.2d Trusts, \u00a7 187, com. j, p. 408.)  The extent of a trustee\u2019s powers depends on whether the trustee has been given \u201cabsolute\u201d powers, on the one hand, or mere \u201cdiscretionary\u201d powers on the other.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (See 60 Cal.Jur.3d, Trusts, \u00a7\u00a7 103-104, pp. 160-166.)</p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">Civil Code section 2269 specifies standards by which the courts are to review the acts of a trustee in light of powers granted by the trust instrument. (See, e.g., <em>Neel </em>v. <em>Barnard </em>(1944) 24 Cal.2d 406, 417 [150 P.2d 177]; <em>Estate of Landau </em>(1958) 158 Cal.App.2d 176, 180 [322 P.2d 222]; <em>Estate of Heard </em>(1951) 107 Cal.App.2d 225, 233 [236 P.2d 810, 27 A.L.R.2d 1313].)  However, an initial question is: which version of Civil Code section 2269 controls?</p>\n<p id=\"b911-9\">In 1961, when the instant trust was created, and in 1966, when the testator died, Civil Code section 2269 provided as follows: \u201cA discretionary power conferred upon a trustee is presumed not to be left to his arbitrary discretion, but may be controlled by the proper court if not reasonably exercised, <em>unless an absolute discretion is clearly conferred by the declaration of trust. </em>\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b911-10\">In 1981, the statute was substantially amended; the italicized language was deleted. (Stats. 1981, ch. 1046, pp. 4032-4033.) The statute was again <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1084\">*1084</page-number>amended in 1983 to its present form (Stats. 1983, ch. 99, \u00a7 3) and its pertinent provisions are set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">Ordinarily, the pre-1981 statute would be applied to the trust document in this case upon the theory that \u201cit must be presumed that the person who drafted the intricate will, as well as the testator, must have had the law in mind as it prevailed at that time.\u201d <em>(Estate of Heard, supra, </em>107 Cal.App.2d at p. 232.) However, the 1981 amendment contained an uncodified section 2, which provided in pertinent part that the new statute \u201cshall apply to any trust, after the effective date of this act, whether the trust instrument was executed before or after that date. No inference shall be drawn from the enactment of this section as to heretofore existing law.\u201d (Stats. 1981, ch. 1046, \u00a7 2, p. 4033.)</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">We shall abide by the command of this enactment and apply current Civil Code section 2269 to the instant dispute.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In doing so, we need not resolve the meaning of the puzzling and cryptic provision in the 1981 enactment stating that \u201cNo inference shall be drawn from the enactment of this section as to heretofore existing law.\u201d  Arguably the language is designed to neutralize the ordinary canon of statutory construction holding that where the language of a statute is changed by an amendment, the Legislature intends to change the law. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Cicero </em>(1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 465, 476 [204 Cal.Rptr. 582] and authorities cited therein.)  Nonetheless, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1085\">*1085</page-number>if the 1981 amendment is construed most favorably to the trustee, it eliminated the previous requirement that an absolute discretion be \u201cclearly conferred\u201d in the trust document. For present purposes, we shall assume arguendo the 1981 amendment accomplished that purpose. However, as we shall see, the 1981 amendment cannot carry the day for the trustee, because the trust document, reasonably construed, does not grant the trustee absolute discretion to sell the cattle.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">Subdivisions (b) and (c) of Civil Code section 2269 still provide that a trustee\u2019s acts shall be reviewed differently according to whether the trustee has been given merely discretionary powers, on the one hand, or absolute, sole or uncontrolled discretion, on the other. (See fn. 6, <em>ante.) </em>Although we are assuming arguendo the 1981 amendment to Civil Code section 2269 eliminated the requirement an absolute discretion be \u201cclearly conferred,\u201d nothing in the amendment nor in logic suggests that the Legislature intended to abrogate the meaning given to words in trust documents by the courts over the decades. If the Legislature wishes to eliminate the historic gloss given to trust language by the courts, and relied upon by the practicing bar in the drafting of instruments, it must say so in plainer language than is contained in the recent amendments to Civil Code section 2269. Consequently, in interpreting the trust document, we have in mind that the drafter of the trust and the settlor \u201chad the law in mind as it prevailed at that time\u201d <em>(Estate of Heard, supra, </em>107 Cal.App.2d at p. 232), at least with respect to language previously given a definitive judicial interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">In this regard, we are mindful that the cases had approved certain words as conveying to a trustee an absolute discretion. Not surprisingly, the most common is the adjective \u201cabsolute\u201d when used in connection with \u201cdiscretion,\u201d \u201ccontrol,\u201d or \u201cpower.\u201d (See, e.g., <em>Estate of Charters, supra, </em>46 Cal.2d at p. 238; <em>Neel </em>v. <em>Barnard, supra, </em>24 Cal.2d at p. 416; <em>Estate of Canfield </em>(1947) 80 Cal.App.2d 443, 446 [181 P.2d 732].) Also common are the words \u201csole discretion\u201d or \u201csole judgment.\u201d (See e.g., <em>Estate of Ferrall, supra, </em>41 Cal.2d at p. 173; <em>Estate of Marre, supra, </em>18 Cal.2d at p. 186.) Conversely, where trust instruments have specified it is \u201cthe duty and power\u201d of a trustee to make a decision <em>(Estate of Heard, supra, </em>107 Cal.App.2d at pp. 226-227) or where the trustees are empowered to act \u201cin their discretion\u201d <em>(Estate of Gross </em>(1963) 216 Cal.App.2d 563, 566 [31 Cal.Rptr. 281]), the powers have been ruled merely discretionary and not absolute.  We therefore turn to the will to ascertain the nature and extent of powers granted the trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">The third paragraph of the will provides in pertinent part \u201cthat my trustee maintain and operate said ranches until either of the contingencies as here<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1086\">*1086</page-number>inafter set forth shall occur. It is also my will that said trustee employ my son, Nicoli Nicholas, to manage and operate said properties on a salary basis, <em>subject, however, during the term of this trust to the absolute control and authority and discretion of my said </em>trustee. \u201d (Italics added.) This provision clearly gives the trustee absolute discretion <em>over Nicoli\u2019s decisions </em>with regard to management and operation of the ranch. However, the clause, which is obviously designed to prevent Nicoli from usurping the trustee\u2019s powers, does not on its face give the trustee absolute discretion to operate and manage the ranch itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">If this paragraph of the will stood in isolation, it might be subject to an interpretation giving the trustee absolute discretion over management and operation of the ranch, including whether to sell any cattle. However, \u201cWhere the meaning of any part of a will is ambiguous or doubtful, it may be explained by any reference thereto, or recital thereof, in another part of the will.  All the parts of a will are to be construed in relation to each other, and so as, if possible, to form one consistent whole . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 103.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">The third paragraph of the will provides further, \u201cIt is my request that the trustee hold, retain and continue to operate my property as businesses solely at the risk of the trust estate and without liability on the part of the trustee, should any losses result therefrom; <em>to </em>dissolve, maintain or <em>sell any part or the whole thereof, at any time the trustee may deem it for the best interests of the beneficiaries. </em>\u201d (Italics added.) This paragraph refers specifically to the trustee\u2019s powers with respect to the operation of the trustee\u2019s property as businesses and, even more specifically, to the sale of assets. Adhering to the principle that the provisions of the will should be neither redundant nor in conflict (\u00a7 103), we conclude this paragraph grants the trustee power to sell the cattle on the ranch.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">The power is to sell \u201cat any time the trustee may deem it for the best interests of the beneficiaries.\u201d This language is merely the equivalent of a grant to the trustee to sell the cattle \u201cin his discretion\u201d and does not confer absolute discretion on the trustee. (See <em>Estate of Gross, supra, </em>216 Cal.App.2d at p. 566.) This is particularly so because, as we have seen, the testator apparently recognized how to use language to convey absolute discretion and did not do so here. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 567.) Finally, any doubts we may have as to the discretion conferred are resolved by language later in the third paragraph stating, \u201cI hereby confer upon my trustee and I intend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1087\">*1087</page-number>by this instrument to grant <em>broad discretionary powers, </em>without liability, as I have full confidence in my\u201esaid trustee.\u201d This inclusive language, appearing near the end of the trust\u2019s provisions, is entitled to considerable weight. (See <em>Copley </em>v. <em>Copley </em>(1981) 126 Cal.App.3d 248, 284-285 [178 Cal.Rptr. 842].) Broad discretionary powers are not absolute powers. For purposes of review under Civil Code section 2269, we conclude the testator granted the trustee discretionary, not absolute, power to sell the cattle.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">C. <em>The Burden of Proof Was Upon the Trustee to Show His Requested Exercise of a Discretionary Power Was Reasonable.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">\u201cThe exercise of a discretionary power is subject to review by a court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 2269, subd. (b).) A discretionary power conferred upon a trustee is presumed not to be left to his or her arbitrary discretion but shall be exercised reasonably. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 2269, subd. (a).)  \u201c\u2018A discretionary power conferred upon a trustee may be controlled by the proper court if not reasonably exercised.\u2019\u201d <em>(CrockerCitizens National Bank </em>v. <em>Younger </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 202, 212 [93 Cal.Rptr. 214, 481 P.2d 222, 56 A.L.R.3d 1228], quoting <em>Estate of Traung </em>(1962) 207 Cal.App.2d 818, 834 [24 Cal.Rptr. 872].)</p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">Where a trustee has exercised absolute powers, the trustee is entitled to a presumption that he has acted in good faith, and the burden is upon an objecting beneficiary to show a bad faith exercise of absolute powers. <em>(Estate of Ferrall, supra, </em>41 Cal.2d at p. 177; see <em>Coberly </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1965) 231 Cal.App.2d 685, 690 [42 Cal.Rptr. 64]; <em>Estate of Canfield, supra, </em>80 Cal.App.2d at p. 451.) However, we are aware of no rule to the effect that a trustee seeking to exercise discretionary powers, and petitioning the court for instructions, is entitled to a presumption that the requested powers will be exercised reasonably. Generally a party has the burden of proof as to each fact the existence or nonexistence of which is essential to the asserted claim for relief. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 500.) Here, the trustee sought instructions in part to obtain insulation from liability.  In effect, the trustee pursued a \u201cclaim for relief\u201d within the meaning of the Evidence Code. Moreover, the trustee knows the reasons for his contemplated action and has at his ready command whatever evidence tends to show his action will be undertaken reasonably.  We therefore conclude a trustee petitioning for instructions as to the exercise of a discretionary power has the burden of proving the exercise will be reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">It is in this context that Nicoli contends no substantial evidence supports the trial court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1088\">*1088</page-number>D. <em>No Substantial Evidence Supports the Court\u2019s Order Allowing the Trustee to Exercise His Discretionary Powers.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">Nicoli first argues <em>no </em>legally cognizable evidence was introduced at the hearing on the trustee\u2019s petition. This claim is premised on the fact that the petition was adjudicated upon the trustee\u2019s verified petition and Nicoli\u2019s verified written objections thereto.  Nicoli asserts the trial court was required to hold a full evidentiary hearing at which witnesses could testify. With respect to the issue of whether the livestock should be sold, we must disagree.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">Evidence Code section 300 states: \u201cExcept as otherwise provided by statute, this code applies in every action before the Supreme Court or a court of appeal, superior court, municipal court, or justice court, including proceedings in such actions conducted by a referee, court commissioner, or similar officer, but does not apply in grand jury proceedings.\u201d  The Probate Code does not exclude probate proceedings from the rules of evidence. Probate jurisdiction is in the superior court. <em>(Copley </em>v. <em>Copley, supra, </em>80 Cal.App.3d at p. 107.) This means, \u201cThe general rules and principles of evidence apply, of course, to evidence in actions relating to trusts.\u201d (60 Cal.Jur.3d, Trusts, \u00a7 334, p. 514, citing <em>Young America Engine Co. </em>v. <em>Sacramento </em>(1874) 47 Cal. 594 [parol evidence rule].)</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">Ordinarily affidavits may not be used in evidence unless permitted by statute. <em>(Estate of Fraysher </em>(1956) 47 Cal.2d 131, 135 [301 P.2d 848].) However, where the parties do not object to the use of affidavits in evidence, and where both parties adopt that means of supporting their positions, the parties cannot question the propriety of the procedure on appeal. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Such is the case here with respect to the issue of the sale of the cattle. The trustee\u2019s petition and Nicoli\u2019s written objections were both verified in the form of declarations under penalty of perjury. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 2015.5.) Absent an objection, these documents were properly considered as evidence. (Es<em>tate of Fraysher, supra, </em>47 Cal.2d at p. 135; <em>Hand </em>v. <em>Board of Examiners </em>(1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 605, 615 [136 Cal.Rptr. 187].) Having failed to object to the trustee\u2019s verified petition, and having submitted verified documentary objections in response, Nicoli may not now complain.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-7\">In his verified petition the trustee alleged: that \u201cPetitioner [trustee] believes that it is in the best interests of the Trust Estate that the livestock be sold,\u201d and that \u201cTwo of the Trust beneficiaries, namely, Maria Kelly and Eugenie Murdock have requested that Petitioner sell said live<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1089\">*1089</page-number>stock as soon as possible.\u201d These terse assertions constituted the only evidence received by the trial court in support of the trustee\u2019s request to sell the cattle.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The trustee\u2019s petition stated no other reasons or circumstances in support of his request.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">We will not pause long over the trustee\u2019s bare assertion that he believes it is in the best interest of the trust that the livestock be sold. The trustee\u2019s mere belief, unsupported by <em>any </em>facts or circumstances underlying the decision, does not constitute substantial evidence of reasonableness. A contrary conclusion would make a mockery of the process by which a court \u201cinstructs\u201d a trustee, because the court would simply ratify the unexamined decision of the trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">Nor is substantial evidence of reasonableness found in the assertion that two of the three beneficiaries requested the trustee to sell the livestock as soon as possible. This averment meant no more than that two of the three beneficiaries wanted the cattle sold.  However, \u201cA trustee . . . owes a duty of impartiality to all who have an interest in the trust and must deal impartially among the several beneficiaries. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Crocker-Citizens National Bank </em>v. <em>Younger, supra, </em>4 Cal.3d at p. 219, fn. 7 (conc. opn. of Sullivan, J.); see also Bogert, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>\u00a7 541, pp. 156-157; 2 Scott on Trusts, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>\u00a7 183, pp. 1471-1472.)  Moreover, even a majority of beneficiaries cannot authorize a trustee to act contrary to the terms of a trust or statute. (60 Cal.Jur.3d, Trusts, \u00a7 120, p. 184.)  The request of the two beneficiaries, in and of itself, does not constitute substantial evidence that sale of the cattle was reasonable in the interest of all beneficiaries or of the trust estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-9\">The trustee contends evidence in support of the trial court\u2019s order can be located in sources other than his verified petition. The trustee first argues the trust had been subject to supervision by the court, that previous accountings showed the trust had accumulated substantial debt, and that the trial court was entitled to take judicial notice of its own records.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-10\">However, the plain fact is no request for judicial notice was made, nor is there any indication in the record that the trial court took judicial notice of anything. \u201c \u2018The trial judge should always be careful to <em>specify exactly </em>the document or portion of a document contained in a court file of which he is taking judicial notice. Also, counsel should be required to state, with <em>like specificity, </em>the exact document or portion of a document from a court file or record, when requesting the court to take judicial notice of a court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1090\">*1090</page-number>record.\u2019 (2 Jefferson, Cal. Evidence Benchbook (2d ed. 1982) \u00a7 47.2, p. 1757.)\u201d <em>(In re David C. </em>(1984) 152 Cal.App.3d 1189, 1205 [200 Cal.Rptr. 115], italics in original.) Where the trial court makes no statement on the record as to matters of which it takes judicial notice, the absence of such a statement \u201cleaves the issue in the realm of the unknown and the unresolved.\u201d <em>(Estate of Feierman </em>(1962) 202 Cal.App.2d 552, 563 [20 Cal.Rptr. 883].)  In the absence of an indication on the record of matters judicially noticed, an appellate court ordinarily cannot conclude substantial evidence may be located somewhere in matters hypothetically subject to judicial notice. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 553, 562-563.)</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">Moreover, Nicoli correctly asserts that if we were to <em>assume </em>the trial court took judicial notice of any matters, Nicoli would be deprived of his right under Evidence Code section 455 to litigate the propriety of taking judicial notice. Evidence Code section 452, subdivision (d) allows the trial court in its discretion to take judicial notice of its own records. However, if the subject of judicial notice is \u201cof substantial consequence to the determination of the action,\u201d Evidence Code section 455 requires the court to allow each party to present information relevant to the propriety of taking judicial notice and as to the tenor of the matter to be noticed. <em>(Estate of Russell </em>(1971) 17 Cal.App.3d 758, 765 [20 Cal.Rptr. 88].) Here, the previous financial condition of the trust would have been \u201cof substantial consequence to the determination of the action.\u201d (See <em>id., </em>at p. 766.) Absent notice to the parties, the trial court could not take judicial notice of records of the court containing financial information. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">Nor may we deem the failure to notify the parties harmless. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Carnesi </em>(1971) 16 Cal.App.3d 863, 867 [94 Cal.Rptr. 555].) As Nicoli points out, whether the trial court could have taken notice of the <em>truth </em>of facts set forth in any court record depends in part on the nature of the record. (See <em>Day </em>v. <em>Sharp </em>(1975) 50 Cal.App.3d 904, 914 [123 Cal.Rptr. 918].) Moreover, even assuming the truth could be considered, prior records of the court contained information not necessarily current at the time of the instant hearing. In the absence of an indication the court would take judicial notice, Nicoli had no occasion to rebut stale information. We therefore conclude the device of judicial notice will not supply evidence in support of the trial court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">The trustee also argues the trial court had before it information contained in unsworn memoranda of points and authorities prepared and filed by counsel for beneficiaries Murdock and Kelly.  However, it is settled that, except for stipulations or admissions contained therein, the unsworn pleadings of counsel do not constitute evidence. <em>(Bostic </em>v. <em>Love </em>(1860) 16 Cal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1091\">*1091</page-number>69, 72-73; <em>Mills </em>v. <em>Vista Pools, Inc. </em>(1960) 184 Cal.App.2d 668, 672 [7 Cal.Rptr. 545].)</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">Finally, the trustee suggests the trial judge was \u201cfamiliar with the case.\u201d Respondent cites no authority indicating how a judge\u2019s \u201cfamiliarity\u201d with a case is a substitute for evidence, and we are aware of none. Moreover, we grant Nicoli\u2019s unopposed formal request for judicial notice (Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 452, 459; <em>People </em>v. <em>Meza </em>(1984) 162 Cal.App.3d 25, 33-34 [208 Cal.Rptr. 576]) of the clerk\u2019s minutes in this action showing the trial judge last presided over this case some six and one-half years before the hearing at issue. The judge\u2019s \u201cfamiliarity\u201d with the case was therefore at best \u201ca remembrance of things past.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">The record contains no substantial evidence showing a sale of the breeding cattle was reasonable. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 2269, subd. (a).) The order directing sale of the breeding cattle must therefore be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b919-8\">Nicoli also argues sale of the breeding cattle is inconsistent with his father\u2019s testamentary intent. Nicoli contends sale of the breeding cattle deprives him of his right to receive one-third of the herd in kind pursuant to his petition for partition of personal property (\u00a7 1100). At this point, we must disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-9\">As noted above, the will clearly authorizes sale of any and all trust assets by the trustee. Nicoli\u2019s right to partition of the trust property commences only at the conclusion of the trust, i.e., when the \u201cheirs, devisees or legatees <em>are entitled, to the distribution of </em>undivided interests in . . . personal property of the decedent . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 1100, italics added.) Until the trust is finally terminated, in this case by order of the probate court, Nicoli has no right to distribution of any portion of the trust assets and may not complain if the trustee, in the exercise of a reasonable discretion, sells them in the interim.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-10\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b919-11\">We lastly consider Nicoli\u2019s contention the trial court erred in ordering him in his individual capacity to register the herd of breeding cattle. The point is meritorious since the record is devoid of any evidence the registration privileges were the property of the trust.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b920-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1092\">*1092</page-number>It is established that \u201cAll proceedings in the probate court are limited and special or limited and statutory <em>(Estate of Schloss </em>(1961) 56 Cal.2d 248, 253 [14 Cal.Rptr. 643, 363 P.2d 875]). The power of the probate court extends only to the property of the decedent. An attempt to take and distribute the property of a living person is a violation of due process (7 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (8th ed. 1974) \u00a7 237, p. 5745; <em>Stevenson </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1882) 62 Cal. 60; <em>Estate of Paulsen </em>(1917) 35 Cal.App. 654 [170 P. 855]).\u201d <em>(Estate of Lee </em>(1981) 124 Cal.App.3d 687, 692 [177 Cal.Rptr. 229].)  The trial court sitting in probate had power over the cattle registration privileges only if those privileges were the property of the trust. If, as Nicoli contends, those privileges belong to him the trial court was without authority over them. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">As we noted above, Nicoli sought the trial court\u2019s permission to conduct an evidentiary hearing at which he could show the industry practice and custom with respect to cattle registration privileges.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The trial court did not allow Nicoli this opportunity. However, there was no evidence in the record from which the trial court could dispute Nicoli\u2019s assertion in his verified objection that the registration privileges belonged to him. To be sure, there was ample evidence the trust owned the cattle located on the ranch. That much Nicoli conceded. However, no evidence suggested that ownership of the cattle established ownership of the registration privileges. The only evidence in the record consisted of Nicoli\u2019s verified objection in which he asserted the registration privileges belonged to him.  The trial court\u2019s order requiring Nicoli to accomplish registration is contrary to the only evidence in the record and is thus in excess of the court\u2019s limited jurisdiction.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>(Estate of Lee, supra, </em>124 Cal.App.3d at p. 692.) The order requiring Nicoli to register the breeding cattle must be reversed. For the benefit of the parties on remand, we note that section 851.5 specifies the appropriate procedures to be followed to adjudicate the ownership of the registration privileges. (See <em>Estate of Linnick </em>(1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 752, 760 [217 Cal.Rptr. 552].)</p>\n<p id=\"b921-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1093\">*1093</page-number>Both sides have requested this court to \u201caugment the record\u201d with certain other materials. Beneficiary Murdock asks that the record be augmented to include matters related to a subsequent partition proceeding. However, the parties acknowledge that the order or judgment in that matter has been appealed; there is not yet any final order or judgment that merits res judicata effect. We perceive no other useful purpose in the materials and therefore deny the motion to augment. We believe the trial court, on remand, can best survey the issues litigated in the partition proceeding and determine whether to abate the instant proceeding pending final resolution of the partition matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">Nicoli\u2019s request for augmentation of matters related to his posting of a bond on appeal is similarly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b921-7\">The order appealed from is affirmed to the extent it instructs the trustee to sell the ordinary \u201csale cattle.\u201d In all other respects, the order is reversed.

J., and Carr, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-9\">On March 13, 1986, the opinion was modified to read as printed above.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b908-11\"> Nicoli did not object in the trial court to a sale of the \u201csale cattle.\u201d He makes no objection in this court to a sale of the \u201csale cattle\u201d and, in any event, he has waived any such objection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b909-11\"> All further statutory references are to the Probate Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b910-6\">\u201c \u2018[T]he trustee has such powers and duties as are appropriate for the winding up of the trust.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Botsford </em>v. <em>Haskins &amp; Sells </em>(1978) 81 Cal.App.3d 780, 784 [146 Cal.Rptr. 752] [adopting view of Rest.2d Trusts, \u00a7 344].) The trustee has such powers as are \u201c \u2018necessary or proper for the preservation of the trust property,\u2019 \u201d such as the power to maintain actions on behalf of the trust. <em>(Botsford, supra, </em>81 Cal.App.3d at p. 785; <em>Gurkewitz </em>v. <em>Haberman </em>(1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 328, 337 [187 Cal.Rptr. 14].)</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">During winding up, the trustee has the duty to take such steps as are necessary to terminate the trust by making a distribution of the trust property. The trustee has the duty to exercise reasonable care and prudence in the preservation of property until distribution. (Rest.2d Trusts, \u00a7 345, com. <em>h, </em>pp. 196-197; Bogert, Trusts and Trustees, \u00a7 1010, p. 450.) The court retains jurisdiction to determine the extent of and enforce the trustee\u2019s obligations during winding up. <em>(Rise </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1943) 21 Cal.2d 614, 625 [134 P.2d 748] [even if liquidation of trust assets terminated trust, trustee\u2019s obligations continued until proceeds distributed; court had jurisdiction to impress lien].) The court retains jurisdiction under section 1120 until the entire trust estate is finally disposed of, and the trustee is entitled to discharge. <em>(McAdoo </em>v. <em>Sayre </em>(1904) 145 Cal. 344 [78 P. 874] [discussing former Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1699].)</p>\n<p id=\"b910-8\">A power of sale does not necessarily continue after the time for termination has arrived. The question is whether the sale serves any trust purpose that the testator intended to be so served. (Annot. (1955) 43 A.L.R.2d 1102, 1103-1104.) For example, a power to sell for investment purposes does not continue after termination. (Rest.2d Trusts, \u00a7 344, com. <em>d, </em>p. 192.) But a power of sale to pay trust debts ordinarily continues as long as debts remain unpaid. (43 A.L.R.2d at p. 1113.)</p>\n<p id=\"b910-9\">A testator\u2019s direction as to distribution often determines whether or not a power of sale continues during winding up. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1109.) Courts often conclude that the power of sale does not survive termination where the testator directs distribution of trust property in specified shares at the end of the trust term. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1115.) But courts often construe broad discretionary powers of sale to be exercisable for the purpose of division or distribution of the trust estate. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1119.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b911-11\"> No extrinsic evidence of the settlor\u2019s intent was introduced in the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b911-12\"><em> A </em>grant of absolute power to a trustee does not immunize the trustee\u2019s acts from review by a court. <em>(Estate of Ferrall, supra, </em>41 Cal. 2d at p. 173.)

The court can interfere with an absolute power only upon pleadings, proof, and findings of fraud, bad faith, or abuse of discretion. <em>(Ibid.) </em>This rule applies even where a trustee initiates a petition for instructions. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 232.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b912-6\"> Civil Code section 2269 provides in pertinent part as follows: \u201c(a) Except as provided in subdivision (c), a discretionary power conferred upon a trustee is presumed not to be left to his or her arbitrary discretion, but shall be exercised reasonably.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-7\">\u201c(b) The exercise of a discretionary power is subject to review by a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-8\">\u201c(c) Subject to the additional requirements of subdivision (d), where a trust instrument confers absolute, sole, or uncontrolled discretion upon a trustee, the trustee shall act in accordance with fiduciary principles and shall not act in bad faith or in disregard of the purposes of the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-9\">\u201c(d) Notwithstanding the trustor\u2019s use of terms such as \u2018absolute\u2019, \u2018sole\u2019, or \u2018uncontrolled\u2019, a person who is a beneficiary of a trust and who, either individually or as trustee or cotrustee, holds a power to take or distribute income or principal to or for the benefit of himself or herself pursuant to a standard shall exercise that power reasonably and in accordance with the standard.
