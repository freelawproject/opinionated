E. (2d) 372, in which the opinion is to be rendered during the present term of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">In this case, there was a verdict by the jury for the plaintiff, awarding her the sum of $1,500.00 damages on account of the injuries which she sustained in the accident. This verdict was confirmed by the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">Perhaps the testimony in this case, given by the defendant, as a witness, as to the number of drinks or quantity of liquor that he drank and its effect upon him, was stronger and more positive than that which was given in the <em>Cottle Case. </em>A new witness, one Cox, was introduced in this case by the defendant, who testified that the defendant was intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">The defendant dwelt upon the contention that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence and the matter of the alleged joint enterprise was stressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">The first two contentions were matters of fact for the jury upon the conflicting testimony. The theory of a joint enterprise is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-11\">There is nothing to substantially differentiate this case from the <em>Cottle Case. </em>The latter is controlling. It is unnecessary to pass upon the motion to dismiss the writ of error as having been improvidently awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-12\">Perhaps there was some tautology in the instructions which were granted. Fewer instructions would likely have been more desirable; but in the main we think the jury was soundly instructed, and that there was no prejudicial error in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-13\">We affirm the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-14\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
