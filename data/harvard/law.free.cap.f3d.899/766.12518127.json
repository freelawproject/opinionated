We vacate the district court's order denying Fomichev's motion to suppress and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Fomichev was born in Russia and came to the United States in 2003 on a student visa. He met Svetlana Pogosyan in 2006, and they married later that year. In 2007, Pogosyan applied for an alien relative visa for Fomichev, and he applied to adjust his immigration status. The United States Department of Homeland Security found the marriage bona fide, approved the visa, and granted Fomichev conditional residence. Two years later, with counsel, Fomichev and Pogosyan petitioned to remove the conditions on Fomichev's residence, indicating a shared address, and certifying that the petition and evidence were true and correct and that the marriage was entered in accordance with the laws of California and not for the purpose of procuring an immigration benefit. The couple attached copies of their jointly filed tax returns to the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2010, agents of the Internal Revenue Service approached Pogosyan, and she agreed to meet with them at a coffee shop. Pogosyan gave conflicting answers to the agents' initial questions about where she and Fomichev lived and about their tax returns, so the agents cautioned her that lying to federal agents is a felony and that she could be culpable and owe back taxes for false returns. At that point, Pogosyan stated she wanted to \"come clean\" and tell the agents the truth. Pogosyan said that she agreed to marry Fomichev so that he could secure U.S. citizenship, and that he agreed to pay her rent in exchange. Pogosyan then assisted the agents' investigation by recording several telephone calls with Fomichev and wearing a concealed recording device during an in-person meeting with him. In these recorded conversations, Fomichev expressed concern regarding his immigration status, saying, among other things, \"do not set us up, me and you, in regards to the immigration as no one knows, ... no one can prove anything.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In January 2011, Pogosyan testified before the grand jury that Fomichev agreed to provide housing for her in return for the marriage, that they never lived together, that the marriage was not intended to last more than a couple of years, and that\n   Fomichev needed to marry a U.S. citizen to obtain citizenship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In October 2012, Pogosyan and Fomichev filed for a divorce in state court. Their divorce was finalized in December 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In March 2013, the government charged Fomichev with three counts of subscribing to false income tax returns based on his 2006, 2007, and 2008 returns; two counts of making false statements to the United States based on certifying that his marriage was not for the purpose of procuring an immigration benefit; and two counts of making false statements in immigration documents based on the same certifications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Fomichev filed a motion to suppress the recordings of his conversations with Pogosyan and Pogosyan's testimony describing those conversations. He argued that this evidence was entitled to protection pursuant to the marital communications privilege because the statements were made while Fomichev and Pogosyan were married. He also argued that the admission of this evidence violated the Fourth Amendment. The government opposed, arguing that Fomichev was not entitled to invoke the marital communications privilege because Fomichev married Pogosyan for fraudulent purposes, and that Fomichev had no expectation of privacy in the communications because his wife had agreed to act as a government informant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After considering the arguments, the district court noted the parties' agreement that the marital communications privilege would protect the challenged evidence from being introduced at trial \"unless a recognized exception to the privilege applie[d]\" because the evidence the government sought to introduce \"constitute[d] (1) words intended as communication to the other spouse, (2) made during the course of a valid marriage, and (3) intended to be confidential.\" The district court acknowledged that although courts have regularly applied the sham marriage exception to the spousal testimonial privilege, it had \"found no cited case where the sham marriage exception ha[d] been applied to the marital communications privilege.\" Indeed, the court reasoned, \"as the communications occurred more than four years after Fomichev and Pogosyan married, it cannot be said that they married for the purpose of invoking any marital privilege.\" The court also recognized that our cases caution against what the district court described as engaging in \"the business of opining on which reasons for marriage are legitimate or deserving of marital privileges and which ones are not.\" Nevertheless, the district court determined there was no principled reason not to extend the sham marriage exception to the marital communications privilege, and it did so. The court found that: (1) Fomichev and Pogosyan married in 2006; (2) the initial plan was to find a place to live together; (3) after looking at about twenty-five options, the couple signed a lease for a residence in White Oak where Fomichev was supposed to live but never did; (4) the couple did not reside together at any time; and (5) the couple never slept in the same bed or engaged in sexual relations. The court concluded, \"[o]n the particular facts of th[e] case, the policy interests behind the marital communications privilege would not be advanced, and would surely be outweighed by the competing societal interest for truth and the administration of justice.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The district court also rejected Fomichev's Fourth Amendment argument. The court recognized that we have not decided whether the law recognizes an expectation of privacy when one spouse consents to\n   electronic monitoring, and it relied on the Supreme Court authority generally establishing that individuals have no reasonable expectation of privacy in the statements they make to government informants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The court denied Fomichev's motion to suppress, evidence of Fomichev's marital communications was admitted at trial, and the jury convicted Fomichev of four counts of making false statements or misrepresentations to the United States government in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201546\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1546\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201001\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court sentenced Fomichev to three years of probation, and Fomichev timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We review de novo an order denying a motion to suppress,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The government urges us to affirm the district court's order denying Fomichev's motion to suppress on one of three grounds: by extending the sham marriage exception, by deeming the marriage irreconcilable at the time the contested statements were made, or by finding Fomichev's statements to Pogosyan were made in furtherance of a joint criminal activity. The last argument is raised for the first time on appeal, so we do not address it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel. Kelly v. Serco, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12125932\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/846/325/#p336\">\n    846 F.3d 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 336 (9th Cir. 2017).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Fomichev separately argues that the admission of the challenged evidence violated the Fourth Amendment. The government counters that Fomichev had no expectation of privacy in the statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The District Court Erred by Extending the Sham Marriage Exception to the Marital Communications Privilege.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   It is not disputed that Fomichev and Pogosyan were married pursuant to California law from July 2006 to December 2012. The government argues that even though Fomichev and Pogosyan had been married for four years at the time the subject statements were recorded, the marriage was never valid for purposes of invoking a federal privilege because Fomichev and Pogosyan had \"no close emotional, social, or cultural ties.\" The government\n   recognizes that we have applied the sham marriage exception only to the spousal testimonial privilege, but it argues that there is no principled reason not to extend the exception to the marital communications privilege, and that allowing a defendant to hide behind the marital communications privilege while engaged in marriage fraud fails to balance the privilege against society's strong interest in the administration of justice. We are not persuaded that the exception should be extended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Federal Rule of Evidence 501 provides that, except as otherwise required by the Constitution, federal statute, or Supreme Court rule, the privilege of a witness shall be governed by the principles of common law as interpreted by United States courts \"in the light of reason and experience.\" Fed.

The question before us is limited to whether the government should be allowed to use Fomichev's private marital communications in order to prove its case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The marital communications privilege has long been recognized in our jurisprudence,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wolfle v.

Like the physician-patient and clergy-penitent privileges, the marital communications privilege recognizes that society has an enormously strong interest in preserving a particular social institution-here, the institution of marriage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Obergefell v.

We afford special protection to private communications exchanged in the confines of each of these relationships because the relationships are uniquely important, and because the law has long recognized that they will be compromised if spouses, patients, and penitents are not secure in the knowledge that their communications will be kept confidential.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Trammel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1777844\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/445/40/#p53\">\n    445 U.S. at 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1777844\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/445/40/#p53\">\n    100 S.Ct. 906\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The privileges between priest and penitent, attorney and client, and physician and patient .... are rooted in the imperative need for confidence and trust.\").

Because the district court did not make a finding about whether the subject marriage was irreconcilable when the IRS recorded Fomichev's statements, we remand for the district court to rule on irreconcilability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Sufficient Evidence Supported the Jury's Finding that Fomichev Understood the Documents He Signed.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Fomichev argues that his convictions must be vacated because there was insufficient evidence that he knew he was making false statements. Specifically, Fomichev argues the evidence offered was insufficient to show that he had the English fluency to understand the documents he signed. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \"When faced with a sufficiency of the evidence challenge, we must consider the evidence presented at trial in the light most favorable to the prosecution and then must determine whether the evidence is sufficient to allow any rational trier of fact to find the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n   <em>\n    Garrison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516631\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/1057/#p1064\">\n    888 F.3d at 1063\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). Fomichev had conversations, however simple, with the manager of his apartment building, and his accounting instructor and friend testified that Fomichev had an extensive vocabulary and average writing skills, as demonstrated by his handwritten affidavit, in English, withdrawing one of his applications. The jury had sufficient evidence to find that Fomichev's English competency was such that he understood what his signature certified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    3. We Decline to Reach Fomichev's Remaining Arguments\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The district court rejected Fomichev's argument that the admission of his statements ran afoul of the Fourth Amendment, ruling that Fomichev had no expectation of privacy because his wife served as a government informant. The district court correctly observed that our circuit has not yet decided whether the law recognizes a reasonable expectation of privacy in marital communications where, as here, one spouse consents to monitoring. We decline to reach this issue until the district court decides whether the marriage was irreconcilable as of the time Fomichev's statements were recorded.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Camreta v.

This prejudice analysis may differ on remand, depending on the district court's ruling on irreconcilability. If the district court decides on remand that Fomichev's statements were improperly admitted, its ruling on the motion for a new trial can be revisited.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The district court erroneously extended the sham marriage exception to the marital communications privilege. We vacate the district court's denial of Fomichev's motion to suppress. On remand, the district court shall decide whether the marriage was irreconcilable as of the time the challenged statements were made. In light of this decision, we vacate the district court's Fourth Amendment ruling and its denial of Fomichev's motion for new trial,\n   both of which may be reconsidered on remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    VACATED\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    REMANDED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    The government moved to dismiss the tax count related to the 2008 return before trial, and the court later granted Fomichev's motion for judgment of acquittal on the remaining tax counts.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    In the trial court, the government argued Fomichev was not entitled to invoke the marital communications privilege because Fomichev's conduct amounted to witness tampering, but it failed to cite to any authority supporting such an exception. On appeal, the government argues the well-recognized joint criminal activity exception-\"the marital communications privilege does not apply to statements made in furtherance of joint criminal activity.\"\n    <em>\n     United States v.
