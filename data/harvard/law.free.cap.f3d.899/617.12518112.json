He also appeals the district court's denial of his motion to remand to state court, claiming that the jurisdictional amount-in-controversy requirements under the Class Action Fairness Act (\"CAFA\") have not been satisfied. We conclude that we have jurisdiction under CAFA, and affirm the district court's denial of the motion to remand and grant of summary judgment to FCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In August of 2010, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (\"NHTSA\") began investigating an alleged safety defect affecting two particular kinds of Jeep Vehicles-2002-2007 Jeep Liberty vehicles and 1993-1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee vehicles. After three years of evaluating the vehicles, the NHTSA reached the preliminary conclusion that the vehicles were defective and that they faced an increased likelihood of dangerous fires in rear crashes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On June 3, 2013, the NHTSA requested that FCA initiate a safety recall of the vehicles. FCA responded by issuing a press release to the public contesting the NHTSA's findings and stating that the vehicles were \"safe and not defective.\" After two weeks passed, FCA issued a second press release, again stating that the vehicles were \"not defective.\" However, the release announced that FCA had agreed with the NHTSA to a limited recall to install a trailer hitch assembly, which it asserted would help improve vehicle performance in low-speed accidents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   David Faltermeier purchased a 2003 Jeep Liberty from an unrelated third party in August of 2013, two months after the FCA's press releases. He admits he did not see the press releases until months after purchasing the Jeep.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 2, 2015, Faltermeier filed a Class Action Petition in the Circuit Court in Jackson County, Missouri, on behalf of all purchasers of the relevant Jeep vehicles in the State of Missouri since June 4, 2013 (the date of the first press release). Faltermeier alleged that FCA's statements that the vehicles were \"safe\" and \"not defective\" were false and misleading. Faltermeier further alleged that FCA's proposed trailer hitch assembly did not remove the vehicles' safety defects in high-speed collisions and suggested that an appropriate remedy required the installation of a \"fuel shield/skid plate.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   FCA removed the case to the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri under CAFA. Faltermeier sought remand, arguing in part that CAFA's amount-in-controversy requirement was not satisfied. On February 10, 2016, the district court denied the motion to remand, finding by a preponderance of\n   the evidence that the \"benefit of the bargain\" damages alleged in this case would be above $5,000,000 dollars, if calculated as either the total value of overpayment or diminution in value damages. The court reached this conclusion by finding that 8,127 unique vehicles were potentially within the class and that the average sale price of a relevant vehicle was $6,638. Based on these facts, the court reasoned that a reasonable jury could find damages in excess of the CAFA jurisdictional limit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On March 11, 2016, Faltermeier filed an amended complaint. In his amended complaint, Faltermeier again asserted that the federal courts lacked subject matter jurisdiction because Missouri law required \"benefit-of-the-bargain\" damages to be calculated as the lesser of diminution in value or cost of repair. Faltermeier argued that since the proposed fuel shield/skid plate repair could be implemented for as little as $320 a vehicle, the amount in controversy would be far under CAFA's $5,000,000 jurisdictional limit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On May 26, 2016, the district court, recognizing that it had not fully explained alternative damages under the MMPA, entered an order clarifying its previous denial of remand. In the clarifying order, the district court addressed Faltermeier's cost of repair argument, finding that compensatory damages under Faltermeier's proposed measure of damages could total $3,605,010. The district court concluded that the $5,000,000 jurisdictional limit was satisfied after taking into consideration the amount of potential attorneys' fees, which it found could well exceed $1,400,000. The court held that a stipulation to limit attorneys' fees to ensure the amount in controversy remained under $5,000,000 did not alter the amount in controversy as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On March 24, 2017, the district court granted summary judgment against Faltermeier, holding that FCA's alleged misrepresentations were not made \"in connection with\" Faltermeier's purchase of his Jeep. The court focused in particular on the lack of evidence supporting a factual nexus between the statements and Faltermeier's interactions with the third party salesman. The court recognized that dismissal of the only named plaintiff's claim was \"not fatal to this putative class action.\" Given the state of the briefing, the court denied the motion to certify the class without prejudice, indicating that the motion could be renewed within thirty days of the order. On April 10, 2017, the parties filed a joint motion to approve a stipulation modifying the summary judgment order to remove the open language related to class certification. On April 12, 2017, the district court approved the stipulation and entered final judgment. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.
