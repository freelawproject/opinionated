Because this antitrust action is fundamentally a challenge to the United Mexican States' determination about the exploitation of its own natural resources, made by a corporation owned and controlled by the Mexican government, it is barred by the act of state doctrine. We therefore affirm the district court's dismissal of the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs, Innofood, S.A. de C.V. (\"Innofood\"), a Mexican corporation with a principal place of business in Mexico, and Sea Breeze Salt, Inc. (\"Sea Breeze\"), a California corporation based in San Diego, brought this suit in the Central District of California, alleging an antitrust conspiracy between Exportadora de Sal, S.A. de C.V. (\"ESSA\"), a Mexican salt production corporation 51-percent owned by the government of Mexico, and Mitsubishi Corporation, a Japanese entity which holds the remaining ownership interest in ESSA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs also named Mitsubishi International Corporation, a New York corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Mitsubishi Corporation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   According to the operative complaint, ESSA is the world's largest producer of solar sea salt, and produces 90 percent of Mexico's salt exports. This amounts to almost 17 percent of the total global output of salt. The complaint further alleges that \"[f]or decades, Mitsubishi has enjoyed a monopolistic stranglehold on ESSA's solar sea salt production, distribution, and sales.\" That is, ESSA sold its salt exclusively to Mitsubishi. That began to change when Jorge Lopez Portillo Basave (\"Portillo\"), a reformist, took over as ESSA's Director General and began developing distribution contracts with other companies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In February 2014, Portillo entered a contract with Innofood for the distribution of solar sea salt. However, ESSA terminated Portillo in late 2014. ESSA then refused to honor multiple purchase orders issued by Innofood under the distribution contract. Plaintiffs allege that this conduct was part of an orchestrated scheme to breach all the outside distribution contracts that Portillo had entered, and to return to dealing exclusively with Mitsubishi.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Innofood alleges that ESSA's breach precluded Innofood from fulfilling its contractual obligation to resell ESSA's salt to Sea Breeze. Sea Breeze in turn was unable to fulfill deals it had in place with purchasers in the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Innofood and Sea Breeze base five claims on ESSA's alleged decision to sell its salt exclusively to Mitsubishi: (1) illegal restraint of trade in violation of the Sherman\n   Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; (2) unlawful exclusive agreement in violation of the Clayton Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2014\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; (3) unlawful restraint of trade in violation of California's Cartwright Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2016720\">\n    Cal.

The district court dismissed the action as barred by the act of state doctrine, and therefore did not reach Mitsubishi's other arguments. It held that (1) the alleged conduct constituted the official acts of a foreign sovereign within its own borders, (2) relief would require the court to declare invalid the official acts of that foreign sovereign, and (3) no exception to the act of state doctrine applied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   ESSA was never served with process. A month after the district court dismissed the claims against Mitsubishi, it also dismissed the claims as to ESSA, for failure to serve and because \"the grounds on which the case was dismissed as to the Mitsubishi defendants would in fact apply with equal (if not greater) force to ESSA if it were to have been served with process.\" Innofood and Sea Breeze timely appealed both dismissals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"[W]e review the district court's decision concerning the act of state doctrine de novo.\"\n   <em>\n    Liu v.

Mexico's salt is a sovereign natural resource; our precedent, and that of other circuits, teaches that its exploitation is therefore a sovereign act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiffs attempt to evade this authority, arguing that ESSA's conduct is distinguishable from the granting of natural resource concessions or the production decisions involved in the OPEC cases. They contend that their suit challenges nothing more than \"everyday commercial decisions\" about salt that has already been extracted, and that these commercial decisions are performed by a government-owned entity only \"by happenstance.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   But plaintiffs' argument inaccurately characterizes the conduct alleged in their own complaint. At the core of the complaint is an allegation that Mexico-through ESSA-has decided to distribute and export the nation's sea salt\n   <em>\n    exclusively\n   </em>\n   through Mitsubishi. That is not a decision about individual lots of already-produced salt; rather, it is a policy regarding the disposition of substantially all of the salt Mexico exports on an ongoing basis. It is not an \"everyday commercial decision\" or one that, \"by happenstance,\" could have been made by a private company. We see no meaningful distinction between granting a foreign company an exclusive concession to extract salt-which plaintiffs appear to concede would be a sovereign act-and extracting that salt through a government-owned company under a policy by which the entire output is sold exclusively to one buyer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The acts alleged in the complaint also occurred in Mexico; that is, they were \"official act[s] of a foreign sovereign performed within its own territory.\"\n   <em>\n    Credit Suisse\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11894031\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/130/1342/#p1346\">\n    130 F.3d at 1346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    W.S.

Like\n   <em>\n    IAM\n   </em>\n   , this case is based on the allegedly anticompetitive acts of a sovereign in the exploitation of its own natural resources; if there is no international consensus condemning such actions, this factor weighs in favor of applying the act of state doctrine. Just as in\n   <em>\n    IAM\n   </em>\n   , the record here reveals no international norms against exclusive arrangements in the extraction and export of a country's resources.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Second, this case also has potentially important implications for our foreign relations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sabbatino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379447\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/398/#p423\">\n    376 U.S. at 428\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379447\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/398/#p423\">\n    84 S.Ct. 923\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As we explained in\n   <em>\n    IAM\n   </em>\n   , \"the very nature\" of an action that, if successful, will result in a United States court telling a foreign sovereign what to do with its own natural resources raises the \"possibility of insult to the [foreign] state[ ] and of interference with the efforts of the political branches to seek favorable relations with\" that state.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1235871\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/649/1354/#p1358\">\n    649 F.2d at 1361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Such an order would be inherently offensive to the principle of co-equality among international sovereigns,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Sarei v.

The complaint alleges that ESSA produces nine million tons of sea salt each year-90 percent of Mexico's salt exports and a full 17 percent of the total global salt output. And because the gravamen of the complaint is that it is unlawful for ESSA to distribute its salt solely through Mitsubishi, the action-and the injunction that a successful suit would bring-implicates\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of that production, not just the sales contemplated by the Innofood contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Finally, to the extent that the complaint alleges improprieties in Mitsubishi's relationship with ESSA, judicial restraint is even more warranted. If it is true that a Japanese corporation has essentially co-opted an instrumentality of the Mexican government through a \"combination of legitimate and illegitimate power,\" a judicial declaration to that effect from a United States court could be fairly regarded as a demeaning affront to Mexico's sovereign control over its own institutions. American intervention in such a delicate matter, if\n   undertaken at all, should proceed through coordinated executive branch action, rather than \"piecemeal adjudication\" in the courts.\n   <em>\n    IAM\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1235871\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/649/1354/#p1358\">\n    649 F.2d at 1358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The possibility of interference with foreign relations therefore militates against allowing this suit to proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   As to the third\n   <em>\n    Sabbatino\n   </em>\n   factor, it is undisputed that the government of Mexico continues to exist.

As laid out by the\n   <em>\n    Dunhill\n   </em>\n   plurality, a commercial exception would apply when \"foreign governments do not exercise powers peculiar to sovereigns.\"\n   <em>\n    Dunhill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6181796\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/425/682/#p695\">\n    425 U.S. at 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6181796\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/425/682/#p695\">\n    96 S.Ct. 1854\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But as explained above, the acts alleged here-decisions about the exploitation and distribution\n   <em>\n    en masse\n   </em>\n   of Mexico's sovereign natural resources-are exactly the kind of powers that\n   <em>\n    are\n   </em>\n   \"peculiar to sovereigns.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   No private citizen could make the policy decision that substantially all of Mexico's salt production should be distributed through a particular channel. As in\n   <em>\n    Clayco\n   </em>\n   , \"[b]ecause the rule espoused by the\n   <em>\n    Dunhill\n   </em>\n   plurality would not apply in any event, we need not reach the question whether to adopt an exception to the act of state doctrine for purely commercial activity.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1878084\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/712/404/#p406\">\n    712 F.2d at 408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   As a final matter, Mitsubishi argues that Sea Breeze's appeal should be dismissed because its corporate status had been suspended by the California Franchise Tax Board for failure to pay taxes. However, we have taken judicial notice of the fact that Sea Breeze's status has since been normalized. Dismissal is not required when a delinquent corporation pays its back taxes and the state restores its corporate powers while its appeal is pending.\n   <em>\n    Intercontinental Travel Mktg., Inc. v.

This decision is not a license for courts to dismiss cases on act of state grounds whenever a foreign state-owned enterprise is involved. Nor even is it an invitation to apply the doctrine in every case challenging the actions of a government-owned company that operates in an industry related to natural resources. We hold merely that on the facts of this case-which amount to a challenge to the Mexican government's policy decision about how to dispose of essentially its entire salt output-application of the act of state doctrine is appropriate to preclude our courts' consideration of the action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    ESSA's amenability to suit in the United States is also at issue in\n    <em>\n     Packsys, S.A. de C.V. v.
