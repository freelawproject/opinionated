That was the mandatory minimum under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\"the ACCA\" or \"the Act\"), and the District Court imposed it because of Peppers's previous convictions. Peppers now challenges that sentence as unconstitutional in light of the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. United States\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct. 2551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    192 L.Ed.2d 569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015), which invalidated a clause of the ACCA-the \"residual clause\"-as unconstitutionally vague. He argued in District Court in a motion under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   that he was impermissibly sentenced under that invalid clause. But that \u00a7 2255 motion was not his first, and \u00a7 2255 itself, through subsection (h), places limits on any effort to file a second or successive collateral attack on a criminal judgment. The District Court denied Peppers's second \u00a7 2255 motion after determining that his prior convictions remained predicate offenses for ACCA purposes because they are covered by portions of the Act that survived\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   . Because we disagree with the District Court's conclusions, we will vacate its decision and remand the case for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Five holdings lead to our remand. First, the jurisdictional gatekeeping inquiry for second or successive \u00a7 2255 motions based on\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   requires only that a defendant prove he might have been sentenced under the now-unconstitutional residual clause of the ACCA, not that he was in fact sentenced under that clause. Second, a guilty plea pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C) does not preclude a defendant from collaterally attacking his sentence in a \u00a7 2255 motion, if his sentence would be unlawful once he proved that the ACCA no longer applies to him in light of\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   . Third, a defendant seeking a sentence correction in a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion based on\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , and who has used\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   to satisfy the gatekeeping requirements of \u00a7 2255(h), may rely on post-sentencing cases (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the current state of the law) to support his\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   claim. Fourth, Peppers's robbery convictions, both under Pennsylvania's robbery statute, are not categorically violent felonies under the ACCA, and, consequently, it was error to treat them as such. Fifth and finally, Peppers failed to meet his burden of proving his\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   claim with respect to his Pennsylvania burglary conviction. We will therefore vacate the District Court's order and remand for an analysis of whether the error that affected Peppers's sentence, i.e., the error of treating the robbery convictions as predicate offenses under the ACCA, was harmless in light of his other prior convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    A. The Initial Trial and Subsequent Guilty Plea\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This case has a long history. In 2000, Peppers was indicted for numerous federal firearms and drug offenses. Among those charges was murder with a firearm, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (j). Peppers pled not guilty to all of the charges, but a jury saw things differently. It convicted him on every count, including the murder charge. He was sentenced to life imprisonment plus five years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Peppers filed a direct appeal, challenging, among other things, the District Court's denial of his request to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    United States v. Peppers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11435471\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/302/120/#p123\">\n    302 F.3d 120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 123 (3d Cir. 2002). We concluded that the District Court erred in handling Peppers's request to represent himself, and thus we vacated the judgment and commitment order and remanded the case for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On remand, Peppers was adamant that he did not want to go through another trial. Instead, he chose to plead guilty under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C) (the \"(C) plea\"). As part of his plea agreement with the government, he waived indictment and pled to a one-count information charging him as an armed career criminal in possession of a .22 caliber revolver, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1) and 924(e)(1). The charging document stated that Peppers had previously been convicted of a variety of state and federal felonies in six separate proceedings: first, in 1979, when he was a juvenile, for both armed robbery and robbery; second, in 1984 for burglary; third, in 1984 for possession of instruments of a crime; fourth, in 1985 for escape; fifth, in 1985 for armed robbery and criminal conspiracy; and sixth, in 1993 for criminal conspiracy to commit unauthorized use of an access device. Because of his admitted status as an armed career criminal, the mandatory minimum penalty for the crime to which Peppers pled guilty was fifteen years' imprisonment. The (C) plea was conditioned upon the District Court sentencing him to that minimum penalty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The plea agreement also stated that the parties understood the United States Sentencing Guidelines applied to the offense to which Peppers was pleading guilty. Although the agreement made plain that Peppers was being convicted and sentenced as an armed career criminal under the ACCA, it failed to disclose which of the six convictions stated in the information qualified as the three predicate \"violent felonies\" that made him eligible for enhanced penalties under the ACCA. That Act provides, in relevant part, that \"a person who violates section 922(g)... and has three previous convictions ... for a violent felony ... committed on occasions different from one another, ... shall be fined ... and imprisoned not less than fifteen years[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1). The statute defines \"violent felony\" as \"any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... that [A] has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or [B] is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or [C] otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B). The parts labeled here as [A], [B], and [C] are commonly referred to, respectively, as the force or elements clause, the enumerated offenses clause, and the residual clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At the plea colloquy, the District Court and the parties discussed only in broad terms whether the prior convictions fell within the ACCA, as the following exchange shows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    [Peppers's Counsel]:\n   </em>\n   We also agree to the applicability of the sentence enhancement under the Armed Career Criminal Act, in that the government has shown the existence of three prior convictions which meet the definitions under the Armed Career Criminal Act.

[Peppers and his attorney confer off the record.] ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    The Court:\n   </em>\n   At least, number one, the armed robbery and robbery and probably the burglary and the other armed robbery and criminal conspiracy would probably meet the Armed Career Criminal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    [Peppers's Counsel]:\n   </em>\n   The armed robbery and robbery would definitely meet the requirements of the Armed Career Criminal Act. The burglary as stated at number two would meet the requirements of the Armed Career Criminal Act. Possession of instruments of a crime may or may not. Escape may or may not. But armed robbery definitely would.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    The Court:\n   </em>\n   We have got at least three there.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    [Peppers's Counsel]:\n   </em>\n   Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (App. at 55-56.) There was no discussion concerning which of the specific ACCA clauses were thought to make three of Peppers's prior convictions \"violent felonies.\" On August 13, 2003, the District Court accepted the (C) plea and sentenced Peppers to fifteen years in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As allowed by his plea agreement,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Peppers filed a direct appeal challenging the constitutionality of the felon-in-possession statute he was convicted of violating, and we affirmed his conviction.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Peppers's First \u00a7 2255 Motion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On November 3, 2005, Peppers filed his first motion under \u00a7 2255, collaterally attacking both his conviction and sentence. He advanced nine claims, all of which were rejected by the District Court, and Peppers appealed. We granted a certificate of appealability solely as to whether Peppers's plea counsel was ineffective for allegedly misinforming him about the ACCA's application and for failing to challenge its applicability on appeal. We ultimately determined that Peppers did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel for either reason. It was not ineffective to concede that Peppers was eligible for enhanced punishment under the ACCA and to negotiate for him to receive a sentence of fifteen years in prison, rather than having him face the potential of a life sentence, which he would have risked if all the original charges had been reinstated. Thus, we affirmed the denial of Peppers's \u00a7 2255 motion.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Then, in\n   <em>\n    Welch v. United States\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12595643\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1257/\">\n    136 S.Ct. 1257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12595643\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1257/\">\n    194 L.Ed.2d 387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016), the Court made that ruling retroactive, so that it applies to cases on collateral review. Peppers filed a timely second \u00a7 2255 motion seeking resentencing based on\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   . He also submitted the required application for permission to file a second such motion, under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h) and 2244(b)(3). We allowed him to proceed with his second \u00a7 2255 motion, concluding that he had satisfied the gatekeeping requirements of \u00a7 2255(h) -which are jurisdictional-by making \"a prima facie showing that his proposed \u00a7 2255 motion contains a new rule of constitutional law made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court that was previously unavailable.\" (App. at 136.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Peppers claimed that his armed robbery convictions under Pennsylvania law no longer qualify as violent felonies after\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   invalidated the ACCA's residual clause. He also claimed that his burglary conviction under Pennsylvania law no longer qualifies as a violent felony under the ACCA. Both of those claims required the District Court to resentence him, he said, because the fifteen-year minimum imprisonment sentence dictated by the ACCA no longer applied to him and the maximum sentence for the felon-in-possession offense he pled to is only ten years' imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The government moved to dismiss the second \u00a7 2255 motion for three reasons. First, it argued that the District Court lacked jurisdiction to consider a second \u00a7 2255 motion from Peppers \"because he has not shown that the new rule of constitutional law announced in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   applies in his case.\" (App. at 173, 175-76.) Essentially, the government contended that, because the District Court never said at sentencing that Peppers's prior convictions fell under the ACCA's residual clause and Peppers submitted no evidence showing that those convictions did not fall under another ACCA clause, he failed to meet the jurisdictional gatekeeping requirements of \u00a7 2255(h). Second, the government contended that, looking to the case law that existed when Peppers was sentenced, Peppers's Pennsylvania armed robbery convictions qualify as violent felonies under the ACCA's elements clause. Finally, the government argued that Peppers's Pennsylvania burglary conviction was a violent felony under the ACCA's enumerated offenses clause, particularly in light of \"the unobjected-to-facts in the PSR[.]\" (App. at 181.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The District Court directed the government to file a supplemental brief addressing the impact of Peppers's (C) plea on his claim for resentencing based on\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   . The government did so and argued that the plea agreement precluded Peppers from challenging his sentence because the sentence was based on the agreement and the strictures of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C), not on the ACCA's invalid residual clause. Peppers countered that the plea agreement should not affect his ability to seek relief under \u00a7 2255 in light of\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   because that agreement was grounded in legal error about the residual clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The District Court ultimately denied the second \u00a7 2255 motion on the merits because it found that Peppers's predicate offenses were violent felonies under the ACCA, even in the absence of the residual clause. It noted the threshold jurisdictional issue raised by the government but did not provide any independent analysis or discussion of it. Instead, in a footnote, the Court adopted \"the reasons set forth in Peppers'[s] response\" to explain why he satisfied the jurisdictional requirements of \u00a7 2255(h). (App. at 4 n.1.) On the merits, the Court concluded that the residual clause had no effect on this case because Peppers had three predicate offenses that qualified as violent felonies under the ACCA's other clauses. Specifically, it determined that Peppers's two previous armed robbery convictions in 1979 and 1985, respectively, qualified under the elements clause, and that Peppers's burglary conviction qualified under the enumerated offenses clause. The Court reached the latter conclusion despite recognizing that the Pennsylvania burglary statute is broader than generic burglary, reasoning that the evidence showed his conviction met the elements of the generic offense. Therefore, the District Court held that Peppers was ineligible for relief under \u00a7 2255.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   We granted Peppers a certificate of appealability on the question of whether he was improperly sentenced in light of\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   He timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The government\n   contends that that provision requires a defendant to do more than merely invoke\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   and assert that he was possibly sentenced under the residual clause. Rather, the government argues, he must demonstrate that the sentencing court did in fact employ the residual clause in imposing an enhanced sentence under the ACCA. That view suggests a defendant can only pass through the jurisdictional gate by producing evidence that his sentence depended \"solely\" upon the ACCA's residual clause. (Answering Br. at 21.) Peppers counters that AEDPA's gatekeeping requirements are satisfied by showing that the sentencing judge may have used the residual clause. (Reply Br. at 4.) Peppers has the better position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The statutory text, case law from our sister circuits, and policy considerations indicate that \u00a7 2255(h) only requires a movant to show that his sentence may be, not that it must be, unconstitutional in light of a new rule of constitutional law made retroactive by the Supreme Court.

Under the rule we announce today, simply mentioning\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   in a \u00a7 2255 motion is not enough. The movant must still show that it is possible he was sentenced under the now-unconstitutional residual clause of the ACCA. There are likely to be situations where the record is clear that a defendant was not sentenced under the residual clause, either because the sentencing judge said another clause applied or because the evidence provides clear proof that the residual clause was not implicated. When that happens, the movant cannot establish that he may have been sentenced under the residual clause, and the court must dismiss the \u00a7 2255 motion for lack of jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   So we are not undermining AEDPA by holding that a movant satisfies \u00a7 2255(h) 's gatekeeping requirements with a showing that he may have been sentenced under the now-unconstitutional residual clause of the ACCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Peppers met those requirements by demonstrating that the claims in his second \u00a7 2255 motion rely on the new rule of constitutional law announced in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   and made retroactive on collateral review in\n   <em>\n    Welch\n   </em>\n   . The record indicates that Peppers was sentenced to the minimum of fifteen years' imprisonment under the ACCA because the District Court and the parties believed he had at least three prior convictions qualifying as violent felonies under that statute. But the Court did not specify the clauses under which those prior convictions qualified as violent felonies. Once it was satisfied that, as defense counsel acknowledged, there were at least three prior convictions that \"would definitely meet the requirements of the Armed Career Criminal Act[,]\" it stopped its analysis and concluded that the Act applied. (App. at 56.) Therefore, the evidence demonstrates that Peppers may have been sentenced under the ACCA's residual clause, and that, in turn, is enough to demonstrate that his motion to correct his sentence relies on the new rule of constitutional law announced in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   .

Therefore, when a new rule of constitutional law made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court renders illegal a sentence that was imposed based on a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement, a defendant who otherwise can successfully challenge that sentence in a \u00a7 2255 motion cannot be held to the unlawful term of imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Here, assuming Peppers makes a meritorious \u00a7 2255 claim, it would be unlawful for the District Court to impose upon him the sentence he is now serving based on his (C) plea agreement. If Peppers wins on the merits of his\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   claim because he was sentenced under the residual clause and his prior convictions do not fall within the remaining clauses of the ACCA, then that statute cannot be constitutionally applied to him. In the absence of the ACCA, there is no applicable sentencing enhancement that carries with it a minimum sentence of fifteen years' imprisonment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1).

Therefore, the District Court would be without authority to impose a sentence upon Peppers with a term of imprisonment any greater than ten years, even if the government and Peppers stipulated to a greater term. The plea agreement in this case does just that-it stipulates to a term of imprisonment of fifteen years. For those reasons, the (C) plea does not stand as an obstacle to Peppers's collateral attack on his sentence in light of\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Given that conclusion, we turn to the merits of Peppers's second \u00a7 2255 motion.

The District Court should analyze in the first instance whether Peppers has at least two other qualifying predicate offenses rendering any constitutional error harmless. If the Court concludes that the error was not harmless, it must proceed to correct Peppers's sentence by removing the sentencing enhancement under the ACCA and resentencing him for the underlying crime he pled guilty to-being a felon in possession of a firearm, which carries a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Accordingly, we will vacate the judgment of the District Court and remand the case for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    There was no waiver of appellate or collateral attack rights, as is often found in plea agreements.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    Specifically, we said the following:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n    Peppers's application for a certification of appealability is granted as to his claim that, in light of\n    <em>\n     Johnson v.

Yet, even if a defendant's admissions are encompassed within those forms of evidence contemplated by\n    <em>\n     Shepard\n    </em>\n    , the fact that Peppers's convictions were for \"armed robbery\" does not help us identify under which of the five subsections of Pennsylvania's robbery statute he was convicted.
