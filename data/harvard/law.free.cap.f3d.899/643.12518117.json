He filed a subsequent motion bolstering that defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After a bench trial, Judge Newsham found King not guilty of the charged violation. However, Judge Newsham did not expressly rule on King's affirmative defense. Several months later, King filed a motion pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mo.%20Ann.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20563.074\">\n    Mo. Ann.

King alleged that the City and Judge Newsham, in his official capacity, violated his federal due process rights by not granting him attorney's fees, costs, and expenses available under state law. Count 1 alleged that Judge Newsham's order \"establish[ed] a policy of 'no jurisdiction' to award costs and attorney fees under Missouri 'Justification' statutes\" and sought the costs and fees that he requested from the municipal court, $250,000 in damages, and a declaration that the \"policy\" is \"unconstitutional and void.\" Complaint at 13.

For instance, he states that under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mo.%20Ann.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20479.170.1\">\n    Mo. Ann. Stat. \u00a7 479.170.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Judge Newsham's determination that the municipal\n   court lacked jurisdiction over his petition for fees and costs obligated Judge Newsham to transfer the case to circuit court, not dismiss it. However, King's failure to raise this argument to the district court weighs against our considering it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hartman v. Workman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3762878\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/476/633/#p635\">\n    476 F.3d 633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 635 (8th Cir. 2007). Additionally, that provision applies to criminal matters: \"If ... it shall appear to the [municipal] judge that the accused ought to be put upon trial for an offense against the criminal laws of the state and not cognizable before him as municipal judge, he shall immediately ... cause the complaint to be made before some associate circuit judge.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mo.%20Ann.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20479.170.1\">\n    Mo. Ann. Stat. \u00a7 479.170.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, that statute is irrelevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   King also discusses at length legislative amendments to \u00a7 1983 concerning judicial immunity. However, the district court did not base its decision on the principle that Judge Newsham was immune from suit due to his status as a judge. Rather, as discussed above, it concluded that Judge Newsham's order was not a final policy decision and, therefore, could not create liability for the City under \u00a7 1983. Accordingly, that argument is without merit. Additionally, King tries to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Granda\n   </em>\n   because it was decided at the summary judgment stage, not, as in his case, on a motion to dismiss. The distinction makes no difference here. The appealable nature of the defendant judges' rulings in both cases is a legal conclusion unaffected by the stage of the litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Finally, King suggests that even if the complained-of conduct does not constitute a policy, it is representative of an unconstitutional custom. He points, for example, to the fact that the City's municipal court's disposition forms do not have a field for awarding costs to a defendant. However, no due process violation is present \"if a meaningful postdeprivation remedy for the loss is available.\"\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   , 375 F.3d at 702 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Hudson\n   </em>\n   , 468 U.S. at 533,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11339213\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/517/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 3194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). As discussed above, King could have sought a trial de novo in a circuit court. He might also have simply been able to re-file the petition in that court as a new case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mollenkamp,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6819369\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/482/467/\">\n    482 S.W.3d at 469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Instead of filing in the Municipal Division, Appellant must file his petition for expungement in the circuit court in which the Municipal Division is located. Municipal courts are a division of the circuit courts.\"). The availability of further process within the state court system defeats this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Judge Newsham's handling of King's case does not present a final policy or custom that can give rise to a \u00a7 1983 action. Because King failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, the district court's dismissal of the action was proper. Further, as \"[a] suit against a government officer in his official capacity is functionally equivalent to a suit against the employing governmental entity,\" a suit against a government official in only his official capacity should be dismissed as redundant if the employing entity is also named.\n   <em>\n    Veatch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6052108\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/627/1254/#p1257\">\n    627 F.3d at 1257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).
