For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that the district court properly dismissed Rayner's claims because they are precluded by the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998 (\"SLUSA\"), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78bb(f). Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   E*TRADE provides brokerage and related services to individual retail investors. Clients place orders to buy and sell securities with E*TRADE, and then E*TRADE executes those orders by delivering them to trading venues such as stock exchanges, hedge funds, banks, electronic communications networks, and third-party market makers. One such client, Rayner, placed a non-directed, standing limit order as recently as January 2014, and E*TRADE executed that order on his behalf. A \"limit order\" is \"an order to buy or sell a stock at a specified price ... or better.\" J.A. 9 n.1. Rayner's order remained \"standing\" until E*TRADE executed the order by (1) placing the order with a trading venue; and (2) the trading venue actually purchased or sold the security. Because the order was \"non-directed,\" E*TRADE retained discretion to choose the trading venue for executing Rayner's order. But\n   E*TRADE's discretion to choose trading venues is guided by its duty of best execution. And indeed, E*TRADE promises clients that it will \"do everything possible to seek best execution each and every time [a client] trade[s]\" in order to \"find the right blend of execution price, speed, and price improvement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13 (quoting E*TRADE's website).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 25, 2015, Rayner filed the Complaint on behalf of himself and other E*TRADE clients who have placed non-directed, standing limit orders. Specifically, Rayner complains that, in breach of its duty of best execution, E*TRADE prioritizes choosing the trading venues that are willing to pay the largest \"kickbacks\" in exchange for order flow.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Such a practice creates a \"conflict of interest between [E*TRADE] and [its] clients ... by incentivizing [E*TRADE to choose trading venues] that may be most cost-effective for [E*TRADE], but which may not be the best method of execution for [its] clients.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12 (quoting \"[m]arket experts [that] acknowledge that the maker-taker system sets up financial incentives that can cause brokers to act to the detriment of their retail investor clients\"). E*TRADE's clients are harmed when limit orders are routed to trading venues that pay higher kickbacks because, according to Rayner, such orders are \"up to 25% less likely to be executed,\" and more likely to \"trade when the market price is becoming worse.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19. Instead of ensuring that its clients can purchase and sell securities at the optimal price and volume, E*TRADE allegedly violates its duty of best execution by seeking to maximize its own revenue from \"kickbacks.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   E*TRADE filed a motion to dismiss, arguing\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   that Rayner's class action suit is precluded by SLUSA. In response, Rayner argued that SLUSA preclusion does not apply because (1) his Complaint does not allege that E*TRADE made a misrepresentation or omission, or employed any manipulative or deceptive device; and (2) even assuming that the Complaint alleges fraud, any such fraud was not \"in connection with\" the purchase or sale of covered securities. In a memorandum opinion and order dated April 1, 2017, the district court granted E*TRADE's motion to dismiss, concluding that \"[Rayner's] arguments against preclusion are unpersuasive.\"\n   <em>\n    Rayner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274403\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/248/497/\">\n    248 F.Supp.3d at 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Fraudulent Conduct\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We agree with the district court that, as to the third element, the gravamen of Rayner's Complaint is that E*TRADE made \"material misrepresentations and omissions that were designed to induce clients to execute non-directed, standing limit orders with E*TRADE even though E*TRADE allegedly had no intention of fulfilling its purported fiduciary obligations.\"\n   <em>\n    Rayner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274403\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/248/497/\">\n    248 F.Supp.3d at 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

According to Rayner, E*TRADE promises that it will provide best execution for its client's limit orders by \"put[ting] the interests of its customers ahead of its own ... so that the resultant price to the customer is as favorable as possible.\" J.A. 13. When clients place limit orders with E*TRADE, they expect that E*TRADE will help them \"buy or sell a stock at a specified price ...\n   <em>\n    or better\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4181839\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/784/128/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 9 n.1 (emphasis added). On its website, E*TRADE also announces that \"we do everything possible to seek best execution each and every time you\n   trade\" in order to deliver \"the right blend of execution price, speed, and price improvement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. Despite these representations (\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   through \"misrepresentation[s] ... of a material fact\"), Rayner alleges that E*TRADE violated its best execution duty by placing its own interests first and routing clients' trades to the trading venues that paid the highest \"kickbacks\" (\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   by use of a \"manipulative or deceptive device\"). As a result, instead of delivering optimal execution prices and price improvement in executing its clients' limit orders, E*TRADE was \"more likely to trade when the price move[d] against [its clients] and less likely to trade when prices move[d] in their favor.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20. The fact that the \"resulting market price\" would be more unfavorable than expected as a result of E*TRADE's routing practice was \"not known to Rayner\" or other clients at the time that they decided to purchase or sell the securities through E*TRADE-Rayner was therefore induced by an \"omission of a material fact\" to purchase and sell securities through E*TRADE. Pl.-Appellant Reply Br. 13. And likewise, rather than speedily purchasing and selling securities for its clients, and unbeknownst to those clients, the limit orders that E*TRADE executed on their behalf were \"fill[ed] slower,\" J.A. 18, and \"up to 25% less likely to be executed,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Rayner argues nonetheless that the district court failed to follow this Court's precedent because \"[a]s in\n   <em>\n    In re Kingate\n   </em>\n   , [Rayner's] claims do not require a showing of false conduct by the named defendants.\" Pl.-Appellant Br. 15 (quoting\n   <em>\n    In re Kingate\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4181839\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/784/128/\">\n    784 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   152 ) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). This argument is meritless.\n   <em>\n    In re Kingate\n   </em>\n   held that some of plaintiffs' breach of fiduciary duty claims were not precluded by SLUSA because the false conduct at issue in that case was committed by\n   <em>\n    third parties\n   </em>\n   rather than by defendants.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4181839\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/784/128/\">\n    784 F.3d at 149\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"SLUSA's preclusion applies when the state law claim is predicated on conduct\n   <em>\n    of the defendant\n   </em>\n   ....\" (emphasis in original) ).
