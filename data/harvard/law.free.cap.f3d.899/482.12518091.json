Rhines argues, as he did to the district court, that the South Dakota Supreme Court's determination that the warnings were adequate was an objectively unreasonable application of\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   We recite the relevant facts as detailed in the Supreme Court of South Dakota's opinion. In February 1992, Rhines was terminated as an employee at the Dig 'Em Donuts Shop in Rapid City. On March 8, the body of employee Schaeffer was found in the Dig 'Em Donut Shop storeroom with his hands bound and stab wounds. Approximately $3,300 was missing from the store. On June 19, Rhines was arrested in Seattle for a burglary in Washington State. After a local police officer read a\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warning, Rhines asked, \"Those two detectives from South Dakota are here, aren't they?\" He was placed in a holding cell without questioning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   That evening, Rapid City Police Detective Steve Allender and Pennington County Deputy Sheriff Don Bahr arrived to question Rhines about the Dig 'Em Donuts burglary and the murder of Schaeffer. During a suppression hearing prior to trial, Detective Allender recalled informing Rhines of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   [Allender]: You have the continuing right to remain silent. Do you understand that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [Rhines]: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   [Allender]: Anything you say can be used as evidence against you. Do you understand that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   [Rhines]: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   [Allender]: You have the right to consult with and have the presence of an attorney, and if you cannot afford an attorney, an attorney can be appointed for you free of charge. Do you understand that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [Rhines]: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [Allender]: Having these rights in mind, are you willing to answer questions?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [Rhines]: Do I have a choice?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [Allender]: Yes [you do] have a choice, in fact [you do] not have to talk with us at all.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [Allender again asked Rhines if he wanted to talk with the detectives]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [Rhines]: I suppose so, I'll answer any questions I like.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   After these warnings, Rhines gave the officers permission to tape record his statement and made a chilling confession to committing the Dig 'Em Donuts burglary and killing Schaeffer. On June 21, after Allender and Bahr gave the same warnings, Rhines again confessed to the burglary and killing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   At trial, over Rhines's objections, the prosecution introduced Detective Allender's testimony regarding Rhines's statements during the untaped portion of the June 19 interview, and recordings of the June 19 and June 21 interviews. From the recordings, the jury heard that Rhines broke into Dig 'Em Donuts to burglarize it. During the burglary, Schaeffer entered\n   the store to retrieve money and supplies for another store. Rhines stabbed Schaeffer in the stomach. With Schaeffer \"thrashing around and screaming,\" Rhines stabbed him in the upper back, then \"help[ed] him up and walk[ed] him into the back room and s[a]t him down on the pallet and walk[ed] him forward, he goes rather willingly like he's decide it's time to go.\" In the back room, Rhines stabbed Schaeffer in the head, attempting to \"stop bodily function.\" After that, with Schaeffer still breathing, Rhines \"tied his hands behind him\" and went back to the office to finish collecting money. A medical examiner testified that Schaeffer's wounds were consistent with Rhines's confession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On direct appeal, Rhines argued the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings were constitutionally deficient in three ways: (i) he was informed of his \"continuing right to remain silent,\" but not his right to cut off questioning whenever he wished; (ii) he was informed of \"the right to consult with and have the presence of an attorney,\" but not his right to an attorney before and during questioning; and (iii) he was informed that \"an attorney can be appointed for you free of charge,\" but not that an attorney would or must be appointed. The Supreme Court of South Dakota concluded the warnings were sufficient, applying the standard in\n   <em>\n    Duckworth v. Eagan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6213318\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/492/195/#p203\">\n    492 U.S. 195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 203,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6213318\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/492/195/#p203\">\n    109 S.Ct. 2875\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6213318\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/492/195/#p203\">\n    106 L.Ed.2d 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989) (\"[t]he inquiry is simply whether the warnings reasonably convey to a suspect his rights as required by\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   \"). The Court reasoned that the interview transcript demonstrated that Rhines understood his right to cut off questioning at any time; indeed, he turned off the recorder when asked about a topic he did not wish to discuss.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10698895\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/548/415/#p424\">\n    548 N.W.2d at 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

He simply disagrees with the South Dakota Supreme Court's application of\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   and clearly established federal cases interpreting\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   . That Court carefully considered each alleged deficiency in light of the warnings given and the circumstances surrounding the warnings, applying the proper Supreme Court standard and considering relevant precedent from this court. Rhines makes the conclusory assertion that the warnings did not reasonably convey his rights. But he does not explain why the warnings given were objectively unreasonable in these circumstances. Reviewing de novo, the district court did not err in\n   concluding that Rhines is not entitled to relief on this claim under AEDPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   II. Penalty Phase Issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Two of the five penalty phase issues raised on appeal concern claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel (IAC) at the penalty phase. These federal claims have a long and complicated procedural history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The trial court appointed three attorneys to represent Rhines at trial-Joseph Butler and Wayne Gilbert, both in private practice, and Michael Stonefield, a local public defender. After the jury found Rhines guilty of first-degree murder and third-degree burglary, the case proceeded to the sentencing phase. The prosecution incorporated evidence from the guilt phase and rested. The defense presented testimony of Rhines's two sisters. They described his academic, behavioral, and social struggles as a child and teenager. They testified that he dropped out of school in early high school, was not helped by enlisting in the military at age seventeen, and struggled with his sexuality as a gay man who grew up in a conservative, Midwestern family. Consistent with South Dakota law, the jury found that one or more statutory aggravating circumstances existed and sentenced Rhines to death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   After his conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal, Rhines applied to the state trial court for a writ for habeas corpus. Represented by new, independent appointed counsel, the Second Amended Application raised forty-six issues, including ten claims of IAC by trial and appellate counsel. The ninth claim was that trial counsel \"failed to investigate his background for mitigation evidence.\" After an evidentiary hearing at which the three trial attorneys testified and the subsequent submission of deposition testimony by a defense attorney expert, the trial court denied the application in a lengthy letter ruling discussing many allegations of trial counsel IAC. With respect to the penalty phase claim, Judge Tice wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (24) Failure to investigate defendant's background to provide effective mitigation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   As discussed earlier, there were substantial efforts made to develop mitigation evidence. Trial counsel used reasonable efforts to do so. There is no evidence to support a belief that any further efforts would have been fruitful.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Rhines appealed this ruling to the Supreme Court of South Dakota. Regarding the penalty phase IAC claim, Rhines argued that his trial attorneys' billing records \"showed that only a cursory amount of work was devoted to mitigation witnesses. The problem is we do not know if there is mitigation evidence favorable ... because the work was not done.\" The Supreme Court of South Dakota affirmed in February 2000. After lengthy review of three guilt phase IAC issues, the Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Rhines raises several other issues relating to ineffective assistance of counsel in his brief. However, these remaining instances are either conclusions, which are wholly unsupported by the record, or sound trial strategy when judged by the circumstances facing trial counsel at the time of their decisions. ... Rhines has not proven either prong of the [IAC] test in regard to these claims.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    Rhines\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11454015\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/608/303/#p305\">\n    608 N.W.2d at 313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Rhines immediately filed a federal habeas petition; a First Amended Petition filed in November 2000 alleged thirteen grounds for relief. The district court concluded that numerous grounds were unexhausted and stayed the petition pending exhaustion of Rhines's state court remedies. The State appealed, we reversed; the Supreme Court, resolving a conflict in the\n   circuits, held that, \"in limited circumstances,\" the district court \"has discretion to stay the mixed petition to allow the petitioner to present his unexhausted claims to the state court ... and then to return to federal court for review of his perfected petition.\"\n   <em>\n    Rhines v.

In December 2005, the district court granted a stay. The court concluded that two penalty phase IAC issues were claims that may not have been exhausted in Rhines's state habeas proceeding-that trial counsel's presentation of mitigation evidence was \"tepid,\" and that counsel failed to hire a mitigation expert.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Rhines then returned to the South Dakota state courts and exhausted his unexhausted claims, including these two penalty phase IAC claims, in a successive state habeas proceeding. Based on the evidentiary record from the initial state habeas proceeding, and extensive affidavits and exhibits submitted by the State, the trial court granted the State's motion for summary judgment on the merits of the penalty phase IAC claims.\n   <em>\n    Rhines v.

Judge Trimble also ruled that one claim, that counsel presented only \"tepid\" mitigation evidence at the penalty phase, was raised in the first habeas proceeding, was decided by Judge Tice, and was therefore precluded by res judicata. The Supreme Court of South Dakota denied probable cause to appeal, and the Supreme Court of the United States denied Rhines's petition for certiorari review.\n   <em>\n    Rhines v.

The Failure To Investigate Claim\n   </em>\n   . Rhines argues that trial counsel were ineffective because they failed to conduct an adequate mental health investigation, failed to provide adequate background information to a retained psychiatrist, failed to follow up on the results of psychological testing, and inadequately investigated Rhines's family background and school and military records. Prior to trial, Rhines was evaluated by Dr. D.J. Kennelly, a psychiatrist, for competency, mental illness, and sanity, and Dr. Bill H. Arbes, a psychologist. Dr. Kennelly found no signs of mental illness, but saw signs of personality deficits. Dr. Arbes's report found that Rhines suffered from general anxiety disorder and schizotypal personality disorder with paranoid, schizoid, or avoidant traits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In denying this claim after a full evidentiary hearing, Judge Tice noted: \"there were substantial initial efforts made to develop mitigation evidence. Trial counsel used reasonable efforts to do so. There is no evidence to support a belief that any further efforts would have been fruitful.\" The Supreme Court of South Dakota cryptically affirmed this ruling. But Judge Trimble, laying foundation for considering the unexhausted tepid-presentation claim on an expanded summary judgment record, described trial counsel's investigative efforts in greater detail:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   A review of the record reveals that Rhines' counsel did investigate possible mitigation evidence. They investigated by talking to Rhines, his family and friends, reviewing his military service records, his schooling, employment history, psychiatric and psychological examinations and found that there was very little mitigating evidence to be found or presented. Counsel also looked to Rhines for information. Gilbert asked him to write an autobiography from which he hoped to obtain mitigating information. The information revealed in this autobiography was at best disturbing. Rhines autobiography described his poor performance in school The attached affidavits from his teachers reveal that he was disruptive, defiant and rebellious. The affidavit from Rhines' childhood friend, Kerry Larson, indicates that Larson's testimony would not be favorable to Rhines. He describes Rhines as \"intimidating and scary\" and knew of Rhines' attempt to blow up the grain elevator. He also said Rhines had a reputation for being a fire starter, and for abusing small animals. He also stated that he witnessed Rhines pouring gasoline on an anthill and setting it on fire in the 6th grade. Furthermore, the other friends that Rhines named in his answers to interrogatories as being helpful in the mitigation case, were interviewed and they did not provide any favorable testimony to support Rhines' allegations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   His military records show that he was jailed and disciplined and Article 15'd on numerous occasions for insubordination, drug use, theft of plastic explosives, and assault with a deadly weapon on a fellow service member. In 1976, Rhines was discharged on less than honorable conditions 4 months before the completion of his enlistment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   After leaving the military, Rhines briefly attended college until he burgled\n   a dorm room in 1977. He then obtained employment with an excavating contractor where he was taught to use dynamite. His employment ended when he stole his employer's dynamite and wired a grain elevator to explode. One of his employers became aware of his plan and rushed to the elevator and unwired the dynamite before Rhines could explode it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   Between his release from the penitentiary in 1987 and the 1992 murder, Rhines worked various jobs. He worked at a doughnut shop in Seattle, Washington, until he embezzled approximately $40,000 from the company by forging payroll checks made payable to himself.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   * * * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   [Trial counsel] Gilbert further explained in his affidavit that Rhines' sisters were emphatic that their elderly mother could not take the stand or assist in his defense. Gilbert stated that the defense team met with Dr. D.J. Kennelly, a psychiatrist and that he did not recognize anything in his report as being useful as mitigation evidence. Dr. Kennelly consulted with Dr. Bill H. Arbes, a psychologist, and no useful evidence was gleaned from his report, either. Gilbert stated that he discussed having Rhines giv[e] his own allocution but it was determined that Rhines' allocution would not be convincing. He further stated that Rhines agreed that his allocution would not be effective.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Based largely on Dr. Ertz's report, which we may not consider on this issue, Rhines argues that trial counsel \"bungled\" the mental health investigation and \"never conducted a thorough investigation of Mr. Rhines's background and history.\" But \"strategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on investigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    466 U.S. at 690-91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Gibson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9399969\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/278/1044/#p1053\">\n     278 F.3d 1044\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1053 (10th Cir. 2001). Rhines argues\n    <em>\n     Nooner\n    </em>\n    is distinguishable because it did not involve an aggravating factor statute. As the victim impact evidence in this case was not admitted under S.D.C.L. \u00a7 23A-27A-1, we need not consider this issue.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    Rhines further argues that the refusal to provide a curative instruction to prevent \"rank speculation regarding life imprisonment without parole\" violated the Eighth Amendment as construed in\n    <em>\n     Boyde v. California\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4909\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/494/370/#p380\">\n     494 U.S. 370\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 380,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4909\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/494/370/#p380\">\n     110 S.Ct. 1190\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4909\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/494/370/#p380\">\n     108 L.Ed.2d 316\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1990). This claim was never raised to the state courts and is therefore procedurally barred.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
