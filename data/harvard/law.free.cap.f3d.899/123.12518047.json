Baker was convicted after a jury determined that he was guilty of participating in a conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute more than 100 grams of heroin in violation of the Controlled Substances Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), 841(b)(1)(B), 846, and 851. Baker raises two issues in this appeal from his judgment of conviction: First, that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction; and second, that the district court erred in denying his request to conduct post-trial interviews of jurors. For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that Baker's arguments lack merit. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As relevant here, Baker was charged on November 5, 2015 in a single count superseding indictment with conspiring to distribute and possess with intent to distribute 100 grams or more of a mixture or substance containing heroin. The evidence presented at his trial established that between January and mid-June 2015, in Albany and Schenectady Counties, New York, Baker participated in this conspiracy with Kandi Kennedy, who testified. Over the course of the conspiracy, Kennedy sold heroin and also fentanyl to two confidential informants (\"CI1\" and \"CI2\") working for the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\") on five separate occasions; she attempted to sell heroin in a sixth transaction that ended in the arrests of both Kennedy and Baker. Kennedy testified that Baker, the father of her only child, was her supplier; that Baker personally handed the drugs over to her at her house in Schenectady; and that after each drug sale, she split the money proceeds with him, so that she kept 10% and Baker took the remaining 90%. The jury also heard evidence that the CIs purchased drugs from Kennedy for $110 or $115 per gram.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Kennedy testified that Baker often accompanied her when she sold heroin or fentanyl to CI1 and CI2. Four of the five\n   completed transactions occurred in the parking lot of a shopping plaza with retail stores including T.J. Maxx and Target in Latham, New York (\"Shopping Plaza\"). When Baker accompanied her on a transaction, Baker and Kennedy would drive together in the same car from Kennedy's house to the Shopping Plaza. The drive took approximately 20 minutes. Upon arrival, Baker would exit the car first and wait inside the T.J. Maxx store. Meanwhile, Kennedy would meet CI1 and CI2 in the parking lot to complete the drug sale. After the sale, which usually lasted only five to ten minutes, Kennedy would meet Baker inside the T.J. Maxx before driving with him back to Kennedy's home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In addition to Kennedy's testimony, the government presented other direct and circumstantial evidence of Baker's involvement in the conspiracy, including testimony from the two CIs and law enforcement agents, chemical forensic analyses of the controlled substances, recorded telephone calls and text messages between Kennedy and CI1 and also between Kennedy and Baker, and audio or video recordings of the drug transactions. Some of this corroborating evidence is described in more detail below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I. The First Transaction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The first of the five completed drug transactions took place in January 2015. CI1 testified that on January 27, he called Kennedy and arranged to meet the next day so he could buy $500 worth of heroin from her. The next day, however, Kennedy told CI1 that she did not have the heroin ready because she fell asleep around 9:30 P.M. the night before, and missed a call from her supplier at approximately 10:30.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The only call that Kennedy received after 9:19 P.M. the night before was a call at 10:14 P.M. from Baker's number, which was forwarded to Kennedy's voicemail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Although Kennedy was unable to supply the heroin on January 28, the transaction took place the next day, January 29, when Kennedy met with CI1 at approximately 12:00 P.M. or 1:00 P.M. and sold him 3.8 grams of a substance containing heroin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The Second, Third, and Fourth Transactions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The next transactions followed a similar pattern and took place in February and March 2015. In a video-recorded transaction, for instance, CI1 and CI2 met with Kennedy at the Shopping Plaza on February 16 and purchased 13.9 grams of a substance containing heroin from her. CI1 then contacted Kennedy again on February 24 at about 4:37 P.M. and asked her to call her supplier to check the price of heroin:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   CI1: [H]ave your people see what's the best number they can do, cause after the next one it's gonna be at least 100.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Kennedy: I can check into it, but you know.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   CI1: Alright, just give 'em a call real quick if they can do a little better. Hit me right back.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   App. 88-90, 363-64. Eight minutes later, at 4:45 P.M., Kennedy called CI1 back to tell him that she was unable to reach her supplier: \"I didn't get an answer, but ... I'm sure that they're going to call me back\n   as soon as possible.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    at 90-91, 365-66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Kennedy's phone records, introduced at trial, reflect only one phone call during the eight-minute period in between her calls with CI1 at 4:37 P.M. and 4:45 P.M.-Kennedy called Baker's number at 4:39 P.M. About two weeks later, on March 6, Kennedy met with CI1 and CI2 at about 1:15 P.M. in the Shopping Plaza and sold them 26.2 grams of a substance containing heroin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The next transaction was on March 26. Kennedy arrived at the Shopping Plaza at approximately 1:30 P.M. in a car registered to Baker. There, she met with CI1 and CI2 again and sold them 27.4 grams of a substance containing fentanyl. Less than ten minutes after Kennedy completed the sale, a law enforcement agent observed Baker and Kennedy exiting the T.J. Maxx together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    III. The Fifth Transaction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On May 11, 2015 at 11:06 A.M., CI1 called Kennedy again, this time seeking to purchase 64 grams of heroin.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   They discussed meeting either later that day or the next day. Kennedy then texted Baker: \"Call my [sic] ASAP ... Tia called ... Wants to see me ASAP.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   App. 541. Baker called Kennedy back six minutes later at 11:12 A.M. The jury heard a recording of this conversation, which was intercepted pursuant to court-ordered wiretap surveillance of Kennedy's telephone communications. During the conversation, Baker queried Kennedy as to when \"Tia\" needed \"it\" and affirmed that he could \"make it happen.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    at 176-79, 525-26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At 11:19 A.M., within a few minutes of this conversation, Kennedy called CI1 again to confirm when CI1 would be available to meet to buy heroin from her. CI1 explained that he was not available to meet that day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The following Monday, May 18, CI1 and Kennedy connected by phone again, and CI1 confirmed that he wanted to meet on Wednesday \"in between like 12 and 1ish,\" and that \"the jacket is a size 56,\" meaning that he now wished to purchase 56 grams of heroin.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    at 185, 530-31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Kennedy called CI1 the next day at 6:25 P.M. to tell him that instead of 56 grams, she would only be able to sell him 28 grams. The pair again used coded language, with Kennedy advising that \"I'm only going to be able to get the pants, not the ... jacket too, not until Friday at least,\" to which CI1 responded, \"The pants is just a 28?\" App. 533. Approximately two hours later, Baker called Kennedy and they had the following conversation, which was again intercepted by wiretap:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   KENNEDY: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   BAKER: Yeah I'll be able to do that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   KENNEDY: Oh, you will?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   BAKER: Yup.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   KENNEDY: Ok. Thank you that's a good look cause I, I really needed, I needed that to happen.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   BAKER: Alright.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   KENNEDY: I appreciate it. So I'll talk to you tomorrow about twelve, twelve thirty, ok?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   BAKER: Yeah.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   KENNEDY: Alright.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    at 187-88, 534-35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Five minutes after her conversation with Baker, Kennedy texted CI1 saying, \"I got the pants and jacket,\" thus confirming that she would be able to sell him the full amount of heroin requested-56 grams. Gov't App. 64;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   App. 113-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On Wednesday, May 20, Kennedy and CI1 were scheduled to meet at the Shopping Plaza at approximately noon or 1 P.M. for the sale of 56 grams of heroin. Baker called Kennedy at 12:41 P.M. and said, \"Yeah I'm almost to you, I'll be there in like two minutes.\" App. 536-37. Twenty minutes later, at 1:01 P.M., CI1 texted Kennedy to say, \"I'm here r u by tj maxx\" and Kennedy responded, \"No. Be there in 10.\" Gov't App. 66. When Kennedy arrived at the Shopping Plaza, she was driving a car registered to Baker. Law enforcement agents observed Baker exit that vehicle, and walk into T.J. Maxx. Kennedy then drove approximately 25 or 30 yards away to a meeting place in the parking lot where she sold 49.8 grams of a substance containing fentanyl to CI1 and CI2. After completing the sale, Kennedy drove back towards T.J. Maxx, parked, and walked into the same T.J. Maxx store that Baker had entered moments before.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. The Arrests\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On Monday, June 15, 2015, Kennedy and CI1 agreed to meet the next day at 1:00 P.M. in the Shopping Plaza. Kennedy agreed to sell CI1 two ounces of heroin on Tuesday and another two ounces on Thursday. On Tuesday, Kennedy and Baker arrived at the Shopping Plaza in a car registered to Baker. Upon arrival, Kennedy dropped Baker off at the T.J. Maxx. Kennedy then proceeded to her meeting with CI1 and CI2, but she was arrested in the parking lot before she was able to complete the sale.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Baker was arrested soon after that, as he was exiting the T.J. Maxx store.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    V. The Trial and Jury Verdict\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Trial commenced on December 15, 2015. Baker did not put on a defense case. After deliberating for approximately three hours, the jury returned a guilty verdict on December 18, 2015. In addition to determining that Baker participated in a conspiracy to distribute drugs, the jury also made a finding that it was reasonably foreseeable to Baker that the conspiracy involved 100 grams or more of heroin. The district court polled the jury and each juror confirmed the verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. Post-Trial Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   By letter dated December 28, 2015, Baker moved\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to Rule 29 and for a new trial pursuant to Rule 33. Fed. R. Crim. P. 29, 33. Then, about five weeks after the jury verdict, on January 25, 2016, Juror No. 10 left a voicemail for Baker's trial counsel, Arthur Frost. Juror No. 10 followed-up with an email to Frost a few days later expressing \"several concerns\" that \"perhaps ... will be helpful to you and your client.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    at 70-71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Among other things, Juror No. 10 advised as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   The jury was instructed on several occasions to \"keep an open mind\" and not discuss the case among themselves until it received the case from the Court. This did not happen. There was discussion among many of the jurors during virtually every break. And after the verdict was rendered I overheard one juror say that he knew the defendant was guilty\n   the first time he saw him (before he was sworn in as a juror).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    at 70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Frost scheduled a meeting with Juror No. 10. On the day of the scheduled meeting, however, Frost notified the district court that he planned to meet with Juror No. 10 later that evening, and sought \"further guidance from the Court on how to proceed.\" App. 556. The district court asked the parties to brief the issue and Frost cancelled his meeting pending the district court's decision on his application for leave to obtain an affidavit from Juror No. 10 for presentation to the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   On April 12, 2016, the district court denied Baker's \"application for permission to inquire further of the jurors about whether the jury engaged in premature deliberations, or if a juror lied during\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   .\" Special App. 8-9. The district court stated \"[t]he proffered resulting testimony would be inadmissible for purposes of challenging the validity of the verdict, see Fed. R. Evid. 606(b), and any further inquiry in the manner suggested by Defendant would be futile.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On May 5, 2016, the district court denied Baker's Rule 33 motion for a new trial and Rule 29 motion for a judgment of acquittal, concluding\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   that \"[v]iewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime of conviction proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    at 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Sentencing was held on August 10, 2016. The district court imposed a term of imprisonment of 180 months, to be followed by eight years of supervised release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   On appeal, Baker first argues that the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to support his conviction. Next, Baker argues that the district court erred in denying his application to conduct post-verdict juror interviews. We address each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   We agree with the district court that the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to show that Baker conspired to distribute more than 100 grams of heroin. We review sufficiency of evidence challenges\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   , but defendants face \"a heavy burden, as the standard of review is exceedingly deferential.\"\n   <em>\n    Brock\n   </em>\n   , 789 F.3d at 63 (citation omitted). \"[W]e must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the [g]overnment, crediting every inference that could have been drawn in the [g]overnment's favor, and deferring to the jury's assessment of witness credibility and its assessment of the weight of the evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks, brackets, and citation omitted). And \"[w]e will sustain the jury's verdict if\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Kennedy testified that she sold heroin several times in 2015; Baker was her supplier and he physically handed heroin over to her at her house; Baker sometimes accompanied her when she met CI1 and CI2 to sell them heroin; and Baker kept 90% of the proceeds from all of her sales. Because a federal conviction \"may be supported by the uncorroborated testimony of even a single accomplice... if that testimony is not incredible on its face,\" Kennedy's testimony alone was sufficient to convict Baker.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Parker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10532841\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/903/91/#p97\">\n    903 F.2d 91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 97 (2d Cir. 1990). Baker argues that Kennedy's \"self-serving testimony\" was uncorroborated and should be rejected as \"incredible on its face\" because she \"received an extraordinarily\n   cushy deal despite her extensive criminal history, her prior drug dealing, and her lying to the police and under oath.\" Def.-Appellant Br. 23-24. But this argument amounts to challenging Kennedy's \"credibility based on [her] plea agreement[ ] with the government and [her] long histor[y] of criminal and dishonest behavior,\" and \"simply repeats facts and arguments already presented to the jury.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

During Kennedy's cross-examination, Baker's trial counsel focused almost exclusively on providing the jury with examples of Kennedy's dishonesty, noting inconsistencies in Kennedy's testimony, and explaining Kennedy's incentives to testify untruthfully. Baker's trial counsel also used a significant portion of his closing statement to expound upon how \"Kennedy is a liar,\" referring to Kennedy as \"Kandi the liar.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dec. 18, 2015 Trial Tr. 547-54, 557-58, 560-61,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Sept. 29, 2016), ECF No. 81. \"We will not attempt to second-guess a jury's credibility determination on a sufficiency challenge,\" particularly when, as is the case here, trial counsel already presented these same credibility arguments to the jury.\n   <em>\n    Florez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5858828\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/447/145/#p156\">\n    447 F.3d at 156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Furthermore, even if corroborating evidence were necessary (and it is not), there was in fact ample corroborating evidence here to support the potential \"inference[s] that the jury may have drawn in the government's favor\" on the basis of Kennedy's testimony alone.\n   <em>\n    United States v.
