In such circumstances, federal law commands that the EPA ban such a pesticide from use on food products unless \"there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from aggregate exposure to the pesticide.\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 346a(b)(2)(A)(ii). Yet, over the past decade and more, the EPA has stalled on banning chlorpyrifos, first by largely ignoring a petition properly filed pursuant to law seeking such a ban, then by temporizing in response to repeated orders by this Court to respond to the petition, and, finally, in its latest tactic, by denying outright our jurisdiction to review the ultimate denial of the petition, even while offering no defense on the merits. If Congress's statutory mandates are to mean anything, the time has come to put a stop to this patent evasion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Petitioners seek review of an EPA order issued March 29, 2017 (the \"2017 Order\" or \"Order\") that denied a 2007 petition to revoke \"tolerances,\" i.e. limited allowances, for the use of chlorpyrifos on food products. Petitioners argue that the EPA does not have the authority to maintain the tolerances for chlorpyrifos under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (\"FFDCA\"), which authorizes the EPA to \"leave in effect a tolerance for a pesticide chemical residue in or on a food only if the Administrator determines that the tolerance is safe\"-with \"safe,\" in turn, defined to mean that the EPA \"has determined that there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from aggregate exposure to the pesticide chemical residue.\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 346a(b)(2)(A)(i)-(ii). Respondent, the EPA, has never made any such determination and, indeed, has itself long questioned the safety of permitting chlorpyrifos to be used within the allowed tolerances. The EPA, therefore, does not defend the 2017 Order on the merits. Instead, the EPA argues that, despite petitioners having properly-filed administrative objections to the 2017 Order more than a year ago, and despite the statutory requirement that the EPA respond to such objections \"as soon as practicable,\" the EPA's utter failure to respond to the objections deprives us of jurisdiction to adjudicate whether the EPA exceeded its statutory authority in refusing to ban use of chlorpyrifos on food products.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   We hold that obtaining a response to objections before seeking review by this Court is a claim-processing rule that does not restrict federal jurisdiction, and that can, and here should, be excused. There being no other reason not to do so, we grant the petition on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    The Statutory Framework\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The FFDCA authorizes the EPA to regulate the use of pesticides on foods according\n   to specific statutory criteria.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20301\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 399i.

Furthermore, even after establishing a tolerance, the EPA bears continuous responsibility to ensure that the tolerance continues to satisfy the FFDCA's safety standard; the FFDCA provides that the Administrator may \"leave in effect a tolerance ... only if the Administrator determines that the tolerance is safe\" and \"shall modify or revoke a tolerance if the Administrator determines it is not safe.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20301\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 346a(b)(2)(A)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The EPA is subject to these same safety standards in exercising its authority to register pesticides under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (\"FIFRA\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136a(a).

Chlorpyrifos, an organophosphate pesticide initially developed as a nerve gas during World War II, was approved in 1965 in the United States as a pesticide for agricultural, residential, and commercial purposes. Chlorpyrifos kills insects by suppressing acetelycholinestrerase, an enzyme that acts as a neurotransmitter in various organisms, including humans. The EPA has set chlorpyrifos residue tolerances for 80 food crops, including fruits, nuts, and vegetables.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20180.342\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 180.342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The 2007 Petition, filed by the Pesticide Action Network North America (\"PANNA\") and the Natural Resources Defense Council (\"NRDC\"), presented scientific studies showing that children and infants who had been exposed prenatally to low doses of chlorpyrifos suffer harms such as reduced IQ, attention deficit disorders, and delayed motor development, that last into adulthood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Prior to the Petition's filing, the EPA already had concerns about chlorpyrifos. After reviewing the registration for chlorpyrifos in 1998 under the amended FFDCA's heightened safety standards that required considering cumulative exposure and the specific risks to children, the EPA cancelled all residential uses. Although the EPA continued to allow the use of chlorpyrifos as a pesticide on food crops,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20180.342\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 180.342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , it required that \"risk mitigation measures\" be implemented while a full reassessment of chlorpyrifos was undertaken, as continued usage of chlorpyrifos without additional precautions \"would present risks inconsistent with FIFRA.\" EPA 738-R-01-007 \"Interim Reregistration Eligibility Decision for Chlorpyrifos\" (Feb. 2002). This \"interim reregistration\" also announced future plans to reduce or revoke entirely chlorpyrifos tolerance levels for certain crops, citing \"acute dietary risks\" for \"infants, all children, and nursing females.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20180.342\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Despite these earlier expressions of concern, the EPA failed to take any decisive action in response to the 2007 Petition, notwithstanding that the EPA's own internal studies continued to document serious safety risks associated with chlorpyrifos use, particularly for children. A 2008 EPA Science Issue Paper, reviewing existing scientific studies, \"preliminarily concluded that chlorpyrifos likely played a role\" in low birth rate and delays in infant mental development observed in human cohort studies. A Science Advisory Panel convened in 2008 concurred that chlorpyrifos exposures \"can lead to neurochemical and behavioral alterations [in the young] that persist into adulthood.\" A Science Advisory Panel convened in 2011 found \"persuasive\" evidence \"that there are enduring effects on the Central Nervous System ... from chlorpyrifos exposure at or above 1.0 mg/kg,\" and that chlorpyrifos exposure is associated with adverse neurodevelopmental effects in children, including abnormal reflexes, pervasive development disorder, and attention and behavior problems.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Yet, even after all of these EPA studies, by 2012 the EPA still had not responded to the 2007 Petition. PANNA and NRDC thereupon petitioned this Court for a writ of mandamus to force the EPA to take action. We initially dismissed the mandamus petition, without prejudice to its renewal, based on the EPA's representation that it had a \"concrete timeline for final agency action\" to be taken on the 2007 Petition by February 2014.\n   <em>\n    In re PANNA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4173575\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/532/649/#p651\">\n    532 F.

The impact of a jurisdictional finding must be considered within the context of the administrative process Congress was establishing in the relevant statute, and the values that process was meant to protect. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Henderson\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court addressed the impact of a jurisdictional finding on the process established by Congress for adjudicating veterans' benefits claims considering the \"solicitude of Congress for veterans\" reflected in the review scheme.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6023194,4151926,12457263\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/1197/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Applying this analysis to the present case, a jurisdictional finding would mean that under no circumstances could persons obtain judicial review of a denial of a petition prior to an EPA response to an administrative objection, even under exigent circumstances where the EPA was unwilling or unable to act. The EPA could evade judicial review simply by declining to issue a (g)(2)(c) order in response to an objection, requiring petitioners to seek writs of mandamus to order EPA action on objections. The history of this very case vividly illustrates this danger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The language Congress used hardly suggests an intention to allow this scenario. Section 346a(g)(2) instructs the EPA to respond \"as soon as practicable\" to objections filed. Providing only a brief administrative review process makes sense. By the time an administrative objection is filed, the EPA has already fully considered the petition at issue and issued either a \"final regulation\" or, as here, \"an order denying the petition.\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 346a(d)(4)(A)(iii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Furthermore, \u00a7 346a(h)(1) provides direct access to the Courts of Appeals to challenge such EPA determinations. Broad, efficient, and prompt access to judicial review is consistent with the other values expressed by the statutory scheme:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   prioritizing public involvement in monitoring tolerances, as evidenced by the \u00a7 346a(d) petition process; and requiring quick EPA responses to changing scientific evidence, as evidenced by the EPA's continuing obligation to ensure that tolerances remain in compliance with the FFDCA's safety standards.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 346a(b)(2)(A)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   We have recognized that \"determining what has and what has not been exhausted ... may prove an inexact science\" and that \"questions about whether administrative proceedings would be futile, or whether dismissal of a suit would be consistent with the general purposes of exhaustion, are better addressed through a fact-specific assessment of the affirmative defense than through an inquiry about whether the court has the power to decide the case at all.\"\n   <em>\n    Payne\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3822008\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/653/863/#p869\">\n    653 F.3d at 870\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finding that a (g)(2)(C) order is a jurisdictional prerequisite would mean that courts would have no ability to analyze whether the administrative process was serving an important role in furthering the development of necessary evidence or was of little value for the issue in question, no matter the significance or the urgency of the question awaiting judicial review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The EPA makes three main arguments that \u00a7 346a(g)(2)(C) is in fact jurisdictional. None are persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   First, the EPA argues that a 1996 amendment to the language of the FFDCA's judicial review provision changing the reviewable orders listed in \u00a7 346a(h)(1), indicated a Congressional intent to condition jurisdiction over any orders not listed in Section 346a(h)(1) on their completion of the administrative appeals process. The EPA provides no support for this account of Congressional motivation, which it loosely suggests was a response to a D.C. Circuit decision from nearly a decade earlier finding that the language in the prior version did not require completing an administrative hearing process before filing for judicial review. In fact, the legislative history indicates that the amended statute \"retain[ed] most of the existing provisions\" regarding judicial review. H.R. Rep. No. 104-669(II), at 49 (1996). But even assuming that Congress's intent with this amendment was to have orders issued in response to petitions go through the \u00a7 346a(g)(2) administrative objections process prior to judicial review, that does not bear on the relevant question here, whether Congress intended the new rule as a claims-processing rule or a jurisdictional limitation on the courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Second, the EPA argues that the structure of the administrative objections process itself indicates that the process was intended as a jurisdictional requirement, rather than a claims-processing rule. This argument relies almost entirely on the similarity between \u00a7 346a(g)(2) 's objections process and an administrative appeal process that we found jurisdictional in\n   <em>\n    Gallo Cattle Co. v. United States Department of Agriculture\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1615422\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/159/1194/\">\n    159 F.3d 1194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 1998). However,\n   <em>\n    Gallo\n   </em>\n   was premised on a view of statutory exhaustion that is inconsistent with subsequent Supreme Court precedent and later decisions in this circuit.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1615422\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/159/1194/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1615422\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/159/1194/\">\n    at 1197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[S]tatutorily-provided exhaustion requirements deprive the court of jurisdiction....\"),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McBride\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9435744\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/290/973/#p978\">\n    290 F.3d at 980\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[N]ot all statutory exhaustion requirements are created equal.

Moreover, even without this change in case law,\n   <em>\n    Gallo\n   </em>\n   would be inapposite. Unlike \u00a7 346a(h)(1),\n   the provision evaluated in\n   <em>\n    Gallo\n   </em>\n   was explicitly jurisdictional, providing that \"[t]he district courts of the United States ...\n   <em>\n    are hereby vested with jurisdiction\n   </em>\n   to review [the administrative] ruling.\"\n   <em>\n    Gallo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1615422\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/159/1194/\">\n    159 F.3d at 1197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Finally, the EPA argues that this Court's statement in its most recent decision in the prior mandamus action forecloses this conclusion. It does not. That decision denied PANNA and the NRDC's petition for further mandamus relief because it was premised on the ground that the 2017 Order failed to meet the requirements for a final order. Rejecting that view and finding that the 2017 Order was a final denial of the 2007 Petition, this Court instructed PANNA and the NRDC that \"[f]iling objections and awaiting their resolution by the EPA Administrator is a prerequisite to obtaining judicial review of [the] EPA's final response to the petition. Only at that point may we consider the merits of [the] EPA's final agency action.\"\n   <em>\n    In re PANNA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276095\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/863/1131/#p1132\">\n    863 F.3d at 1133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The crux of petitioners' challenge is that the EPA has found that chlorpyrifos is not safe and therefore cannot maintain a tolerance for it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Allowing the petition to proceed would not reward failure to properly exhaust administrative remedies. \"Proper exhaustion demands compliance with an agency's deadlines and other critical procedural rules because no adjudicative system can function effectively without imposing some orderly structure on the course of its proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    Woodford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500482\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/81/#p89\">\n    548 U.S. at 90-91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500482\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/81/#p89\">\n    126 S.Ct. 2378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Here, petitioners timely submitted objections to the order denying the 2007 petition to revoke tolerances, fulfilling all of their exhaustion obligations except for the one not within their control-obtaining the EPA's response to the objections. Petitioners' objections were filed 13 months ago, and the key issue therein-whether the EPA was statutorily obligated to revoke the tolerance for chlorpyrifos-was first raised to the EPA over a decade ago in the 2007 Petition. This timeline has provided the EPA more than ample opportunity to correct any mistakes on its own. But, despite the statutory requirement that the EPA respond to the objections \"as soon as practicable,\" it has failed to do so. The history of this litigation supports the inference that the EPA is engaging in yet more delay tactics to avoid our reaching the merits of the sole statutory issue raised here: whether chlorpyrifos must be banned from use on food products because the EPA has not determined that there is a \"reasonable certainty\" that no harm will result from its use, even under the established tolerances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The second institutional interest identified by the Supreme Court as potentially favoring exhaustion, judicial economy, counsels against requiring further administrative exhaustion in this instance. Exhaustion offers the greatest support for judicial efficiency where it either permits the agency to \"correct its own errors\" such that the \"judicial controversy may well be mooted, or at least piecemeal appeals may be avoided,\" or where administrative review \"may produce a useful record for subsequent judicial consideration, especially in a complex or technical factual context.\"\n   <em>\n    McCarthy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6222886\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/140/#p146\">\n    503 U.S. at 145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6222886\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/140/#p146\">\n    112 S.Ct. 1081\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, it is just the opposite. Since 2012, we have issued five separate decisions related to the EPA's inaction on the chlorpyrifos tolerances. Declining to waive exhaustion at this point would make this our sixth decision on the matter without once reaching the merits, setting the stage for yet another \"piecemeal appeal[ ]\" if the EPA should someday issue a response to the petitioners' objection-something the EPA itself has strongly hinted may not come about until 2022, if then. Similarly, further development of the administrative record is of no use to judicial efficiency at this point in the proceedings; there are no factual questions, let alone \"complex or technical\" ones, at issue-only legal questions. And on the merits of these legal questions, the EPA offers no defense of its inaction, effectively conceding its lawlessness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   While both institutional interests favoring exhaustion are weak, this petition invokes two of the \"three broad sets of circumstances in which the interests of the individual weigh heavily against requiring\n   administrative exhaustion.\"\n   <em>\n    McCarthy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6222886\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/140/#p146\">\n    503 U.S. at 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6222886\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/140/#p146\">\n    112 S.Ct. 1081\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Petitioners argue that the EPA's decision in its 2017 order to maintain a tolerance for chlorpyrifos in the face of scientific evidence that its residue on food causes neurodevelopmental damage to children is flatly inconsistent with the FFDCA. Specifically, petitioners argue that a need for additional scientific research is not a valid ground for maintaining a tolerance that, after nearly two decades of studies, has not been determined safe to \"a reasonable certainty,\" and that the EPA cannot delay a decision on tolerances to coordinate that decision with registration review under FIFRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The EPA presents no arguments in defense of its decision. Accordingly, the EPA has forfeited any merits-based argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Martinez v.

A tolerance is safe when \"the Administrator has determined that there is a\n   <em>\n    reasonable certainty\n   </em>\n   that\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   harm will result from aggregate exposure to the pesticide, including all anticipated dietary exposures and all other exposures for which there is reliable information.\" \u00a7 346a(b)(2)(A)(ii) (emphasis added). Accordingly, the EPA bears a continuing obligation to revoke tolerances that it can no longer find with a \"reasonable certainty\" are safe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The EPA's 2016 risk assessment concluded that its analysis of chlorpyrifos \"continues to indicate that the risk from potential aggregate exposure does not meet the FFDCA safety standard\" and that \"expected residues of chlorpyrifos on most individual food crops exceed the 'reasonable certainty of no harm' safety standard.\" This finding was the EPA's final safety determination before the 2017 EPA Order. The 2017 Order declined to revoke chlorpyrifos tolerances but did not make a finding of reasonable certainty that the tolerances were safe. Instead, it found \"significant uncertainty\" as to the health effects of chlorpyrifos, which is at odds with a finding of \"reasonable certainty\" of safety under \u00a7 346a(b)(2)(A)(ii) and therefore mandates revoking the tolerance under \u00a7 346a(b)(2)(A)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \"[H]owever desirable it may be for [the] EPA to consult [a Scientific Advisory Board] and even to revise its conclusion in the future, that is no reason for acting against its own science findings in the meantime.\"\n   <em>\n    Chlorine Chemistry Council v.

Specifically, \u00a7 346a(g)(2)(A) provides that a person may file objections to an order issued under \u00a7 346a(d)(4), as the 2017 Order was. The EPA may then hold a public evidentiary hearing upon request or upon its own initiative.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 346a(g)(2)(B). An appropriate \"order stating the action taken upon each such objection and setting forth any revision to the ... prior order\" must then be issued.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276095\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/863/1131/#p1132\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at (C). Pursuant to the plain reading of the above subsection taken as a whole,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   then, and only then, can judicial review in this court be sought pursuant to \u00a7 346a(h)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   But, says LULAC, the requirement is no more than a claim-processing rule\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   rather than a true jurisdictional rule.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The majority agrees; I am not convinced. Here Congress was very careful and very specific about the class of cases-the limited kind of orders-over which it wished to give the courts of appeals direct review. It made it plain that we could not review the EPA's actions in this specific area until the agency had developed and considered a full record regarding objections and the like. Before that occurred, judicial review was not available; we had no authority whatsoever to consider the issue. As the Second Circuit Court of Appeals has pointed out, \u00a7 346a(h)(1) is \"unique in that it only commits certain specific agency actions\n   to appellate court review.\"\n   <em>\n    Nat. Res. Def. Council v. Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3671688\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/461/164/\">\n    461 F.3d 164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 172 (2d Cir. 2006). In light of that careful restriction on judicial review, it is not at all likely that Congress would have authorized our seizing jurisdiction before the specific agency action was concluded. Lest there be any doubt, Congress also precluded possible bypassing of the \u00a7 346a(g)(2) provisions when it directed that no \"judicial review under any other provision of law\" would be permitted. Section 346a(h)(5) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3671688\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/461/164/\">\n    461 F.3d at 172-74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And that is further emphasized by the fact that the section does not speak in general language of finality or exhaustion;\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   it, rather, states specifically when we can assume review authority over the particular matters. Had Congress contemplated appellate court review before the EPA completed the process required by \u00a7 346a(g)(2)(C), it could easily have inserted orders under \u00a7 346a(d)(4), or, more specifically, \u00a7 346a(d)(4)(A)(iii) into the judicial review provisions of \u00a7 346a(h)(1), which, of course, it did not do. Rather, it expressly allowed judicial review only over the agency's ruling on objections that had to be filed with the agency, and not before.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gallo Cattle Co. v.

That is particularly telling because earlier iterations of the review provisions contained no such jurisdictional limitations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Coal.

Jurisdiction under FIFRA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   LULAC then argues that because it not only asked for the EPA to revoke all tolerances for the Pesticide but also asked the EPA to cancel all registrations for the Pesticide, the 2007 Petition to the EPA arose under both the FFDCA and FIFRA. Thus, it argues, it need not abide by the FFDCA review provisions, but can rely on the jurisdictional provisions of the FIFRA to establish our jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136n(b). I do not agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Rather, I am persuaded by the cogent reasoning of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in a strongly similar situation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3671688\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/461/164/\">\n    461 F.3d at 176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In that case, pursuant to the FFDCA provisions, NRDC also challenged the EPA's setting of tolerances for residues on food of five pesticides (not including the Pesticide).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3671688\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/461/164/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3671688\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/461/164/\">\n    at 169-70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . NRDC added that their registration should be cancelled pursuant to FIFRA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3671688\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/461/164/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3671688\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/461/164/\">\n    at 176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . NRDC had brought its action in the district court, and on appeal the Second Circuit determined that the district court did not have jurisdiction to review the EPA determination under the FFDCA because, as \u00a7 346(a)(h)(1), (5) provide, jurisdiction over those claims was limited to the courts of appeals.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3671688\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/461/164/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3671688\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/461/164/\">\n    at 172-76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . NRDC then argued that the district court still had jurisdiction pursuant to FIFRA. The court replied:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   However, FIFRA's grant of jurisdiction to the district courts is irrelevant. The\n   NRDC Appellants \"challenge the registration of pesticides under FIFRA only through their challenge to the tolerances set under the [F]FDCA.\" Essentially, therefore, the violations of FIFRA alleged by the NRDC Appellants \"amount to challenges to the methodologies used in reaching the reassessment determinations at issue\" in this case. As such, these challenges represent an \"issue as to which review is or was obtainable under Section 346a(h). Section 346a(h)(5) precludes judicial review of these issues \"under any other provision of law.\" The NRDC Appellants' attempt to find independent jurisdiction for their claims under FIFRA is thus precluded by the express language of \u00a7 346a(h)(5). The NRDC Appellants' claims are reviewable only in the courts of appeals, and only after they have exhausted the statutory provisions for administrative review.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3671688\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/461/164/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3671688\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/461/164/\">\n    at 176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   I accept that reasoning and the same reasoning should apply here. It would foreclose LULAC's argument. LULAC essentially argues that the EPA has erred in maintaining tolerances for the Pesticide, which is an unsafe insecticide, and for that same reason it argues that the EPA must forthwith revoke registration of the Pesticide. It argues that it should not have to wait for the EPA to rule on its registration claim, but that is just an allotrope of its central arguments against waiting for relief under the FFDCA tolerances provision with which its FIFRA argument is \"inextricably intertwined.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. U.S. EPA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12191749\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/847/1075/#p1089\">\n    847 F.3d 1075\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1089 (9th Cir. 2017). Therefore, the FIFRA provision does not offer a way to avoid the judicial review provisions of the FFDCA in this instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Thus, I would dismiss the petition for review for lack of jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   WRIT OF MANDAMUS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   In its briefs, LULAC asks us to issue a writ of mandamus\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   directing that the EPA respond to its objections within sixty days. However, LULAC did not file a petition for issuance of that writ and, therefore, made no attempt to comply with the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure when it filed its petition for review of the merits of the 2017 Order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. App. P. 21(a), (c) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. App. P. 20. I see no reason to treat LULAC's petition for review as, in fact, one for a writ of mandamus. It was not, and could not have been, a mere instance of mislabeling a request for relief that was sought. Had LULAC intended to seek a writ of mandamus, rather than a merits review, that would have been most peculiar because on that same day LULAC had just filed its objections to the 2017 Order. It could not honestly complain about delay in considering its objections at that point. Were I to decide otherwise, I would essentially ignore our holding, which was handed down after this petition for review was filed, but before the briefs were filed, and which declared that PANNA and NRDC must file their objections and await resolution of those objections by the EPA before we\n   would consider the merits of the EPA's actions regarding the Pesticide.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nat.
