Run Gum alleged that Appellees USA Track &amp; Field (USATF) and the United States Olympic Committee (Olympic Committee) engaged in an anticompetitive conspiracy in violation of antitrust law by imposing advertising restrictions during the Olympic Trials for track and field athletes. According to Run Gum, the district court erroneously determined that the Olympic Committee and USATF should be afforded implied antitrust immunity on the basis that their advertising restrictions were integral to performance of their duties under the Ted Stevens Olympic and Amateur Sports Act (ASA).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    JES Props., Inc. v.

Under the auspices of the ASA, the Olympic Committee exercises exclusive jurisdiction over \"all matters pertaining to United States participation in the Olympic Games, the Paralympic Games, and the Pan-American Games, including representation of the United States in the games,\" and \"the organization of the Olympic Games, the Paralympic Games, and the Pan-American Games when held in the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20220503\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 220503(3).

According to Run Gum, USATF \"severely restrict[s] the type of\n   <em>\n    individual\n   </em>\n   sponsors that track [and] field athletes can display on their athletic apparel at the Olympic Trials, including their competition kit, which greatly diminishes sponsorship opportunities for the athletes and excludes various would-be sponsors.\" (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis in the original). Run Gum complained that USATF's advertising restrictions provide that \"with the exception of standard manufacturers' equipment identification ... the equipment, uniforms, and the bibs/numbers of the competitors and officials at the Trials may not bear any commercial identification or promotional material of any kind (whether commercial or noncommercial).\" (alteration and footnote reference omitted). Run Gum asserted that the USATF regulation nonetheless allows athletes to wear apparel containing the logo and names of certain pre-approved manufacturers, such as Nike.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Run Gum maintained that use of pre-approved manufacturers \"exclude[d] scores of sponsors from the marketplace\" in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. Run Gum posed a single cause of action premised on violations of the antitrust laws stemming from the challenged advertising restrictions. Run Gum contended that the regulation limiting sponsorships of athletes during the Olympic Trials was \"an anticompetitive horizontal and vertical agreement among competitors to fix artificially-and unlawfully-the number of individual sponsors and the price paid to athletes for individual sponsorship.\" Run Gum further alleged that the advertising and logo restriction was \"an unlawful group boycott of individual sponsors that do not manufacturer [sic] apparel or equipment, which are categorically excluded from sponsoring athletes at the Olympic Trials.\" In addition to damages, Run Gum sought to enjoin the Olympic Committee and USATF from \"preventing Run Gum from sponsoring individual athletes at the 2016 Olympic Trials in exchange for sponsor identification on clothing at the Olympic Trials.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In a published opinion, the district court dismissed Run Gum's action based on implied antitrust immunity under the ASA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gold Medal LLC v.

While acknowledging that grants of implied antitrust immunity are generally disfavored, the district court nevertheless concluded that the advertising restrictions enabled the Olympic Committee and USATF to perform their statutory obligations under the ASA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12142344\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/187/1219/#p1222\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12142344\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/187/1219/#p1222\">\n    at 1228-30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court emphasized that \"[a]s the only nation that does not provide its Olympic team with federal funding or subsidies, the United States instead relies on the [Olympic Committee] to raise the financial resources necessary to organize Team USA and to compete in the Olympic Games.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12142344\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/187/1219/#p1222\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12142344\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/187/1219/#p1222\">\n    at 1228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). According to the district court, the advertising restrictions \"prevent a dilution of the Olympic brand,\" and \"permit the [Olympic Committee] and USATF to play a gatekeeping function which preserves the exclusivity-and thus value-of the Olympic symbols and name.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12142344\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/187/1219/#p1222\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12142344\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/187/1219/#p1222\">\n    at 1230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The mileage rule generally required that any A-rated equestrian competitions on the same date be held a minimum of 250 miles apart. The Eleventh Circuit discerned the following two purposes for the rule: 1) \"to concentrate elite riders into fewer competitions in order to yield the most competitive international equestrian team possible,\" and 2) \"to promote equestrianism nationwide by forcing promoters to hold recognized competitions in more diverse locations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3385636\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/458/1224/#p1226\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3385636\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/458/1224/#p1226\">\n    at 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The district court properly applied implied antitrust immunity under the ASA in dismissing Run Gum's complaint based on the \"convincing showing of clear repugnancy between the antitrust laws\" and the provisions of the ASA to advance the Olympic Committee's mission to fund and administer Olympic events.\n   <em>\n    Total TV\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7410273\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/69/298/\">\n    69 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   302 n.6 (citation omitted). As the district court observed, an injunction preventing enforcement of the advertisement regulation \"would open the floodgates\" to potential advertisers, some of which might enhance the Olympic brand and some of which might devalue the Olympic brand.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gold Medal LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12142344\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/187/1219/#p1222\">\n    187 F.Supp.3d at 1230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The regulation avoids placing the Olympic Committee in the unenviable position of having to face this conundrum in fulfilling its mission to finance American Olympic athletes. We thus view the regulation as protected from antitrust challenge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Behagen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11349417\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/884/524/\">\n    884 F.2d at 529\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (connecting implied antitrust immunity with Congressional intent for the ASA).
