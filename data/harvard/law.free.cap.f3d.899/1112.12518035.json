The Teachers' Retirement System comprises three retirement plans named \"Plan 1,\" \"Plan 2,\" and \"Plan 3.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This case concerns savings that were held in Plan 2. Plan 2 contributions are invested in a comingled trust fund by the Washington State Investment Board. DRS does not handle deposits, but rather tracks teachers' contributions and credits their individual accounts for accumulated interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wash.%20Rev.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2041.32.010\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 41.32.010(1)(b).

Since 1977, DRS has credited Plan 2 accounts with a 5.5% annual rate compounded quarterly. DRS determines the amount of interest to credit to Plan 2 accounts based on the accounts' balances at the end of the prior quarter. Therefore, DRS does not credit accounts with the interest earned on the funds in the account during that quarter. In addition, if a Plan 2 account has a zero balance at the end of a quarter, the account is not credited with interest earned on any funds in that account during either that quarter or the prior quarter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Fowler and Maurer (collectively, \"Teachers\") were originally members of Plan 2, but in 1996 they transferred their holdings into newly created Plan 3 accounts. Because the Teachers transferred their Plan 2 holdings mid-quarter, and thus had a zero balance in their Plan 2 accounts at the end of the quarter in which they transferred their holdings, DRS did not credit their accounts for the interest earned during that quarter or the prior quarter. Instead, DRS kept the interest and used it to pay benefits to other members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2005, another Washington State employee filed a class action suit in state court challenging DRS's interest rate calculations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Probst v.

Without reaching the Teachers' constitutional arguments, that court held that DRS's interest rate policy was arbitrary and capricious under state law because there was no record showing the agency gave the issue \"due consideration.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=271%20P.3d%20966\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=271%20P.3d%20966\">\n    at 971-73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Superior Court subsequently remanded the case to DRS to initiate a new rulemaking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   DRS began the rulemaking process in July 2013. The Teachers appealed the Superior Court's remand to the agency, however, and the Washington Court of Appeals affirmed the Superior Court's order in an unpublished decision.\n   <em>\n    Probst v.

App. Dec. 30, 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Teachers then filed this suit in federal court. The complaint omits the Teachers' state-law claims and alleges solely that the Director of DRS (\"Director\") violated the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments by withholding some of the daily interest earned on their Plan 2 accounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The parties filed a stipulated motion to certify a class of all active and retired members of the Teachers' Retirement System who had transferred from Plan 2 to Plan 3 before January 20, 2002. The district court denied the stipulated motion without prejudice, concluding that the parties' explanation was not detailed enough for the court to fulfill its independent responsibility to ensure that the requirements of Rule 23 were met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The district court then granted the Director's motion for summary judgment, concluding that this case was prudentially unripe pending the conclusion of DRS's new interest calculation rulemaking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Teachers timely appealed. Less than a month before oral argument in this case, DRS's new rule took effect and retroactively affirmed its prior interest calculation method.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wash.%20Admin.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20415-02-150\">\n    Wash.
