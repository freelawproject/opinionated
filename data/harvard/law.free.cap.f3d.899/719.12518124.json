We address whether that agent has qualified immunity and whether he can be sued for violating the Fourth Amendment. Based on the facts alleged in the complaint, we hold that the agent violated a clearly established constitutional right and is thus not immune from suit. We also hold that the mother of the boy who was killed has a cause of action against the agent for money damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   We take the facts as they are pleaded in the First Amended Complaint. These facts have not been proven, and they may not be true. But we must assume that they are true for the sake of determining whether the case may proceed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Shortly before midnight on October 10, 2012, defendant Lonnie Swartz was on duty as a U.S. Border Patrol agent on the American side of our border with Mexico. J.A., a sixteen-year-old boy, was peacefully walking down the Calle Internacional, a street in Nogales, Mexico, that runs parallel to the border. Without warning or provocation, Swartz shot J.A. dead. Swartz fired somewhere between 14 and 30 bullets across the border at J.A., and he hit the boy, mostly in the back, with about 10 bullets. J.A. was not committing a crime. He did not throw rocks or engage in any violence or threatening behavior against anyone or anything. And he did not otherwise pose a threat to Swartz or anyone else. He was just walking down a street in Mexico.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Calle Internacional, where J.A. was walking, is a main thoroughfare lined with commercial and residential buildings. The American side of the border is on high ground, atop a cliff or rock wall that rises from the level of the Calle Internacional. The ground on the American side is around 25 feet higher than the road, and a border fence rises another 20 or 25 feet above that. (See the Appendix for a photograph.) The fence is made of steel beams, each about 6\u00bd inches in diameter, set about 3\u00bd inches apart. Nogales, Mexico, and Nogales, Arizona, are in some respects one town divided by the border fence. Families live on both sides of the border, and people go from one side to the other to visit and shop. J.A.'s grandparents live in Arizona. They were lawful permanent residents at the time of the shooting, and they are now U.S. citizens. J.A.'s grandmother often stayed with him in Mexico when his mother was away at work. J.A. was a Mexican citizen who had never been to the United States, but Swartz did not know that when he shot J.A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   J.A.'s mother, Araceli Rodriguez, acting both individually and as a personal representative of J.A.'s estate, sued Lonnie Swartz for money damages. She has two claims: one for a violation of her son's Fourth Amendment rights, and another for a violation of his Fifth Amendment rights. Her complaint alleges no facts that could allow anyone to characterize the shooting as being negligent or justifiable. What is pleaded is simple and straightforward murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   To summarize the facts alleged in the complaint: Swartz was an on-duty U.S. Border Patrol agent stationed on the American side of the border fence. J.A. was a Mexican citizen walking down a street in Mexico. Swartz fired his pistol through the border fence into Mexico. He intentionally killed J.A. without any justification. Swartz acted entirely from within the United States, but J.A. was in Mexico when Swartz's bullets struck and killed him. Swartz did not know J.A.'s citizenship or whether he had substantial connections to the United States, so for all Swartz knew, J.A. could have been an American citizen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Swartz moved to dismiss the complaint based on qualified immunity. He conceded that Rodriguez had a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   cause of action under the Fourth Amendment. In a carefully reasoned opinion, the district court held that Swartz was not entitled to qualified immunity on the Fourth Amendment claim. Because it treated the shooting\n   as a \"seizure\" under the Fourth Amendment, the court dismissed the Fifth Amendment claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Swartz filed this interlocutory appeal to challenge the district court's denial of qualified immunity. The United States filed an amicus brief that presented an argument that had not been made in district court: that Rodriguez lacks a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   cause of action for a Fourth Amendment violation. Though Swartz had not raised that argument in his opening brief on appeal, he adopted it in his reply brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We affirm the district court's decision to let Rodriguez's Fourth Amendment claim proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    I. QUALIFIED IMMUNITY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Qualified immunity protects public officials \"from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established ... constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"To determine whether an officer is entitled to qualified immunity, a court must evaluate two independent questions: (1) whether the officer's conduct violated a constitutional right, and (2) whether that right was clearly established at the time of the incident.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   A constitutional right is \"clearly established\" if \"every reasonable official would have understood that what he is doing violates that right.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Based on the facts alleged in the complaint, Swartz violated the Fourth Amendment. It is inconceivable that any reasonable officer could have thought that he or she could kill J.A. for no reason. Thus, Swartz lacks qualified immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Fourth Amendment forbids using unreasonable force to \"seize\" a person.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Fourth Amendment prohibits law enforcement officers from using \"objectively unreasonable\" force to \"seize\" a person.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Harris v. Roderick\n   </em>\n   , a person shot by a federal agent brought a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   claim for a Fourth Amendment violation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   We held that the officer lacked qualified immunity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Graham v. Connor\n   </em>\n   , we wrote that \"the reasonableness of a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Ordinarily,\" we continued, \"our inquiry is ... whether the totality of circumstances, (taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of the particular case including the severity of the crime at issue; whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others; and whether he is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade by flight) justified the particular type of seizure.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Then, quoting the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Tennessee v. Garner\n   </em>\n   , we wrote that even when a felony suspect tries to escape, \"where the suspect poses no immediate threat to the officer and no threat to others, the harm from failing to apprehend him does not justify the use of deadly force to do so.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   These principles are clearly established.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   As we held in\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   , every reasonable law enforcement officer should know that \"officers may not shoot to kill unless, at a minimum, the suspect presents an immediate threat to the officer or others, or is fleeing and his escape will result in a serious threat of injury to persons.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   And \"whenever practicable, a warning must be given before deadly force is employed.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Fourth Amendment applies here.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Even though we must assume that Swartz shot and killed J.A. for no reason, Swartz nevertheless argues that he did not violate the Constitution. He relies on\n   <em>\n    United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez\n   </em>\n   , which held that the Fourth Amendment did not apply to the search and seizure of a non-citizen's property that was located abroad.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   J.A. was a Mexican citizen who was shot, and therefore \"seized,\" in Mexico.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   We must therefore determine whether the Fourth Amendment applies in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    Boumediene v. Bush\n   </em>\n   establishes that to determine whether the Constitution applies here, we must examine J.A.'s citizenship and status, the location where the shooting occurred, and any practical concerns that arise.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Neither citizenship nor voluntary submission to American law is a prerequisite for constitutional rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, citizenship is just one of several non-dispositive factors to consider.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Boumediene\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held that enemy combatants detained at the U.S. Naval Station at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, were entitled to the writ of habeas corpus.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Geography was an important factor in\n   <em>\n    Boumediene\n   </em>\n   . Guantanamo Bay is in Cuba, and Cuba has sovereignty over it, but it is the United States that has complete practical control over\n   Guantanamo.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   The geography is different in our case. Although Swartz was in the United States when he shot at J.A., Mexico has both sovereignty and practical control over the street where J.A. was hit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nevertheless, we conclude that J.A. had a Fourth Amendment right to be free from the unreasonable use of such deadly force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez\n   </em>\n   held that the Fourth Amendment did not apply to the search and seizure of a Mexican citizen's property in Mexico.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   There, Mexican authorities arrested suspected cartel leader Rene Verdugo-Urquidez in Mexico, brought him to the United States, and handed him over to American law enforcement so that he could be tried in the United States. Later, American and Mexican agents searched Verdugo-Urquidez's house in Mexico without a warrant. During the search, agents seized evidence showing that Verdugo-Urquidez was a drug smuggler. Verdugo-Urquidez challenged the search and seizure, but the Supreme Court held that the U.S. Constitution did not apply.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   According to the\n   <em>\n    Verdugo-Urquidez\n   </em>\n   majority opinion, the text of our Fourth Amendment \"suggests that 'the people' protected by the Fourth Amendment ... refers to a class of persons who are part of a national community or who have otherwise developed sufficient connection with this country to be considered part of that community.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because Verdugo-Urquidez was a Mexican citizen with no voluntary connection to the United States, he was not among \"the people.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the Fourth Amendment's text was \"by no means conclusive,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the majority also relied on history, precedents, and practicalities in holding that the Fourth Amendment did not apply to the search and seizure of a nonresident alien's property located abroad.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   Among the Court's practical concerns were that a warrant from an American magistrate \"would be a dead letter outside the United States\" and that requiring warrants for searches abroad would plunge the executive branch \"into a sea of uncertainty.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   Justice Kennedy, concurring, said that he could not \"place any weight on the reference to 'the people' in the Fourth Amendment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   But he agreed with the majority that it would be \"impractical and anomalous\" to apply the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement to aliens abroad.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   But this case is not like\n   <em>\n    Verdugo-Urquidez\n   </em>\n   for several reasons. For one,\n   <em>\n    Verdugo-Urquidez\n   </em>\n   addressed only \"the search and seizure by United States\n   agents of property that [was] owned by a nonresident alien and located in a foreign country.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   That type of search and seizure implicates Mexican sovereignty because Mexico is entitled to regulate conduct in its territory. But unlike the American agents in\n   <em>\n    Verdugo-Urquidez\n   </em>\n   , who acted on Mexican soil, Swartz acted on American soil. Just as Mexican law controls what people do there, American law controls what people do here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Verdugo-Urquidez\n   </em>\n   simply did not address the conduct of American agents on American soil. Also, the agents in\n   <em>\n    Verdugo-Urquidez\n   </em>\n   knew that they were searching a Mexican citizen's property in Mexico, but Swartz could not have known whether J.A. was an American citizen or not.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The practical concerns in\n   <em>\n    Verdugo-Urquidez\n   </em>\n   about regulating conduct on Mexican soil also do not apply here. There are many reasons not to extend the Fourth Amendment willy-nilly to actions abroad, as\n   <em>\n    Verdugo-Urquidez\n   </em>\n   explains.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   But those reasons do not apply to Swartz. He acted on American soil subject to American law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   We recognize that on similar facts, the Fifth Circuit reached a contrary conclusion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   But its reasoning was about the Fourth Amendment generally, including warrantless searches of those crossing the border and electronic surveillance of the border itself. The concerns in\n   <em>\n    Verdugo-Urquidez\n   </em>\n   were also specific to warrants and overseas operations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   But this case is not about searches and seizures broadly speaking. Neither is it about warrants or overseas operations. It is about the unreasonable use of deadly force by a federal agent on American soil. Under those limited circumstances, there are no practical obstacles to extending the Fourth Amendment. Applying the Constitution in this case would simply say that American officers must not shoot innocent, non-threatening people for no reason. Enforcing that rule would not unduly restrict what the United States could do either here or abroad. So under the particular circumstances of this case, J.A. had a Fourth Amendment right to be free from the objectively unreasonable use of deadly force by an American agent acting on American soil, even though Swartz's bullets hit him in Mexico.\n   <em>\n    Verdugo-Urquidez\n   </em>\n   does not require a different conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   And according to the complaint, Swartz used objectively unreasonable force. To determine whether a particular use of force is objectively unreasonable, we balance the \"nature and quality of the intrusion on the individual's Fourth Amendment interests against the countervailing governmental interests at stake.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"The intrusiveness of a seizure by means of deadly force\n   is unmatched,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   so deadly force is unreasonable unless there are strong countervailing government interests. But the government had\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   interest whatsoever in shooting J.A. He was not suspected of any crime. He was not fleeing or resisting arrest. And he did not pose a threat of harm to anyone at all. The use of deadly force was therefore unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    C. It was clearly established that Swartz could not shoot J.A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Even though Rodriguez has more than sufficiently alleged that Swartz violated the Constitution, that does not automatically mean that Swartz lacks qualified immunity. Instead, Swartz lacks immunity only if J.A.'s Fourth Amendment right was \"clearly established\" when he was shot and killed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   A right is \"clearly established\" when it is \"sufficiently clear that every reasonable official would have understood that what he is doing violates that right.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although precedent is certainly relevant to determining what a reasonable officer would know, \"it is not necessary ... that the very action in question has previously been held unlawful.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, an officer loses qualified immunity, even in novel situations, if he or she commits a \"clear\" constitutional violation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   Swartz argues that when he shot J.A., it was not clearly established that he could not shoot someone on the other side of the border. We cannot agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \"The qualified immunity analysis ... is limited to the facts that were knowable to the defendant officers at the time they engaged in the conduct in question. Facts an officer learns after the incident ends-whether those facts would support granting immunity or denying it-are not relevant.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   This timing factor usually applies to protect an officer from being judged with 20/20 hindsight. Such hindsight often fails to take into account what an officer reasonably knew when he or she acted, especially when the officer had to make a split-second decision in a \"tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving\" situation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   For example, if a police officer shot a suspect after the suspect brandished what looked like a gun, the officer's reasonable perception that the suspect was armed would entitle the officer to qualified immunity-even if the \"gun\" turned out to be a\n   cell phone.\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the timing factor also applies when later-discovered facts arguably justify an officer's actions even though the officer could not have known those facts when he or she acted. For example, if a police officer shot a suspect before perceiving any threat, the officer would lack qualified immunity-even if the suspect actually had a gun nearby and likely would have harmed the officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Supreme Court recently reaffirmed this rule in\n   <em>\n    Hernandez v. Mesa\n   </em>\n   . There, a U.S. Border Patrol agent shot and killed 15-year-old Sergio Hernandez, a Mexican citizen, in a culvert between the United States and Mexico.\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Fifth Circuit had held that even if the shooting violated the Fifth Amendment, it was not clearly established that the Constitution applied to aliens abroad.\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the Supreme Court rejected that analysis, holding that because \"Hernandez's nationality and the extent of his ties to the United States were unknown to [the agent] at the time of the shooting,\" those facts were irrelevant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   J.A.'s citizenship and ties to the United States are similarly irrelevant here. When he shot J.A., Swartz could not have known whether the boy was an American citizen. Thus, Swartz is not entitled to qualified immunity on the bizarre ground that J.A. was not an American. For all Swartz knew, J.A. was an American citizen with family and activities on both sides of the border. Therefore, the question is not whether it was clearly established that aliens abroad have Fourth Amendment rights. Rather, it is whether it was clearly established that it was unconstitutional for an officer on American soil to use deadly force without justification against a person of unknown nationality on the other side of the border.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Had there been a serious question about whether the Constitution banned federal officers from gratuitous cross-border killings,\n   <em>\n    Tennessee v. Garner\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Harris v. Roderick\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n   would have answered it. \"It does not take a court ruling for an official to know that no concept of reasonableness could justify the unprovoked shooting of another person.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   Any reasonable officer would have known, even without a judicial decision to tell him so, that it was unlawful to kill someone-anyone-for no reason. After all,\n   <em>\n    Tennessee v. Garner\n   </em>\n   held that an officer could not shoot a non-threatening, fleeing suspect.\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n   Would Swartz have us treat it as an open question whether an officer could kill a non-threatening person who was not a suspect and who was not fleeing? Or, since the police officer in\n   <em>\n    Garner\n   </em>\n   shot the fleeing suspect with a gun, would it be an open question if an officer shot a fleeing suspect with a crossbow? Any reasonable officer should know that the answer to both questions, despite the lack of a case on all fours.\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   We explained in\n   <em>\n    Hardwick v.

Unlike officers in other situations,\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n   Swartz did not have to determine how much force to use; he was not permitted to use any force whatsoever against someone who was innocently walking down a street in Mexico.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   One final note. The district court dismissed Rodriguez's Fifth Amendment claim because the Fourth Amendment applied, and we do not analyze the Fifth Amendment claim here. But if the Fourth Amendment does not apply because J.A. was in Mexico, then the Fifth Amendment \"shocks the conscience\" test may still apply.\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n   Swartz's conduct would fail that test. We cannot imagine anyone whose conscience would not be shocked by the cold-blooded murder of an innocent person walking down the street in Mexico or Canada by a U.S. Border Patrol agent on the American side of the border.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     BIVENS\n    </em>\n    CAUSE OF ACTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Under\n   <em>\n    Bivens v.

We previously held that on an interlocutory appeal of a denial of qualified immunity, we lacked appellate jurisdiction to decide whether there was a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   cause of action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    64\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, Swartz did not challenge whether Rodriguez could sue under\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   until he filed his reply brief on appeal. That would normally constitute a waiver even though the United States addressed the issue in its amicus brief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    65\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   But there is new law to consider. In\n   <em>\n    Hernandez v. Mesa\n   </em>\n   , the Fifth Circuit confronted a cross-border shooting similar to the one here. It held that even if the shooting was unconstitutional, the law was not clearly established at the time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    66\n   </footnotemark>\n   It did not decide whether the family of the boy who was shot had a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   cause of action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    67\n   </footnotemark>\n   In fact, the officer who shot him had not moved to dismiss on that basis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    68\n   </footnotemark>\n   Yet the Supreme Court reversed, holding that whether\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   applied was \" 'antecedent' to the other questions presented.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    69\n   </footnotemark>\n   It then remanded the case so that the Fifth Circuit could consider whether the boy's family had a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   cause of action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    70\n   </footnotemark>\n   In a different context, we have also held that qualified immunity \"by necessity\" implicates whether there is a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   cause of action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    71\n   </footnotemark>\n   We therefore hold that we have jurisdiction to decide whether Rodriguez has a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   cause of action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    72\n   </footnotemark>\n   Given the Supreme Court's instruction in\n   <em>\n    Hernandez\n   </em>\n   , we must now address that issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n    permits a cause of action for damages in certain cases.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <em>\n    Bivens v.

But the agents did not have probable cause or a search warrant, so their search and seizure violated the Constitution. The Court held that Bivens was entitled\n   to sue the agents for damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    74\n   </footnotemark>\n   It explained that there were \"no special factors counselling hesitation in the absence of affirmative action by Congress,\" in part because the agents themselves, not the government, would be liable for damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    75\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Justice Harlan concurred in the judgment. He agreed that the Court had the \"judicial power to accord damages as an appropriate remedy in the absence of any express statutory authorization\" by Congress.\n   <footnotemark>\n    76\n   </footnotemark>\n   He then explained that damages were \"the only possible remedy\" for Bivens: an injunction could not prevent what had already happened, the United States was immune to suit, and the exclusionary rule would be irrelevant if Bivens had not committed any crimes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    77\n   </footnotemark>\n   So for Bivens, it was \"damages or nothing.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    78\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

Although Congress had not passed a statute prohibiting sex discrimination against congressional employees, there was also no evidence that Congress intended to permit such discrimination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    83\n   </footnotemark>\n   And though the Speech and Debate Clause of the Constitution confers special protections on members of Congress,\n   <footnotemark>\n    84\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court reaffirmed that \"all individuals, whatever their position in government, are subject to federal law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    85\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court therefore held that unless the congressman could somehow show that the Speech and Debate Clause protected his actions, the woman he had fired could sue him for damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    86\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   A year later, in\n   <em>\n    Carlson v.

First,\n   <em>\n    Abbasi\n   </em>\n   makes plain that even though a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   action lies for some constitutional violations (like the Fourth Amendment claim in\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   ), it does not lie for all violations (like the Fourth Amendment claim in\n   <em>\n    Abbasi\n   </em>\n   ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    102\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Second,\n   <em>\n    Abbasi\n   </em>\n   explains that if a case presents a \"new context\" for a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   claim, then we must exercise \"caution\" in determining whether to extend\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    103\n   </footnotemark>\n   That is because \"expanding the\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   remedy is now a 'disfavored' judicial activity.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    104\n   </footnotemark>\n   And while\n   <em>\n    Abbasi\n   </em>\n   mandates caution and disfavor only when courts extend\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   into a \"new context,\" a case presents a new context whenever it is \"different in a meaningful way from previous\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   cases decided by [the Supreme] Court.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    105\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Third, if a case presents a new context for a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   claim, then we can extend it only if two conditions are met. One condition is that the plaintiff must not have any other adequate alternative remedy. The other condition is that there cannot be any \"special factors\" that lead us to believe that Congress, instead of the courts, should be the one to authorize a suit for money damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    106\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Together, these three principles restrict when we can extend a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   cause of action. But\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   and its progeny are still good law.\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Carlson\n   </em>\n   have never been overruled, implicitly or explicitly. Instead,\n   <em>\n    Abbasi\n   </em>\n   went out of its way to emphasize that the Court did \"not intend[ ] to cast doubt on the continued force, or even the necessity, of\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   in the search-and-seizure context in which it arose.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    107\n   </footnotemark>\n   So at least in the \"common and recurrent sphere of law enforcement,\"\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   is \"settled law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    108\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   This brings us to a fourth principle of the Court's\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   jurisprudence: in the right case, we may extend\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   into a new context. After all, if\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   could not be expanded so that it applied in a new context, there would be no need for \"caution\" or treating expansion as a \"disfavored judicial activity,\" or considering whether there was an adequate alternative remedy or special factors. Determining that the context was new would be the end of the inquiry, not the beginning. If extension were prohibited, then\n   <em>\n    Abbasi\n   </em>\n   could simply have concluded that each of the claims presented a \"new context\" and ended its analysis there. But instead,\n   <em>\n    Abbasi\n   </em>\n   went on to explain why extension was inappropriate for certain claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    109\n   </footnotemark>\n   And for the remaining claim, it remanded the case to let a lower court consider in the first instance whether to extend\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    110\n   </footnotemark>\n   That instruction for a lower court to consider extension would have been superfluous if courts were barred from extending\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   We apply these four principles in this case. This case presents a new\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   context. Like\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   , this case is about a federal law enforcement officer who violated the Fourth Amendment. But this case differs from\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   because J.A. was killed in Mexico (by a bullet fired in the United States) and because we are applying the Constitution to afford a remedy to an alien under these circumstances.\n   <footnotemark>\n    111\n   </footnotemark>\n   We therefore cannot extend\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   unless: (1) Rodriguez has no other adequate alternative remedy; and (2) there are no special factors\n   counseling hesitation. We now turn to those two inquiries, keeping in mind that extension is disfavored and that we must exercise caution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Rodriguez does not have an adequate alternative remedy.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   We cannot grant a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   cause of action if \"any alternative, existing process for protecting the [constitutional] interest amounts to a convincing reason for the Judicial Branch to refrain from providing a new and freestanding remedy in damages.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    112\n   </footnotemark>\n   We also cannot extend\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   if Congress's \"failure to provide money damages, or other significant relief, has not been inadvertent.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    113\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Swartz and the United States have suggested several possible alternative remedies. But even though an alternative remedy need not be \"perfectly congruent\" with\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    114\n   </footnotemark>\n   or \"perfectly comprehensive,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    115\n   </footnotemark>\n   it still must be \"adequate.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    116\n   </footnotemark>\n   None of the suggested alternatives is adequate. We also do not think that Congress meant to bar a remedy. Congressional legislation that does address\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   (the Federal Tort Claims Act, as amended) signals at least acquiescence. That other statutes were silent in unrelated circumstances is irrelevant: here, \"[a]s is often the case, [C]ongressional silence whispers\" only \"sweet nothings.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    117\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Rodriguez cannot bring a tort claim against the United States.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The United States has sovereign immunity, meaning it cannot be sued without its consent. The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) provides that consent for certain tort claims brought against the United States, including certain claims about abusive federal law enforcement officers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    118\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the FTCA also specifically provides that the United States cannot be sued for claims \"arising in a foreign country.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    119\n   </footnotemark>\n   This \"foreign country exception\" means that the United States is completely immune from \"all claims based on any injury suffered in a foreign country, regardless of where the tortious act or omission occurred.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    120\n   </footnotemark>\n   J.A. suffered his deadly injury in Mexico, so Rodriguez cannot sue the United States under the FTCA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    121\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   But this foreign country exception does not imply, as Swartz, the United States, and the dissent all argue, that Congress intended to prevent Rodriguez from having a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   remedy. This is because \"the foreign country exception ... codified Congress's 'unwilling[ness] to subject the United States to liabilities depending upon the laws of a foreign power.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    122\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the\n   time, standard choice-of-law analyses, which have not been uniformly abrogated, focused on the place the harm occurred, and would have compelled U.S. courts to apply foreign law, even to a state common law claim, leading \"to a good deal of difficulty.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    123\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, \"[t]he object being to avoid application of substantive foreign law, Congress evidently used the modifier 'arising in a foreign country' to refer to claims based on foreign harm or injury, the fact that would trigger application of foreign law to determine liability.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    124\n   </footnotemark>\n   And even under modern choice of law rules, the application of state tort law could mean the application of state choice of law rules, which, in turn, could lead to the application of foreign substantive law, which is what Congress did not want.\n   <footnotemark>\n    125\n   </footnotemark>\n   Allowing a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   cause of action here, however, does not implicate this concern because it arises under only U.S. constitutional law and does not implicate Mexican substantive law or even Arizona choice-of-law provisions that could lead to the application of Mexican substantive law. This is all that Congress sought to avoid.\n   <footnotemark>\n    126\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   More significantly, an amendment to the FTCA called the Westfall Act shows that the FTCA is concerned only with common law actions. Under the Westfall Act, if a federal agent commits a tort while acting within the scope of his or her employment, then any resulting civil suit must be brought against the United States under the FTCA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    127\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the agent is sued individually, the United States is substituted as the defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    128\n   </footnotemark>\n   The purpose of the amendment was to \"protect Federal employees from personal liability for common law torts committed within the scope of their employment, while providing persons injured by the common law torts of Federal employees with an appropriate remedy against the United States.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    129\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Westfall Act is clear, however, that the protection afforded federal employees for common law torts \"does not extend or apply to a civil action against an employee of the Government ... which is brought for a violation of the Constitution of the United States.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    130\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In other words, the FTCA has an \"explicit exception for\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   claims,\" allowing them to proceed against individuals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    131\n   </footnotemark>\n   This ensures that federal officers cannot dodge liability for their own constitutional violations by foisting their liability onto the government. As a contemporaneous House Report explained, \"[s]ince the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   , ... the courts have identified [a constitutional] tort as a more serious intrusion of the rights of an individual that merits special attention. Consequently, [the Westfall Act] would not affect the ability of victims of constitutional torts to seek personal redress from Federal employees who allegedly violate their Constitutional rights.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    132\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, in discussing the FTCA, the dissent\n   \"acknowledge[s] that in a proper context, as delineated by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Abbasi\n   </em>\n   , the\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   remedy may well be available.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    133\n   </footnotemark>\n   We agree, and as we show, after\n   <em>\n    Abbasi\n   </em>\n   , the facts here do present a proper context. The Westfall Act also shows why the dissent is wrong to claim an incongruity between an alien's inability to sue the United States for injuries on Mexican soil under the FTCA and her ability to sue an individual for those same injuries under\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   . That is exactly the structure the Westfall Act imposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Rodriguez cannot bring a state law tort claim against Swartz.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The United States suggests that Rodriguez could sue Swartz for wrongful death under Arizona tort law. But its brief merely mentions the possibility, without fleshing it out with any citations to Arizona law. And it appears that the Westfall Act would bar such a claim. As just discussed, the Westfall Act in effect \"accords federal employees absolute immunity from common-law tort claims arising out of acts they undertake in the course of their official duties.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    134\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   At this stage of litigation, we must assume that Swartz acted within the scope of his employment. The complaint alleges that J.A. was shot by an agent \"stationed on the U.S. side of the fence\" and that Swartz \"acted under color of law.\" Swartz himself interprets the complaint as alleging that he was \"on duty\" when he shot J.A. He argued in district court that he had acted \"within the course and scope of his employment.\" Under the applicable law, an employee \"acts within the scope of employment when performing work assigned by the employer or engaging in a course of conduct subject to the employer's control.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    135\n   </footnotemark>\n   If Swartz was \"on duty\" when he shot J.A., then it seems that he would have been acting within the scope of his employment even if he violated rules governing his conduct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    136\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, Rodriguez cannot bring a state-law tort action against Swartz without the Westfall Act converting it into an FTCA suit against the United States.\n   <footnotemark>\n    137\n   </footnotemark>\n   At that point, as discussed, the claim would be barred by the FTCA's foreign country exception because the injury occurred in Mexico. Although the application of Arizona law would not on its face qualify as the application of foreign law, the concern was that a state's choice of law rules as applied to common law torts\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   still require the application of foreign law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Restitution is not an adequate alternative.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The United States indicted and tried Swartz for murdering J.A. Though a jury acquitted him of murder, the government has indicated that it will retry him for manslaughter. If he is convicted, federal law will require him to pay restitution to J.A.'s estate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    138\n   </footnotemark>\n   The United States argues that such restitution is an adequate remedy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   But restitution is not an adequate remedy for several reasons. First, even if a federal agent commits a crime in the course of his employment, the government has discretion whether to charge him. A criminal charge is the government's remedy, not the victim's. Second, Swartz can be convicted of a crime only if his guilt is proven \"beyond a reasonable doubt.\" By contrast, a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   claim requires the jury to find only that it is \"more likely than not\" that Swartz used objectively unreasonable force.\n   <footnotemark>\n    139\n   </footnotemark>\n   So even if Swartz is acquitted of all criminal charges, he could still be liable for money damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    140\n   </footnotemark>\n   Third, criminal charges were potentially available in\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   itself, yet that availability did not bar a damages cause of action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    141\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Section 1983 does not preclude a\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n    remedy.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   According to the United States and the dissent,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   implies the absence of a damages remedy here. Under \u00a7 1983, a state or local official who violates the constitution may be sued for damages by \"any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    142\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because J.A. was not an American citizen, and because he was not shot within the jurisdiction of the United States, Rodriguez could not sue a state or local police officer for this type of shooting. Thus, the argument goes, Rodriguez should not be allowed to sue Swartz under\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   , either. The dissent claims that it is \"bizarre\" for federal officers to face liability when state officers would not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   We disagree. Nearly 150 years ago, in response to an urgent message from President Grant, Congress enacted what became \u00a7 1983\n   <footnotemark>\n    143\n   </footnotemark>\n   as part of legislation to ensure that state and local officials could not escape liability for constitutional violations, which were endemic in the recently defeated Confederate States.\n   <footnotemark>\n    144\n   </footnotemark>\n   Proponents \"continually referred to the failure of the state courts to enforce federal law designed for the protection of the freedman, and saw \u00a7 [1983] as remedying this situation by interposing the federal courts between the State and citizens of the United States.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    145\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is inconceivable that, at the same time, Congress thought about (and deliberately excluded liability for) cross-border incidents involving federal officials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    5. There is no evidence a Mexican court could grant a remedy.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Swartz argues that Rodriguez could seek a remedy in a Mexican court. But that argument appears to be a mere makeweight. Swartz does not cite any authority showing that a Mexican court could exercise jurisdiction over him or that Rodriguez would have a remedy under Mexican law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    146\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nor does he attempt to show how\n   Rodriguez could execute on a judgment from a Mexican court without running afoul of the Westfall Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    6. The remaining arguments also fail.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   We can summarily dispose of the three remaining arguments for the availability of some other remedy. First, even though the Torture Victim Protection Act (an amendment to the Alien Tort Claims Act) does not apply to American officials,\n   <footnotemark>\n    147\n   </footnotemark>\n   that is because Congress was focused on allowing claims for violations of customary international law against foreign officials, not barring suits against American ones. The goal was the codification of a particular Second Circuit opinion construing the Alien Tort Claims Act to allow suit against foreign torturers; Congress was responding to an attack on that construction by an influential judge.\n   <footnotemark>\n    148\n   </footnotemark>\n   Domestic officials were not at issue. Second, there is a history of diplomacy when the military harms aliens abroad.\n   <footnotemark>\n    149\n   </footnotemark>\n   But this case is not about the military, and nothing in the record suggests that any diplomatic remedy for J.A.'s mother is available. And third, Congress does permit discretionary administrative payments for injuries suffered abroad if Drug Enforcement Administration, State Department, or military personnel cause those injuries.\n   <footnotemark>\n    150\n   </footnotemark>\n   But unlike the Border Patrol, those agencies routinely operate and maintain an extended presence abroad.\n   <footnotemark>\n    151\n   </footnotemark>\n   Congress thus granted those agencies, as aspects of the United States, the discretion to pay for foreign tort claims to promote international comity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    152\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under these statutes, such a discretionary payment to an alien is an effect, not the purpose. These payments do not say anything about a Congressional intent to preclude\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   claims against individuals. If anything, these statutes mostly cross-reference the FTCA,\n   <footnotemark>\n    153\n   </footnotemark>\n   under which, after the Westfall Act, the availability of discretionary administrative payments and lawsuits against the United States does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   bar action against individual officers when the claim is a constitutional tort.\n   <footnotemark>\n    154\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   In short, for Rodriguez, it is damages under\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   or nothing, and Congress did not intend to preclude\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    D. No \"special factors\" are present in this case.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Though a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   action is Rodriguez's only available adequate remedy, we cannot extend\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   if a \"special factor\" counsels hesitation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    155\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because we must proceed with caution and are reluctant to extend\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   , we have carefully weighed all the reasons Swartz and the United States have offered for denying a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   cause of action. But this case does not present any such special factors. We are \"well suited ... to consider and weigh the costs and benefits of allowing a damages action to proceed\" in this cross-border-shooting case, and there are no \"sound reasons to think that Congress might doubt the efficacy or necessity of a damages remedy.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    156\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The special factors analysis is almost always performed at a high level of specificity, not at the abstract level.\n   <footnotemark>\n    157\n   </footnotemark>\n   For example,\n   <em>\n    Ziglar v. Abbasi\n   </em>\n   looked at specific claims about detention policies in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, not at seizures and prison policies generally.\n   <footnotemark>\n    158\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Wilkie v. Robbins\n   </em>\n   also focused on the concrete facts and circumstances of that case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    159\n   </footnotemark>\n   Likewise here, we look for special factors in terms of the specific facts alleged in the complaint, not cross-border shootings generally.\n   <footnotemark>\n    160\n   </footnotemark>\n   In so doing, it is essential to keep in mind that Rodriguez does not seek damages from the United States. Neither does she seek an injunction or declaratory judgment that might affect future government actions. Instead, she brings only a claim for money damages against Swartz as an individual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Of course, in many hypothetical situations, a cross-border shooting would not give rise to a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   action. And in some situations (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , repelling an armed invasion or foiling violent smugglers), it would be frivolous to claim a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   remedy. But this case involves the unjustifiable and intentional killing of someone who was simply walking down a street in Mexico and who did not direct any activity toward the United States. Our discussion is limited to those facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    1. This case is not about policies or policymakers.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   A\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   claim is \"not a proper vehicle for altering an entity's policy,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    161\n   </footnotemark>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Abbasi\n   </em>\n   holds that a special factor is present when a plaintiff challenges high-level\n   executive branch policies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    162\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Abbasi\n   </em>\n   sued policymakers, including the Attorney General and the FBI Director,\n   <footnotemark>\n    163\n   </footnotemark>\n   in order to challenge \"major elements of the Government's whole response to the September 11 attacks\" and any subsequent attacks that might have been planned.\n   <footnotemark>\n    164\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   But Rodriguez does not challenge any government policy whatsoever.\n   <footnotemark>\n    165\n   </footnotemark>\n   And neither the United States nor Swartz argues that he followed government policy. Instead, federal regulations expressly\n   <em>\n    prohibited\n   </em>\n   Swartz from using deadly force in the circumstances alleged.\n   <footnotemark>\n    166\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rodriguez also sued a rank-and-file officer, not the head of the Border Patrol or any other policy-making official. This case is therefore like the ones that\n   <em>\n    Abbasi\n   </em>\n   distinguished-those involving \"standard law enforcement operations\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    167\n   </footnotemark>\n   and \"individual instances of ... law enforcement overreach.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    168\n   </footnotemark>\n   The standards governing Swartz's conduct are the same here as they would be in any other excessive force case. Thus,\n   <em>\n    Abbasi\n   </em>\n   implies that\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   is available.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Extending\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n    does not implicate national security.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Abbasi\n   </em>\n   , there were national security concerns because plaintiffs challenged the government's response to September 11. That was a special factor because determining how best to protect the United States is a job for Congress and the President, not judges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    169\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the same time, however,\n   <em>\n    Abbasi\n   </em>\n   warned that \"national-security concerns must not become a talisman used to ward off inconvenient claims-a label used to cover a multitude of sins.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    170\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"This danger of abuse,\"\n   <em>\n    Abbasi\n   </em>\n   continued, \"is even more heightened given the difficulty of defining the security interest in domestic cases.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    171\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, \"national-security concerns\" are indeed waved before us as such a \"talisman.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   We recognize that Border Patrol agents protect the United States from unlawful entries and terrorist threats.\n   <footnotemark>\n    172\n   </footnotemark>\n   Those activities help guarantee our national security. But no one suggests that national security involves shooting people who are just walking down a street in Mexico.\n   <footnotemark>\n    173\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover,\n   holding Swartz liable for this constitutional violation would not meaningfully deter Border Patrol agents from performing their duties. The United States and Swartz have identified no duty that would have required Swartz to shoot J.A. Border Patrol agents have faced Fourth Amendment\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   claims in the past.\n   <footnotemark>\n    174\n   </footnotemark>\n   Agents sued under\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   are liable only when they violate a \"clearly established\" constitutional right, and the rules governing the use of lethal force are clearly established.\n   <footnotemark>\n    175\n   </footnotemark>\n   It cannot harm national security to hold Swartz civilly liable any more than it would to hold him criminally liable, and the government is currently trying to do the latter. Thus, national security is not a special factor here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Extending\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n    would not have problematic foreign policy implications.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The United States argues that we should not extend\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   here because the cross-border nature of the shooting implicates foreign policy. The United States is correct that courts should not extend\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   if it requires courts to judge American foreign policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    176\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the United States has not explained how any policy is implicated or could be complicated by applying\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   to this shooting. It has not identified any policy that might be undermined. Just as national security cannot be used as a talisman to ward off inconvenient claims, neither does the \"mere incantation\" of the magic words \"foreign policy\" cause a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   remedy to disappear.\n   <footnotemark>\n    177\n   </footnotemark>\n   In this case, extending\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   would not implicate American foreign policy. There is no American foreign policy embracing shootings like the one pleaded here. To the contrary: it would threaten international relations if we declined to extend a cause of action, because it would mean American courts could not give a remedy for a gross violation of Mexican sovereignty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The United States says that this case implicates foreign policy because the American and Mexican governments have discussed \"the use of force at the border\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    178\n   </footnotemark>\n   and created a bilateral council to \"address border violence, use of force, and ways to address and mitigate incidents of border violence.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    179\n   </footnotemark>\n   It then says that if we extend\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   here, it will \"inject the courts into these sensitive matters of international diplomacy and risk undermining the government's ability to speak with one voice in international affairs.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   But that argument proves too much. It would have the courts decline to address any crimes involving our border with Mexico. If the government's argument were correct, then courts would be excluded from all \"incidents of border violence.\" Yet district courts along the border address such incidents routinely, in smuggling cases particularly, concurrently with whatever diplomacy may also be addressing them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   We fail to see how extending\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   here would actually implicate American foreign policy. No policy has been brought to our attention, and no policymaking individuals have been sued, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Abbasi\n   </em>\n   . Swartz did not act pursuant to government policy. He broke the rules that were in the Code of Federal Regulations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    180\n   </footnotemark>\n   And the only policy interest that the United States has put forward-maintaining dialogue with the Mexican government-shows that our government wants to\n   <em>\n    reduce\n   </em>\n   the number of cross-border shootings. To that end, the United States prosecuted Swartz for murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The only foreign policy concern that we can glean from the briefs is the need to avoid violating Mexican sovereignty. As Mexico says in its amicus brief, \"giving Mexican nationals an effective remedy for harm caused by arbitrary and unlawful conduct directed across the border by U.S. Border Patrol agents would not conflict with Mexico's laws and customs and could not possibly damage relations between our two countries.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Any presumption against extraterritorial remedies is rebutted.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Finally, we do not dispute the dissent's suggestion that the presumption against the extraterritorial application of statutes suggests an analogous presumption against extraterritorial\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   claims. But the dissent ignores that the presumption can be overcome when actions \"touch and concern the territory of the United States ... with sufficient force to displace the presumption.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    181\n   </footnotemark>\n   That is the case here. Swartz was an American agent acting within the scope of his employment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    182\n   </footnotemark>\n   Swartz's bullets crossed the border, but he pulled the trigger here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    183\n   </footnotemark>\n   We have a compelling interest in regulating our own government agents' conduct on our own soil.\n   <footnotemark>\n    184\n   </footnotemark>\n   Presumably, that is why the United States was willing to apply its criminal law \"extraterritorially\" in charging Swartz with\n   homicide, even while simultaneously arguing that the presumption against extraterritoriality precludes the\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   claim here because the injury happened a few feet onto the other side of the border. A damages remedy against an officer for unconstitutional misconduct strengthens the set of disincentives that deter it. And, as we have shown, no other special factors counsel against this extraterritorial application of\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Under the particular set of facts alleged in this case, Swartz is not entitled to qualified immunity. The Fourth Amendment applies here. No reasonable officer could have thought that he could shoot J.A. dead if, as pleaded, J.A. was innocently walking down a street in Mexico. And despite our reluctance to extend\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   , we do so here: no other adequate remedy is available, there is no reason to infer that Congress deliberately chose to withhold a remedy, and the asserted special factors either do not apply or counsel in favor of extending\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Of course, the facts as pleaded may turn out to be unsupported. When all of the facts have been exposed, the shooting may turn out to have been excusable or justified. There is and can be no general rule against the use of deadly force by Border Patrol agents. But in the procedural context of this case, we must take the facts as alleged in the complaint.

The majority authorizes an impermissible extension of\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   to a new context despite the presence of numerous special factors counselling judicial hesitation. In doing so, the majority creates a circuit split and tees up our court for a new \"chastening\" by the Supreme Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

However, the majority downplays the new-context inquiry, relegating its analysis on the question to only a few sentences. To properly address the majority's error, I first consider the Supreme Court's new instructions on the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   \"The proper test for determining whether a case presents a new\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   context is as follows.

That the differences between a given claim and previous\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   cases are \"small\" is insignificant: \"Given th[e] Court's expressed caution about extending the\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   remedy, ... the new-context inquiry is easily satisfied.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1865.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   The Court provided a non-exhaustive list of differences that may render a given context new.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1859-60. For example,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-139\">\n   A case might differ in a meaningful way because of the rank of the officers involved; the constitutional right at issue; the generality or specificity of the official action; the extent of judicial guidance as to how an officer should respond to the problem or emergency to be confronted; the statutory or other legal mandate under which the officer was operating; the risk of disruptive intrusion by the Judiciary into the functioning of other branches; or the presence of potential special factors that previous\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   cases did not consider.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1860. At bottom, the touchstone is whether the \"claims bear ... resemblance to the three\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   claims the Court has approved in the past,\" namely, \"a claim against FBI agents for handcuffing a man in his own home without a warrant; a claim against a Congressman for firing his female secretary; and a claim against prison officials for failure to treat an inmate's asthma.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1860.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Rodriguez's claims bear no resemblance whatsoever to the three\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   claims previously authorized by the Court. The differences are obvious: J.A. was a Mexican national, and his death, caused by the actions of a Border Patrol agent, occurred in Mexico.

This approach clearly flouts the Supreme Court's instructions.

Rather, heeding the Court's guidance in\n   <em>\n    Abbasi\n   </em>\n   , I have undertaken my analysis with one controlling question in mind: \" '[W]ho should decide' whether to provide for a damages remedy, Congress or the courts?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1857 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Bush\n   </em>\n   , 462 U.S. at 380,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6188608\" index=\"541\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/367/#p388\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Here, the task of deciding whether to create a damages remedy for Rodriguez lies squarely within the purview of Congress, not of the judiciary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   By creating an extraterritorial\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   remedy in this case, the majority veers into uncharted territory, ignores Supreme Court law, and upsets the separation of powers between the judiciary and the political branches of government. The majority pays only lip service to the new-context inquiry, without any real regard for the principles set forth in\n   <em>\n    Abbasi\n   </em>\n   , and concludes, remarkably, that there are no special factors weighing against this unprecedented expansion of\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   . The Supreme Court has made clear its views on expanding\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   , and the majority has, in turn, made clear how it views the Court's instructions.

Whereas an alien injured on Mexican soil by a Border Patrol agent shooting from Texas lacks recourse under\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   , an alien injured on Mexican soil by an agent shooting from California or Arizona may sue for damages. This is an untenable result, and will lead to an uneven administration of the rule of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   Applying Supreme Court law, I would adopt the reasoning of the Fifth Circuit.
