(collectively, \"Rembrandt\") filed in the mid-2000s against dozens of cable companies, cable equipment manufacturers, and broadcast networks. The cases were consolidated in the District of Delaware. After several years of litigation, the district court entered final judgment against Rembrandt as to all claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Many of the defendants (collectively, \"Appellees\") thereafter filed a motion requesting attorney fees under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20285\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in deeming this case exceptional, but that the court erred by failing to analyze fully the connection between the fees awarded and Rembrandt's misconduct. We thus affirm the district court's exceptional-case determination, vacate the district court's fee\n   award, and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A. The Patents in Suit\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The underlying litigation involves nine patents belonging to Rembrandt. Eight of them address cable modem technology- U.S. Patent Nos. 4,937,819 (\"the '819 patent\"), 5,008,903 (\"the '903 patent\"), 5,710,761 (\"the '761 patent\"), 5,719,858 (\"the '858 patent\"), 5,778,234 (\"the '234 patent\"), 5,852,631 (\"the '631 patent\"), 6,131,159 (\"the '159 patent\"), and 6,950,444 (\"the '444 patent\"). The ninth patent,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%205%2C243%2C627\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 5,243,627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"the '627 patent\"), involves over-the-air signals. Although the patented technology is not directly relevant here, the history of the patents and the documents associated with the technology bears heavily on the issues on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   1. Rembrandt and Paradyne\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Before Rembrandt obtained the patents at issue, they belonged to Paradyne Networks, Inc. (\"Paradyne\"), a former AT&amp;T subsidiary that developed, manufactured, and distributed network access products. Three former Paradyne employees are relevant to this appeal: Gordon Bremer, the former director of Paradyne's technology department who managed its patent portfolio; Scott Horstemeyer, Paradyne's outside patent prosecution counsel; and Patrick Murphy, Paradyne's Chief Financial Officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In 2002, Paradyne decided that the expected value of the '819 and '858 patents did not justify paying their maintenance fees, and it therefore let the patents lapse. Horstemeyer and Bremer later testified that Paradyne incorrectly believed it could thereafter make belated payments of the maintenance fees to revive the patents if it so desired. The '819 and '858 patents lapsed in June and February 2002, respectively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Following some third-party interest in acquiring the Paradyne patents, Bremer, Horstemeyer, and Murphy decided to petition the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\"PTO\") to revive the '819 and '858 patents. In connection with that request, they represented that \"the delay in payment of the maintenance fee of this patent was unintentional.\" J.A. 141;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   J.A. 150. Horstemeyer testified in these proceedings that he felt he could truthfully say that the failure to pay fees had been unintentional because of Paradyne's misunderstanding about the conditions for revival. Horstemeyer explained, however, that he did not offer this explanation to the PTO at the time because he did not want to deviate from the PTO form. The PTO granted the revival petitions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In September 2004, Paradyne contacted Rembrandt to propose a joint \"patent assertion team\" to \"exploit[ ] the Paradyne patents\"-including the ones that Paradyne had revived. Appellees' Br. 8. In December 2004, Paradyne and Rembrandt executed a patent sale agreement that assigned six of the asserted patents (as well as several others not at issue here) to Rembrandt. The agreement also gave Rembrandt the right to access and copy relevant Paradyne documents. The companies amended their agreement in February 2005, adding the '819 patent to the portfolio of patents assigned to Rembrandt. Rembrandt's in-house counsel, John Meli, asked Paradyne in March 2005 to \"save any material that relates to patents you sold to us or plan to sell to us, including product data that embodies the patented inventions.\" J.A. 203.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   2. Rembrandt and Zhone\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Paradyne was acquired in September 2005 by Zhone Technologies (\"Zhone\"), an equipment manufacturer. Thereafter,\n   Zhone cut much of Paradyne's workforce and footprint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Zhone also began to destroy Paradyne's documents, most of which were housed in a storage facility separate from Paradyne's offices. Zhone's general counsel, Paul Castor, testified that the purpose of the document destruction was to cut storage costs, that boxes of documents were destroyed based on their dates (and not their contents), and that Zhone staff had no time to review their contents before destroying them. Zhone discarded approximately 3,200 boxes of documents in total, 90% of them between September 2005 and April 2006. The destroyed documents related to conception and reduction to practice of the patents at issue; potentially invalidating sales and offers to sell; public uses of prior art products; royalty agreements and licensing; standardization of the relevant technology; and patent prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   There is no direct evidence that anyone at Rembrandt was aware of the document destruction, but Meli-then Rembrandt's in-house counsel-repeatedly visited Paradyne's offices to review and copy documents around the time of the sale to Zhone. Meli and other Rembrandt witnesses later testified that Rembrandt did not send Paradyne or Zhone a formal document retention notice until at least 2007. Several Zhone employees could recall no such requests from Rembrandt before 2008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On February 14, 2006, Rembrandt signed a consulting agreement with Attic IP (\"Attic\"), a consulting firm that Bremer, Murphy, and Horstemeyer had formed. The consultants agreed to provide Rembrandt \"[a]ssistance with patent portfolio analysis and ongoing patent assertion programs.\" J.A. 240. In exchange, Rembrandt would pay Attic an annual flat fee, in addition to a small percentage of licensing or litigation royalties if Rembrandt subsequently acquired any patents from Zhone. The agreement would not take effect until such an acquisition occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Weeks after Bremer signed this agreement-but before Rembrandt had acquired any patents from Zhone, so that Bremer still had no stake in licensing or litigation royalties-Zhone's general counsel, Castor, asked Bremer to review 30 boxes of documents. Bremer wrote back to Castor that the documents \"generally contain[ed] sales/marketing strategies, plans, reports, etc.,\" not \" 'legal' documents.\" J.A. 256. Bremer asked whether Castor wanted him to provide other details and whether the boxes should \"remain in storage or be destroyed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%205%2C243%2C627\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Castor simply wrote back \"destroy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%205%2C243%2C627\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Bremer did not object.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   A few months later, on June 9, 2006, Rembrandt entered into a patent sale agreement with Zhone, acquiring more than 100 patents, including two of the patents in suit (the '444 and '903 patents ). Like the sale agreement with Paradyne, the agreement provided that Zhone would give Rembrandt access to documents relating to the assigned patents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On June 12, 2006, Rembrandt learned that Zhone was planning to discard warehoused documents, including those relevant to the patents Rembrandt had purchased from Paradyne. Rembrandt urged Zhone not to destroy documents relevant to the patents it had purchased and began to work out an arrangement to preserve them. Castor told Rembrandt that it was \"welcome to have\" files relating to the purchased patents but that, if Rembrandt was not interested in them, Zhone would \"likely destroy [them] in accordance with [its] records policy.\" Appellants' Br. 40. Rembrandt told Zhone to send Rembrandt the relevant files.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In August 2006, Rembrandt arranged for the Attic consultants to take custody of the Zhone documents (termed the \"Documents of Common Interest\"), including\n   patent disclosure and prosecution files, patent maintenance files, inventor files, license agreement and acquisition files, technical files, and patent marketing files.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   B. The Present Litigation\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   This brings us to the present litigation. In September 2005, Rembrandt sued Comcast in the Eastern District of Texas, asserting infringement of six patents it had acquired from Paradyne.\n   <em>\n    Rembrandt Techs., LP v. Comcast Corp.\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:05-CV-00443-TJW (E.D. Tex.). Rembrandt then sued several other cable providers in the same district in June 2006.\n   <em>\n    Rembrandt Techs., LP v. Time Warner Cable, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , Nos. 2:06-cv-224 (TJW-CE), 2:06-cv-369 (TJW-CE) (E.D. Tex.);\n   <em>\n    Rembrandt Techs., LP v. Charter Commc'ns, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , Nos. 2:06-cv-223 (TJW-CE), 2:06-cv-507 (TJW-CE) (E.D. Tex.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   After Rembrandt acquired more patents from Zhone, it filed a second wave of litigation in November 2006. Rembrandt added five patents, including two from Zhone, to its pending suits. At that time, the Attic consultants-Bremer, Murphy, and Horstemeyer-gained a stake in the outcome of Rembrandt's litigation. Rembrandt additionally asserted four of those patents against Adelphia Communications Corp. (\"Adelphia\") in Adelphia's ongoing bankruptcy proceedings before the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.\n   <em>\n    Rembrandt Techs., LP v. Adelphia Commc'ns Corp.\n   </em>\n   , Bky. Adv. No. 1:06-1739-reg (Bankr. S.D.N.Y.). Rembrandt also sued several broadcast networks in the District of Delaware.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Rembrandt Techs., LP v. CBS Corp.\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:06-cv-00727-GMS (D. Del.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated all of Rembrandt's pending suits before Judge Sleet in the District of Delaware.\n   <em>\n    In re Rembrandt Techs., LP, Patent Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3436933\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/493/1367/\">\n    493 F.Supp.2d 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (J.P.M.L. 2007). Soon thereafter, several cable modem equipment manufacturers-most of which are among the Appellees here-filed suit against Rembrandt in the District of Delaware seeking a declaratory judgment that their products did not infringe any valid patents.\n   <em>\n    Motorola, Inc. v. Rembrandt Techs., LP\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:07-cv-00752-GMS (D. Del.). The declaratory judgment action was consolidated into the multi-district litigation as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   1. Litigation on the Merits\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   After a\n   <em>\n    Markman\n   </em>\n   hearing in August 2008, the district court issued claim construction orders on the nine patents, all of which were adverse to Rembrandt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Rembrandt Techs., LP Patent Litig.\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:07-md-01848-GMS,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%205773604\">\n    2008 WL 5773604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Del. Nov. 19, 2008) ;\n   <em>\n    In re Rembrandt Techs., LP Patent Litig.\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:07-md-01848-GMS,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%205773627\">\n    2008 WL 5773627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Del. Nov. 7, 2008). On January 6, 2009, Rembrandt advised the parties that, in light of the claim construction order, it would not pursue its infringement claims on three of the patents in suit-the '631, '819, and '858 patents -unless the district court's claim construction was reversed on appeal. And, after further discovery, Rembrandt offered to drop the '903 and '234 patents from the litigation in March and May 2009, respectively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On July 31, 2009, after the parties executed a mutual covenant not to sue, Rembrandt moved to dismiss its claims on eight of the patents, and the defendants moved to dismiss their associated invalidity counterclaims. The district court granted the motion and dismissed the claims and counterclaims. On the remaining '627 patent, Rembrandt stipulated to summary judgment of noninfringement subject to its appeal of the district court's claim construction decisions. The district court granted the motion on July 8, 2011. We affirmed the district court's claim construction\n   in 2012.\n   <em>\n    In re Rembrandt Techs., LP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3996927\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/496/36/\">\n    496 F. App'x 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fed. Cir. 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Until Rembrandt dismissed its claims, the parties engaged in considerable fact discovery. Appellees produced more than 15 million pages of documents, Rembrandt took 75 depositions, and Appellees took 35 depositions of their own. Rembrandt also provided eight reports from five experts, and Appellees responded with eleven reports from seven experts. Rembrandt incurred $20 million in fees from 2006 to 2008 alone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Appellees also subpoenaed documents from Paradyne and Zhone. Although Rembrandt's attorneys responded to these subpoenas, Rembrandt never searched the warehouse where it claimed Paradyne's boxes were stored, nor acknowledged any document destruction until after April 2008. Rembrandt instead claimed that it could not ascertain information relevant to the on-sale bar, and it denied on several occasions that it had access to or control over Paradyne product documentation. Rembrandt also asserted in interrogatory responses and in its opposition to summary judgment that there was no evidence of prior sales, without mentioning that relevant documents potentially reflecting such sales might have been destroyed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   2. Fee Motions\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Through discovery, Appellees ultimately learned about the abandonment and revival of the '819 and '858 patents, the three Attic consultants' contingent interests in the litigation, and Zhone's destruction of documents. On July 8, 2009-after Rembrandt had dropped its infringement case as to five of the patents, but before the covenant not to sue had been finalized-the district court granted Appellees permission to file a motion for sanctions as a motion in limine. Two weeks later, the parties entered into the covenant not to sue on all patents other than the '627 patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On November 16, 2009, Appellees moved for a determination that the case was exceptional under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20285\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and for an award of attorney fees. The parties adverse to Rembrandt-which the parties defined as \"All Other Parties,\" or \"AOPs\"-argued that the case was exceptional because Rembrandt (1) asserted two patents that Paradyne had revived improperly; (2) allowed Zhone to spoliate evidence; (3) improperly gave the Attic consultants an interest contingent on the litigation outcome; and (4) threatened AOPs with a baseless injunction demand. Adelphia additionally argued in a separate motion that Rembrandt (1) had failed to comply with the marking requirement of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20287\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , (2) possessed evidence that the on-sale bar invalidated two of the asserted patents, and (3) engaged in bad-faith conduct before the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.\n   <footnotemark>\n    \u2020\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   On July 13, 2011, the district court struck the fee motions as premature in light of the still-live dispute with regard to the '627 patent. But, after we affirmed the district court's ruling on the '627 patent in 2012, the district court ordered that the fees motions would be deemed re-filed as of September 7, 2011. More than a year later, the court returned the sealed record to the parties without ruling on the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Soon after the Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    Octane Fitness, LLC v. ICON Health &amp; Fitness, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12579874,12706997\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1749/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 1749\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12579874,12706997\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1749/\">\n    188 L.Ed.2d 816\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014), AOPs submitted a notice of supplemental authority to the district court citing that case. Rembrandt responded by arguing that AOPs had abandoned their motion because the case had been closed for two-and-a-half years and because the pertinent briefs and supporting documentation had been returned to AOP's counsel, who had accepted them without objection. Rembrandt also contended that a ruling on the motions would cause great prejudice to Rembrandt because the briefings and supporting documents were stale. Rembrandt further argued that the case was not exceptional under the\n   <em>\n    Octane Fitness\n   </em>\n   standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   On August 20, 2015, the district court issued a four-page order ruling on the motions, which by then had been pending for nearly four years.\n   <em>\n    Exceptional Case Order\n   </em>\n   , at 1-4. The district court attributed the delay in issuing the order to its \"own administrative carelessness.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12579874,12706997\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1749/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 2 n.3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The court determined that the case was \"indeed exceptional\" for three reasons.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12579874,12706997\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1749/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 3 n.4.

The District Court's Finding that the Witness Payments Were Improper Is Not Clearly Erroneous\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Rembrandt first disputes the district court's decision that \"the fee structure for Rembrandt's fact witnesses was unreasonable and improperly linked to the outcome of the case, giving rise to a considerable risk of tainted testimony.\"\n   <em>\n    Exceptional Case Order\n   </em>\n   , at 3 n.4. Rembrandt contends that it never expected the Attic consultants to become fact witnesses, that the agreement did not prejudice Appellees, and that the agreements were permissible under our precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   After filing suit based on the Paradyne patents, Rembrandt hired three former Paradyne employees in February 2006 to provide \"[a]ssistance with ...\n   <em>\n    ongoing\n   </em>\n   patent assertion programs.\" J.A. 240 (emphasis added). Although the agreement did not immediately give the consultants an interest in the outcome of the ongoing litigation, it clearly contemplated future \"assertion programs.\" It expressly granted the consultants a stake in any litigation involving the Zhone patents, once acquired. Rembrandt bought patents from Zhone in June 2006 and asserted them later that year. The district court reasonably could have found that, when Rembrandt signed the consulting agreement, it was likely that the consultants would play a role in litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   It also was foreseeable, at the very least, that the consultants would become fact witnesses in that litigation, given their roles within Paradyne. Meli-Rembrandt's former in-house counsel-acknowledged as much in his deposition. Whether Rembrandt identified the consultants as witnesses is beside the point. As Appellees correctly point out, all three witnesses\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   in fact testify about their knowledge of facts relevant to the merits of the lawsuit. Bremer testified about his involvement in patenting and licensing, the decision to abandon patents (which was related to Appellees' inequitable conduct defense), the development process that led to the patented technology, and potentially invalidating sales of products that may have practiced the asserted patents. And Horstemeyer testified that he prosecuted most of the asserted patents, that he participated in the patent review board at Paradyne that decided whether to proceed with patent applications, and that he helped decide whether to abandon patents. Murphy was not involved as directly, but he was Paradyne's CFO during the relevant period and also participated in the patent review board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   It is true, as Rembrandt notes, that the district court never found that any witnesses gave false testimony. But the issue that the district court correctly identified was not that witnesses lied, but that the contingent fee arrangement gave them incentives to lie. For exactly this reason, the Delaware State Bar Association has advised lawyers not to pay, offer to pay, or acquiesce in payments to witnesses contingent on the outcome of the case. Del. State Bar Ass'n Comm. on Prof'l Ethics, Opinion 1994-1 at 2-3,\n   <em>\n    available at\n   </em>\n   http://media.dsba.org/ethics/pdfs/19941.pdf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Rembrandt may be right that Bremer had simply forgotten key details about sales associated with a twenty-year-old project. But his contingent interest in the litigation outcome gave him a strong incentive not to remember those sales, and it renders Appellees' claim of tainted testimony at least plausible. And, though Bremer had a similarly innocent explanation for his tacit approval of Castor's decision to destroy sales documents, Bremer's potential stake in the case may well have led the district court to see his acquiescence in a different light. It was reasonable for the district court to find \"that the fee structure for Rembrandt's fact witnesses was unreasonable and improperly linked to the outcome of the case, giving rise to a considerable risk of tainted testimony.\"\n   <em>\n    Exceptional Case Order\n   </em>\n   , at 3 n.4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Rembrandt contends that the district court's decision conflicts with our holding in\n   <em>\n    Ethicon, Inc. v.

The testimony that U.S. Surgical secured from Choi was known to be case-dispositive, but when Rembrandt hired the Attic consultants, all Rembrandt could have known is that their testimony would likely be relevant to certain defenses. And the\n   <em>\n    Ethicon\n   </em>\n   agreement conditioned the bulk of the payment on U.S. Surgical's prevailing in the litigation, which provided a much stronger incentive to the inventor than a percentage of any licensing or litigation proceeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   But, as Appellees note, the agreement in\n   <em>\n    Ethicon\n   </em>\n   involved the\n   <em>\n    assignment\n   </em>\n   of patent rights. In allowing the assignor to testify, we noted that \"[a] patent license agreement that binds the inventor to participate in subsequent litigation is very common,\" because it \"simply assures the licensee that it will be able to defend the property in which it has purchased an interest.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581942,12448254\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/176/494/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Rembrandt also cites several district court decisions permitting contingent payment arrangements, but each of those opinions relies on the fact that the payments were \"made in connection with an assignment or license of patent rights.\"\n   <em>\n    ESN, LLC v.

Mar. 31, 2017) (observing that \"the Agreement involves assignment of the Patent, not an agreement to pay fact witnesses to testify, and the witnesses identified included the inventor\"). Rembrandt identifies no comparable agreements to the one here, however, where the contingent interest was given to likely witnesses\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   for their help with a licensing or litigation campaign.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In short,\n   <em>\n    Ethicon\n   </em>\n   did not upend the longstanding ethical rule in Delaware and other jurisdictions that fact witnesses to a lawsuit should not be paid contingent on the outcome of the suit. It is instead best read as an exception to that rule that applies only when the contingent payment accompanies the assignment or license of patent rights. As we said in\n   <em>\n    Ethicon\n   </em>\n   , it makes sense for a licensee or assignee to give the licensor or assignor an incentive \"to defend the property in which [the former\n   ] has purchased an interest.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11879751\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/135/1456/\">\n    135 F.3d at 1465\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And these contingent interests make sense for sellers as well-they ensure that, if the patented technology unexpectedly gains value, the licensor or assignor can reap some portion of the windfall. The agreement between Rembrandt and Attic, on the other hand, was fundamentally different from the sale of a right in a patent, and it does not implicate these policy rationales. The district court's decision does not call these \"very common\" agreements into question,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11879751\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/135/1456/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , as Rembrandt suggests, and its finding that the witness payments were improper is not clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   2.

Rembrandt points out that Paradyne and then Zhone always maintained physical possession of the documents while they were being destroyed. In signing the patent sale agreements, however, Paradyne and Zhone legally obligated themselves to give Rembrandt access to all documents\n   related to the assigned patents. Rembrandt did not just obtain this right; it exercised the right by asking Bremer to collect the Documents of Common Interest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    \u2021\n   </footnotemark>\n   As noted above, Rembrandt attorneys issued discovery responses and made all document productions on behalf of Paradyne and Zhone until September 2008. The district court reasonably could infer that Rembrandt, not Paradyne or Zhone, actually had control over the documents that Zhone destroyed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Next, under Third Circuit law, \"a finding of bad faith is pivotal to a spoliation determination.\"\n   <em>\n    Bull\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3863221\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/665/68/#p73\">\n    665 F.3d at 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Jur. 2d Evidence \u00a7 177 ). Rembrandt emphasizes that Zhone only destroyed the documents to clear warehouse space and did not even look at their contents. Indeed, nothing in the record suggests that Zhone acted with fraudulent intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   But the issue is not Zhone's bad faith; it is Rembrandt's. Rembrandt instructed Paradyne in March 2005 to preserve material related to the patents sold and asked Zhone for access to or copies of all relevant materials in January 2006. Rembrandt also obtained boilerplate contractual assurances from Paradyne that Paradyne would provide \"all material information within its possession ... regarding the assigned patents.\" J.A. 155, \u00a7 3.1.3; Appellants' Br. 61. And only in June 2006, after Zhone had destroyed the bulk of the Paradyne documents, did Bremer tell Rembrandt about the document destruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Two facts in the record suggest, however, that Rembrandt knew that document destruction was a significant risk. First, Meli visited the former Paradyne facility in Florida shortly after the Zhone acquisition, and he reported that \"every cubicle is gone, there's nobody in it, [and] papers are strewn all over the place.\" J.A. 2419-20, 72:14-73:11; Appellees' Br. 11. He testified that he \"really [did] believe it was shut down\" and \"being dismantled.\" J.A. 2419, 72:22-25; J.A. 2422, 75:11-22; Appellees' Br. 10, 14, 50. By that time, litigation already was ongoing, and Meli should have known that some of the documents \"strewn all over the place\" might be relevant to that litigation. And second, Bremer-who by then was on the Rembrandt payroll-participated in the document destruction well before June 2006. He reviewed dozens of boxes for potential disposal in March 2006, some of which were sales documents, and he allowed Zhone to order them to be destroyed. Bremer was not a lawyer, but he had run a patent program for 30 years and later admitted that he knew that sales documents could be relevant to the on-sale bar. He testified that he did not preserve the documents simply because he had not been instructed to do so. Bremer also admitted that he never asked for other warehoused documents to be preserved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Even after it knew about the risk of document destruction, Rembrandt did not issue a formal document retention notice until May 2008. Rembrandt points to its January 2006 letter, in which it sought \"access to, and copies of, all documents that may be related to the patents in suit,\" including but not limited to \"any documents relating to the products that embody any invention claimed in the patents in suit (both technical and financial documents).\" J.A. 229-30. That request did imply\n   that Zhone should hand over those documents instead of destroying them. But subsequent testimony from Rembrandt's own in-house attorneys suggests that even they did not consider the 2006 letter a document-retention notice. Given the significant risk of document destruction, Rembrandt could have at least issued a litigation hold.\n   <footnotemark>\n    \u00a7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Rembrandt relies heavily on\n   <em>\n    St. Clair Intellectual Property Consultants, Inc. v.

Although some of Appellees' more conspiratorial allegations go too far, the district court had a reasonable basis to conclude that Rembrandt stood idly by while Zhone destroyed documents.

In a memo from Bremer to Horstemeyer on November 24, 2003, Bremer acknowledged that the PTO would not allow the revival of a patent unless the failure to pay maintenance fees was \"unavoidable\" or \"unintentional.\" J.A. 138. Bremer told Horstemeyer that he felt that the abandonment was \"unintentional\" under the meaning of the PTO form because \"we would NOT have abandoned [certain patents] if we understood that reviving was not possible.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869436\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/703/511/#p519\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Bremer testified that it was Paradyne's \"understanding at the time of abandonment that a patent could be revived within 24 months of the USPTO official abandonment date.\" J.A. 144. Horstemeyer also testified that he \"thought [it] to be a true statement\" that the delay in payment was unintentional. J.A. 1162, 195:13-20. He claimed that the failure to pay maintenance fees was due to \"a misunderstanding about ... when the deadline actually was,\" and that he was \"instructed not to make that payment\" because of the misunderstanding. J.A. 1174, 207:3-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   As Appellees point out, however, that explanation is difficult to square with Bremer's acknowledgment in another document that \"[f]ailure to pay [maintenance] fees results in loss of patent rights.\" J.A. 3880. And Bremer testified that Horstemeyer was involved in the patent review board meetings where Paradyne decided which patents to abandon. Horstemeyer knew, in other words, exactly why Paradyne decided to abandon the '819 and '858 patents -namely, because it believed that they were not worth the fee. Rembrandt's explanation is also difficult to square with documents indicating that it was Bremer's surprise that a third party might have interest in the abandoned patents that prompted their revival.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The district court could fairly conclude from this evidence that the claim of mistake was a post hoc rationalization. The district court also could have decided the same about Paradyne's explanation for why it told the PTO that the abandonment was \"unintentional.\" In making these factual findings, the district court also considered the misconduct discussed above, in which Bremer and Horstemeyer also were involved.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Exceptional Case Order\n   </em>\n   , at 3 n.4 (\"[T]he fact witnesses-discussed above-were the very same Paradyne employees who engaged in the inequitable conduct.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reargument Order\n   </em>\n   , at 2 n.1 (\"The court has been furnished with sufficient evidence to conclude that revival of the patents in this case fit into a pattern of misconduct, and therefore deception was the most reasonable inference.\"). Although the other misconduct occurred much later, the district court was entitled to weigh it when assessing the key players' trustworthiness and the likelihood that they had deceptive intent.

That, too, is an issue of fact, for which the district court is owed deference. Although the district court did not elaborate on this finding, Appellees identify sufficient evidence to support it. Appellees cite, in particular, a spreadsheet that Bremer sent Meli in August 2006 about the patents in which the third party had expressed interest. The row in that spreadsheet about the '858 patent indicated that it had been abandoned. Although Rembrandt dismisses the likelihood that it could have gleaned information about the improper revival from this spreadsheet, the spreadsheet was not large-it contained only 30 patents-and among them were patents that Rembrandt already had asserted in this case and to which Rembrandt would have paid close attention. The district court reasonably could have found that Rembrandt knew that the '858 patent had been abandoned and chose not to investigate how it had been revived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Appellees also cite other documents that were available to Rembrandt in which Paradyne employees discussed their plan to revive the patents. Rembrandt had access to these documents under the patent sale agreement. Although the '819 patent was not listed in the spreadsheet, the fact that at least one patent had been revived in this way, in combination with the other documents accessible to Rembrandt, could give rise to the inference that Rembrandt knew about, or could have learned about, the improper revival of both the '819 and '858 patents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Rembrandt argues that the district court's implicit application of the \"should have known\" standard imposes too high a burden on Rembrandt and conflicts with our guidance in\n   <em>\n    Therasense\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5715257\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/649/1276/#p1285\">\n    649 F.3d at 1290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"A finding that the misrepresentation or omission amounts to gross negligence or negligence under a 'should have known' standard does not satisfy [the] intent requirement.\"). But Appellees are right that Rembrandt conflates the inequitable conduct and exceptional case inquiries. The first question-the one governed by\n   <em>\n    Therasense\n   </em>\n   -is whether\n   <em>\n    Paradyne\n   </em>\n   committed inequitable conduct. The second question-to which\n   <em>\n    Therasense\n   </em>\n   does not apply-is whether Paradyne's conduct renders\n   <em>\n    Rembrandt's\n   </em>\n   case exceptional. Rembrandt's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Therasense\n   </em>\n   in the latter context is misplaced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   4. The District Court Followed the Proper Procedures in Making Its Exceptional-Case Determination\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   It is undisputed that Rembrandt did not request an evidentiary hearing at any point before the district court made its\n   exceptional-case determination. The district court sat on the motion for years, and it even returned the sealed exhibits to the parties, but it never resolved the motion. Five years after the motion was filed, and three years after the motion was re-filed after judgment was entered on the '627 patent, Appellees submitted supplemental authority citing\n   <em>\n    Octane Fitness\n   </em>\n   , and Rembrandt responded. Although Rembrandt argued that Appellees had abandoned the motion and that ruling on the stale record would be prejudicial, Rembrandt did not request an evidentiary hearing. Rembrandt was never entitled to assume that the motions would be denied or simply ignored. Indeed, Rembrandt apparently did not make such an assumption; its filings show that it contemplated at least the possibility of a ruling on the motions. Rembrandt waived its procedural objection to the lack of an evidentiary hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The district court also was not required to afford Rembrandt an evidentiary hearing in this case. Rembrandt is right that \"[t]he imposition of monetary sanctions by a court implicates fundamental notions of due process and thus requires 'fair notice and an opportunity for a hearing on the record.' \"\n   <em>\n    Rogal v.

The Third Circuit remanded for the district court to hold the hearing, in particular, because the witness whose testimony the district court found sanctionable \"did not have the same incentive at trial to try to clear up all of the apparent contradictions and inconsistencies in his testimony or to try to show his good faith as he would have had at an evidentiary hearing on the question of sanctions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   That is not the case here.

Appellees point to their own itemization of the documents destroyed and their relevance to the case. Rembrandt, on the other hand, submitted a declaration accompanied by extensive documentation explaining all of the aspects of the case that the misconduct did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   affect. Rembrandt notes, moreover, that the improperly revived patents were not asserted against Adelphia, that the on-sale bar defense was only relevant\n   to two patents, and that the '627 patent was on a separate track and had no overlap with the issues involving the other patents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   The district court, by and large, did not even attempt to assess which issues the claimed misconduct affected. It specifically addressed the fees Appellees incurred relating to the '627 patent, which Appellees had listed separately in their proposed orders.\n   <em>\n    Second Fees Order\n   </em>\n   , at 2 n.1. But the district court did not establish a causal connection between the misconduct and those fees, and it did not offer any other reason for its fee award.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4074354\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/726/1359/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And, even though the district court explained why it awarded the attorney fees that Adelphia incurred defending against Rembrandt in bankruptcy court, it again failed to connect the misconduct with Adelphia's fees. Nowhere did the district court address the requisite \"causal connection\" it was required to find between the misconduct and the fees it awarded.\n   <em>\n    Goodyear\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12603202\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1178/\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 1187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   In the run-of-the-mill patent infringement case involving a few patents and a couple of defendants, a finding of pervasive misbehavior or inequitable conduct that affects all of the patents in suit may justify an award of all of the fees incurred. But this massive case featured nine patents and dozens of defendants, and the claimed misconduct affected only some patents asserted against some defendants. Even if Rembrandt's misconduct, taken as a whole, rendered the case exceptional, the district court was required to establish at least some \"causal connection\" between the misconduct and the fee award.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12603202\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1178/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   What the district court did here-award all fees with no explanation whatsoever of such a causal connection-was not enough.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   The most appropriate course, therefore, is to remand for the district court to determine in the first instance how much of the claimed fees Rembrandt should pay.
