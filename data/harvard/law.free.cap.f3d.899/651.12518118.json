We deny the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Degbe came to the United States from Ghana in June 2002 on a B1/B2 non-immigrant visa. It authorized him to stay until late July 2002. However, he did not return to Ghana. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) filed a Notice to Appear in 2007 charging Degbe with being removable pursuant to Immigration and Nationalization Act (INA) \u00a7 237(a)(1)(B). He did not appear, and in 2008, the immigration judge (IJ) entered a removal order\n   <em>\n    in absentia\n   </em>\n   . Degbe, nonetheless, remained in the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detained Degbe after he was in a car accident in North Dakota in May 2014. In July 2014, he filed an emergency motion to reopen and rescind the 2008 removal order with the immigration court on the basis that the order was entered without proper notice, depriving him of the chance to resist his removal on the merits. Following the IJ's grant of the motion, Degbe filed an application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Degbe's claim rested on his political activities while in Ghana. He supported the then-opposition party, the New Patriotic Party (NPP), in the 2000 elections. The NPP sought to take power from the ruling New Democratic Congress (NDC). Degbe alleged that he worked as a youth organizer for the NPP and canvassed for the NPP in a suburb of Accra, Ghana's capital. Degbe averred that he was attacked twice during the campaign. In one incident, a group of people threw stones at him. He was hit and suffered the loss of a tooth. Degbe claimed to have reported the stone-throwing incident to local police, who took no action, according to Degbe, as a result of pro-NDC sentiment in the police force. He also alleged that persons wearing NDC\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   shirts stabbed him with a knife, leaving painful keloid scars. Degbe represented that Ghanaian doctors told him to come to the United States to have the scars treated, though he did not actually receive treatment for the scars until 2007. Degbe contended he could not afford the treatment prior to 2007.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The NPP, Degbe's party, won the 2000 election. However, the NDC returned to power in 2008. It also won the subsequent 2012 election. Degbe claimed that he had heard reports of rampant political violence during the 2012 election season and began to fear that he would be killed or imprisoned if he returned to Ghana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The IJ heard the case in late 2015 and issued her decision in April 2016, concluding that Degbe's claims were either procedurally defaulted or meritless. The IJ held that Degbe was ineligible for asylum due to the untimeliness of his request. Under INA \u00a7 208(a)(2)(B), an asylum application is generally due within one year of arrival in the country. However, changed circumstances, such as an alteration in country conditions that creates eligibility for asylum where it was previously absent, can extend that deadline. INA \u00a7 208(a)(2)(D);\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201208.4\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(i). The IJ held that the NDC's return to power in 2008 was such a change of circumstances. However, the IJ also concluded the NDC's 2012 re-election was not. Accordingly, the 2014 application for asylum was untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The IJ also declined to withhold removal. She held that the knife attack sufficiently set forth past political persecution, creating a rebuttable presumption that Degbe had a well-founded fear of future persecution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201208.13\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1). However, she further held that the government had shown that the democratic process in Ghana had become smoother, less violent, and more stable since Degbe suffered the attack and left the country. Therefore, the government had demonstrated a fundamental change in circumstances that overcame the presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution, extinguishing Degbe's claim for withholding of removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The IJ's withholding-of-removal analysis guided her CAT inquiry. The IJ relied on her finding that Ghana was not now unsafe for those, including Degbe, who vocally disagreed with the ruling party. Accordingly, the IJ held that Degbe failed to \"show[ ] that he would more likely than not be tortured by the government or someone acting with the acquiescence of the government if he were returned to Ghana.\" Pet'r's Add. at 17. The IJ denied Degbe's application for CAT relief. Though she dismissed all of Degbe's substantive claims, the IJ granted his request for voluntary departure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Degbe appealed unsuccessfully to the BIA. In addition to the arguments made before the IJ, Degbe also included claims and supporting evidence regarding political violence in the summer of 2016 in the runup to that year's election. Degbe argued that the pre-election incidents constituted changed circumstances supporting a finding that his asylum application was timely. In addition, he asserted that these incidents qualified as extraordinary circumstances that demonstrated a well-founded fear of future persecution. He sought either a favorable ruling or a remand to the IJ for her to consider the new evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The BIA did not expressly address the 2016 election claims in its January 2017 order. However, it agreed with the IJ that the asylum application was untimely. The BIA's analysis of Degbe's withholding-of-removal and CAT-protection requests echoed the IJ's:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   We agree with the Immigration Judge that the evidence of record demonstrates\n   a change in country conditions such that the respondent no longer has a clear probability of persecution in Ghana. Past persecution gives rise to a rebuttable presumption that his life or freedom would be threatened in the future in the country of removal, on the basis of his original claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201208.16\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). To overcome this regulatory presumption, the Department of Homeland Security must demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence that either (1) the respondent could avoid future persecution by relocating to another part of the proposed country of removal, or (2) since the time the persecution occurred, conditions in the respondent's country have changed to an extent that the respondent's life or freedom would not be threatened if he were to return to his country.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201208.16\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1208.16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(l)(i)(A) and (B).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   The Immigration Judge determined that the evidence of record demonstrates a fundamental change in circumstances such that the respondent would not be threatened in Ghana. Accordingly, we find that the respondent has failed to satisfy the burden of proof required for withholding of removal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   section 241(b)(3) of the Act;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201231\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201208.16\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). The respondent also has alleged eligibility for protection under the Torture Convention. However, he relies upon the same evidence as that submitted for his withholding of removal claim. Accordingly, we further find that he has not demonstrated that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured for any reason if removed to Ghana.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201208.16\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Pet'r's Add. at 3.

Degbe contends that these rules extended the deadline for his asylum application because events preceding the\n   2016 elections constitute changed or extraordinary circumstances. Degbe asks for either a favorable ruling from this court or a remand to the agency for it to consider the 2016 election evidence. Degbe also states that the severity of his injuries while in Ghana justified a humanitarian reprieve from the one-year rule for an asylum application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Based on our review of the record, we conclude that we lack jurisdiction to determine the timeliness of Degbe's asylum application. Therefore, we deny the petition for review on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   An alien may receive asylum if he can show that he is a refugee and faces persecution in his home country due to, as relevant here, his political opinions.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201158\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
