Here, a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Assistant Chief Counsel representing the government intentionally forged and submitted an ostensible government document in an immigration proceeding, which had the effect of barring Ignacio Lanuza (Lanuza) from obtaining lawful permanent resident status, a form of relief to which he was otherwise lawfully entitled. We recognize that the Supreme Court \"has made clear that expanding the\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   remedy is now a 'disfavored' judicial activity,\"\n   <em>\n    Abbasi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604999\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1843/\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 1857\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

We therefore reverse the district court's holding that Lanuza was not entitled to a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   remedy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Lanuza is a 38-year-old lawful permanent resident married to a U.S. citizen with two U.S. citizen children. He was born in Mexico and first came to the United States without inspection when he was seventeen years old. He lives and works in Seattle, Washington. In July 2008, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) commenced removal proceedings against him before the Tacoma immigration court, which were ultimately transferred to the Seattle immigration court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On May 6, 2009, Lanuza appeared before an immigration judge for a master calendar hearing. During that hearing, Lanuza notified the court of his intention to apply for Cancellation of Removal and Adjustment of Status for Certain Nonpermanent Residents (cancellation of removal or cancellation) under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(1). At the time, he was prima facie eligible to apply for cancellation of removal, which is a type of immigration relief that enables nonpermanent residents to adjust their status to that of permanent residents. To qualify for cancellation, a person must demonstrate (1) continuous physical presence in the United States for ten years immediately prior to being served with the Notice to Appear; (2) good moral character; (3) that he is not subject to any other bar to eligibility on account of having certain criminal convictions; and (4) the existence of a U.S. citizen or lawful\n   permanent resident spouse, parent, or child who would suffer exceptional and extremely unusual hardship if the person were removed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(1). As later events would confirm, Lanuza satisfied all these requirements: (1) he had been residing continuously in the United States since 1996 and thus had more than ten years of continuous residence; (2) he possessed good moral character; (3) he was not subject to any other bar to eligibility; and (4) his U.S. citizen wife and children would suffer exceptional and extremely unusual hardship without him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   During the master calendar hearing, ICE Assistant Chief Counsel Jonathan Love (\"Love\") stated that Lanuza's immigration file contained an I-826 form, signed by Lanuza, accepting voluntary departure to Mexico in 2000. The I-826 form was critical in determining whether Lanuza would be able to remain in the United States with his family, because a signed I-826 form would render him ineligible for cancellation of removal. By signing an I-826 form, a person accepts an administrative voluntary departure instead of exercising his right to appear before an immigration judge in removal proceedings and thereby breaks whatever continuous physical presence he may have accrued.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ibarra-Flores v. Gonzales\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"31299\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/439/614/#p618\">\n    439 F.3d 614\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 618-20 (9th Cir. 2006) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Landin-Zavala v.

As a result, even though Lanuza met all the other elements of \u00a7 1229b(b)(1), if Lanuza had signed an I-826 form in 2000, he would have accrued continuous residence in the United States for only seven years, rather than the requisite ten years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On May 11, 2009 at Lanuza's actual immigration hearing, Love submitted an I-826 form agreeing to voluntary departure, purportedly signed by Lanuza on January 13, 2000, making Lanuza ineligible for cancellation of removal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . Based solely on that I-826 form, the immigration judge issued an order of removal on January 5, 2010; the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") affirmed on November 15, 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On December 9, 2011, Lanuza hired new counsel, Hilary Han (\"Han\"), who discovered, for the first time, evidence that the I-826 form Love submitted was forged. Han sent the I-826 form to a forensic examiner, who, on February 1, 2012, confirmed that the form was forged. While several aspects of the form demonstrated it was forged, most glaringly, it referred to the \"U.S. Department of Homeland Security\" at the top of the page, an agency that did not exist at the time Lanuza purportedly signed the form on January 13, 2000. Congress created DHS in response to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, and the agency did not begin formal operations until 2003. Therefore, it would have been impossible for Lanuza to sign the DHS I-826 form in January 2000, because that form did not then exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Based on the forensic report, the BIA reopened and remanded the case, and, on remand, the immigration judge ultimately found that Lanuza was prima facie eligible to apply for cancellation of removal. The agency adjusted his status to lawful permanent resident on January 9, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The government did not take any action against Love until after this lawsuit was filed on October 24, 2014. Love was ultimately prosecuted and pleaded guilty to deprivation of rights under color of law pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20242\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which ICE characterized as a \"deprivation of constitutional\n   rights\" in a press release.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Love was sentenced to a thirty-day term of imprisonment, one year of supervised release, and 100 hours of community service.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Love\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:16-cr-00005-BAT-1, ECF No. 16 (W.D. Wash. April 20, 2016). He was also barred from practicing law for ten years and was required to pay restitution to Lanuza in the amount of $12,000, a figure the government proposed based on its approximation of the legal fees Lanuza paid related to his removal proceedings as a result of Love's submission of the forged I-826 form.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 6-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On October 23, 2014, Lanuza filed a complaint against Love and the United States alleging, among other things, that he was entitled to damages under\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   for a violation of his Fifth Amendment right to due process. Love filed a motion to dismiss, which the district court hesitantly granted. While the district court believed Lanuza was entitled to relief, the court felt its hands were tied by our decision in\n   <em>\n    Mirmehdi v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3501927\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/689/975/\">\n    689 F.3d 975\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2012), which declined to extend\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   to a claim for wrongful detention in the course of immigration removal proceedings. The district court further held that, if a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   remedy were available, Love was not entitled to qualified immunity. Lanuza timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Whether a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   remedy is available here turns on the presence of the conditions articulated in\n   <em>\n    Abbasi\n   </em>\n   for extending the\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   remedy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Abbasi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604999\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1843/\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 1856-58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We decline to entertain such a broad reading of immigration law, as the illogical nature of such a reading is demonstrated by the absurdity of its results. If, for example, an immigration official physically forced himself on an asylum-seeker and offered to help her obtain relief if she kept quiet, we would have no trouble concluding that such criminal conduct bears no relationship to the legitimate execution of immigration policy. Likewise, we will not allow an officer of the immigration court to cloak himself in the government's protection when he commits the crimes of forgery and perjury.

As this is a straightforward case against a single low-level federal officer, we are not concerned that this litigation will burden the Executive Branch to an unacceptable degree.

In contrast, the facts of this case show that immigration cases often do not implicate high-level policy decisions related to national security.

Specifically, Mexico had requested the extradition of the law enforcement agent who shot Hernandez, and the United States had denied this request and refused to indict the agent.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . The Fifth Circuit reasoned that \"[i]t would undermine Mexico's respect for the validity of the Executive's prior determinations if, pursuant to a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   claim, a federal court entered a damages judgment against [the federal officer].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516361\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/811/#p820\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, in contrast, there is no evidence that any executive official has taken an interest in Lanuza's case, or that his situation has been the subject of diplomatic discussions between the United States and other sovereign nations.

But there are no such alternative remedial schemes available to Lanuza. The INA does not provide a remedy for actions by immigration officials that are designed to prevent individuals from accessing its lawful forms of relief. Lanuza was following the law, using the procedures Congress legislated, until his lawful pursuit of legal permanent resident status was criminally obstructed. Love's submission of the forged I-826 form completely barred Lanuza from using the INA's remedial scheme. The Act provides no remedial scheme for forgery if undiscovered. And to be sure, there are other individuals like Lanuza who may also be entitled to relief and who may not have obtained it for this very reason. While Lanuza was ultimately able to reopen his case, if Lanuza had not, by stroke of luck, found an exceptionally thorough immigration attorney, the forgery might never have been discovered and Lanuza would be deported and separated from his U.S. citizen wife and children. The system does not account for actions designed to circumvent it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The government also argues that the $12,000 Love paid Lanuza in restitution pursuant to his criminal guilty plea is an alternative form of judicial relief. However, criminal prosecutions vindicate the government's interests, not the interests of the victim. The victim does not choose whether to prosecute the case. As such, the criminal law is not an alternative remedial structure designed by Congress for individuals like Lanuza. When Lanuza discovered Love's transgression, he had no right to force the government to prosecute; indeed the government declined to do so until Lanuza brought his\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   action-after Lanuza's immigration proceeding and long after the forgery was discovered. What is more, it is the judge, not the victim, who decides if and how much restitution is appropriate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   With all of these factors in mind, we must now ask \"whether the Judiciary is well suited, absent congressional action or instruction, to consider and weigh the costs and benefits of allowing a damages action to proceed.\"\n   <em>\n    Abbasi\n   </em>\n   , 137 S.Ct. at 1858. We recognize that \"it is a significant step under separation-of-powers principles for a court to determine that it has the authority, under the judicial power, to create and enforce a cause of action for damages against federal officials in order to remedy a constitutional violation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1856. We do not take that step lightly. However, we conclude that doing so here is not an improper intrusion into the decisions of other governmental branches where the factors discussed above all suggest that providing a damages remedy is consistent with congressional and executive policy. Although Congress is often better suited to finding a balance between deterrence of constitutional violations and the costs of allowing a lawsuit to proceed, we do not believe that finding \"[t]he proper balance\" in this case \"is one for the Congress, not the Judiciary, to undertake.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1863.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Judges are particularly well-equipped to weigh the costs of constitutional violations that threaten the credibility of our judicial system. Indeed, there are\n   few persons better equipped to weigh the cost of compromised adjudicative proceedings than those who are entrusted with protecting their integrity. And, more often than not, the Judicial Branch, not Congress or the Executive, is responsible for remedying circumstances where a court's integrity is compromised by the submission of false evidence. Thus, it falls within the natural ambit of the judiciary's authority to decide whether to provide a remedy for the submission of false evidence in an immigration proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The consequences of allowing the submission of false evidence by government attorneys without repercussion extends beyond its effect on Lanuza. The magnitude of its societal injury was addressed in the government's press release about Love's conviction: \"[D]efendants in immigration court have a 'right to proceedings free from false and fabricated evidence knowingly presented against them. When that right is denied, a real harm is inflicted both on society, which loses faith that its government plays fair, and the individual who suffers directly.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Accordingly, there are compelling interests that favor extending a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   remedy here, and, on balance, those interests outweigh the costs of allowing this narrow claim to proceed against federal officials.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Abbasi\n   </em>\n   , 137 S.Ct. at 1863.

Indeed, the administration of Lanuza's case is particularly straightforward because it is undisputed that Love intentionally submitted forged documents, and therefore the only question remaining for the district court is determining the amount of damages to which Lanuza is entitled, an area where our courts have substantial experience.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Finally, we do not foresee a \"deluge\" of potential claimants seeking to avail themselves of this particular\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1532130\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/442/228/\">\n    442 U.S. at 248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1532130\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/442/228/\">\n    99 S.Ct. 2264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting argument that implying\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   action would cause a deluge of claims). Recognizing a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   action here will produce widespread litigation only if ICE attorneys routinely submit false evidence, which no party argues is the case. And if this problem is indeed widespread, it demonstrates a dire need for deterrence, validating\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   's purpose. Moreover, a plaintiff seeking a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   remedy under this theory must allege sufficient facts to show that a federal official willfully submitted falsified evidence and the submission of this evidence resulted in a complete bar to relief to which the individual was otherwise entitled under congressionally enacted laws.
