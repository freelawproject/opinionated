Besides the \"[t]wo features of the residual clause [that] conspire to make it unconstitutionally vague,\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   discussed several other parts of the ACCA's text and its history in the courts as additional support for declaring that provision unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The State begins by pointing to the residual clause's lack of any limiting temporal language. Without such a limitation, the ACCA required courts to evaluate the risk of injury throughout the commission of an offense, even if the injury is \"remote from the criminal act\"-such as the risk posed by a burglar confronting a resident after breaking into his or her home.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    at 2557-59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . By contrast, the State contends, California's inherently-dangerous-felony inquiry looks only to the dangers that might occur in the course of satisfying the elements of an offense. But the State seems to be mistaken. Where relevant, the California Supreme Court has assessed the risks that may arise throughout the commission of a crime, even after its elements are formally satisfied.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Patterson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=262%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20195\">\n    262 Cal.Rptr. 195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=778%20P.2d%20549\">\n    778 P.2d at 551-53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that a conviction for furnishing cocaine could be deemed \"inherently dangerous\" based on a recipient later overdosing on the drug).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The State also argues that\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   is cabined to the ACCA based on the list of four crimes that precede the residual clause. After faulting the residual clause for \"apply[ing] an imprecise 'serious potential risk' standard ... to a judge-imagined abstraction,\" the Court went on to add:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   By asking whether the crime \"\n   <em>\n    otherwise\n   </em>\n   involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk,\" moreover, the residual clause forces courts to interpret \"serious potential risk\" in light of the four enumerated crimes-burglary, arson, extortion, and crimes involving the use of explosives. These offenses are \"far from clear in respect to the degree of risk each poses.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). The State contends that the presence of these enumerated offenses was essential to\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   's holding, while California's second-degree felony-murder rule involves\n   no such list. But\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   recently rejected this cramped reading of\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , explaining:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   To say that ACCA's listed crimes failed to resolve the residual clause's vagueness is hardly to say they caused the problem. Had they done so,\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   would not have needed to strike down the clause. It could simply have instructed courts to give up on trying to interpret the clause by reference to the enumerated offenses. .... That\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   went so much further-invalidating a statutory provision rather than construing it independently of another-demonstrates that the list of crimes was not the culprit. And indeed,\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   explicitly said as much. As described earlier,\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   found the residual clause's vagueness to reside in just \"two\" of its features: the ordinary-case requirement and a fuzzy risk standard. Strip away the enumerated crimes-as Congress did in [the Immigration and Nationality Act] \u00a7 16(b)-and those dual flaws yet remain. And ditto the textual indeterminacy that flows from them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610616\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1204/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 1221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Finally, the State contends that the history of courts struggling with the residual clause was essential to\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   's holding, and that California's second-degree felony-murder rule has no such history. After describing the residual clause's \"[t]wo features\" that rendered it unconstitutional, the\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   Court noted that \"the failure of persistent efforts to establish a standard can provide\n   <em>\n    evidence\n   </em>\n   of vagueness.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation and alteration omitted) (emphasis added). The Court then wrote that the \"repeated attempts and repeated failures to craft a principled and objective standard out of the residual clause\n   <em>\n    confirm\n   </em>\n   its hopeless indeterminacy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). As these quotations make clear,\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   did not expressly limit its holding based on the residual clause's record in the courts, but said that this evidence confirmed its earlier holding that the residual clause is unconstitutional.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And the provision at issue in\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   lacked this troubled history, yet the Court reaffirmed that judicial experience struggling with a statute is not necessary for it to be declared impermissibly vague.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610616\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1204/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 1223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   We conclude that there is a plausible position that\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   did not limit its constitutional rule to certain features of the ACCA's residual clause that the State contends are absent from California's second-degree felony-murder rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    IV\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   AEDPA's standard of review for a \u00a7 2254 habeas corpus petition is far more demanding than \u00a7 2244(b) 's requirements for authorization to file a second or successive \u00a7 2254 petition, and although Henry's habeas corpus claim may ultimately fail for any number of reasons, those issues are not presently before us.
