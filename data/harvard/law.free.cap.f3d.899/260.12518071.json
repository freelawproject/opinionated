The challenges were\n   brought by Defenders of Wildlife, the Sierra Club, and the Virginia Wilderness Committee (collectively, \"Petitioners\"). For the reasons that follow, we conclude that both agency decisions are arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The first petition, No. 18-1083, concerns the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS). Pursuant to the Endangered Species Act, FWS issued an Incidental Take Statement (ITS) authorizing the pipeline to \"take\"-i.e., kill, harm, or harass-five species that are listed as threatened or endangered. Petitioners challenged the ITS as arbitrary and capricious under \u00a7 706 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) because the amount of take authorized in the ITS (known as the \"take limit\") cannot be enforced. Petitioners identify two flaws that make the take limits unenforceable: first, FWS failed to set numeric limits on take of the five threatened and endangered species, and second, FWS failed to comply with the requirements for using habitat as a surrogate for a numeric limit. Although FWS is not required to set a numeric limit, it can only use a habitat surrogate if it demonstrates a causal link between the species and the delineated habitat, shows that setting a numerical limit is not practical, and sets a clear standard for determining when incidental take is exceeded. Here, FWS failed some or all of these requirements for all five challenged species. As such, FWS's take limits are not enforceable and therefore arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The second petition, No. 18-1082, concerns the U.S. National Park Service (NPS). The pipeline's proposed route intersects the Blue Ridge Parkway, a unit of the National Park System managed by NPS. Invoking the Blue Ridge Parkway Organic Act, NPS issued a right-of-way permit allowing the pipeline to drill and pass underneath the Parkway surface. The pipeline will also carve a path through a nearby forest, affecting views from the Parkway's scenic overlooks. Petitioners Sierra Club and the Virginia Wilderness Committee argue that NPS lacked the authority to grant a right-of-way to a gas pipeline and that doing so violated the statutory mandate that agency decisions not be inconsistent with the Parkway's conservation purpose. As detailed below, we assume for purposes of this case that NPS has the requisite statutory authority but because NPS does not explain how the pipeline crossing is not inconsistent with the purposes of the Parkway and the overall National Park System, the permit decision is arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Part I of this opinion will provide a brief background and address a statute of limitations question common to both cases. Part II will provide the relevant background facts and legal analysis for No. 18-1083 (FWS), while Part III will provide the relevant background facts and legal analysis for No. 18-1082 (NPS). Finally, having concluded that the respective agencies erred, Part IV will address a question of remedy common to both cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The ACP is a 600-mile pipeline designed to transport natural gas from Harrison County, West Virginia, to the eastern portions of Virginia and North Carolina. J.A. 234. Constructing the pipeline would generally require a 125-foot right-of-way for most of the distance, which will disturb 11,776 acres of land. J.A. 553. Once completed, ACP would generally maintain a 50-foot permanent right-of-way along the length of the pipeline. J.A. 325.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Under the Natural Gas Act, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is the agency responsible for giving final\n   approval, in the form of a certificate of public convenience and necessity, for the construction of natural gas pipelines. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717f. The Natural Gas Act also requires applicants such as ACP to obtain \"any permits, special use authorizations, certifications, opinions, or other approvals as may be required under Federal law.\"\n   <em>\n    N.Y.

FERC serves as the \"lead agency\" responsible for \"coordinating all applicable Federal authorizations.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717n.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On October 13, 2017, FERC issued ACP a certificate of public convenience and necessity that authorized the construction and operation of the pipeline. J.A. 234-389. As it has done in other cases, FERC conditioned its approval of the pipeline on ACP receiving all \"state and other federal authorizations required for the proposed project.\"\n   <em>\n    Del.

Two of these authorizations must come from FWS and NPS. On October 16, 2017, FWS issued a biological opinion and incidental take statement that authorized the pipeline to take several endangered and threatened species. On December 12, 2017, NPS issued a right-of-way permit authorizing the pipeline to cross the Blue Ridge Parkway. Petitioners challenged both agency actions in this Court on January 19, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The first question we must resolve is whether the Petitioners filed their challenges within the applicable statute of limitations. Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 15(a) provides that \"[r]eview of an agency order is commenced by filing,\n   <em>\n    within the time prescribed by law\n   </em>\n   , a petition for review[.]\" Fed. R. App. P. 15(a)(1) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Petitioners filed their challenges within 95 days (No. 18-1083) and 38 days (No. 18-1082) of the agency decisions, respectively. In their opening brief, Petitioners invoked the six-year statute of limitation created for claims \"against the United States,\" which applies generally to challenges brought under the APA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202401\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ;\n   <em>\n    Jersey Heights Neighborhood Ass'n v.

Thus, ACP urges us to adopt the most closely analogous\n   <em>\n    state law\n   </em>\n   statute of limitations. ACP Resp. Br. 18-27 (citing\n   <em>\n    Reed v. United Transp.

ACP proposes the 30-day limitations period applicable to petitions for review of state agency actions in West Virginia, Virginia, and North Carolina (the states through which the pipeline will be built). Such a short statute of limitations period, ACP argues, would comply with Congress's intent to create an expedited review process for agency decisions related to natural gas pipelines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The problem with ACP's argument is that the cases on which it relies predate Congress's establishment of a four-year default statute of limitations for any \"civil action arising under an Act of Congress enacted after\" December 1, 1990.

If \u00a7 717r(d) is the source of Petitioners' cause of action, then \u00a7 1658(a) applies and the statute of limitations is four years.

By either measure, the petitions are timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We turn first to petition No. 18-1083, in which Petitioners challenge the take limits set by FWS for five species that will be negatively impacted by the pipeline. We begin with the Endangered Species Act and the exception created for \"incidental\" take of threatened and endangered species. We next discuss how the Endangered Species Act obligated FWS to analyze how the pipeline would affect threatened and endangered species. We then summarize the statutory and regulatory requirements FWS must satisfy to issue a proper incidental take statement. Finally, we review in detail the agency's determinations about the five species at issue. We conclude that for each species, FWS failed to satisfy the requirements for a habitat surrogate and therefore failed to create enforceable take limits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Congress enacted the Endangered Species Act in 1973 \"to protect and conserve endangered and threatened species and their habitats.\"\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Ass'n of Home Builders v.

The agency incorrectly characterizes the law for at least two reasons. First, the statute does not require that the consultation be completed within 90 days. Rather, it states that the agency and FWS may extend the 90-day consultation period to and until 150 days without the consent of the applicant and even longer with the consent of the applicant. \u00a7 1536(b)(1)(A)-(B). Accordingly, Congress expressly contemplated that FWS might need more than 90 days to conduct a review and provided a mechanism for it to do so. Second, contrary to the agency characterization, FWS is not required to rely on \" 'best scientific and commercial data'\n   <em>\n    then\n   </em>\n   available.\" Gov't Br. 21 (emphasis added). Rather, the statute requires that \"each agency shall use the best scientific and commercial data available,\" \u00a7 1536(a)(2), regardless of whether the data is available at the time of the application. Accordingly, the statute does not foreclose FWS or an applicant from developing additional data.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3762861\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/476/1031/#p1036\">\n    476 F.3d at 1038\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting FWS determination that establishing numerical take limit was impractical due to lack of up-to-date surveys because agency never stated \"that it is not possible to update the survey in order to estimate the number of takings, only that it has not actually done the surveys\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Tellingly, neither the statute, nor the agency's implementing regulation, nor the agency's\n   <em>\n    Endangered Species Consultation Handbook\n   </em>\n   , identify lack of time as a proper basis for concluding that setting a numerical limit is impractical.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   H.R.

Within a section titled \"Amount or Extent of Take Anticipated,\" FWS prepared a table for each species and stated that the reader should look to that table to locate the anticipated take limit. J.A. 440-43 (stating, for example, that the \"anticipated take is described in Table 6 below\" for the Clubshell). We review the plain language of the take limits as set forth by FWS in each table.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State Farm\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/#p50\">\n    463 U.S. at 50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/#p50\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2856\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We also note that the inability of FWS and ACP to agree on exactly what level of incidental take is allowed only reinforces our conclusion that the ITS set vague and unenforceable limits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   1. Roanoke Logperch (\n   <em>\n    Percina rex\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Before turning to the five challenged species, we take a moment to discuss briefly the sixth: the Roanoke Logperch, an endangered freshwater fish. Petitioners do not challenge the logperch take limit, but FWS's approach to the logperch is a useful comparator when evaluating its much different approach to the other five species.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The pipeline will cross four waterbodies known or with potential to support the logperch. J.A. 407. Neither ACP nor FWS conducted presence/absence surveys; instead, they assumed the presence of the logperch because the pipeline will affect potential habitat in areas known to support the logperch. J.A. 405. ACP threatens the logperch both indirectly due to increased sedimentation and directly where it crosses waterbodies with logperch present. J.A. 407, 418.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   FWS estimated that a total of 150 logperch are expected to occur in the area affected by the pipeline. J.A. 406. It reached this number by using recent survey information for two of the four affected waterbodies. In the first waterbody, a 2017 survey observed 12 logperch. FWS multiplied that number by ten because \"mark-recapture data indicates that only about 10% of [logperch] are actually detected during surveys.\" This resulted in an estimated 120 total logperch. In the second waterbody, a 2012 survey observed one logperch. Adjusting by the same multiple of ten, FWS estimated there were ten total logperch there. The third and fourth waterbodies lacked recent survey information, but FWS believed the fish to be present at a density comparable to the second waterbody (i.e., 10). And 120 plus ten plus ten plus ten equals 150.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   FWS set a take limit of 5 individual Roanoke Logperch through injury or death and 145 individuals through harm or harassment. J.A. 440. To arrive at this take limit, FWS divided the area of logperch habitat needed to actually build the crossing structures by the total area of logperch habitat at each pipeline crossing and determined that the crossings themselves will comprise 3.3 percent of the total affected habitat. Because FWS estimates\n   that there are 150 logperch total in the area, this means 3.3 percent (or 5 logperch) will be directly killed by the crossings, while the other 145 will be harmed or harassed by increased sedimentation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/#p50\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We note that FWS set a numeric take limit for the Roanoke Logperch despite using surveys from several years ago that observed only a few fish and despite the detection difficulties caused by the logperch's small size (five inches) and river habitat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   2. Clubshell (\n   <em>\n    Pleurobema clava\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The Clubshell is an endangered mussel that grows to be about three inches long. J.A. 692. In the Monongahela River system of West Virginia, which contains only one Clubshell population in Hackers Creek, the Clubshell is in severe decline and is not reproducing. J.A. 401, 432. A 2009 survey at a long-term monitoring site in Hackers Creek found 29 individuals; a 2014 survey found 19 individuals. J.A. 407. ACP will conduct construction in the upstream drainage area of Hackers Creek and will cross six of its tributaries. J.A. 407. The resulting sediment load will adversely impact the Clubshell population at Hackers Creek. J.A. 432.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   FWS set the take limit as: killing a \"[s]mall percent of individuals present within 585 m,\" and harming or harassing the \"[m]ajority of individuals present within 585 m.\" J.A. 440-41. The agency explained that it \"anticipates incidental take of clubshell will be difficult to detect for the following reason: up to 70% of a population can be distributed below the substrate surface.\" J.A. 440. Therefore, FWS concluded that the \"level of take of this species can be anticipated by loss of habitat from 130 m downstream to 455 m upstream of Life's Run Bridge (County Route 14) (total of 585 m) because this area contains suitable clubshell habitat.\" J.A. 440. As part of the terms and conditions, FERC must collect all Clubshell in the 585-meter stretch of Hackers Creek. J.A. 444-45. The Clubshell will then be held at an approved facility for reintroduction after the pipeline is completed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/#p50\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The incidental take authorized here is not a proper habitat surrogate because it lacks the three necessary elements. First, there is no clear and enforceable standard of take. Instead, take is limited to a \"small percent\" and a \"majority\" of Clubshell within a fixed geographic area. Although the geographic bounds are fixed, FWS authorized the pipeline to take\n   <em>\n    only a subset of individuals located within those bounds\n   </em>\n   . But it is impossible to know the size of the subset-i.e., how many individuals constitute a \"small percent\" or a \"majority.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Second, FWS offered no explanation for why the habitat surrogate is limited to 130 meters downstream and 455 meters upstream of Life's Run Bridge. Although the Biological Opinion mentioned that the Hackers Creek Clubshell population is located at Life's Run Bridge, the geographic bounds of 130 meters downstream and 455 meters upstream are not explained anywhere else in the ITS or Biological Opinion. The arbitrariness of this range is particularly conspicuous considering that the pipeline will introduce sediment upstream of Life's Run Bridge, meaning that the sediment will flow through all of Hackers Creek, not just 585 meters of it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Finally, FWS did not adequately explain why a numeric limit is not practical. The only proffered explanation is that Clubshell are difficult to detect because most of them live below the substrate surface. But FWS has been able to adequately survey Clubshell in the past; indeed, it knew there were 29 Clubshell in 2009 and 19 in 2014.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Fla.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3647809\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/566/1257/#p1275\">\n    566 F.3d at 1275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding\n   unpersuasive FWS's argument that a species was difficult to detect when the record showed the species being counted regularly). Moreover, the ITS terms and conditions require FERC to\n   <em>\n    remove and store\n   </em>\n   the Hackers Creek Clubshell during the pendency of construction, evincing a clear expectation that FERC can locate them. And in a prior ITS, FWS was able to set numeric take limits for the Clubshell.\n   <em>\n    Biological Opinion on the Washington Crossing Bridge Project\n   </em>\n   22 (Sept. 2, 2014) (setting a total incidental take of 18 Clubshell).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In sum, the take limit for the Clubshell fails all three habitat surrogate requirements: it lacks a causal link between the specific 585-meter stretch of Hackers Creek and the local Clubshell population, it lacks an explanation as to why a numerical limit is impractical, and it lacks a clear enforcement standard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20402.14\">\n    50 C.F.R. \u00a7 402.14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i)(1)(i).

Rusty Patched Bumble Bee (\n   <em>\n    Bombus affinis\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The Rusty Patched Bumble Bee (RPBB) was listed as endangered in January 2017. J.A. 401, 809-11. A 2017 survey found one bee in Bath County, Virginia, about a mile from the pipeline route. J.A. 408. FWS concluded that the magnitude of the Rusty Patched Bumble Bee's population losses \"has greatly reduced the likelihood that the species is present elsewhere\" along the pipeline route. J.A. 408. As a result, \"comprehensive RPBB surveys were not conducted throughout the action area\" in Virginia. J.A. 408.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Based on this single bee, FWS estimated that the Rusty Patched Bumble Bee is most likely to occur in a 653-hectare \"high potential zone\" near the pipeline. J.A. 408-10. The pipeline will directly affect approximately 7.3 hectares of this zone, which could \"crush individuals, crush a colony, expose RPBBs to noise/vibration, and render habitat temporarily and permanently unsuitable.\" J.A. 421. After making a number of assumptions about bee and bee colony density, FWS estimated that one colony-i.e., a cohesive biological unit of bees established every spring by a solitary queen and made up of her offspring, J.A. 807-is statistically likely to be present in the 7.3 hectares directly affected by the pipeline. J.A. 433.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   FWS set the take limit as: killing \"1 colony present within 7.3 [hectares]\" and harming or harassing a \"[s]mall percent of [queen bees] from 1 colony present within 7.3 [hectares].\" J.A. 441. FWS explained that it \"anticipates incidental take of RPBB will be difficult to detect for the following reasons: species has small body size, losses may be masked by seasonal fluctuations in numbers and other environmental factors, and species occurs in habitat\n   (i.e., underground) that makes detection difficult.\" J.A. 441.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The incidental take authorized here is not a proper habitat surrogate because it lacks two of the three necessary elements. FWS has demonstrated a causal link between the bee and the geographic boundaries of the take limit: the pipeline will affect 7.3 hectares of high potential habitat for the Rusty Patched Bumble Bee, which\n   <em>\n    statistically\n   </em>\n   will affect only one Rusty Patched Bumble Bee colony. But FWS's incidental take limit is not a clear standard because it is not actually defined by the 7.3 hectares; instead, take is limited to exactly\n   <em>\n    one colony and a small percent of queen bees within the 7.3 hectares\n   </em>\n   . Neither one colony nor a small percent is an enforceable standard: There may be multiple colonies within the 7.3 hectares, FERC cannot know if taken bees are from the same colony or different colonies, and it is not clear what constitutes a \"small percent\" of queen bees.

Madison Cave Isopod (\n   <em>\n    Antrolana lira\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The Madison Cave Isopod (MCI) is a threatened subterranean freshwater crustacean about a half-inch in size. \"The species is endemic to underground karst aquifer habitats and is restricted to the Shenandoah Valley, from Lexington, Virginia to Harpers Ferry, West Virginia.\" J.A. 608. The pipeline right of way, additional temporary work space, and access roads will affect \"approximately 1,974 surface acres (approximately 0.74%)\" of the isopod's potential habitat in Augusta County, Virginia. J.A. 411. Included in this area are Cochran's Cave and five sinkholes, which FWS assumed are connected and which provide a conduit for sediment and contaminants to the isopod's habitat. J.A. 411-12. Because FWS lacked the ability to survey the presence or abundance of the isopods, it assumed that they will be found in the pipeline project area. J.A. 411.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The pipeline will threaten the isopods by crushing them or introducing sediment that smothers them or their habitat. J.A. 422. Although there are no \"localities\" in the pipeline construction area where Madison Cave Isopods have been sampled, FWS arbitrarily decided that Cochran's Cave would serve as an undocumented isopod \"locality\" and then chose to use \"localities as a surrogate for a population.\" J.A. 434. It concluded that a total of 896.7 surface acres of isopod potential habitat is within 0.5 miles of the construction activities\n   that bisect Cochran's Cave. J.A. 434. Within the 896.7 acres, the pipeline will directly displace 11.2 surface acres. J.A. 434. Within the rest of the 896.7 acres, ground-disturbing activities could smother or crush the isopods. J.A. 422.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   FWS set the take limit as: killing a \"[s]mall percent of individuals present within 11.2 acres\" and harming or harassing \"[a]ll individuals present within 896.7 acres.\" J.A. 441-42. The agency explained that \"incidental take of the MCI will be difficult to detect for the following reasons: small body size, finding a dead or impaired specimen is unlikely, and species occurs in habitat (underground) that makes detection difficult.\" J.A. 441.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   FWS has shown that a numeric limit is not practical here: the isopod is a half-inch crustacean that lives in underground aquifers. But the take limit fails as a habitat surrogate because it lacks the other two elements. First, FWS stated that the pipeline will affect 1,974 surface acres of MCI potential habitat, all of which it assumes contains isopods. But without providing a reasoned explanation, FWS arbitrarily limited the habitat surrogate to the 896.7 acres near Cochran's Cave. Second, the proffered take limits are not real surrogates: the authorized take limit is (in part)\n   <em>\n    a \"small percent\" of isopods within the 11.2 acres that will be directly affected by the pipeline\n   </em>\n   . But there is no precise way of measuring what a \"small percent\" of isopods would be, and thus no clear standard for enforcement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In sum, the take limit for the Madison Cave Isopod fails to satisfy two of the habitat surrogate requirements: its causal link between the isopod and the geographic bounds of the take limit is arbitrary, and it lacks a clear enforcement standard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20402.14\">\n    50 C.F.R. \u00a7 402.14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i)(1)(i).

Indiana Bat (\n   <em>\n    Myolis sodalis\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The Indiana Bat (Ibat) is an endangered migratory bat. FWS estimated that, as of 2017, there are only 425 in Virginia and 1,076 in West Virginia. J.A. 412. The pipeline crosses the Indiana Bat Appalachian Mountain Recovery Unit, an area of protected Indiana Bat habitat that covers all of West Virginia and part of western Virginia.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   J.A. 412, 725. The pipeline will adversely affect Indiana Bats by temporarily or permanently removing 4,448 acres of suitable habitat in the Recovery Unit. J.A. 423-24. Based on survey data and seasonal movements, FWS defined four relevant categories of Indiana Bat habitat in the Recovery Unit: (1) suitable unoccupied summer habitat, i.e., habitat that is unoccupied during the summer; (2) known use summer habitat, i.e., habitat that is known to be used by the bats in the summer; (3) unknown use spring staging/fall swarming habitat, i.e., habitat near unsurveyed but potentially suitable winter hibernation quarters (known as \"hibernacula\"); and (4) known use spring staging/fall swarming habitat, i.e., habitat near known hibernacula. J.A. 412. The pipeline will affect these different habitats in the Recovery Unit as follows:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-84\"><strong>Habitat Category</strong> <strong>Total (acres)</strong> Suitable unoccupied summer habitat 3,275.382 Known use summer habitat 144.1 Unknown use spring staging/fall swarming habitat 178.1 Known use spring staging/fall swarming habitat 850.4 <strong>Total Acres of Recovery Unit</strong> <strong>4,447.982</strong></pre>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   J.A. 413.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   FWS set the take limit as:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-87\"><strong>Amount of Take Anticipated</strong> <strong>Type of Take</strong> Small percent of individuals present within Harm, Harass, 1,637.69 acres of suitable unoccupied summer Injure, or Kill habitat Small percent of individuals within 144.1 acres Harass of known use summer habitat Small percent of individuals present within 89.05 Harm, Harass, acres of unknown use spring staging/fall or Kill swarming habitat Small percent of individuals present within 850.4 Harm, Harass, acres known use spring staging/fall swarming or Kill habitat</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   J.A. 442. The agency explained that it \"anticipates incidental take of the Ibat will be difficult to detect for the following reasons: species has small body size, finding a dead or impaired specimen is unlikely, and species occurs in habitat (forest and caves) that makes detection difficult.\" J.A. 442. FWS concluded that the \"take of this species can be anticipated by loss of 4,447.982 acres because this area contains suitable Ibat habitat.\" J.A. 442. But FWS imposed a 0.5 multiplier on the affected acreage for two of the four habitat categories-suitable unoccupied summer habitat and unknown use spring staging/fall swarming habitat-purportedly \"[t]o account for differences in Ibat use of the habitat categories.\" J.A. 442.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The incidental take authorized here is not a proper habitat surrogate because it lacks the three necessary elements. First and most significantly, it is not a true habitat surrogate: take is limited to a \"small percent\" of Indiana Bats within each geographic area. Although the geographic bounds are fixed, the pipeline can\n   <em>\n    only take a subset of individuals located within those bounds\n   </em>\n   . But it is impossible to know what a \"small percent\" of bats is. Therefore, there is no clear and enforceable standard of take.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Second, two of the chosen geographic bounds are arbitrary. FWS knew that the pipeline will directly affect 3,275.382 acres of suitable unoccupied summer habitat and 178.1 acres of unknown use spring staging/fall swarming habitat. Yet, without any explanation, the agency set the take limit for these two habitats at half of these acreages. In other words, FWS set the take limit at half the affected bat habitat that it knows the pipeline is going to affect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Even if FWS removed the words \"small percent of individuals\" from the take limit, the limit would still fail as a habitat surrogate because FWS knows that the pipeline will exceed the geographic bounds. Oddly, despite the ITS clearly showing the use of the 0.5 multiplier on two of the four habitats, both FWS and ACP claim that the habitat surrogate is actually the full 4,448 acres directly impacted by the pipeline. ACP Resp. Br. 40; Gov't Resp. Br. 27-28 &amp; n.5. ACP actually seems unaware that FWS arbitrarily reduced the habitat surrogate to below the 4,448 affected acres.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   ACP Resp. Br. 40 (stating that the habitat surrogate is 4,448 acres),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   ACP Resp. Br. 46 (stating that the habitat surrogate applies to \"individuals present within 1,637.69 acres of suitable unoccupied habitat, 144.1 acres of known use summer habitat, 89.05 acres of unknown use spring staging/fall swarming habitat and 850.4 acres of known use spring staging/fall swarming habitat\"-even though these four numbers add up only to 2721.24 acres).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Finally, FWS has not shown that a numeric limit is impractical. The bats may be small, but FWS has been able to survey them in the past. Indeed, FWS made precise estimates as recently as 2017, determining that there are 425 bats in Virginia and 1,076 in West Virginia.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Fla.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3647809\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/566/1257/#p1275\">\n    566 F.3d at 1275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

NPS challenges Petitioners' standing to bring this petition, while both NPS and ACP contest the merits. We begin by briefly reciting the facts relevant to this petition before turning first to standing and next the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The Blue Ridge Parkway is a component of the National Park System, linking the Shenandoah National Park in Virginia to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in North Carolina. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 460a-2. Like the rest of the National Park System, the Parkway is managed by NPS. According to NPS's Management Plan, the Blue Ridge Parkway serves not only as a connector between destinations but also as a recreational and scenic site in itself. J.A. 623-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The ACP's proposed pathway intersects with the Blue Ridge Parkway. Accordingly, FERC's final approval of the pipeline hinges on NPS granting a right-of-way to cross the Parkway. As proposed, the pipeline would drill and pass underneath the Parkway without breaching the Parkway's surface. However, the proposed route would require removing all of the trees from a portion of a nearby forest, leaving a vertical clearing that would be visible from the Parkway. J.A. 1018. During initial construction of the pipeline, that clearing would be 125 feet wide. Once construction is complete, the clearing would be reduced to a permanent 50-foot wide corridor, reserved for pipeline maintenance purposes. J.A. 325, 1035.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   A visual impact study conducted by ACP and overseen by NPS concluded that the corridor would be visible from at least one key observation point along the Parkway, thus significantly decreasing the park's scenic value. J.A. 1020. Specifically, the analysis concluded that \"[v]iews of the ACP corridor from the Three Ridges overlook ... would likely be inconsistent with NPS management objectives, given the proximity to the viewer, the axial nature of the view, and the corridor's contrast with the surrounding forest.\" J.A. 1020.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   On December 12, 2017, NPS issued a revocable permit granting right-of-way to ACP, subject to a list of terms and conditions. The permit cites only 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 460a-8 for its statutory authority. J.A. 897. The permit decision does not reference any harm to the Parkway's scenic or conservation value or the effectiveness of any mitigation strategies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Petitioners now seek review of the right-of-way permit, arguing that NPS failed to comply with the Mineral Leasing Act and the Blue Ridge Parkway Organic Act.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20185\">\n    30 U.S.C. \u00a7 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 460a-3, 460a-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   We first address standing.

Specifically, NPS emphasizes that the pipeline proceeds underneath the Parkway and does not disturb the Parkway's surface as it crosses. And, although the pipeline's construction and maintenance corridor will scar a nearby forest visible from the Parkway, NPS disclaims all responsibility because that corridor resides on federal lands not managed by NPS and does not require NPS authorization.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The problem with this argument is that the causation element of standing does not require the challenged action to be the sole or even immediate cause of the injury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bennett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651295\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/154/#p170\">\n    520 U.S. at 168-69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651295\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/154/#p170\">\n    117 S.Ct. 1154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"This wrongly equates injury 'fairly traceable' to the defendant with injury as to which the defendant's actions are the very last step in the chain of causation.\");\n   <em>\n    Libertarian Party of Va.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4049554\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/718/308/#p316\">\n    718 F.3d at 315-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

However, this argument is mere speculation. NPS has not provided any support for its claim that the pipeline would materially affect views from the Parkway even if ACP were denied a right-of-way. The crossing of the Parkway necessitated the maintenance corridor that harms views from the Parkway, and we simply see no reason why the pipeline would clear and maintain a permanent corridor near the Parkway if no crossing is (or can be) permitted by NPS.

First, Petitioners argue that NPS lacks general statutory authority to grant rights-of-way for oil and gas pipelines. Second, assuming such general authority exists, they argue that issuing the permit in this case violates the authorizing statute because it is not consistent with parkway purposes. Answering these questions requires us to interpret three statutory provisions-the two general right-of-way provisions under the Blue Ridge Parkway Organic Act and the definitional provision of the Mineral Leasing Act, which purportedly constrains agency authority under the Organic Act. We first consider what deference we owe to the agency's interpretation of these statutes and then address the parties' arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The parties seem to assume, without any analysis, that NPS's interpretation of the relevant statutes is eligible for\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v.

The question\n   here is whether the MLA's omission of national parks precludes NPS from granting rights-of-way to oil and gas pipelines.

For support, Petitioners cite to\n   <em>\n    Food &amp; Drug Admin. v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.\n   </em>\n   , where the Supreme Court held that \"the meaning of one statute may be affected by other Acts, particularly where Congress has spoken subsequently and more specifically to the topic at hand.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508268\" index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/120/#p133\">\n    529 U.S. 120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 133,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508268\" index=\"209\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/120/#p133\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508268\" index=\"210\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/120/#p133\">\n    146 L.Ed.2d 121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   However,\n   <em>\n    Brown &amp; Williamson\n   </em>\n   is inapposite. There, the Supreme Court denied the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) the power to regulate tobacco because Congress had \"enacted several statutes addressing the particular subject of tobacco and health, creating a distinct regulatory scheme for cigarettes and smokeless tobacco.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508268\" index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/120/#p133\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508268\" index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/120/#p133\">\n    at 155-56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508268\" index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/120/#p133\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The FDA, by independently regulating tobacco, had effectively asserted authority in a field that other statutes had already occupied. Under such circumstances, the Supreme Court held that \"Congress has directly spoken to the issue here and precluded the FDA's jurisdiction to regulate tobacco products.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508268\" index=\"213\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/120/#p133\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508268\" index=\"213\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/120/#p133\">\n    at 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508268\" index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/120/#p133\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the MLA does not directly speak to the issue of oil and gas pipelines in national parks; the statute instead expressly applies to all Federal lands\n   <em>\n    except\n   </em>\n   national parks. Therefore, unlike the tobacco statutes in\n   <em>\n    Brown &amp; Williamson\n   </em>\n   that occupied the FDA's regulatory space, the MLA is carefully drawn to\n   <em>\n    avoid\n   </em>\n   NPS's domain. Thus, the MLA and the National Park System simply operate in separate spheres, and the MLA leaves untouched whatever preexisting right-of-way authority that Congress delegated for the Park System's management.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   In an effort to show that the MLA is all-encompassing and precludes oil and gas pipelines in the National Park System, Petitioners cite the MLA's exclusivity and retroactivity provisions.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20185\">\n    30 U.S.C. \u00a7 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (q), (t). However, those provisions do not support Petitioners' position because the provisions' scope remains limited to all \"Federal lands\" other than national parks. Had those provisions utilized a definition of \"Federal lands\" that included the National Park System, we may be compelled to agree, but that is not the statute we have.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Petitioners also argue that a ruling in the agency's favor would allow NPS and ACP to evade the policy choice that Congress made in the MLA, which subjects oil and gas pipelines to stringent requirements. However, the MLA's requirements, by the statute's plain text, never applied to the National Park System. Thus, there is simply nothing to evade. That is not to say that NPS has unbridled discretion to grant oil and gas rights-of-way-the agency still has to comply with the requirements of whatever authorizing statute it properly invokes. And, although the MLA does not preclude NPS from granting such rights-of-way, the statute's exhaustive requirements shed light on the rigor and thoroughness that Congress expects to accompany such weighty decisions, particularly given the National Park System's conservation mission.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"216\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=54%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20100101\">\n    54 U.S.C. \u00a7 100101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Accordingly, we hold that the MLA neither authorizes nor precludes grants of\n   rights-of-way across \"lands in the National Park System.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"217\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20185\">\n    30 U.S.C. \u00a7 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Having determined that the MLA leaves intact NPS's right-of-way authority, we now consider the scope of authority conferred by the Blue Ridge Parkway Organic Act and NPS's compliance with its requirements. At issue are two provisions containing substantially similar language, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 460a-3 and \u00a7 460a-8. Petitioners argue that neither provision authorizes the right-of-way permit in this case, while NPS and ACP argue that both provisions are independently sufficient sources of authority. To harmonize and give effect to both provisions, we conclude below that \u00a7 460a-8 applies only to a specific extension of the Blue Ridge Parkway that is not at issue in this case. Even assuming that either \u00a7 460a-3 or \u00a7 460a-8 confers general authority on NPS to grant oil and gas rights-of-way through Blue Ridge Parkway property, we conclude that NPS has acted arbitrarily and capriciously by failing to explain why ACP's pipeline is not inconsistent with parkway purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Our analysis begins with the text. Section 460a-3 provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   In the administration of the Blue Ridge Parkway, the Secretary of the Interior may issue revocable licenses or permits for rights-of-way over, across, and upon parkway lands, or for the use of parkway lands by the owners or lessees of adjacent lands, for such purposes and under such nondiscriminatory terms, regulations, and conditions as he may determine to be not inconsistent with the use of such lands for parkway purposes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   16 U.S.C. \u00a7 460a-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Section 460a-8 provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-145\">\n   The Secretary of the Interior may issue revocable licenses or permits for rights-of-way over, across, and upon parkway lands, or for the use of parkway lands by the owners or lessees of adjacent lands, or for such purposes and under such terms and conditions as he may determine to be consistent with the use of such lands for parkway purposes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   16 U.S.C. \u00a7 460a-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   To discern the scope of these two virtually identical provisions, we must determine how they interact with one another. NPS and ACP argue that \u00a7 460a-8 is broader than \u00a7 460a-3 because the former places an \"or\" in front of \"for such purposes and under such terms and conditions as he may determine to be consistent with ... parkway purposes.\" Thus, NPS and ACP read \u00a7 460a-8 as authorizing three types of permits: (1) permits for rights-of-way over, across, and upon parkway lands; (2) permits for the use of parkway lands by the owners or lessees of adjacent lands; and (3) permits for other purposes that the agency determines to be consistent with parkway objectives. Meanwhile, because \u00a7 460a-3 lacks the final disjunctive \"or,\" it would only authorize two types of permits, both of which must be consistent with parkway purposes: (1) permits for rights-of-way over, across, and upon parkway lands and (2) permits for the use of parkway lands by the owners or lessees of adjacent lands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   We find NPS and ACP's reading of \u00a7 460a-8 unpersuasive. Were we to adopt it, \u00a7 460a-8 would completely swallow \u00a7 460a-3 and render it a nullity. Indeed, \u00a7 460a-8 would be an implied repeal of \u00a7 460a-3 because it would remove the consistency requirement that previously constrained NPS's discretion. This construction also flouts a fundamental principle that undergirds every aspect of NPS's management of the National Park System-the\n   agency is forbidden from taking any action that is not consistent with its conservation mission unless Congress has \"directly and specifically\" authorized the harmful activity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"218\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=54%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20100101\">\n    54 U.S.C. \u00a7 100101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), (b)(2).

The geographical distinction between \u00a7 460a-3 and \u00a7 460a-8 completely resolves the seeming redundancy of the two similarly worded provisions. In particular, the statutory provision explicitly relied on in the permit, \u00a7 460a-8, applies only to the never-constructed southern extension, not to the original Blue Ridge Parkway itself (for which \u00a7 460a-3 governs). In sum, because the proposed pipeline crossing in this case is in Virginia, \u00a7 460a-8 does not provide NPS with any authority to issue the requisite right-of-way permit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Ordinarily, that conclusion would end our inquiry because it is a \"fundamental rule of administrative law\" that \"a reviewing court, in dealing with a determination or judgment which an administrative agency alone is authorized to make, must judge the propriety of such action solely by the grounds invoked by the agency.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sec. &amp; Exch.

Under both \u00a7 460a-3 and \u00a7 460a-8, NPS's ground for granting a right-of-way permit is the identical determination\n   that such a grant would not be inconsistent with parkway purposes.

NPS and ACP counter that the \"owners or lessees\" clause only modifies \"for the use of parkway lands.\" In other words, they believe that NPS may authorize only the Parkway's neighbors to \"use\" the Parkway, but NPS can grant rights-of-way to both neighbors and non-neighbors. Second, the parties dispute whether \u00a7 460a-3 allows NPS to grant rights-of-way for oil and gas pipelines notwithstanding the neighbors clause. Petitioners argue that oil and gas pipelines are categorically inconsistent with parkway purposes and that NPS therefore has no authority to grant a right-of-way for any oil or gas pipeline, not just the ACP.

However, we need not-and thus do not-decide either of these broader interpretative questions because, even assuming that \u00a7 460a-3's general right-of-way authority encompasses oil and gas pipelines, Petitioners nonetheless prevail because the agency has not fulfilled the requirements needed to exercise any such authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   To the extent \u00a7 460a-3 confers such authority, before NPS can properly issue a right-of-way permit, it must make a threshold determination that granting the right-of-way is \"not inconsistent with the use of such lands for parkway purposes\" and the overall National Park System to which it belongs. Critically, Congress has defined the National Park System's \"purpose\" as \"conserv[ing] the scenery, natural and historic objects, and wild life in the System units and [ ] provid[ing] for the enjoyment of the scenery, natural and historic objects, and wild life in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"234\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=54%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20100101\">\n    54 U.S.C. \u00a7 100101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ;\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In addition to invoking an inapplicable statutory provision ( 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 460a-8 ) as the source of its authority, the NPS decision also cites an inapplicable set of regulations. In the permit, NPS seems to take as a given that regulations codified at 36 C.F.R. Part 14 govern the issuance of the ACP permit and its conditions. J.A. 897. However, those regulations were promulgated under what is now\n   <extracted-citation index=\"256\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=54%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20100902\">\n    54 U.S.C. \u00a7 100902\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , a statute that expressly governs rights-of-way for electric utilities, telecommunications lines, and water conduits-not gas pipelines. While NPS certainly has discretion under 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 460a-3 to adopt those same requirements for other uses, there is nothing to indicate that NPS recognized the actual scope of 36 C.F.R. Part 14 or considered the regulations' appropriate application beyond the express purposes of \u00a7 100902. Given the collective weight of these errors and omissions, we are left with the firm conviction that NPS has not discharged its statutory obligation to apply its considered expertise to the exercise of its delegated authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Accordingly, we hold that NPS's permit decision is arbitrary and capricious. NPS began by invoking inapplicable laws. Even if this Court overlooks that error and assumes that NPS correctly interpreted the Organic Act to authorize rights-of-way for gas pipelines, NPS has not fulfilled its statutory mandate of ensuring consistency with values and purposes of the Blue Ridge Parkway unit and the overall National Park System.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   In sum, we hold that Petitioners have standing to bring this challenge, that this Court owes no deference to the statutory interpretation contained in NPS's permit decision, that the MLA does not strip NPS of authority to grant rights-of-way for gas pipelines, and that NPS's decision to grant ACP a right-of-way was arbitrary and capricious for failing to explain the pipeline's consistency with the purposes of the Blue Ridge Parkway and the National Park System.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Having concluded that both FWS and NPS erred in issuing their respective authorizations, we turn to the final question of remedy. Respondents argue that this Court lacks authority to vacate the agency actions under the Natural Gas Act. However, Respondents' position is contrary to the plain text of the Natural Gas Act. The judicial review provision at issue provides,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-164\">\n   If the Court finds that such order or action is inconsistent with the Federal law governing such permit and would prevent the construction, expansion, or operation of the facility subject to section 717b of this title or section 717f of this title, the Court shall remand the proceeding to the agency to take appropriate action consistent with the order of the Court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717r(d)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   On its face, \u00a7 717r(d)(3) only applies to an agency action that \"would prevent the construction\" of the natural gas facility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Islander E.
