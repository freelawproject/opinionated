In the government's view, its violation of the court's stay of removal order is irrelevant because the jurisdiction-stripping language of \u00a7 1252(g) extends to\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   action taken in connection with a removal order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We do not believe that the statute sweeps as broadly as the government contends.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Anaya is not attacking the removal itself, as he does not challenge the validity of his removal order, or claim that the Attorney General should have exercised discretion to delay his removal. Instead, he points out-correctly-that the Attorney General lacked the authority to execute the removal order because of the stay of removal issued by our court. Thus, his claims arise not from the execution of the removal order, but from the violation of our court's order. Indeed, the stay of removal \"temporarily suspend[ed] the source\" of the Attorney General's \"authority to act,\" resulting in a \"setting aside of ... [the] authority to remove\" Anaya.\n   <em>\n    Nken v. Holder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653916\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/418/#p428\">\n    556 U.S. 418\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 428-29,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653916\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/418/#p428\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1749\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653916\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/418/#p428\">\n    173 L.Ed.2d 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009). Put differently, but for the violation of the stay of removal, Anaya would not have an FTCA claim at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Our interpretation is supported by the express instructions of the Supreme Court, our precedent, and common sense, all of which require us to read the statute narrowly. The Supreme Court has not \"interpret[ed] [the statute's] language to sweep in any claim that can technically be said to 'arise from' the three listed actions of the Attorney General.\"\n   <em>\n    Jennings v. Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12616906\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/830/#p841\">\n    138 S.Ct. 830\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 841,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12616906\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/830/#p841\">\n    200 L.Ed.2d 122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018). Thus, \u00a7 1252(g) does not strip the federal courts of jurisdiction over claims challenging the multitude of \"other decisions or actions that may be part of the deportation process-such as the decisions to open an investigation, to surveil the suspected violator, to reschedule the deportation hearing, to include various provisions in the final order ..., and to refuse reconsideration of that order.\"\n   <em>\n    Reno v. Am.-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm. (\"AADC\")\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076671\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/525/471/#p482\">\n    525 U.S. 471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 482,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076671\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/525/471/#p482\">\n    119 S.Ct. 936\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076671\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/525/471/#p482\">\n    142 L.Ed.2d 940\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1999). A decision or action to violate a court order staying removal similarly falls outside of the statute's jurisdiction-stripping reach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Moreover, even if we agreed with the government that Anaya's claims tangentially \"arise from\" the execution of his removal order, we would still retain jurisdiction because the Attorney General entirely lacked the authority, and therefore the discretion, to remove him. \"Follow[ing] the [Supreme] Court's instruction to interpret \u00a7 1252(g) narrowly,\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Hovsepian\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9287080\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/359/1144/#p1155\">\n    359 F.3d 1144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1155 (9th Cir. 2004) (en banc), we have limited the statute's jurisdiction-stripping power to actions challenging the Attorney General's discretionary decisions to initiate proceedings, adjudicate cases, and execute removal orders. In\n   <em>\n    Barahona-Gomez v. Reno\n   </em>\n   , we rejected, for the second time, the government's argument that \u00a7 1252(g) deprived our court of jurisdiction over a challenge to a directive from the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) and the Chief Immigration Judge \"ordering a halt to the issuance of decisions granting suspension of deportation ... until further notice.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11171049\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/236/1115/#p1117\">\n    236 F.3d 1115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1117 (9th Cir. 2001). Though such an order could be interpreted to arise from the \"decision or action\" to \"adjudicate cases,\" we declined to adopt such a broad reading, instead finding that the statute \"does not remove from judicial review actions in violation of mandatory duties of IJs and the BIA conducted pursuant to the usual rules of administrative procedure.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11171049\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/236/1115/#p1117\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11171049\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/236/1115/#p1117\">\n    at 1120-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Catholic Soc.

Where the Attorney General totally lacks the discretion to effectuate a removal order, \u00a7 1252(g) is simply not implicated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Finally, taken to its logical conclusion, the government's reading would significantly circumscribe our authority to enforce our orders. As government counsel conceded at argument, in its view, the district court would lack jurisdiction even to sanction DHS for intentionally deporting a subpoenaed witness while under a court order not to do so. There is no support for the government's claim that Congress intended to prohibit federal courts from enforcing\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   court order so long as it is related to or in connection with an immigration proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We acknowledge that the Eighth Circuit, in a split decision, reached a contrary result, holding that it lacked jurisdiction over the FTCA claims of a noncitizen who was wrongfully removed in violation of stay issued by the BIA.\n   <em>\n    Silva v.

The\n   <em>\n    Silva\n   </em>\n   majority held that \u00a7 1252(g) eliminated jurisdiction because the removal order \"still existed\" in spite of the stay, thereby \"connect[ing]\" the FTCA claim \"directly and immediately\" to the decision to execute the order.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275662\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/866/938/#p939\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275662\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/866/938/#p939\">\n    at 940\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Humphries v.
