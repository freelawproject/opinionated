We disagree with Munro except as to his trademark claim. Thus, we affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Munro is an artist best known for his works \"Field of Light\" and \"Forest of Light\"-\"large-scale, immersive, light-based installations, and exhibitions.\" Proposed Amend. Compl. \u00b6 1. Munro alleges that Lucy contacted him and proposed a Lucy advertising and promotional campaign featuring Munro's work. He further claims that, relying on a promise of confidentiality, he shared additional information with Lucy about his prior work, including \"attendance figures, achieved online/multimedia traffic, and promotional methods used for the exhibitions.\" He further disclosed that he was in talks with public officials in Boston, Massachusetts about creating a public exhibition in the city. Following these disclosures, Munro says that Lucy stopped contacting him and that communications with Boston officials ceased soon thereafter as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In October 2013, Lucy launched a light exhibition and advertising campaign for Lucy in Boston. The exhibition, titled \"Light Forest,\" was an interactive light installation that responded to the participants' movements. An advertising campaign associated with the exhibit crossed several media platforms, including television, print, internet, and in-store displays.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2015, Munro filed a complaint against Lucy in Texas state court alleging that, by presenting the \"Light Forest\" exhibition and advertising campaign in Boston, Lucy infringed on Munro's trademark and trade dress and usurped a prospective business opportunity. In September 2015, Lucy removed the case to federal court and then filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, or, in the alternative, to transfer venue. Lucy also filed a separate Fed. R. Civ. P. Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. In January 2016, the case was transferred to the federal district court in Minnesota. The following month, Lucy renewed its Rule 12(b)(6) motion. Munro responded, but in March 2016, he also moved to amend his complaint. In his proposed amended complaint, Munro alleged: trademark and trade dress infringement, trademark and trade dress dilution, false designation of origin and unfair competition, misappropriation, fraud, tortious interference with prospective business opportunities, and unfair competition. The district court found that Munro's proposed amended complaint was futile and denied his motion to amend. It also granted Lucy's motion to dismiss Munro's complaint for failure to state a claim. The court dismissed without prejudice Munro's fraud claim as well as his trademark claim-to the extent it is based on the similarity of the names of the two exhibitions-but it dismissed all remaining claims with prejudice. Munro appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Munro asserts that Lucy created a \"knockoff\" light installation that basically plagiarized his creative designs. Copyright law, not trademark law, protects Munro's creative works. As the district court found, Munro's installation is not a \"mark\" that the Lanham Act was attempting to protect. Rather, the installation is the product itself. Because the light installation is a product, not a mark, and because copyright, not trademark, protects artistic and creative ideas and concepts,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dastar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8896954\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/23/#p28\">\n    539 U.S. at 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8896954\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/23/#p28\">\n    123 S.Ct. 2041\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Munro's claim does not properly fall under the Lanham Act. Furthermore, because Munro's proposed amended complaint continues to style his claim as trade dress infringement under the Lanham Act, he has not shown that amending the complaint would save his claim. Thus we find the district court properly dismissed his motion to amend his trade dress claim as futile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     2. Fraud\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Next, Munro argues that Lucy perpetrated fraud by making promises to Munro that it never intended to keep. He argues that Lucy stated it would keep the information he provided regarding his light exhibitions and prospective business opportunity with the city of Boston confidential. But, he asserts, Lucy knowingly made those false promises so that it could exploit the information for its own gain, as evidenced by the fact that Lucy did not maintain confidences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The circumstances of fraud must be pled with particularity.

The Minnesota Supreme Court has held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   It is a well-settled rule that a representation or expectation as to future acts is not a sufficient basis to support an action for fraud merely because the represented act or event did not take place. It is true that a misrepresentation of a present intention could amount to fraud.

This is insufficient to show fraud.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Parnes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"302297\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/122/539/#p549\">\n    122 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   549 ;\n   <em>\n    Stumm v.

Minn. 2012). Munro relies on the phrase \"on information and belief\" to allege that Lucy intentionally provided false promises. He argues the fact that Lucy broke its promises is proof that Lucy never intended to keep those promises in the first place. We disagree. Munro's complaint does not set forth any supporting facts showing that Lucy intended to defraud\n   him when the promises were made. Thus, he has not adequately alleged fraud under Minnesota law, and the district court did not err in dismissing his claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Valspar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6116137\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/764/359/#p368\">\n    764 N.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   368-69 ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Parnes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"302297\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/122/539/#p549\">\n    122 F.3d at 549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

For example, an artist is considered the producer of the creative ideas of his work, but if the artist also makes and sells his artwork himself, then he is considered the producer of that good or service as well and is \"able to assert a Lanham Act claim for false designation of origin.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523487\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/291/465/#p470\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Here, the district court held that Munro did not properly assert a trademark claim because he failed to provide facts suggesting that the names of his installations-\"Field of Light\" and \"Forest of Light\"-served a source-identifying function for a product or service. Instead, the court found, the names merely identified Munro as the artist or source of the creative idea. We disagree. Munro has alleged that he and his studio together create, design, develop, produce, promote, and market these large-scale immersive light installations. Like the artists in\n   <em>\n    Shepard v. European Pressphoto Agency\n   </em>\n   , Munro actually produces and sells these installations, making him the producer of the good.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dastar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8896954\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/23/#p28\">\n    539 U.S. at 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8896954\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/23/#p28\">\n    123 S.Ct. 2041\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the names \"Field of Light\" and \"Forest of Light\" are serving a source-identifying function for the installations, distinguishing them as unique products made by Munro and his studio.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201127\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Dastar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8896954\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/23/#p28\">\n    539 U.S. at 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8896954\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/23/#p28\">\n    123 S.Ct. 2041\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because Munro produces these installations, he is the \"origin of goods\" or \"source\" that the names identify, which entitles him to bring an action under the Lanham Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shepard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523487\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/291/465/#p470\">\n    291 F.Supp.3d at 470\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's decision to dismiss Munro's trade dress, fraud, and tortious interference claims as well as its denial of Munro's motion to amend these claims because the proposed amendments are futile. However, we find that Munro has sufficiently pled a trademark claim so as to survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. Accordingly, we reverse the district court's dismissal of Munro's trademark claim. Furthermore, we reverse the denial of Munro's motion to amend his compliant with respect to this claim. Finally, we remand the trademark claim under 15 U.S.C. 1125(a) to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n    </extracted-citation>\n    et seq.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
