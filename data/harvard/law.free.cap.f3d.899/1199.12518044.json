In these consolidated appeals, Joyner and Sturgis raise many issues, but having reviewed the briefs and the record, and with the benefit of oral argument, we find only one to have merit. Accordingly, we vacate Joyner's sentence and remand his case for resentencing; we affirm in all other respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Joyner and Sturgis, along with another co-Defendant, Joseph Stowers, were charged with robbing several CVS and Walgreens drugstores in the Atlanta metropolitan area during May and June 2015. Specifically, all three were charged with robbing a Walgreens on June 16, a different Walgreens on June 18, and a CVS on June 19. Additionally, they were charged with brandishing a firearm during each of those robberies, and Joyner alone was charged in three other counts with robbing a CVS on May 27 and two CVS stores on June 4. The tenth and final count of the superseding indictment charged Joyner and Sturgis with committing attempted robbery on June 24; law enforcement officers observed Joyner and Sturgis casing two CVS stores that night and arrested them after they exited the parking lot of one of those stores in Joyner's car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Prior to trial, the district court denied several motions, including motions by Joyner for new counsel and motions to suppress cell site data obtained from wireless carriers without a search warrant. The jury returned guilty verdicts on nine of the ten counts, acquitting Joyner and Sturgis only on the attempted robbery charge. Joyner was sentenced to 480 months in prison; Sturgis, to 384 months.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On appeal, Joyner and Sturgis primarily argue that the district court erred in providing the superseding indictment to the jury during deliberations without repeating the instruction that the indictment is not evidence of guilt, and they also challenge the district court's refusal to suppress cell site data. Additionally, Joyner contends that the trial court abused its discretion in denying his motions for new counsel and his motion for mistrial based on an alleged\n   <em>\n    Bruton\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   violation. Joyner also asserts error in the total offense level and resulting Guidelines range relied upon by the district court at his sentencing. We address only these contentions; on the other issues raised, we affirm without further discussion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    A. The District Court Did Not Reversibly Err By Declining to Repeat a Jury Instruction When It Provided the Indictment to the Jury.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After the jurors began their deliberations, they sent a note to the trial judge asking for a list of the dates and locations of each robbery, as well as a list of times that each robbery took place. The judge\n   discussed this two-part question with counsel, and during that discussion she realized that although she had told the jurors that they would receive a copy of the indictment, she inadvertently had not yet provided it to them. The jurors thus were attempting to complete a verdict form that listed the charged robberies only by count number, with no indication of which date and location corresponded to which count.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The judge told counsel that \"they definitely need a copy of the indictment,\" but Joyner's counsel objected to giving the jury the indictment at that point \"because of the context of the question that they've asked.\" Sturgis's counsel did not oppose the jury being given the indictment but asked the judge to give a cautionary instruction reminding the jury that the indictment is not evidence; Joyner's counsel agreed with that suggestion. The judge declined to reinstruct the jury on that issue or any other, though she acknowledged: \"Maybe there's no harm in doing that, at least to remind them of that, but I just don't see the necessity for it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The judge called the jury back into the courtroom and noted their question about the dates and locations of each robbery. She then apologized for not having provided the jury with a copy of the indictment, and she told the jurors it would be provided to them momentarily. The judge explained that the indictment contained \"the 10 counts that are alleged in this case\" and that \"in each count, the date and location of the particular robbery being alleged is set forth.\" The judge then said: \"So I hope that that helps you with respect to your first part of the request.\" With regard to the second part of the jury's note, which requested a list of times that each robbery took place, the judge noted that the indictment did not allege any specific times and told the jurors: \"So you will have to rely on the evidence that was presented to you during the case.\" Joyner and Sturgis contend that in responding to the jury's note in this manner, the district court misled and confused the jury by suggesting that the indictment was evidence of guilt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"We review a district court's response to a jury question for an abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Lopez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3505418\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/590/1238/#p1247\">\n    590 F.3d 1238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1247 (11th Cir. 2009). Likewise, \"[a] district court's refusal to give a requested jury instruction is reviewed for abuse of discretion, and '[w]e reverse when we are left with a substantial and ineradicable doubt as to whether the jury was properly guided in its deliberations.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3505418\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/590/1238/#p1247\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3505418\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/590/1238/#p1247\">\n    at 1248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (second alteration in original) (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v. Grigsby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11914252\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/111/806/#p814\">\n    111 F.3d 806\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 814 (11th Cir. 1997) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   While it would have been prudent for the trial court to have reminded the jurors that the indictment is not evidence when the indictment was belatedly provided to them during their deliberations, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in handling the jury's question as it did. The judge had already told the jury at least twice that the indictment is not evidence of guilt-once during preliminary instructions at the beginning of the trial, and again after the close of evidence when full instructions on the law were given. And the court's instructions further informed the jury that the Government had the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the charged crimes were committed on a date reasonably close to the date alleged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"[T]he Supreme Court has repeatedly held that we must presume that juries follow their instructions,\" and \"[w]e have obediently followed\" that direction.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Roy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277144\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/855/1133/#p1186\">\n    855 F.3d 1133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1186-87 (11th Cir. 2017) (en banc). Here, the trial court did not tell the jury that it could rely on the indictment as evidence of guilt, and it did not remove any elements of the crimes from the jury's consideration. And as the\n   Government aptly notes, this case was not about whether the robberies took place-clearly, someone robbed these stores. At issue was the identity of the robbers and whether these defendants were the perpetrators of the crimes charged. The jury was properly instructed, and we are not \"left with a substantial and ineradicable doubt as to whether the jury was properly guided in its deliberations.\"\n   <em>\n    Lopez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3505418\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/590/1238/#p1247\">\n    590 F.3d at 1248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Grigsby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11914252\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/111/806/#p814\">\n    111 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   814 ). Thus, no abuse of discretion has been shown.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    B. The District Court's Denial of Motions to Suppress Cell Site Data Does not Warrant Reversal.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Joyner and Sturgis both argue that their cell phone records-including \"cell site data\" with which prosecutors demonstrated their proximity to the locations of the robberies-should not have been allowed into evidence at trial because the records were obtained without a warrant and thus in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Although the Supreme Court recently agreed with this argument in a similar case and held that a search warrant indeed is generally required to obtain such cell site data, the Supreme Court's intervening decision does not afford Joyner or Sturgis relief in this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Government obtained the cell site data at issue here through three court orders issued pursuant to the Stored Communications Act (SCA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202701\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 2711. The SCA provides that a governmental entity may require a cellular provider to disclose subscriber records if the governmental entity obtains a court order after offering \"specific and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that ... the records or other information sought[ ] are relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202703\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1)(B), (d). The required showing to obtain an order under the SCA is less than the probable cause required for a search warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On May 5, 2015-about six weeks before the Government obtained the SCA orders challenged in this case-we held that a \u00a7 2703(d) SCA order allowing government access to a cellular provider's records \"comports with applicable Fourth Amendment principles and is not constitutionally unreasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The district court was constrained to rely on this binding precedent and correctly did so in denying Joyner's and Sturgis's motions to suppress cell site data. And Joyner and Sturgis acknowledge in their appellate briefs that the district court had no choice but to follow\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ; they note that they raised this issue to preserve it pending a decision in\n   <em>\n    Carpenter v.

The Government has maintained throughout\n   this case that it acted in good faith and that the\n   <em>\n    Leon\n   </em>\n   exception therefore applies; neither Sturgis nor Joyner presented any argument or evidence to either the district court or this Court to counter that proposition.

Here, the Government complied with the requirements of the SCA in obtaining the orders to compel cell site records, and when they did so in June 2015, that warrantless procedure was, under this Court's precedent, within the bounds of the Fourth Amendment. Thus here, as in\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   , under the\n   <em>\n    Leon\n   </em>\n   exception to the warrant requirement, the district court's denial of the motions to suppress is not reversible error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    C.

Agent Fitzgibbons also recounted that Sturgis told him that the 9 millimeter Beretta firearm found in the vehicle belonged to him. Joyner's counsel did not object to this later testimony when it was given, though at the conclusion of Agent Fitzgibbons' testimony-thirty-five transcript pages later-Joyner's counsel told the court, \"I just want to complete the record on my\n   <em>\n    Bruton\n   </em>\n   motion.\" He then suggested that the \"natural implication\" of Sturgis's statement about owning the Beretta was \"that the other gun belonged to Mr. Joyner,\" and he asserted that the statement that \"they left the apartment together\" implicated Joyner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Preserved evidentiary rulings and denials of motions for mistrial are reviewed for abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Joyner explains that he objected to the testimony that Sturgis had been staying in Joyner's apartment \"because it was a link in the chain of evidence\" against Joyner \"based on [incriminating] items that had been seized from the apartment.\" But Joyner's \"link in the chain\" objection describes precisely the kind of statement that poses \"[n]o\n   <em>\n    Bruton\n   </em>\n   problem.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Indeed, the district court had discretion to conclude that the statement was exculpatory for Joyner because he could argue that Sturgis owned the incriminating items that were found in Joyner's apartment. For similar reasons, there was no\n   <em>\n    Bruton\n   </em>\n   violation when the district court admitted Sturgis's other two statements. One statement was a facially innocent account of Sturgis and Joyner's whereabouts leading up to their arrests at the CVS on Powder Springs Street. And Sturgis did not \"directly inculpate\" Joyner when Sturgis took responsibility for one of the two guns found in Joyner's car.\n   <em>\n    Beale\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10549934\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/921/1412/#p1425\">\n    921 F.2d at 1425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As Conceded By The Government, Joyner Should Be Resentenced Under a Correct Offense Level and Guidelines Range.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In calculating Joyner's adjusted offense level in the presentence report, the Probation Office applied U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.4 to determine the combined offense level for the multiple counts of conviction. This guideline provides for an increase in offense level based on the number of \"units\" involved as defined in the guideline. The Probation Office determined that there were 5 \"units\" for purposes of this guideline and then added 5 levels to Joyner's offense level.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   But USSG \u00a7 3D1.4 prescribes a 4-level increase for 5 units, not a 5-level increase. This error went unnoticed by both the district court and the parties, and the court sentenced Joyner using an incorrect total offense level of 32 and, applying a criminal history category of I, a resulting Guidelines range of 121-151 months.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The correct total offense level is 31, which yields a Guidelines range of 108-135 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   We review sentencing issues not raised in the district court for plain error, and we may correct the error only if it affects substantial rights.\n   <em>\n    United States v.
