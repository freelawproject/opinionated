As the movant, a \u00a7 2255 litigant has always been required to shoulder the burden of proving his claim. That being so,\n   <em>\n    Beeman\n   </em>\n   held that a \u00a7 2255 litigant who seeks to overturn his sentence on the ground that he was sentenced pursuant to the residual clause must actually prove that his sentence was based on that clause: a requirement\n   that the panel majority thought to be rather obvious and unremarkable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Dissenting as to the denial of en banc review of\n   <em>\n    Beeman\n   </em>\n   , Judge Martin, however, disagrees that a \u00a7 2255 litigant who raises a\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   claim should be held to such a burden. Instead, our dissenting colleague seeks a new rule that would exempt\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2255 claimants from the standard that is applied to all other \u00a7 2255 litigants. As the author of the\n   <em>\n    Beeman\n   </em>\n   decision, I write in response to our dissenting colleague's assertion that\n   <em>\n    Beeman\n   </em>\n   was wrongly decided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Following a search of his residence that uncovered, among other things, the presence of illegal drugs, drug paraphernalia, a rifle and pistol, and 31 rounds of ammunition, Jeffrey Beeman was convicted by a jury of cocaine possession with the intent to distribute and of being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition. The district court considered whether Beeman's sentence as to the firearm and ammunition charges should be enhanced pursuant to the ACCA: a statute that calls for a sentence of at least fifteen years for a defendant convicted of an applicable firearms offense who has at least three prior qualifying felony convictions for drug trafficking offenses and/or violent felonies. Beeman potentially had three such convictions: two prior drug trafficking convictions and a prior violent felony conviction. The latter was a conviction for aggravated assault under Georgia law after Beeman, armed with a shotgun, shot a person named Parrish Mitchell. The district court concluded that this aggravated assault conviction constituted a violent felony and that the prior drug trafficking convictions likewise qualified as ACCA-predicate crimes. The court therefore sentenced Beeman pursuant to the ACCA. Beeman offered no objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Beeman likewise did not appeal his sentence, which had been imposed in 2009, albeit he unsuccessfully appealed his conviction, which became final in 2010. Nevertheless, almost six years later, in 2016, he filed a \u00a7 2255 motion claiming that the district court had erred when it counted the aggravated assault conviction as a violent felony and sentenced him pursuant to the ACCA. Accordingly, he asked that his ACCA-sentence be vacated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The ACCA provides three ways by which a prior conviction can qualify as a violent felony, only two of which are relevant here: the elements clause and the residual clause. The elements clause defines as a violent felony a crime that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(B)(i). The residual clause defines a violent felony as a crime that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). The presentence investigation report had recommended that a conviction for Georgia aggravated assault be considered a violent felony under the ACCA, but it did not specify on what clause or clauses that recommendation was based, nor did the district court so specify when it imposed sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Beeman's\n    <em>\n     Descamps\n    </em>\n    Claim is Untimely\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As noted, only two of the three clauses defining a violent felony were potentially applicable to Beeman's aggravated assault conviction: the elements clause and the residual clause. Accordingly, in his \u00a7 2255 motion, Beeman raised two separate claims in an effort to knock out each clause as a viable basis for characterizing the aggravated assault conviction as a violent felony: a\n   <em>\n    Descamps\n   </em>\n   claim challenging use of the elements clause and a\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   claim challenging use of the residual clause. As to the former, he relied on the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Descamps v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698469\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/254/\">\n    570 U.S. 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698469\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/254/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 2276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698469\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/254/\">\n    186 L.Ed.2d 438\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013), in which the Supreme Court clarified, among other things, that the modified categorical approach cannot be used to classify a conviction as being for a violent felony if the underlying statute is indivisible. Relying on the\n   <em>\n    Descamps\n   </em>\n   decision, which was issued subsequent to his sentencing, Beeman contended that the elements clause can now no longer support the characterization of his aggravated assault conviction as a violent felony. From this proposition, he argued that any use by the district court of that clause when imposing his sentence was illegitimate, and thus his ACCA-sentence should be vacated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Unfortunately for Beeman, his\n   <em>\n    Descamps\n   </em>\n   claim could not make it out of the starting gate because it was untimely. Holding that Beeman's claim for relief under \u00a7 2255 was time-barred to the extent it sought relief pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Descamps\n   </em>\n   , the panel opinion explained that Beeman had filed his \u00a7 2255 motion over five years after his judgment of conviction became final-an event that typically triggers the start date for AEDPA's one-year limitations period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Beeman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266600\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/871/1215/\">\n    871 F.3d at 1220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This default limitations period may, however, be restarted and extended for a one-year period of time when the movant asserts a right that \"has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(3). But\n   <em>\n    Descamps\n   </em>\n   \"did not announce a new rule.\"\n   <em>\n    Mays v.

Moreover, even had it done so, Beeman did not file his \u00a7 2255 motion within one year of\n   <em>\n    Descamps\n   </em>\n   's issuance in 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In short, Beeman's\n   <em>\n    Descamps\n   </em>\n   claim being untimely, he cannot challenge in a \u00a7 2255 motion the validity of the elements clause as a basis for classifying his aggravated assault conviction as a violent felony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    Beeman Failed to Prove His\n    <em>\n     Johnson\n    </em>\n    Claim\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Without a timely\n   <em>\n    Descamps\n   </em>\n   claim, the only route to relief for Beeman was a successful\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   claim. The panel opinion concluded that Beeman had asserted a timely\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   claim by alleging that the residual clause was an improper basis for determining whether a putative predicate conviction constitutes a violent felony and by filing his \u00a7 2255 motion within one year after\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   's issuance.\n   <em>\n    Beeman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266600\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/871/1215/\">\n    871 F.3d at 1220-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Unlike\n   <em>\n    Descamps\n   </em>\n   , the\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   decision meets both requirements necessary to invoke a renewed limitations period under \u00a7 2255(f)(3) : (1)\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   announced a new rule and (2) the Supreme Court made the rule retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Welch v.

That lapse was fatal.\n   <em>\n    Beeman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266600\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/871/1215/\">\n    871 F.3d at 1221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In order to do that, the movant must prove that-more likely than not-he was sentenced based solely on the residual clause. If the movant's sentence was based also, or instead, on the elements or the enumerated offenses clause (neither of which were called into question by\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ), then one must necessarily conclude that the now-invalid residual clause did not adversely affect the sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Beeman provided no evidence to meet his burden. He offered no reason why one should infer that the district court based its conclusion that the Georgia aggravated assault conviction qualified as a violent felony on the residual clause. Certainly, nothing in the sentencing record indicates that the district court, addressing an aggravated assault conviction arising out of Beeman's shooting of another person, rejected-or even questioned-what would have appeared to be the obvious clause to use in first determining whether that conviction was a violent felony: the elements clause, which clause requires that the underlying crime have as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against another person.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Nor has Beeman shown that there is anything in the legal landscape in 2009 to suggest that the district court would have had any reason to doubt that the elements clause provided a sound basis for characterizing the aggravated assault conviction as a violent felony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

As the panel explained, \"[e]ach case must be judged on its own facts.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In this particular case, Beeman simply failed to show-by any of the methods suggested by the panel or by any other method\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   -that the sentencing court relied on the residual clause in applying the ACCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In determining whether a district court based its sentencing decision solely on the residual clause, our colleague would widen the path for a movant seeking\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   relief by considering only whether a particular conviction would qualify\n   <em>\n    today\n   </em>\n   as an ACCA predicate under the enumerated offenses or the elements clause, given developments in the caselaw such as\n   <em>\n    Descamps\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    . See\n   </em>\n   Judge Martin Dissent at 1227. If current law would forbid the use of the enumerated offenses or the elements clause, according to our colleague's reasoning, one would have to infer that the sentencing court necessarily relied only on the residual clause when it applied the ACCA enhancement.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Yet, simply as a matter of logic, this approach is flawed because evidence of what a judge is allowed to do under current law does not answer the question of what the judge actually did at the time of the sentencing. To use this case as an example, even if we assume that it would be improper today, after the 2013\n   <em>\n    Descamps\n   </em>\n   decision and its progeny, to find that a Georgia aggravated assault conviction qualifies as a violent felony under the elements clause, that conclusion does not mean that the district court in 2009 was clairvoyant and, anticipating future caselaw, that it would have eliminated the elements clause as the basis for its determination that aggravated assault is a violent felony, instead defaulting to the residual clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   But more fundamentally, our dissenting colleague's approach would let Beeman's untimely claim for relief under\n   <em>\n    Descamps\n   </em>\n   in through the backdoor, thereby entirely neutering a ruling that any such claim is clearly barred by AEDPA's statute of limitations. Our colleague suggests that the panel somehow \"ignored\"\n   <em>\n    Descamps\n   </em>\n   by adhering to this statute of limitations ruling.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Judge Martin Dissent at 1227. To the contrary, the panel acknowledged\n   <em>\n    Descamps\n   </em>\n   , as well as its retroactive application to cases on collateral review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Beeman\n   </em>\n   , 871 F.3d at 1219. But the fact that a particular legal principle is to be given retroactive effect does not necessarily mean that a claim based on that legal principle will be timely under AEDPA. As the panel opinion explained,\n   <em>\n    Descamps\n   </em>\n   does not reset AEDPA's statute of limitations pursuant to \u00a7 2255(f)(3), because\n   <em>\n    Descamps\n   </em>\n   does not set forth a \"newly recognized\" right.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1220. Further, Beeman filed his motion more than a year after\n   <em>\n    Descamps\n   </em>\n   was issued. In short, Beeman should not be allowed to obtain relief under \u00a7 2255 based on a purported\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   claim that is nothing more than a thinly-disguised and untimely\n   <em>\n    Descamps\n   </em>\n   claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Essentially, what our colleague is advocating for in her dissent is that the burden of proof and persuasion that ordinarily applies to a \u00a7 2255 motion be relaxed when it comes to\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   claims to ensure that more\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   movants prevail on their claims. In support of her position, our colleague notes that sentencing courts have never been required to say, and as a result have not always expressly stated, which of the ACCA's clauses they are relying on when finding that a conviction qualifies as a violent felony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Judge Martin Dissent at 1228-29. As a result, our colleague argues, if we treat\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   movants like every other \u00a7 2255 movant, and require them to shoulder their burden of proof, it is unlikely that many of these prisoners will succeed in showing they are due relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Even accepting Judge Martin's factual premise about what sentencing records typically show or do not show, our panel opinion rejected her legal premise that the burden of proof should be overhauled for\n   the purpose of increasing the number of cases in which a movant prevails. The burden of proof reflects longstanding and fundamental interests in finality. It is by application of the appropriate burden that the outcome of a case is supposed to be determined, not the other way around. This approach is as true with\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   as with any other type of claim. A \u00a7 2255 petitioner is not exempt from the requirement that he prove his sentence was imposed contrary to the Constitution simply because he has pled a\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   For all of the above reasons, I remain convinced that the\n   <em>\n    Beeman\n   </em>\n   panel got the law right. To obtain relief on a\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   claim, a \u00a7 2255 movant must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that that the residual clause in fact adversely impacted his sentence. The movant cannot meet this burden by showing only that his qualifying convictions do not satisfy the elements clause or the enumerated offenses clause under the law as it stands today, because such a showing does not demonstrate that the sentencing court in fact relied on the residual clause when it imposed sentence. Rather, the movant must point to evidence in the record or to caselaw in existence at the time of the sentencing sufficient to show that-more likely than not-the sentencing court based its imposition of an ACCA-sentence on the residual clause.\n   <em>\n    Beeman\n   </em>\n   was true to applicable and long-standing legal principles, and I submit that it was correctly decided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   MARTIN, Circuit Judge, with whom JILL PRYOR, Circuit Judge joins, dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Jeffrey Bernard Beeman is serving a seventeen and one-half year term of imprisonment. His sentence was made longer because he was sentenced under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\"ACCA\"), a statute intended to impose harsher sentences on criminal defendants who committed violent felonies in the past. Since he was sentenced, the law defining what constitutes a \"violent felony\" has changed. Indeed, the U.S. Supreme Court invalidated part of the statute that had been the basis for his longer sentence,\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. United States\n   </em>\n   , 576 U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct. 2551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    192 L.Ed.2d 569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). As a result, Mr. Beeman filed this action seeking to have his sentence vacated. He points out that a person with a background identical to his would get a significantly shorter sentence if sentenced today. However, the panel of this court that ruled on Mr. Beeman's appeal imposed administrative impediments, such that he can get no review of his sentence. Those impediments are not derived from the statute or Eleventh Circuit or Supreme Court precedent, and they bar relief for prisoners serving sentences that could not properly be imposed under current law. I hoped the majority of this Court would vacate the\n   <em>\n    Beeman\n   </em>\n   panel opinion, and I dissent from their decision to let it stand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The panel opinion in Mr. Beeman's case allows him no relief unless he can point to something from the transcript of his 2009 sentencing hearing that proves his longer sentence was based on the part of the statute, the residual clause, which was invalidated by the Supreme Court. Of course, at the time of Mr. Beeman's sentencing hearing, no one who was there had any idea that the Armed Career Criminal Act would, six years later, be partly invalidated by the Supreme Court. Thus, the question presented by Mr. Beeman's case is what opportunity, if any, do we give him (and many others like him) to have his sentence reevaluated now that the Supreme Court has recognized his sentence was imposed under a statute that was, in part, unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In her opinion respecting the denial of en banc review, Judge Julie Carnes says I\n   \"disagree\" that litigants seeking habeas relief should be required to bear the burden of proving their case. Judge Carnes Op. at 1218-19. Not so. The burden belongs squarely on Mr. Beeman. My argument is that he has carried his burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Mr. Beeman came forward with proof that his sentence must have been based on the residual clause. That is, it can't possibly be based on the other clauses in ACCA's definition of \"violent felony.\" This Court has previously relied on precisely this type of process of elimination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Chance\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4349672\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/831/1335/#p1339\">\n    831 F.3d 1335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1339-41 (11th Cir. 2016) ;\n   <em>\n    In re Rogers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325693\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/825/1335/#p1339\">\n    825 F.3d 1335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1339 (11th Cir. 2016) (per curiam).

And Mr. Beeman is right when he tells us that his 1990 conviction in Georgia for aggravated assault is not an ACCA predicate offense under the enumerated offenses clause, one of the two surviving definitions of violent felony. Beyond that, and although this Court has not yet decided the issue, Mr. Beeman explains why his 1990 Georgia aggravated assault conviction cannot qualify as a violent felony under the last remaining definition either.

Mr. Beeman would like the opportunity to prove that his sentence was not based on the elements clause. But the panel is interested only in how the sentencing court understood ACCA in 2009. As\n   <em>\n    Descamps\n   </em>\n   explains, the rules for evaluating predicate offenses-other than under the residual clause-are the same today as they always have been.\n   <em>\n    Descamps\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698469\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/254/\">\n    570 U.S. at 260, 263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698469\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/254/\">\n    133 S.Ct. at 2283, 2285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Ignoring for a moment that we\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   apply Supreme Court precedent, what is the value in binding ourselves to erroneous decisions?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   We also know that\n   <em>\n    Beeman\n   </em>\n   's historical-fact test raises very real practical concerns. Most pre-\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   sentencing records don't specify reliance on the residual clause because \"[n]othing in the law requires a judge to specify which clause of [ACCA] ... it relied upon in imposing a sentence.\"\n   <em>\n    Chance\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4349672\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/831/1335/#p1339\">\n    831 F.3d at 1340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A \u00a7 2255 claim under the\n   <em>\n    Beeman\n   </em>\n   rule thus now turns on whether the sentencing court happened to utter superfluous commentary at sentencing. This Court plainly identified this problem in\n   <em>\n    Chance\n   </em>\n   , which discussed two hypothetical defendants who were \"sentenced on the same day, for the same offense, by the same judge, with the same\n   ACCA predicates.\"\n   <em>\n    Beeman\n   </em>\n   , 871 F.3d at 1228-29 (Williams, J., dissenting) (citing\n   <em>\n    Chance\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4349672\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/831/1335/#p1339\">\n    831 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1341 ). The hypothetical judge specified for one defendant that the sentence was based on the residual clause, but was silent about the other.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4349672\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/831/1335/#p1339\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Under the historical-fact test, one of those defendants gets relief and the other does not. And the resulting disparity means courts fall short in imposing like punishments on like wrongdoers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In short, Mr. Beeman's method of proving his claim-showing that his sentence could not possibly be based on the elements clause or enumerated offenses clause-is rational, supported in law, embraced by this circuit and others, and a proper allocation of the burden for a \u00a7 2255 petitioner.

With a ten-year maximum sentence, he could be nearing his release date. Instead, he will spend another seven-and-a-half more years behind bars. And not only does this Court sanction his unconstitutional sentence, we will prevent him-and many other prisoners like him-from arguing the full merits of his case in court. Our Court is now daily presented with pleadings from prisoners who are barred from our Court because of the rule created in the\n   <em>\n    Beeman\n   </em>\n   panel opinion.

In the part of his opinion addressing the merits of Beeman's \u00a7 2255 motion, the judge indicated, as an alternative ground, that relief on the motion was not warranted because Georgia aggravated assault still qualifies as a violent felony under the elements clause of the ACCA, even under the more exacting analysis required by\n    <em>\n     Descamps\n    </em>\n    and its progeny. Given this post-\n    <em>\n     Descamps\n    </em>\n    analysis by the judge, it is unlikely that he would have relied solely on the residual clause in finding that Beeman's Georgia aggravated assault conviction qualified as a violent felony when he sentenced Beeman pre-\n    <em>\n     Descamps\n    </em>\n    in 2009.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    We noted in the panel opinion that the suggested methods of proof were just \"a few examples\" and that \"there could be other circumstances on which a movant can rely\" to prove he is entitled to relief under \u00a7 2255 pursuant to\n    <em>\n     Johnson\n    </em>\n    .\n    <em>\n     Beeman\n    </em>\n    , 871 F.3d at 1224 n.4.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    Our colleague also argues that the panel's statute of limitations ruling conflicts with our own precedent in\n    <em>\n     Mays v.
