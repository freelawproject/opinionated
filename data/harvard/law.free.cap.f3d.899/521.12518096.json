The district court found that the defendants violated McAdoo's Eighth Amendment rights by their deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs while he was in their custody. However, the court concluded that the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) precludes McAdoo's recovery of compensatory damages because McAdoo failed to meet 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(e) 's physical injury threshold. We reverse in part and affirm in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In May 2013, McAdoo was in the custody of the Hot Spring County Detention Center (\"the Jail\"). He was awaiting transfer to an Arkansas Department of Corrections (ADC) prison. McAdoo and a fellow inmate began fighting. Officer Ben Cash noticed the quarrel and ordered the inmates to cease. McAdoo refused while the other inmate complied. Officer Cash again ordered McAdoo to stop fighting, and after the third ignored command, the officer \"grabbed [McAdoo] by the waist, took [McAdoo] to the floor, and placed his knee on [McAdoo's] back.\"\n   <em>\n    McAdoo v. Martin\n   </em>\n   , No. 6:13-CV-06088,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201091348\">\n    2017 WL 1091348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (W.D. Ark. Mar. 21, 2017). McAdoo immediately complained of a painful shoulder; Officer Cash subsequently submitted a report stating that McAdoo's shoulder was injured during the takedown to stop the fight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Sergeant Amy Martin, the Jail's acting administrator, gave permission for McAdoo to be transported to a hospital, and a Jail deputy took McAdoo to the local emergency room approximately three hours after the fight. The treating physician, after diagnosing a dislocated shoulder, prescribed McAdoo ten hydrocodone tablets for pain, to be taken every four hours, as needed. McAdoo also wore a splint to restrain the shoulder. Because Jail policy bans all narcotic drugs, Jail officials refused to fill McAdoo's hydrocodone\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   prescription. Instead, the Jail offered McAdoo-free of charge-his choice of non-prescription pain relievers, to be taken every four to six hours, depending on the dose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   McAdoo revisited the hospital two days later for a follow-up appointment. At that time, X-rays revealed \"[p]robable avulsion fractures off the humeral head.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4 (alteration in original) (quoting Defs.' Ex. 9 at 3). A computerized tomography (CT) scan indicated the presence of \"a 'comminuted fracture involving the superolateral left humeral head with the fracture extending through the greater tuberosity. There were at least three bony fragments in the anterior glenohumeral.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting Defs.' Ex. 9 at 4). According to McAdoo, the examining physician informed him that he needed immediate surgery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   McAdoo told his doctor that the over-the-counter pain relievers were inadequate. However, the doctor declined to prescribe hydrocodone to McAdoo because of the Jail's policy against narcotic medications. The doctor then scheduled another follow-up appointment two days later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Jail was responsible for inmate medical expenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nonetheless, the Jail insisted that McAdoo sign documents stating that he would be liable for all medical expenses resulting from the shoulder injury. McAdoo declined, and the Jail denied his follow-up visit to the hospital. The Jail would not authorize McAdoo's transport to the hospital. The Jail also did not arrange for McAdoo's surgery because McAdoo refused responsibility for the costs. McAdoo remained in the Jail until he was transferred to an ADC facility in June 2013. McAdoo eventually had surgery following his transfer to the ADC prison. In that surgery, \"screws were placed to hold his 'arm together.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5 (quoting Pl.'s Ex. 5). McAdoo then underwent nine months of physical therapy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   McAdoo filed a pro se\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   suit against Sergeant Martin and Officer Cash, alleging failure to protect, excessive force, and denial of medical care in violation of his constitutional rights. The district court held a bench trial in August 2016. During trial, McAdoo testified that despite the surgery and physical therapy \"his left arm is 'damaged for the rest of [his] life.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (alteration in original). At the trial's conclusion, the court granted judgment as a matter of law to the defendants on McAdoo's failure-to-protect claim. The district court subsequently issued a memorandum opinion in which it concluded that McAdoo's excessive force claim also lacked merit. The court did, however, find in favor of McAdoo on his claim of denial of medical care. It found that the defendants acted with deliberate indifference and failed to provide adequate medical care to McAdoo. The court noted that \"[o]pioids are stronger and more effective in providing pain relief,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at *7 n.3, and explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Here, the policy denies prisoners the right to narcotic pain medication even when prescribed by an emergency room physician.

No medical judgment was exercised. Their actions amount to deliberate indifference.

The court, citing the PLRA, \"[r]eluctantly\" concluded that McAdoo's \"severe pain\" does not constitute a showing of a physical injury required for recovery under the statute.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at *8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

However, we need not resolve that question because McAdoo sustained a severe physical injury that meets the PLRA's requirements. Officer Cash's takedown maneuver fractured McAdoo's shoulder, which required surgery. McAdoo's severe pain flowed directly from that physical injury, and despite surgical intervention and physical therapy, the injury has caused some amount of permanent disability. This injury is beyond de minimis. Our prior decisions held that injuries less extensive than McAdoo's shoulder fracture met \u00a7 1997e(e) 's requirements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Munn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"881118\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/433/1087/#p1089\">\n    433 F.3d at 1089\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (headaches, cramps, nosebleeds, and dizziness);\n   <em>\n    Pratt v.

They say that since Officer Cash's takedown of McAdoo was legitimate and constitutional conduct during the course of his duty, McAdoo's shoulder injury does not qualify as \"a showing of physical injury\" required by the PLRA.
