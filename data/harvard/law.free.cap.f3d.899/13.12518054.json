On July 3, 2017, PREPA defaulted on its payments. The bondholders accuse PREPA of breaching a promise to seek a rate increase sufficient to cover debt payments, of failing to collect on customer accounts, and of mismanaging operations.

In an effort to dispose quickly of that limitation, the bondholders cite two California municipal bankruptcy cases for the proposition that by allowing the debtor to file a Title III petition, the Oversight Board consented carte blanche to the full exercise of the Title III court's powers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alliance Capital Mgmt.

We reject this approach because it would render Section 305 a nullity; consent would always exist because Section 305 only applies in Title III cases, and in those cases, the Oversight Board must approve the debtor's filing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202164\">\n    48 U.S.C. \u00a7 2164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202164\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2124(j).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Anticipating the possibility that this \"consent\" argument would fail, the bondholders also urge a more nuanced reading of Section 305 as limiting only what the Title III court can itself directly order. The Title III court disagreed. It read Section 305 as not only preventing the Title III court from directly interfering with the listed powers and properties of PREPA, but also from indirectly interfering by issuing an order for the purpose of allowing another court to engage in any such interference, at least when the relief sought is the appointment of a receiver. The Title III court reasoned that Section 305 and other PROMESA provisions create a structure that is \"protective of the autonomy of public entities engaged in debt adjustment proceedings.\" It also read the word \"otherwise\" in Section 305 as prohibiting the Title III court from indirectly doing (i.e., allowing others to do) what it could not directly do.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We agree with the bondholders that Section 305 does not tie the Title III court's hands quite so much as that court found it did. Our reasoning begins with the statutory text. The text of Section 305 trains on the powers of \"the court,\" plainly the Title III court. It states specifically what that court may not do: \"interfere with\" certain powers and assets of the debtor \"by any stay, order, or decree.\" The bondholders' principal request for relief does not ask the Title III court to issue any such stay, order, or decree that itself interferes with the debtor's powers or assets. Rather, the bondholders ask the Title III court to stand aside-by lifting the stay-to allow another court under Commonwealth law to decide whether to do what the Title III court is assumed not to be able to do. Nothing in that text plainly calls for us to read a prohibition on interference by the Title III court so broadly as to encompass an action that might allow another court to decide whether to interfere with the powers or properties of the debtors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The statute's use of the word \"otherwise\" does not alter our reading. The word \"otherwise\" serves not as a\n   catchall for broadly defining\n   <em>\n    what\n   </em>\n   the Title III court cannot do. Rather, it broadly defines\n   <em>\n    where\n   </em>\n   the Title III court may not interfere: \"in the case or otherwise.\" In this manner, it makes clear that the Title III court cannot issue an order of interference, for example, when deciding disputes under its \"related to\" jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202166\">\n    48 U.S.C. \u00a7 2166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) (Title III court has original but not exclusive jurisdiction over civil proceedings \"arising in or related to cases under\" PROMESA);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Edwards\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1340034\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/300/\">\n    514 U.S. 300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 307-08 &amp; 307 n.5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6119138,1340034\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/115/1493/\">\n    115 S.Ct. 1493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1340034\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/300/\">\n    131 L.Ed.2d 403\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995) (identical provision for bankruptcy code gives bankruptcy court broad \"related to\" jurisdiction over suits between third parties that have an effect on the debtor's property).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Our interpretation of the text of Section 305 secures even firmer footing when grounded in context because Title III of PROMESA also incorporates section 362(d)(1) of the bankruptcy code.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202161\">\n    48 U.S.C. \u00a7 2161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (incorporating\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

The implication-which the debtor's brief makes express-is that perhaps the Title III court would lift the stay to allow another court to provide some other type of protection of collateral. But neither the Title III court nor the debtor points to any toehold in the language of Section 305 that would accommodate a distinction allowing the Title III court to lift the stay to allow another court to interfere with the debtor's property sometimes but not others. Either Section 305 only bars the Title III court itself from\n   interfering, or it bars that court also from lifting the stay to allow another court to do that which it cannot do. And it is only the latter, broader possibility that creates a situation in which the creditor is deprived of any means of protecting its property interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Title III court also pointed out that Section 305 would not bar section 362(d) relief when the Oversight Board consents to the requested relief. But the principal aim of section 362(d)(1) is to protect the creditor when protection is needed, which is customarily when the debtor is not obliging. In short, saying that a creditor can get relief from the stay when the debtor's representative consents effectively wipes out section 362(d)(1) precisely when it is most likely needed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We also find no inconsistency between the apparent purpose served by Section 305 and a reading of that section as only barring the Title III court itself from directly interfering with the debtor's powers or property. Like the Title III court, we read Section 305 as respectful and protective of the status of the Commonwealth and its instrumentalities as governments, much like section 904 of the municipal bankruptcy code respects and protects the autonomy of states and their political subdivisions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20904\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 904\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . When a bankruptcy or Title III court acts directly, it impinges on that autonomy. But when it merely stands aside by lifting the automatic stay, it allows the processes of state or territorial law to operate in normal course as if there were no bankruptcy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Finally, the limited case law on this subject provides no holdings or reasoning that call for a contrary interpretation of Section 305. Other courts have had occasion to pass on the plain meaning of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20904\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 904\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , but only in the context of considering the bankruptcy court's ability to interfere directly with the powers, property, and revenues of the debtor. In Detroit's recent bankruptcy case, the Sixth Circuit held that the \"plain language [of section 904 ] expressly prohibits the bankruptcy court from\" ordering the city's water department to restore service or institute a water affordability plan for residents.\n   <em>\n    Lyda\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    City of Detroit\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    In re City of Detroit)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175022\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/841/684/#p696\">\n    841 F.3d 684\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 696 (6th Cir. 2016). Likewise, in municipal bankruptcy proceedings for the city of Stockton, California, the bankruptcy court determined that section 904 prevented it from ordering the city to continue paying for the health benefits of retired city employees, reasoning that section 904 is a like a \"clean-up hitter in baseball\" and limits the court's authority \"absolute[ly]\" when applicable.\n   <em>\n    In re City of Stockton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6052853\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/478/8/#p22\">\n    478 B.R. at 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Though these interpretations express a broad view of what the bankruptcy court in a municipal bankruptcy may not itself do without the debtor's consent, they make no effort to address whether and to what extent the bankruptcy court may lift the stay to allow another court to do what the bankruptcy court cannot do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   For these reasons, we hold that Section 305 does not prohibit as a matter of course the Title III court from lifting the stay when the facts establish a creditor's entitlement to the appointment of a receiver in a different court in order to protect a creditor's collateral should that protection otherwise be necessary and appropriate. Although we share the Title III court's concerns about the deleterious impact that a robust receivership outside the Title III court's control might have on the efforts of the Title III court to consolidate and adjust the debtor's affairs, those concerns are best addressed in deciding whether, precisely to what extent, and for what purpose relief from the automatic stay might be granted. In other words, it might be possible to grant tailored relief for the\n   creditor to seek a receivership provided that the receiver only take specific steps necessary to protect the creditor's collateral. Further, concerns about moving the locus of the debtor's protections outside the Title III court are greatly ameliorated by the fact that the Oversight Board itself can always, through consent, opt for a regime held more tightly within the federal forum's direct control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   We turn next to the Title III court's holding that the exclusive jurisdiction provision contained in PROMESA section 306(b),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202166\">\n    48 U.S.C. \u00a7 2166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), operates to prohibit a court from entering an order to lift the stay upon a determination of inadequate protection if the relief sought is the appointment of a receiver. Unlike Section 305, Section 306's exclusive jurisdiction over property rule is not a provision specially crafted for municipal or territorial bankruptcies. Rather, it is the general rule for bankruptcies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e). In short, Section 306(b) provides that bankruptcy courts acquire exclusive jurisdiction over a debtor's property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   This grant of exclusive jurisdiction has to our knowledge never limited the bankruptcy court's power to allow others to act on the debtor's property with the permission of the bankruptcy court. For example, bankruptcy courts routinely grant leave to allow a creditor to sell a debtor's property without threat to the exclusive jurisdiction rule.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Catalano\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Comm'r of Internal Revenue\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9398765,9396702\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/279/682/\">\n    279 F.3d 682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 687 (9th Cir. 2002) (order lifting stay to permit bank to foreclose on residential property did not extinguish the estate's interest in the property or constitute abandonment of the property).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Allowing the Title III court to permit or enlist others to take action with the court's permission enhances rather than limits the control given to the Title III court by Section 306.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Ridgemont Apartment Assocs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6114805\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/105/738/#p741\">\n    105 B.R. 738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 741 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1989) (lifting stay for creditor to obtain a receiver to collect some income from debtor's rental property did not cede exclusive jurisdiction over the debtor's property, as Congress gave \"considerable flexibility\" to bankruptcy courts to protect both creditors and debtors). Moreover, were we to read Section 306 as precluding the Title III court from allowing a Commonwealth court to protect a creditor's collateral from actions of the debtor, we would create the same problem that our reading of Section 305 sought to avoid: The creditor would have no forum that could provide any protection. Section 306 is better understood as a housekeeping provision keeping the bankruptcy process ultimately under the prerogative of the Title III court. Even when the Title III court lifts the stay, that prerogative remains. Thus, we conclude that Section 306(b) does not prevent a Title III court from, after a determination of \"cause,\" lifting the stay to allow a creditor to seek the appointment of a receiver in another court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Title III court also included a brief section in its order stating, in the alternative, that it would deny the requested relief from the automatic stay even if it had the power to do otherwise. In so stating, it identified the impediments that a receiver appointed outside the adjustment proceeding would pose to the successful conclusion of that proceeding. The Title III court, however, undertook no assessment of the extent to which any collateral of the bondholders might be irreversibly harmed in the interim, or whether PREPA could demonstrate that it was adequately protecting that interest, factors a court would ordinarily examine and weigh.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United Sav.

It is true that the bondholders took the position that their motion could be decided \"on the basis of law and limited undisputed facts.\" But one of the predicate legal issues was whether and to what extent the bondholders possessed property interests. The Title III court found it unnecessary to decide that issue.
