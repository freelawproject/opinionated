Rangel concedes that she was subject to a state class-action settlement that released all claims arising from the allegations on which her FLSA action is predicated. She nonetheless contends that the FLSA action is excepted from the ordinary operation of res judicata. California law is to the contrary.

In early 2014, three PLS workers (not including Rangel) filed suit against PLS and a related company, alleging violations of several wage-and-hour and wage statement provisions of the California Labor Code. In December 2014, the parties reached a tentative settlement. Around the same time, presumably in furtherance of that settlement, the three PLS workers filed a consolidated class-action complaint spelling out their claims and the subclasses for which relief was sought. Specifically, the workers brought claims for failure to provide meal periods, failure to provide rest breaks, failure to pay overtime, failure to pay minimum wage, failure to pay out accrued vacation, failure to make timely wage payments on termination, and failure to provide itemized wage statements. The consolidated complaint also included a generic claim for unfair or unlawful business practices under California's Unfair Competition Law,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2017200\">\n    Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code \u00a7\u00a7 17200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -10. The complaint did not bring any federal claims and made no mention of the FLSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The parties reached a final settlement in April 2015. This settlement - the so-called\n   <em>\n    Dieguez\n   </em>\n   settlement - covered \"all Class Members who do not timely send a ... valid Opt-Out Request.\" The\n   <em>\n    Dieguez\n   </em>\n   settlement defined the class members as \"all hourly paid or non-exempt employees who\n   worked at a Defendant store within the state of California\" between January 6, 2010 and April 10, 2015. The settlement included a broad release provision, which encompassed\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   all claims that were or could have been pled based on the factual allegations in the Complaint ... while in a Covered Position and during the Class Period, including without limitations claims for unpaid wages and overtime, untimely final paychecks, record-keeping violations, itemized wage statements, meal and rest period wages and premiums, unpaid and/or untimely vacation wages, and restitution and penalties under the Private Attorneys General Act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The language of the\n   <em>\n    Dieguez\n   </em>\n   settlement made clear that it was \"made in compromise of disputed claims\" and \"for the sole purpose of settling\" the class action. PLS reiterated in the settlement that it \"den[ied] all claims as to liability, damages, penalties, interest, fees, restitution, injunctive relief and all other forms of relief as well as the class allegations asserted.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Superior Court certified the class for settlement purposes and granted preliminary approval of the settlement in June 2015. The Superior Court also approved notice to class members, which included information on opting out of the settlement. After a fairness hearing, the Court granted final approval under California Code of Civil Procedure section 382, California's counterpart to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, and entered judgment. The judgment stated that \"Class Members shall take nothing from Defendants ... except as expressly set forth in the Joint Stipulation of Settlement and Release.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In August 2016, Pearl Rangel, a PLS worker covered by the\n   <em>\n    Dieguez\n   </em>\n   settlement, brought a putative collective action under the FLSA in the Central District of California. Rangel brought claims for violations of the FLSA's minimum wage provision,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20206\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), and overtime provision,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20207\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and proposed a separate FLSA collective for each.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Rangel, PLS \"instituted a policy and practice against its employees wherein the minimum wage was not paid in accordance with [f]ederal law.\" PLS allegedly also required its workers to \"work[ ] extra hours on the graveyard shift, exceeding 40 hours in a week,\" but without \"properly pa[ying] for ... overtime hours.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   PLS promptly moved to dismiss on res judicata grounds. PLS argued that the\n   <em>\n    Dieguez\n   </em>\n   settlement resulted in a final judgment in state court on the merits of Rangel's minimum wage and overtime claims. PLS also argued that the\n   <em>\n    Dieguez\n   </em>\n   settlement, which expressly released all claims that could have been brought based on the same factual predicate, functioned as a waiver coextensive with the scope of res judicata.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In opposition to PLS's motion to dismiss, Rangel took the position that her FLSA claims could not have been released in the\n   <em>\n    Dieguez\n   </em>\n   settlement because the settlement was the product of an opt-out class asserting only state law labor claims. FLSA collective actions, unlike Rule 23(b)(3) class actions and their state law analogues, are strictly\n   <em>\n    opt-in\n   </em>\n   actions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20216\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Workers cannot become plaintiffs to a collective action unless\n   they first file a written consent with the court expressly joining the litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20216\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   According to Rangel, this unique requirement of the FLSA prevented the opt-out class settlement from releasing FLSA claims, and thus prevented the state court's judgment from having any preclusive effect with respect to those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Applying federal preclusion law, the district court sided with PLS. The district court found the elements of res judicata met, and noted that class settlements, in the interest of finality, routinely release related claims that were not pled in the operative complaint. The district court dismissed the action with prejudice, and Rangel filed a timely appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In California, \"[r]es judicata applies if (1) the decision in the prior proceeding [was] final and on the merits; (2) the present proceeding is on the same cause of action as the prior proceeding; and (3) the parties in the present proceeding or parties in privity with them were parties to the prior proceeding.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Fed'n of Hillside &amp; Canyon Ass'ns v.

That a settlement may not specifically resolve liability as to all released claims is immaterial.

Rangel suggests that her FLSA claims could not have been pled in the\n   original state action because that action was opt-out only, and therefore inconsistent with the opt-in mechanism used for FLSA claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20216\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).

Rangel does not disagree on this point, but instead argues a different one: Her FLSA claims must be distinguished from the California Labor Code claims released in\n   <em>\n    Dieguez\n   </em>\n   because the FLSA claims could not have been litigated through an opt-out class. Rangel is not wrong in her premise; the collective action and opt-out class mechanisms do differ.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McElmurry v. U.S. Bank Nat. Ass'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3564369\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/495/1136/#p1139\">\n    495 F.3d 1136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1139 (9th Cir. 2007).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   But she is wrong about the import of that distinction for res judicata purposes. The mechanism of litigation has no impact on the California primary rights analysis. The same injuries to the same rights are at issue in both cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    C\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Finally, it is beyond dispute that Rangel was a party to\n   <em>\n    Dieguez\n   </em>\n   , because she did not opt out. She was therefore a party to the settlement and bound by the resulting judgment. As in\n   <em>\n    Richardson v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.\n   </em>\n   , where the Fifth Circuit applied California law in very similar circumstances, the plaintiff \"became part[y] to the [opt-out] settlement because [she] did not opt out,\" and thus \"became bound by the settlement terms, including the release of [her] FLSA claims.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175735\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/839/442/#p451\">\n    839 F.3d 442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 451-52 (5th Cir. 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Rangel notes, correctly, that because she never opted\n   <em>\n    into Dieguez\n   </em>\n   , she would not have been a party to the action if it were brought as an FLSA collective action,\n   and so she would not have been bound by any resulting settlement. She objects to the notion that a plaintiff can pretermit the FLSA's statutorily mandated opt-in requirement by first bringing state law labor claims in an opt-out class action, then reaching a settlement that extends to the FLSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   But the question presently before us is not the wisdom of the state court proceeding as it did. Rangel discusses in her res judicata argument, for example, whether allowing an opt-out settlement to release opt-in FLSA claims was proper,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   or whether the notice given to class members regarding the waiver contained in the settlement was sufficiently specific.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Cotter v.
