The Robbery\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At roughly 9:00 AM on November 9, 2011, Ronneld Johnson and Jonathan King twice drove by a house in the area of 111th and Anzac or Grape Streets in Southeast Los Angeles. Two men were doing landscaping work at the house. Johnson and King then pulled into an alley next to the house, exited the car, and approached the other men. Johnson pointed a semiautomatic gun at the faces of the victims, first at one, and then he hopped a small fence to point the gun at the other. Johnson and King took their money, a cell phone, and a gold chain. During the robbery, either Johnson or King said, \"Hurry up cuz,\" which was either directed at the other defendant or at one of the victims. Johnson and King then got back in the car and left.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In December 2011, the State charged both Johnson and King with two counts of robbery each, including gang and gun enhancement allegations. In March 2012, a jury convicted Johnson and King and found the gang and gun enhancements to be true.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    B. The Gang Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The prosecution called an expert witness, Officer Jose Carias, to testify about the nature of criminal street gangs. For example, Officer Carias explained that gang members sometimes commit crimes so that other members will \"respect\" them, and he testified that gangs often encourage or require their members to \"put in work\"-meaning commit crimes-in order to ensure the gang is respected and feared by others in the community, elevating the status of the gang and discouraging witnesses from reporting information to the police. He said that \"cuz\" is a term typically used by Crip gangs, and is not a term typically used by members of other gangs, like Bloods or Hispanic gangs. He also testified that it is not uncommon for members of different gangs to commit crimes together after forming ties through family, school, or juvenile detention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   King was an admitted member of a gang, the Project Watts Crips. He had numerous tattoos indicating membership in that gang, including some on his face and hands. Johnson had self-identified as a member of the 58th Street Neighborhood Crips in 2006, but the tattoos on his body, including his hands, suggest he was a member of a different gang, the East Coast Crips. Robbery is one of the primary activities of the Project Watts Crips. The robbery occurred within the area the Project Watts Crips claims as its territory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The territory of the East Coast Crips is roughly four or five miles away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After a lengthy hypothetical scenario corresponding to the facts of Johnson and King's case, the gang expert opined that the individuals \"committed a crime together in concert and thus in association with another gang member,\" and he concluded that the crime primarily benefited the Project Watts Crips. The expert relied on the following factors: that both perpetrators were members of gangs, they committed the crime within Project Watts Crips territory, they used the word \"cuz,\" they drove by the victims multiple times indicating a level of sophistication, they seemed comfortable because they took the time to jump a fence and rob a second person, and the crime occurred in broad daylight, without any attempt to hide their identities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    C. The Post-Trial Proceedings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On April 4, 2012, the trial court sentenced Johnson to an aggregate term of imprisonment of twenty-eight years, eight months. The sentence was based on the robbery, the gang and gun enhancements, and a prior strike from a juvenile conviction, all to run consecutively. The sentencing court also found Johnson in violation of probation in another case, and sentenced him to an additional consecutive 16-month term of imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On October 4, 2012, Johnson filed a direct appeal. The California Court of Appeal denied his appeal on May 15, 2013. Johnson sought review from the California Supreme Court, but it denied review without substantive comment on July 24, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On January 6, 2014, Johnson filed a state habeas petition. The California Court of Appeal denied the petition on January 23, 2014. On February 18, 2014, Johnson filed a habeas petition in the California Supreme Court. It denied Johnson's petition on May 14, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On June 20, 2014, Johnson filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. The district court denied Johnson's habeas petition on June 8, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    The Sufficiency of the Evidence for the Gang Enhancement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    A.

Johnson does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence regarding the specific intent prong.

Instead, the gang expert testified that: the Project Watts Crips' \"primary rivals\" included three other Crips gangs; he disagreed with the proposition that \"all Crip gangs or sets get along with other Crip sets\"; and he agreed that, \"even though they've adopted the same color, if you will, or the same title, Crips, it's been [his] experience that, even within that larger group, there's going to be some rivalry and infighting.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Because the defendants were in different gangs, and there was no evidence that the different gangs associated with one another, no rational jury could have found that King and Johnson acted in association with a single gang.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Court of Appeal held, in the alternative, that there was sufficient evidence under\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   that Johnson committed the robberies \"for the benefit of\" King's gang.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20186.22\">\n    Cal.

Unlike the majority, I would hold this conclusion as well objectively unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Under California law, a crime can benefit a gang if it \"enhanc[es]\" the gang's \"reputation for viciousness.\"\n   <em>\n    Albillar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3915029\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/51/47/\">\n    51 Cal. 4th at 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=119%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20415\">\n    119 Cal.Rptr.3d 415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=244%20P.3d%201062\">\n    244 P.3d 1062\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But, here, even the evidence that King committed the robberies to benefit his own gang's reputation was flimsy. The gang expert opined that the robberies benefitted the Project Watts Crips in two ways: by \"creat[ing] a sense of fear and intimidation with the community,\" thereby \"prevent[ing] citizens from coming forward and reporting crimes like this\"; and by \"bestow[ing] a certain amount of respect on\" and \"elevat[ing] the status of the gang itself.\" The expert rested his conclusion exclusively on evidence that King was a member of the Project Watts Crips, and that robberies were committed with \"comfort\" in the territory of the Project Watts Crips \"in broad daylight,\" while one of the defendants used the word \"cuz,\" a word the expert represented as particular to \"Crip gang members.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   There is an obvious gap between the expert's opinion and the evidence introduced to support it: \"[T]here was no evidence that ... any of the ... persons who witnessed the crime knew that [Project Watts Crips] gang members or affiliates were involved. Therefore, the crime could not have enhanced respect for the gang members or intimidated others in their community ....\"\n   <em>\n    In re Daniel C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4233355\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/195/1350/#p1363\">\n    195 Cal.

King or Johnson used a word generically associated with\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   Crips gang subsets, including the Project Watts Crips' rivals. While King had Project Watts Crips-related tattoos, neither victim saw them. Even if the victims\n   <em>\n    had\n   </em>\n   seen King's tattoos, there was no evidence that they would have been able to associate them with the Project Watts Crips gang. The tattoos do not obviously mean anything to a layperson-they contain the words \"Funny\" and \"Side,\" the letters \"P,\" \"J,\" and \"RIP,\" and abstract symbols.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   And the fact\n   that the robbery was committed in Project Watts Crips territory cannot, on its own, support a link between the robbery and the gang's reputation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People v. Ramon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3974346\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/175/843/#p851\">\n    175 Cal.

On that logic,\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   robbery committed in the territory, even if it is unconnected to a gang or connected to a rival Crips gang, enhances the Project Watts Crips' reputation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The majority places great weight on the \"outward manifestations of gang involvement\" displayed by both King and Johnson. Maj. Opn. at 1058. This reasoning ignores the fact that such signs did not, and could not, point to affiliation with the Project Watts Crips in particular, and thus could not benefit\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   gang by enhancing its reputation. To the extent Johnson displayed signs of gang membership generally, neither California law, nor due process, permits Johnson to be subject to a sentence enhancement for benefitting\n   <em>\n    a particular gang\n   </em>\n   by enhancing its reputation because he looked like and sounded like someone who was in\n   <em>\n    any gang\n   </em>\n   . A general aura of \"gangness\"-even if broken down in a numbered list-cannot establish a particular benefit to a particular gang.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The Court of Appeal, and today's opinion, sidestep the fundamental question of how, exactly, the Project Watts Crips' reputation in particular could have been affected by the crime when there was no evidence indicating that onlookers could connect the Project Watts Crips to it. The majority appears persuaded by the Court of Appeal's concern that if it held \"self-identification during the commission of a crime [to be] an essential requirement,\" \"such a requirement would allow gang members to get around the gang enhancement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   To the degree this concern constitutes a factual finding, it is flatly unreasonable. Defendants need not self-identify as gang members to commit a crime for the benefit of a gang; they could commit a crime to fund a gang, or to further its other illegal activities, while maintaining steadfast secrecy.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    People v. Gonzales\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053417\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/232/1449/#p1466\">\n    232 Cal.

But if the prosecutor's theory is that the defendants intended to benefit a gang by enhancing its reputation for violence, surely there must be\n   <em>\n    some way\n   </em>\n   for the violent crime's victims or onlookers to connect the particular defendant's actions to that gang, either through self-identification or some other means. If the onlookers cannot make that connection, and there is no non-reputational benefit to the gang, due process, as well as California law, require that defendants not receive a gang enhancement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Even if the evidence barely supported King's sentence enhancement, there was just no evidence introduced as to why Johnson, a member of one gang, would seek to promote the reputation of a different gang.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The gang expert suggested that it was \"not uncommon\" for members of different gangs to commit crimes together because they \"form[ ] ties\" at school, through family, or at juvenile hall. In other words, he opined that members of different gangs commit crimes together because they know each other. That is not an opinion or evidence that they commit crimes together because they seek to benefit one another's gangs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The majority's result implies that Johnson's motives are of no moment-that the\n   government need not prove that Johnson committed his crime for the benefit of King's gang so long as King did so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Maj. Opn. at 1058. That is incorrect. The statute \"does not punish a defendant for the actions of associates.\"\n   <em>\n    People v.
