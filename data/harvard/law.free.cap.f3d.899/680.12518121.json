SMITH, Circuit Judge\n   After the Surface Transportation Board (the STB) \"railbanked\" the portions of the Eastside Rail Corridor (the Corridor) adjacent to or bisecting Plaintiffs-Appellants' residential lots, pursuant to the National Trails System Act Amendments of 1983 (the Trails Act),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201247\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs-Appellants filed suit in federal court seeking a declaration of their property rights in the Corridor. Plaintiffs-Appellants disputed the nature and scope of Defendant-Appellee King County's railroad easement, and the Corridor's width. In response, King County filed counterclaims asking the court to (1) declare that the Trails Act preserved the full scope of the original railroad easement, and that the Corridor's width is 100 feet, and (2) quiet title to the Corridor in King County. Both sides moved for summary judgment. The district court denied summary judgment to Plaintiffs-Appellants, dismissed their claims with prejudice, and granted summary judgment to, and quieted title to the Corridor in, King County. Plaintiffs-Appellants timely appealed.

The Origins of the Corridor &amp; Plaintiffs-Appellants' Property Interests\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 1887, the Seattle, Lake Shore &amp; Eastern Railway Company (SLS&amp;E), which later became part of BNSF Railway Company (BNSF, and together with SLS&amp;E, the Railroad), began to construct the Corridor along the eastern shoreline of Lake Sammamish. The SLS&amp;E obtained the land that it needed for the Corridor through various means, which gave the SLS&amp;E a collection of railroad easements and fee simple properties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Beres v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5759177\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/fed-cl/104/408/#p412\">\n    104 Fed.Cl. 408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 412 (2012) (hereinafter\n   <em>\n    Beres III\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   All Plaintiffs-Appellants are landowners whose properties abut the Corridor's boundaries (the precise location of which the parties dispute). Plaintiff-Appellant the Thomas E. Hornish and Suzanne J. Hornish Joint Living Trust (Plaintiff-Appellant Hornish) owns property adjacent to a portion of the Corridor that SLS&amp;E obtained through a May 9, 1887 quitclaim deed executed by homesteader William Hilchkanum and his wife. Hilchkanum later sold the remainder of his property, and some part of that remainder interest is now owned by Plaintiff-Appellant Hornish.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs-Appellants Tracy and Barbara Neighbors, Arul Menezes and Lucretia Vanderwende, Lake Sammamish 4257 LLC, Herbert and Elynne Moore, and Eugene and Elizabeth Morel (the Non-Hornish Plaintiffs-Appellants) own properties that are adjacent to other portions of the Corridor. The SLS&amp;E completed construction of the Corridor's tracks in March 1888, and the Northern Pacific Railroad conveyed its property to Samuel Middleton the following year. The Non-Hornish Plaintiffs-Appellants' chains of title all originate with Middleton.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The Railbanking Process\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In 1997, BNSF conveyed all of its ownership interests in the Corridor to The Land Conservancy of Seattle and King County (TLC) through a recorded quitclaim deed. On June 11, 1997, TLC initiated the \"railbanking\" process by petitioning the STB for an exemption to allow TLC's abandonment of the Corridor for active rail service.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Land Conservancy of Seattle &amp; King Cty.-Abandonment Exemption-in King Cty., WA\n   </em>\n   , No. AB-508X,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1997%20WL%20359085\">\n    1997 WL 359085\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (S.T.B. June 23, 1997). As part of its petition, TLC provided\n   King County's Statement of Willingness to Assume Financial Responsibility as the interim trail sponsor under the Trails Act.\n   <em>\n    Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co.-Abandonment Exemption-in King Cty., Wa,\n   </em>\n   No. AB-6 (Sub-No. 380X),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1998%20WL%20638432\">\n    1998 WL 638432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1, (S.T.B. Sept. 16, 1998). The STB granted the exemption on May 13, 1998. Then, in September of 1998, the STB issued a Notice of Interim Trail Use (NITU) to facilitate railbanking and interim trail use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Subsequently, TLC and King County entered into an agreement formally designating King County as the trail sponsor. The agreement also conveyed to King County all of TLC's ownership interests in the Corridor through a recorded quitclaim deed, which described the precise property that was being conveyed. King County then constructed a soft-surface hiking and biking trail in the Corridor. More recently, King County has prepared to construct a paved trail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Prior Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On February 25, 2015, several of Plaintiffs-Appellants, among others, filed suit to obtain a declaration of their rights with regard to the Corridor and to quiet their title in the Corridor. King County moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of standing, arguing that the Plaintiffs-Appellants had failed to demonstrate that they had any ownership interest in the Corridor. While this motion was pending, the Plaintiffs-Appellants sought leave to file a proposed amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On June 5, 2015, the district court granted King County's motion to dismiss, and denied leave to file the proposed amended complaint. The court determined that amendment would be futile because the proposed amended complaint did not remedy the standing defects of the original complaint. However, the court gave the Plaintiffs-Appellants leave to file a different amended complaint that would address the standing problem. Plaintiffs-Appellants did so, filing the Amended Complaint (AC). King County then answered and brought quiet title and declaratory judgment counterclaims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Both sides then filed motions for summary judgment. On April 20, 2016, the district court denied Plaintiffs-Appellants' summary judgment motion, dismissed Plaintiffs-Appellants' claims with prejudice, and granted summary judgment to King County with regard to its declaratory judgment and quiet title counterclaims. Plaintiffs-Appellants timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   We review the district court's grant of summary judgment\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    King County v.

The resolution of this dispute turns on an interpretation of the Trails Act, because deciding the scope of King County's rights pursuant to the Quit Claim Deed will require this court to determine whether the Trails Act creates, supplements, or replaces any previously existing railroad easement.

To understand why, it is helpful to consider the Federal Circuit's rails-to-trails takings jurisprudence. In the years since the Trails Act's enactment, the Court of Federal Claims has been inundated with Tucker Act claims alleging that the Trails Act's preclusion of state law caused a taking of their property interests, for which the landowners were entitled to just compensation under the Fifth Amendment. To decide these cases, that court has been required to determine what property interests were taken when each corridor was railbanked; only once the court determined\n    <em>\n     what\n    </em>\n    was taken could it determine\n    <em>\n     how much\n    </em>\n    (if any) compensation was due.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Consistently, the Federal Circuit has explained that \"a Fifth Amendment taking occurs when, pursuant to the Trails Act, state law reversionary interests are effectively eliminated in connection with a conversion of a railroad right-of-way to trail use.\"\n    <em>\n     Caldwell\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9144560,793504\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/391/1226/\">\n     391 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    1228 (citing\n    <em>\n     Preseault v.

As noted, the parties agree that because no original deeds for the portions of the Corridor adjacent to which the Non-Hornish Plaintiffs-Appellants own land were put into evidence, the railroad easement was a prescriptive easement with regard to those portions of the Corridor.

Thus, a prescriptive\n    <em>\n     railroad\n    </em>\n    easement exists \"to the extent necessary\" to operate a railroad. Accordingly, Washington common law dictates that \"a change in use from 'rails to trails' \" will \"constitute[ ] abandonment\" of such easement.\n    <em>\n     Lawson v.

The Easement's Width Adjacent to the Non-Hornish Plaintiffs-Appellants' Properties Is 100 Feet\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    Plaintiffs-Appellants claim that the railroad \"utilized a width of approximately 12 feet for their actual railroad operations for over 100 years from 1888 until 1998.\" Defendants-Appellees dispute this, arguing that the Corridor is 100 feet wide, except where it is fifty feet wide next to the Morel Plaintiffs-Appellants' property and is approximately seventy-five feet wide next to the Menezes and Vanderwende Plaintiffs-Appellants' properties. Defendants-Appellees also observe that \"[a]t various times in this litigation, Appellants have claimed the Railroad actually needed a width 'between 12 feet and 20 feet,' 'no greater than 18 feet,' fourteen feet, ('7 feet from center line' on both sides 'of the tracks'), and 'approximately 12 feet.' \"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    In support of their current 12-foot-width argument, Plaintiffs-Appellants primarily rely on the declaration of Eugene and Elizabeth Morel (the Morel Declaration). The Morels assert that at their property, which is \"located along\" and \"bisected\" by a portion of the Corridor, the Corridor has a width of 10 feet. The original house on the property was built in the 1920s and '30s, and \"was more than 50% inside the [right-of-way] width claimed by King County.\" The Morels claim that they have paid taxes on the parts of the home and property that fall within the land claimed by King County. An access driveway \"was and is still today\" within that right-of-way. The Morels improved an area on the east side of the track, \"about 7 feet from [the] center line of the tracks,\" which they used to park cars. To access their house, they would cross the tracks and walk down stairs to it. The Morels also improved the land by adding \"privacy trees,\" other landscaping, irrigation, patios, and child swing sets. No rail operator ever asked the Morels to stop or limit these uses of the land.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    Then, in 1996, the Morels obtained a quitclaim deed from BNSF granting them \"clear title to the outside 25 feet on both the east and west sides of the [right-of-way].\" This allowed the Morels to replace the original house with a new house, the construction of which finished in 2001. The Morels claim that \"driveways, walkways, landscaping and other improvements were installed during construction\" that are \"clearly on land that King County claims they own via prescriptive easement.\" The Morels also assert that there is an \"8 foot diameter boulder, estimated to weigh about 6 tons\" that sits on the lot owned by the Neighbors Plaintiffs-Appellants. One of the Morels played on the rock as a child, in the 1950s. The Morels assert that this rock proves the right-of-way is no more than 12 feet in width because the \"rock is just over 6 feet from the centerline of the [right-of-way] corridor\" and the railroad has never removed it.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    Plaintiffs-Appellants also rely on the declaration of John Rall (the Rall Declaration), a private consultant with a bachelor's degree in civil engineering and a \"Professional Land Surveying License\" from the\n    state of Georgia. Rall indicates that he has reviewed the chains of title relating to the Plaintiffs-Appellants' chains of title, and determined that they evidence that\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n    [1] [n]o deed in the chains of title expressly reserved the fee portion underlying the Railroad Right-of-way unto any predecessor grantor; [2] [e]ach grantor ... granted all interest that they owned, including their interest in the railroad right-of-way; ... and [3] [e]ach of the current [Plaintiffs-Appellants] acquired their interests in the former railroad right-of-way from their predecessor in interests and are the current owners of the underlying fee in the current easement held by King County for hiking and biking purposes with the potential future reactivation of a railroad.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    In support of their claim that the Corridor has a 100-foot width, Defendants-Appellees introduced \"[o]fficial agency records from the Interstate Commerce Commission ('ICC'), known as the 1917 Val Maps.\" The Val Maps were drawn pursuant to the 1913 Valuation Act, which required the ICC \"to make an inventory which shall list the property of every common carrier subject to the provisions of this Act in detail, and show the value thereof as hereinafter provided, and shall classify the physical property, as nearly as practicable.\" Pub. L. No. 62-400, \u00a7 19(a),\n    <extracted-citation index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=37%20Stat.%20701\">\n     37 Stat. 701\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 701 (1913) (former\n    <extracted-citation index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010781\">\n     49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10781\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ). During this inventory, engineers devised the Val Maps to document \"the land owned by a railroad and how it was acquired, the land adjacent to railroad property, and the financial history of the railroad from its earliest operations to the date of basic valuation.\" Defendants-Appellees contend that the maps prove that the width of the relevant portions of the Corridor has long been 100 feet. First, the Maps indicate that the Railroad originally acquired 4.71 acres of land in the 2,050-foot-long segment adjacent to the Neighbors, Morel, and Menezes and Vanderwende Plaintiffs-Appellants' properties, Parcel 6, by way of adverse possession. Second, the Maps indicate that the segment adjacent to the Lake Sammamish 4257 LLC and the Moore Plaintiffs-Appellants' property, Parcel 13, is 3.29 acres and 1,434.4 feet long. Defendants-Appellees claim these measurements confirm the Corridor's 100-foot width.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    Defendants-Appellees have also introduced certain of the King County Assessor's records. These records document a change in \"the area owned by Mr. Middleton in 1891 and later years,\" which Defendants-Appellees argue \"confirms the creation of a one hundred feet Corridor in Lot 2 of Section 7, Township 24 North, Range Six East of the Willamette Meridian, which eventually became the source of the parcels owned by the Neighbors, Morel, and Menezes and Vanderwende [Plaintiffs-Appellants].\" Defendants-Appellees claim that \"[t]he Assessor Rolls confirm the Railroad also acquired a one hundred foot Corridor in Lot 3 of Section 17, which became the source of the property owned by Lake Sammamish 4257 LLC and the Moore [Plaintiffs-Appellants].\" Additionally, the King County Assessor's maps exclude the one hundred foot Corridor from Appellants' properties, consistent with tax assessments dating back to 1895. Notably, Plaintiffs-Appellants offered no proof that they have ever paid property taxes within the Corridor.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    Additionally, Defendants-Appellees argue that the actions of Plaintiffs-Appellants and their predecessors-in-interest comport with an understanding of the 100-foot width. For example, the Morel Plaintiffs-Appellants acquired their property from Eugene Morel's parents, who acknowledged\n    that the Corridor was one hundred feet wide when they purchased a \"portion of [BNSF's] 100.0 foot wide Snoqualmie Branch Line right of way\" from the Railroad on May 23, 1996, and left the railroad with the 50 feet it still has today. And the predecessor of the Menezes and Vanderwende Plaintiffs-Appellants, Lynn Goldsmith, filed an adverse possession lawsuit against the Railroad, disputing the Railroad's \"claim[ ] that the right of way is 100 ft. in width - 50 ft. on each side of its centerline.\" Goldsmith settled her claims in exchange for a narrow strip of land from BNSF, implicitly acknowledging that the remainder of the Corridor-roughly seventy-five feet wide-belonged to BNSF (and now King County). Such attempts to buy land are inconsistent with a belief in one's right of possession.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     City of Port Townsend v.

For example, Mike Nuorala, a longtime engineer for BNSF, stated in his declaration that the full width of the right of way is necessary as a \"safety buffer to ensure minimum setbacks between freight trains and residential development, to prevent nearby construction and development activities that could undermine the stability of the steep slopes above and below the tracks, and to provide access for maintenance activities, such as tie replacement, that require significant clearance on one or both sides of the track.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    Lining this evidence up alongside Plaintiffs-Appellants', it is clear that most of Defendants-Appellees' evidence is unrebutted. The Rall Declaration is inadmissible, because it offers only Rall's interpretation of the relevant deeds, and \"[r]esolving doubtful questions of law is the distinct and exclusive province of the trial judge.\"\n    <em>\n     Nationwide Transp.

And, the Morel Declaration, at most, creates a genuine issue of fact regarding the\n    <em>\n     historic\n    </em>\n    width of the Corridor adjacent to only the Morels' property with its statement that the Morel family previously had a home inside the claimed Corridor. However this dispute is not material; the current width of the Corridor adjacent to the Morels' property is undisputed because of the Morel family's 1996 purchase of land from the railroad. Because Plaintiffs-Appellants have not introduced any admissible evidence to support their claimed 12-foot width, and Defendants-Appellees have introduced considerable evidence supporting their claimed 100-foot width, there is no genuine dispute of material fact with regard to the width of the Corridor.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Anderson v.

(Dkt. No. 57). Specifically, Plaintiffs-Appellants seek to add certain evidence and testimony introduced by Plaintiffs-Appellants in a similar case,\n    <em>\n     Neighbors v. King County\n    </em>\n    , which they contend contradicts Defendants-Appellees' claim that the corridor at issue here had a consistent width of 100 feet and supports Plaintiffs-Appellants' argument that the width is much less.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    Defendants-Appellees oppose this motion, (Dkt. No. 61), which they point out was not made until nearly 18 months after the district court proceedings had concluded. Defendants-Appellees contend that Plaintiffs-Appellants made the strategic decision to argue below that Defendants-Appellees' payment of taxes and fees was irrelevant, and that Plaintiffs-Appellants should now be held to that choice on appeal. Defendants-Appellees also note that the evidence Plaintiffs-Appellants seek to introduce includes declarations written by Plaintiffs-Appellants themselves, and that Plaintiffs-Appellants have offered no explanation as to why this evidence was not available at the time of the summary judgment proceedings below. Finally, Defendants-Appellees argue that the submitted materials are not the proper subject for judicial notice, and that there has been no showing of extraordinary circumstances.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    We agree with Defendants-Appellees. Plaintiffs-Appellants had a full opportunity to acquire these records during discovery, and simply failed to do so. Plaintiffs-Appellants have not offered any explanation for their failure to undertake discovery relating to King County's payment of taxes and to procure and produce their own property tax records in response to King County's discovery. Indeed, below Plaintiffs-Appellants explained only that they were not obtaining this discovery because they believed it irrelevant. It is only now, after the district court has disagreed with that belief and\n    <em>\n     credited\n    </em>\n    Defendants-Appellees' argument, that Plaintiffs-Appellants have felt compelled to act.

Barnhart\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9129679\" index=\"210\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/329/1019/#p1024\">\n     329 F.3d 1019\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1024 (9th Cir. 2003) ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    Neither of the first two exceptions could apply here. Plaintiffs-Appellants have made no argument that these documents were omitted by mistake or by accident. Rather, the record makes clear that they were omitted for a tactical reason-because Plaintiffs-Appellants had concluded they were irrelevant. Additionally, the contents of the records are not a matter of which the court can take judicial notice.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    Even if the records are filed on the public docket of the\n    <em>\n     Neighbors\n    </em>\n    case, we can take judicial notice only of the\n    <em>\n     filing\n    </em>\n    of the documents, and not of the truth of the documents' contents.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Reyn's Pasta Bella, LLC v. Visa USA, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1064008\" index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/442/741/\">\n     442 F.3d 741\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 746 n.6 (9th Cir. 2006) ;\n    <em>\n     Lee v.

However, Plaintiffs-Appellants have not explained in their moving papers or at oral argument what extraordinary circumstances prevented their timely introduction of such evidence as\n    <em>\n     their own\n    </em>\n    declarations in this case. Moreover, there seems to be nothing extraordinary about Plaintiffs-Appellants' situation. Plaintiffs-Appellants were well aware that the width of the Corridor was at issue at summary judgment, and that it was their burden to introduce evidence supporting their claim that the width was no greater than 12 feet. Plaintiffs-Appellants believed the Morel and Rall Declarations were sufficient, and declined to obtain the additional evidence that was available to them. We see no reason why now they should be freed from the consequences of that strategic decision. Plaintiffs-Appellants' motion to supplement the record is denied.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's denial of summary judgment to Plaintiffs-Appellants, dismissal of the AC, and grant of summary judgment and quiet title to King County. We also deny Plaintiffs-Appellants' motion to supplement the record.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    <strong>\n     AFFIRMED.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"3\">\n    <p id=\"p-105\">\n     Defendants-Appellees suggest that \"this is particularly true where, as in\n     <em>\n      Ray\n     </em>\n     , the Washington Supreme Court has denied review.\" However, the authority that they cite for this proposition,\n     <em>\n      Intex Plastics Sales Co. v.
