Together, the Drivers filed suit against Defendants-Appellees the City of Seattle, the Seattle Department of Finance and Administrative Services (the Department), and the Department's Director, Fred Podesta (collectively, the City), challenging the Ordinance on federal law grounds.

The Drivers\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Drivers are for-hire drivers who contract with Uber. Two of the Drivers, Clark and Lowe, also contract with Lyft. All of the Drivers, with the exception of Clark and Dunlap, are qualifying drivers under the terms of the Ordinance. The Drivers object to the Ordinance and the prospect of representation by Teamsters Local 117 (Local 117): They do not wish to become members of, or be represented by, Local 117, and they do not wish to be bound by any future agreement Local 117 may reach with Uber or Lyft.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Because the present case has proceeded in parallel with the Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America's (the Chamber) lawsuit challenging the same Ordinance, we briefly recount the procedural history of both cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   After the Ordinance took effect on January 22, 2016, the Chamber filed suit on March 3, 2016, challenging the Ordinance as preempted by the Sherman Antitrust Act and the NLRA. The district court dismissed the Chamber's action as unripe, because no entity had as yet applied for certification as a QDR.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chamber of Commerce of the U.S. v.

On March 7, 2017, Local 117 notified Uber, Lyft, and ten other driver coordinators that it intended to seek EDR certification for those companies. Local 117 requested the contact information of the driver coordinators' qualifying drivers pursuant to the Ordinance's disclosure provisions. In response, the Chamber quickly filed suit again on March 9, 2017, seeking a declaration that the Ordinance is unenforceable, and a preliminary injunction enjoining the City from enforcing the Ordinance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Drivers filed the present action on the heels of the Chamber's refiling. On March 10, 2017, the Drivers filed a Complaint challenging the Ordinance primarily on federal labor law and First Amendment grounds. In their Complaint, the Drivers asserted five claims: (1) that the Ordinance is preempted by NLRA section 8(e); (2) that the Ordinance is preempted by NLRA section 8(b)(4); (3) that the Ordinance is\n   preempted under a\n   <em>\n    Garmon\n   </em>\n   theory because it regulates conduct regulated by NLRA sections 8(b)(4) and 8(e), and/or preempted under a\n   <em>\n    Machinists\n   </em>\n   theory because it regulates conduct Congress intended to be left to the free play of economic forces; (4) a\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   claim that the Ordinance violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments; and (5) that the Ordinance is preempted by the Drivers' Privacy Protection Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Drivers sought a declaration that the Ordinance is unlawful, an injunction enjoining the City from enforcing the Ordinance, and damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On March 21, 2017, the City filed a motion to dismiss the Chamber's case. On April 4, 2017, before ruling on the City's motion to dismiss the Chamber's case, the district court granted the Chamber's motion for a preliminary injunction. After the district court granted the Chamber's motion for a preliminary injunction, it denied as moot the Drivers' motion for a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On April 13, 2017, the City moved to dismiss the Drivers' Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On August 1, 2017, the district court granted the City's motion to dismiss the Chamber's case.

Such an injury is neither actual nor imminent. Section 8(e), by its plain language, requires a \"contract or agreement\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   It shall be an unfair labor practice for any labor organization and any employer to enter into any contract or agreement, express or implied, whereby such employer ceases or refrains or agrees to cease or refrain from handling, using, selling, transporting or otherwise dealing in any of the products of any other employer, or to cease doing business\n   with any other person, and any contract or agreement entered into heretofore or hereafter containing such an agreement shall be to such extent unenforcible and void....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20158\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e). Here, no contract or agreement is imminent. No QDR has successfully procured the support of the majority of either Uber or Lyft's qualifying drivers. It is speculative whether Local 117, another entity, or no entity at all, will become the EDR for Uber and Lyft's drivers. With no EDR in sight to reach an agreement with either Uber or Lyft, the Drivers' assertion of a section 8(e) injury is wholly speculative. We thus reject the Drivers' second injury-in-fact theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Third, the Drivers argue that \"the Ordinance's certification process will violate the Drivers' federal right under Section 8(b)(4) not to be subject to union\n   <em>\n    campaigns\n   </em>\n   prohibited by that statute.\" NLRA section 8(b)(4) provides, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   It shall be an unfair labor practice for a labor organization or its agents ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   (ii) to threaten, coerce, or restrain any person engaged in commerce or in an industry affecting commerce, where in either case an object thereof is-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   (A) forcing or requiring any employer or self-employed person to join any labor or employer organization or to enter into any agreement which is prohibited by subsection (e);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   (B) forcing or requiring any person to cease using, selling, handling, transporting, or otherwise dealing in the products of any other producer, processor, or manufacturer, or to cease doing business with any other person, or forcing or requiring any other employer to recognize or bargain with a labor organization as the representative of his employees unless such labor organization has been certified as the representative of such employees....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20158\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 158(b)(4)(ii)(A)-(B).
