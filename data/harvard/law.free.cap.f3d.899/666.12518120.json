Plaintiffs Robert Stevens and Steven Vandel (\"the Photographers\") are professional real estate photographers who take photographs of listed properties and license them to real estate agents. The real estate agents, in turn, upload such photographs to Multiple Listing Services (\"MLS\") - computerized databases of listed properties - using Defendant CoreLogic's software.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In this action against CoreLogic, the Photographers allege that CoreLogic removed copyright management information from their photographs and distributed their photographs with the copyright management information removed, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201202\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 1202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)-(3). We affirm the grant of summary judgment in favor of CoreLogic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS BELOW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Metadata\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Stevens and Vandel are hired by real estate agents to take digital photographs of houses for sale. The Photographers retain the copyright in those photographs and license them to the agents. Like most digital photographs, at least some of Stevens' and Vandel's photographs contain metadata -\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , data about the image file itself. Metadata is not visible on the face of the image. Rather, it is either embedded in the digital file or stored outside the image file, such as in a \"sidecar\" file, and can be viewed using computer programs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Some metadata is generated automatically by cameras. The Exchangeable Image\n   File Format (\"EXIF\") is used by virtually all digital cameras to store information about the settings used to capture a digital image. EXIF information can include the make, model, and serial number of the camera taking the photograph; the shutter speed; the aperture settings; light sensitivity; the focal length of the lens; and even, in some cases, the location at which the photo was captured. Essentially, EXIF metadata provides information about when the image was taken and under what technical conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Other metadata may be added manually, either by programming the camera or by adding information after taking the picture, using photo editing software. Such metadata is often stored in IPTC format, named for the International Press Telecommunications Council, which developed metadata standards to facilitate the exchange of news. IPTC metadata can include, for example, the title of the image, a caption or description, keywords, information about the photographer, and copyright restrictions. It may be used to check copyright information, to sort images, and to provide accurate search results in an image database or search engine. A small number of fields such as Author/Creator, Copyright, and Caption/Description exist in both EXIF and IPTC formats.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Copyright law restricts the removal or alteration of copyright management information (\"CMI\") - information such as the title, the author, the copyright owner, the terms and conditions for use of the work, and other identifying information set forth in a copyright notice or conveyed in connection with the work.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201202\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 1202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) - (c). Both EXIF and IPTC metadata can contain \"copyright management information.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B. CoreLogic Software\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   CoreLogic is a California-based corporation that develops and provides software to Multiple Listing Services. Known as one of the \"Big 3\" real estate software vendors nationally, CoreLogic currently markets, or has previously marketed, several MLS software platforms, including Matrix, InnoVia, Fusion, MLXchange, Tempo 4, and Tempo 5. The Photographers allege that CoreLogic's software removed CMI metadata from their photographs, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201202\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 1202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Because image files can be very large, CoreLogic's MLS software resizes or \"downsamples\" images. Downsampling entails creating and saving a copy of an uploaded image in a smaller number of pixels and deleting the original image; the process reduces storage size, facilitates computer display, and helps images load faster on web pages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The image processing aspect of CoreLogic's software was not developed by CoreLogic entirely on its own. Like virtually all software, CoreLogic's software incorporated \"libraries\" - pre-written code that can be used by a computer program and that enables software to develop in a modular fashion. These libraries are unable to read EXIF data from image files or to write EXIF data to image files. Thus, when images are copied or resized using the code from these pre-existing libraries, metadata attached to those images is not retained.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Photographers\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed this action in May 2014. Significantly, the dispute is limited to metadata. The Photographers do not allege that CoreLogic's software removed\n   <em>\n    visible\n   </em>\n   CMI, such as digital watermarks, from their photographs, and indeed, CoreLogic's software does not detect, recognize, or remove visible CMI.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Murphy v. Millennium Radio Grp\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3749992\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/650/295/#p305\">\n    650 F.3d 295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 305 (3d Cir. 2011) (imposing liability on a defendant who cropped out the photographer's name from the \"gutter\" copyright credit before posting a photograph online).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   After receiving the Photographers' initial complaint, CoreLogic modified its software to ensure that EXIF metadata is copied and restored to images processed by CoreLogic's MLS software. These modifications were made within a few months of receiving the initial complaint, although testing and installation of the revised version on all MLSs using CoreLogic software took several more months. The Photographers contend that, even after these changes, CoreLogic software continues to remove IPTC metadata.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In addition to providing MLS software - which, again, real estate agents use to share information about properties with other agents - CoreLogic also operates the Partner InfoNet program, which allows MLSs to license their aggregated real estate listing data to mortgage lenders and servicers, in exchange for a share of the licensees' revenue. CoreLogic used photographs taken and owned by the Photographers on Partner InfoNet products.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   After the discovery deadline, but before all discovery disputes were resolved, Core Logic filed a motion for summary judgment. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of CoreLogic and denied as moot the Photographers' motion to compel the production of additional documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   After entry of judgment, CoreLogic filed a Bill of Costs, to which the Photographers objected. The district court denied the Photographers' motion to re-tax costs with respect to witness fees for CoreLogic corporate employees. This timely appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

To avoid superfluity, the mental state requirement in Section 1202(b) must have a more specific application than the universal possibility of encouraging infringement; specific allegations as to how identifiable infringements \"will\" be affected are necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   At the same time, as the statute is written in the future tense, the Photographers need not show that any specific infringement has already occurred. Also, recognizing that \"nothing is completely stable, no plan is beyond alteration,\" we have previously observed that statutes requiring knowledge that a future action \"will\" occur do not \"require knowledge in the sense of certainty as to a future act.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Todd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6052164\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/627/329/#p334\">\n    627 F.3d 329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 334 (9th Cir. 2010). Rather, knowledge in the context of such statutes signifies \"a state of mind in which the knower is familiar with a pattern of conduct\" or \"aware of an established modus operandi that will in the future cause a person to engage in\" a certain act.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6052164\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/627/329/#p334\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Applying that concept here, we hold that a plaintiff bringing a Section 1202(b) claim must make an affirmative showing, such as by demonstrating a past \"pattern of conduct\" or \"modus operandi\", that the defendant was aware or had reasonable grounds to be aware of the probable future impact of its actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Our conclusion about the import of the \"induce[d], enable[d], facilitate[d], or conceal[ed]\" prong is supported by the legislative history of Section 1202. That provision was enacted to implement obligations of parties to the WIPO Copyright Treaty (\"WCT\") and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S. Rep. No. 105-190, at 5, 9 (1998). The initial draft of the WCT provision regarding CMI provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Contracting parties shall make it unlawful for any person knowingly ... (i) to remove or alter any electronic rights management information without authority; [or] (ii) to distribute, import for distribution or communicate to the public, without authority, copies of works from which electronic rights management information has been removed or altered without authority.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   World Intellectual Property Organization [WIPO],\n   <em>\n    Basic Proposal for the Substantive Provisions of the Treaty on\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Certain Questions Concerning the Protection of Literary and\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Artistic Works to Be Considered by the Diplomatic Conference\n   </em>\n   , art. 14(1), WIPO Doc. CRNR/DC/4 (Aug. 30, 1996).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In response to requests from delegates that the provision be modified to require a connection to an infringing purpose, the provision was redrafted as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Contracting Parties shall provide adequate and effective legal remedies against any person knowingly performing any of the following acts\n   <em>\n    knowing or, with respect to civil remedies\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    having reasonable grounds to know, that it will induce, enable, facilitate or conceal an infringement of any right covered by this Treaty or the Berne Convention\n   </em>\n   : (i) to remove or alter any electronic rights management information without authority; (ii) to distribute, import for distribution, broadcast or communicate to the public, without authority, works or copies of works knowing that electronic rights management information has been removed or altered without authority.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   WIPO Copyright Treaty art. 12, Dec. 20 1996 (emphasis added). The revision thus makes clear that the \"induce, enable, facilitate or conceal\" requirement is intended to\n   limit liability in some fashion - specifically, to instances in which the defendant knows or has a reasonable basis to know that the removal or alteration of CMI or the distribution of works with CMI removed\n   <em>\n    will\n   </em>\n   aid infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   When Congress was considering the WIPO Copyright Treaties Implementation Act - a part of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (\"DMCA\") that included the new Section 1202 - the Register of Copyrights emphasized that Section 1202 's provisions \"do not apply to those who act innocently. ... Liability for the removal or alteration of information requires the actor to know or have reason to know that his acts 'will induce, enable, facilitate or conceal' infringement.\"\n   <em>\n    WIPO Copyright Treaties Implementation Act, and Online Copyright Liability Limitation Act: Hearing Before the H. Subcomm. on Courts and Intellectual Property of the H. Comm. on the Judiciary\n   </em>\n   , 105th Cong. 51 (1997) (statement of Marybeth Peters, Register of Copyrights, Copyright Office of the United States).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In short, to satisfy the knowledge requirement, a plaintiff bringing a Section 1202(b)(1) claim must offer more than a bare assertion that \"when CMI metadata is removed, copyright infringement plaintiffs ... lose an important method of identifying a photo as infringing.\" Instead, the plaintiff must provide evidence from which one can infer that future infringement is likely, albeit not certain, to occur as a result of the removal or alteration of CMI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Photographers Have Failed to Make the Required Affirmative Showing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Photographers have not offered\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   specific evidence that removal of CMI metadata from their real estate photographs will impair their policing of infringement. There are no allegations, for example, of a \"pattern of conduct\" or \"modus operandi\" involving policing infringement by tracking metadata.\n   <em>\n    Todd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6052164\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/627/329/#p334\">\n    627 F.3d at 334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, the evidence presented cuts against any inference that CMI metadata is of any practical significance to the Photographers in policing copyright infringement of their images.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Photographers have not, for example, averred that they have ever used CMI metadata to prevent or detect copyright infringement, much less how they would do so. Vandel testified that, before this lawsuit began, he had never \"looked at any metadata information on any photograph in an MLS system.\" On the only two occasions Vandel became aware of unauthorized use of his photographs, he learned about the unauthorized use from the real estate agent who commissioned the photographs. The agent saw the image elsewhere and contacted Vandel to ask if he had permitted the use. Stevens similarly testified that he had \"[n]ever tried to download a photo off an MLS listing ... and look at its properties, its metadata,\" that he \"d[id]n't think you can pull up metadata off of an MLS listing,\" and that he \"didn't even realize you could click on a picture off the Internet, right-click it, and get metadata off of it.\" The testimony of both Stevens and Vandel undermines any ostensible relationship between the removal of CMI metadata and their policing of infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Nor have the Photographers brought forward any evidence indicating that CoreLogic's\n   <em>\n    distribution\n   </em>\n   of real estate photographs ever \"induce[d], enable[d], facilitate[d], or conceal[ed]\" any particular act of infringement by anyone, let alone a pattern of such infringement likely to recur in the future. They identify\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   instance in which the removal of CMI metadata from any photograph \"induce[d], enable[d], facilitate[d] or conceal[ed] an infringement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, a party intent on using a copyrighted photograph undetected can itself remove any CMI metadata, precluding detection through a search for the metadata.
