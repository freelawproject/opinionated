Employees at ConAgra's Russellville, Arkansas, plant (employees) must don and doff company-provided personal protective equipment (protective equipment) outside the plant's production areas. Because the majority of employees use time clocks within production areas, they are not compensated for their time donning and doffing their protective equipment and walking to and from the time clocks.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In March 2012, the employees' union and ConAgra entered into negotiations to\n   revise the 2008 Collective Bargaining Agreement. The union submitted a proposal that sought \"a 10 minute paid dress out period\" for employees. The parties dispute what occurred during negotiations, but the employees have presented evidence that ConAgra agreed to move its time clocks from production areas to changing areas so that the employees could be compensated for time spent donning and doffing protective equipment. In return, the union agreed to withdraw its proposal. Ultimately, both parties entered into the 2012 Collective Bargaining Agreement, which did not state that employees would be compensated for donning and doffing protective equipment. Nor did it address whether ConAgra would move the time clocks from production areas to changing areas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   ConAgra thereafter made no changes to its compensation practices for donning and doffing protective equipment and did not move its time clocks to changing areas. Neither the union nor any employee filed a grievance under the 2012 Collective Bargaining Agreement demanding compensation for time spent donning and doffing protective equipment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   II.

Fair Labor Standards Act Claims\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Employers must pay their employees a minimum wage for hours worked, but may exclude \"any time spent in changing clothes or washing at the beginning or end of each workday\" if the time is excluded \"by the express terms of or by custom or practice under a bona fide collective-bargaining agreement applicable to the particular employee.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20203\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (o). The parties agree that the 2012 Collective Bargaining Agreement does not state that employees will be paid for their time spent donning and doffing protective equipment. Thus, the issue before us is whether it was the \"custom or practice\" under the 2012 Collective Bargaining Agreement for employees not to be compensated for donning and doffing their protective equipment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The employees argue that ConAgra cannot unilaterally create a custom or practice by refusing to compensate them for time spent donning and doffing, but this argument overlooks the parties' previous interactions. Prior to 2012, \"[t]he Parties had a long-standing practice of non-payment for donning and doffing for most (but not all) employees at the Russellville Plant[.]\" Appellants' Br. 28. Because this practice continued after the 2012 Collective Bargaining Agreement took effect, we do not view ConAgra as unilaterally imposing a custom or practice, but rather as continuing a custom or practice that was in effect under the 2008 Collective Bargaining Agreement. Moreover, the union and its employees have not objected-under the agreement-to this practice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

A year later, the Arkansas legislature passed Act 914, which sought to legislatively overrule\n   <em>\n    Gerber\n   </em>\n   . Part of Act 914 amended Arkansas Code \u00a7 11-4-205 to include the underlined language:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   Nothing in this subchapter\n   <em>\n    , including the provisions of \u00a7 11-4-218(b),\n   </em>\n   shall be deemed to interfere with, impede, or in any way diminish the right of employers and employees to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing in order to establish wages or other conditions of work.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   This amendment attempted to clarify that the parties' agreement controlled employee compensation, regardless of Arkansas Code \u00a7 11-4-218(b) 's directive that \"[a]ny agreement between the employee and employer to work for less than minimum wages shall be no defense to the action.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Because it arises under Arkansas law, we will apply that law to appellants' claim.\n   <em>\n    Witzman v.

The employees assert that the district court was bound by\n   <em>\n    Gerber\n   </em>\n   -not Act 914-because no Arkansas Supreme Court opinion has questioned its legal underpinnings. The United States Supreme Court has explained, however, that \"[w]henever [the] law is authoritatively declared by a State, whether its voice be the legislature or its highest court, such law ought to govern in litigation founded on that law, whether the forum of application is a State or a federal court[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Guar.

Unlike the statute in\n   <em>\n    J-McDaniel\n   </em>\n   , Act 914 did not create a new substantive right under \u00a7 11-4-205, but merely clarified the statute's meaning that \"[n]othing in this subchapter\" applied to \u00a7 11-4-218(b), a different\n   statute within the subchapter. Such a change in text cannot be considered the creation of a substantive right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The employees also argue that Act 914 can be applied only prospectively, because the Act limits itself \"to conduct occurring on or after the effective date of this act.\" This quoted language does not apply to \u00a7 11-4-205, because it appears in a section of Act 914 that created Arkansas Code \u00a7 11-4-221. This was made clear when the statute was codified. Although Act 914 states that \u00a7 11-4-221(e) should read, \"This act applies only to conduct occurring on or after the effective date of this act,\" the codified version of the statute states, \"This\n   <em>\n    section\n   </em>\n   applies only to conduct occurring on or after April 5, 2017.\" (emphasis added). We thus follow the statute as codified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   After reviewing\n   <em>\n    Gerber\n   </em>\n   , Act 914, and the codified text of the Act, we predict that if this issue were before the Arkansas Supreme Court today, it would not follow\n   <em>\n    Gerber\n   </em>\n   but would instead apply the terms of the parties' 2012 Collective Bargaining Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   III.

Response to Defendant's Statement of Facts in Support of Its Motion for Summary Judgment 9-10, 12. The employees argue that ConAgra could track time spent checking-out and checking-in tools if ConAgra recorded the check-out and check-in times and compared them with time-clock records. The question is whether the time required to perform these activities is more than\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Employers are not required to pay employees for \"insubstantial or insignificant periods of time beyond the scheduled working hours, which cannot as a practical administrative matter be precisely recorded for payroll purposes[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20785.47\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 785.47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Although \"the amount of daily time spent on the additional work\" is \"[a]n important factor in determining whether a claim is\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   ,\" no precisely calculated, rigid durational period applies, but \"[m]ost courts have found daily periods of approximately 10 minutes\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   even though otherwise compensable.\"\n   <em>\n    Lindow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"661654\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/738/1057/#p1062\">\n    738 F.2d at 1062\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The employees argue that the district court erred by concluding that the time spent checking-out and checking-in tools was\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   . We disagree. Under the facts before us, we conclude that such time is\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   in light of the short duration of that process and the additional administrative burden necessary to compensate employees for that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   IV. Conclusion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   We conclude that ConAgra is not required to compensate employees for the time spent donning and doffing their protective equipment under either the Fair Labor Standards Act or the Arkansas Minimum Wage Act. Likewise, ConAgra is not required to compensate employees for the\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   time spent checking-out and checking-in tools.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    The Honorable James M. Moody, Jr., United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    The fry bake department employees are not involved in this litigation. They use a time clock outside of a production area and may don and doff their protective equipment while being paid.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
