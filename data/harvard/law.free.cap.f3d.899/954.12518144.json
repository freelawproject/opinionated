(\"King Mountain\"), a tribal manufacturer of tobacco products located on land held in trust by the United States, is subject to the federal excise tax on manufactured tobacco products. The district court awarded the United States almost $58 million for unpaid federal excise taxes, associated penalties, and interest. Because we conclude that neither the General Allotment Act of 1887,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=4%20Stat.%20388\">\n    4 Stat. 388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (codified as amended in scattered sections of 25 U.S.C.), nor the Treaty with the Yakamas of 1855,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20Stat.%20951\">\n    12 Stat. 951\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , entitles King Mountain to an exemption from the federal excise tax, we affirm the judgment of the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2006 the late Delbert Wheeler, Sr., a lifelong-enrolled member of the Yakama Nation in Washington State, purchased \"80 acres of trust property ... from the Yakama Nation Land Enterprise, the agency of the Yakama Nation which is charged with overseeing the maintenance of real property held in trust by the United States for the benefit of the Yakama Nation and its members.\" Wheeler then opened King Mountain Tobacco Company, which manufactures cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco in a plant located on this trust land. After making significant investments to improve and develop the trust property, Wheeler transferred his interest in the property to King Mountain so that King Mountain could commence farming, agricultural, and manufacturing operations on Wheeler's land.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   King Mountain received a federal tobacco manufacturer's permit in February 2007. Today, King Mountain manufactures all of its tobacco products, and grows some of its own tobacco, on trust lands within the boundaries of the Yakama Nation. Some of those trust lands-including those\n   on which King Mountain is located-are allotted to Wheeler, while others are allotted to other Yakama members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   King Mountain initially obtained all of the tobacco for its products from an entity in North Carolina. But according to King Mountain, \"[t]obacco has historically grown on the Yakama Nation Reservation.\" Over time, King Mountain increased the proportion of tobacco grown on trust land and incorporated into its manufactured products. In 2010 the \"approximately 3.1% of the tobacco used [in 2009 had] risen to 9.5%. In 2011, it rose again, to 37.9%.\"\n   <em>\n    King Mountain Tobacco Co., Inc. v.

By the end of 2013, King Mountain's products were composed \"of at least 55 percent tobacco grown exclusively on allotted land held in trust by the United States for the beneficial use of ... Wheeler.\" The bulk of King Mountain's products are now manufactured by blending \"[t]rust-land grown tobacco ... with non-trust-grown tobacco.\" King Mountain also manufactures a small amount of \" 'traditional use tobacco' that is intended for Indian ... ceremonial use\" and consists entirely of trust land-grown tobacco.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The federal government imposes excise taxes on manufactured tobacco products, including cigars, cigarettes, and roll-your-own tobacco.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   I.R.C. \u00a7 5701.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The current tax rate for cigarettes, for example, is approximately $1 per pack, or $10 per carton.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4264976\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/768/989/#p991\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 5701(b).

Administered by the Treasury Department's Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (\"TTB\"), these excise taxes are assessed on the privilege of manufacturing tobacco products and determined at the time the tobacco products are removed from a factory or bonded warehouse.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4264976\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/768/989/#p991\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 5703(b), 5702(j).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Although King Mountain initially paid federal excise taxes on its tobacco products, it began to fall behind in 2009. The Treasury gave King Mountain statutory notice, under I.R.C. \u00a7 5703(d), of the delinquent taxes and afforded the company an opportunity to show cause why the taxes should not be assessed. King Mountain did not challenge the statutory notice. Accordingly, the Treasury delegate timely made assessments against King Mountain for unpaid excise taxes, failure-to-pay penalties, failure-to-deposit penalties, and interest for periods in October, November, and December 2009. In February 2010, the Treasury issued King Mountain a Notice and Demand for Payment pursuant to I.R.C. \u00a7 6303. King Mountain paid the assessed taxes in installments over a five-month period in 2010, but it failed to pay the associated penalties and interest. Eventually, King Mountain ceased paying federal excise taxes altogether.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   This case has shuttled between the district court and our court on both procedural and substantive grounds. Back in 2012, the United States brought suit against King Mountain to collect the delinquent taxes. The suit was a companion to an earlier-filed action brought by King Mountain, Wheeler, and the Yakama Nation for declaratory and injunctive relief against the imposition of the federal tobacco excise tax on King Mountain's products.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    King Mountain Tobacco Co., Inc. v.

Observing that the merits issues were \"essentially identical\" to those presented in the earlier\n   <em>\n    Yakama\n   </em>\n   case, the court expressly incorporated its conclusions of law from the summary judgment order. The district court reserved ruling on the amount of liabilities owed by King Mountain, however, in order to enable King Mountain to obtain additional discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After further discovery, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the government on the amount of King Mountain's liabilities-$57,914,811.27. However, when the district court entered final judgment in favor of the government, it accidentally omitted this amount from its order. The government quickly moved to alter or amend the judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) to reflect that King Mountain owed \"to the United States federal tobacco excise tax liabilities totaling $57,914,811.27 as of June 11, 2013, plus interest and other statutory additions accruing after that date until paid in full.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Before the district court could issue an amended judgment, however, King Mountain filed a timely notice of appeal. Citing Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(a), the district court initially ruled that it lacked jurisdiction to amend the judgment, but that it would do so if we remanded. Three months later, the district court reconsidered its ruling\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   , concluding that our precedent permitted it to correct the omission of the amount of judgment as a mere \"clerical error.\" Accordingly, the district court granted the government's motion and amended the judgment. Again, King Mountain filed a timely notice of appeal, which is now before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

And King Mountain concedes that the Internal Revenue Code provides \"highly mechanical\" formulas for computing the statutory additions accruing thereafter. King Mountain objects, however, to the amended judgment's failure to specify the portions of the $57,914,811.27 award that are attributable to unpaid taxes, to unpaid penalties, and to unpaid interest, because King Mountain claims that it cannot determine how much it owes in statutory additions without those figures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Assuming without deciding that the determination of the statutory additions depends on these figures, we conclude that the amended judgment sufficiently provides them. In the district court, the Government submitted the \"Transaction History Report,\" \"Corrected Final Notice &amp; Demand of Taxes Due / Notice of Intent to Levy,\" and \"Second Corrected Final Notice &amp; Demand of Taxes Due / Notice of Intent to Levy\" that it had issued to King Mountain, collectively referred to as the \"Blue Ribbon Transcript.\" For each taxable period, the TTB's Blue Ribbon Transcript detailed the additional penalties and interest for failure to pay the amounts due. The Government also introduced three binders containing \"detailed copies of the computations done in connection with\" the Blue Ribbon Transcript. In granting the Government's renewed motion for summary judgment, the district court held that \"the Blue Ribbon Transcript constitutes presumptive proof of a valid assessment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The district court expressly entered the amended judgment \"pursuant to\" its order granting the United States' renewed motion for summary judgment, which ruled that the Government's Blue Ribbon Transcript \"establishes [that] the ... sum\" of King Mountain's liability, as of June 11, 2013, was $57,914,811.27. As explained above, the Blue Ribbon Transcript did not pull that sum from thin air. Rather, it specified the exact amounts of King Mountain's unpaid taxes, unpaid penalties, and unpaid interest for each taxable period, and then added all of those amounts together.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In other words, the amended\n   judgment reduced the amounts of unpaid taxes, unpaid penalties, and unpaid interest\n   <em>\n    in the Blue Ribbon Transcript\n   </em>\n   to judgment. Hence, a \"remand to effectuate that intent is a matter of 'mere form.' \"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Huey v.

After all, King Mountain can easily calculate for itself how much of the $57,914,811.27 award is attributable to taxes, to penalties, and to interest by consulting the Blue Ribbon Transcript and compute the statutory additions accordingly.

The land on\n   which King Mountain operates was allotted to and held in trust for Delbert Wheeler (and now for his estate)-not King Mountain. The only trust land used to grow tobacco for King Mountain's products was allotted to Wheeler or to other Yakama members-not King Mountain.

Most obviously, the United States is already the titleholder of those lands.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20348\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (providing that \"the United States does and will hold the land ... allotted\" under the Act). King Mountain fails to explain how it is possible to \"forfeit\" land to the existing titleholder. And again, King Mountain is not the allottee of the trust land on which it operates. Thus, King Mountain itself has no land, or even a trust relationship with the United States, to \"forfeit\" as a penalty for nonpayment. Any liability incurred by King Mountain cannot result in a lien on or forfeiture of allotment land, because the allotment on which King Mountain operates is held\n   <em>\n    in trust\n   </em>\n   for Wheeler's estate.\n   <em>\n    See Trust\n   </em>\n   , Black's Law Dictionary (West, 10th ed. 2014) (\"The right, enforceable solely in equity, to the beneficial enjoyment of property to which another person holds the legal title; a property interest held by one person ... for the\n   <em>\n    benefit of a third party\n   </em>\n   ....\") (emphasis added). The same is true of allotments held in trust for other Indians that are used to grow tobacco for King Mountain's products.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Notably, IRS regulations expressly prohibit forfeiture or attachment of tax liens to property held in trust \"by the United States for an individual incompetent Indian.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20301.6321-1\">\n    26 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.6321-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017).
