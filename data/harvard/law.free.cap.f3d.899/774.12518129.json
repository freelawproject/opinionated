Because the Nevada statute outlaws conduct that presents a lesser risk of harm to a child (\"reasonably foreseeable\" harm) than does the conduct required to violate the INA (at least a \"reasonable probability\" of harm), we conclude that the BIA did so err, and grant the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Petitioner Lorenzo Alvarez-Cerriteno (\"Alvarez-Cerriteno\") is a native and citizen of Mexico. He entered the United States on March 9, 1985, without inspection or parole. However, he duly became a lawful permanent resident on December 1, 1990.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Alvarez-Cerriteno has incurred several criminal convictions since entering the United States, including a January 18, 2011, conviction for \"Child Abuse and Neglect\" under Nevada Revised Statutes \u00a7 200.508(2)(b)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In that case, Alvarez-Cerriteno was charged with \"punching\" his fourteen-year-old son in 2010.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Alvarez-Cerriteno pleaded guilty to violating \u00a7 200.508(2)(b)(1) and received a prison sentence of nine months. After Alvarez-Cerriteno was arrested because of outstanding traffic warrants in 2016, the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") initiated removal proceedings against him based on the 2011 child abuse conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   DHS issued a Notice to Appear (\"NTA\") and charged that Alvarez-Cerriteno was removable pursuant to Section 237(a)(2)(E)(i) of the INA (codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(E)(i) ) as an \"alien who at any time after entry has been convicted of ... a crime of child abuse, child neglect, or child abandonment.\" Alvarez-Cerriteno admitted the factual allegations in the NTA but denied the charge of removability. On May 31, 2016, he submitted an application for cancellation of removal pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On June 6, 2016, the Immigration Judge (IJ) issued a written decision, which (1) found that Alvarez-Cerriteno was removable as charged in the NTA and (2) denied Alvarez-Cerriteno's application for discretionary cancellation of removal. On the first issue, the IJ found that, under the BIA's decision in\n   <em>\n    Matter of Soram\n   </em>\n   , \"the crime of unreasonably placing a child in a situation that poses a threat of injury to the child's life or health ... is categorically a crime of child abuse under [the INA], even though no proof of actual harm or injury to the child was required\" under the state statute of conviction.\n   <em>\n    Matter of Soram\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20378\">\n    25 I. &amp; N. Dec. 378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (BIA 2010). Having thus denied Alvarez-Cerriteno's claim based on the \"categorical approach,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the\n   IJ did not apply the \"modified categorical approach.\" On the second issue, the IJ denied discretionary relief based on Alvarez-Cerriteno's \"pattern of violations of this country's criminal laws.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On October 25, 2016, the BIA dismissed Alvarez-Cerriteno's appeal. The Board affirmed the IJ's determination that Alvarez-Cerriteno was removable based on a conviction for a \"crime of child abuse, neglect, or child abandonment.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(E)(i). The BIA found that the Nevada statute includes reasonableness and criminal-negligence standards that would \"preclude a conviction\" for conduct which \"creates only the bare potential for nonserious harm to a child.\" The BIA concluded therefore that there was no \"realistic probability\" the Nevada statute could be used to prosecute conduct outside the scope of the generic crime in the INA. The BIA also affirmed the IJ's discretionary denial of cancellation of removal on de novo review, and emphasized that Alvarez-Cerriteno's \"history of domestic violence over a period of years, for which he shows little remorse, is a very significant negative factor.\" Petitioner timely petitioned this court for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The panel did not construe the generic crime, but rather deferred to the BIA's construction in\n   <em>\n    Matter of Velazquez-Herrera,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20503\">\n    24 I. &amp; N.

There, the BIA had construed the federal generic \"crime of child abuse\" to mean \"any offense involving an intentional, knowing, reckless, or criminally negligent act or omission that constitutes maltreatment of a child or that impairs a child's physical or mental well-being, including sexual abuse or exploitation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20503\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20503\">\n    at 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Thus, a conviction under the Nevada statute is not categorically a \"crime of child abuse\" under the INA. However, after this court decided\n   <em>\n    Fregozo\n   </em>\n   , the BIA clarified that its definition of the federal generic \"crime of child abuse,\" as set forth in\n   <em>\n    Velazquez-Herrera\n   </em>\n   , was \"not limited to offenses requiring proof of injury to the child.\"\n   <em>\n    Matter of Soram\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20378\">\n    25 I. &amp; N.

So, even accepting the government's argument, we are still left to ask what \"threat\" of harm, as \"indicate[d]\" in the \"circumstances,\" is required for a finding of \"abuse or neglect\" (and thus guilt). As discussed above, determining whether treatment is \"negligent\" involves the application of an objective, \"reasonable person\" standard. Thus, treatment of a child is negligent when it places the child in circumstances that create a risk of harm which is \"reasonably foreseeable.\" Accordingly, we find that, to sustain a conviction under section 200.508(2), the Supreme Court of Nevada would require proof that a defendant negligently exposed a child to at least a \"reasonably foreseeable\" harm, but no greater risk need be shown.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    D.
