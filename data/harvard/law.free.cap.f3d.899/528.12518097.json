The district court granted the officers summary judgment based on qualified immunity. Michael appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Michael was in possession of a set of keys to a truck his mother had rented. He refused to return them without speaking to his mother, but she refused to talk with him. The police were called. Officer Trevena arrived first, and officer Chaffee soon afterward. Both officers wore microphones that recorded much of what happened next. Both officers also drove police vehicles equipped with dashboard cameras. Trevena's vehicle was positioned such that the camera was facing away from the front yard where Michael was sitting. Chaffee's vehicle was positioned with its dash cam pointing at the yard, but its view was almost completely obscured by a large tree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Michael was sitting in a chair on the lawn of his cousin's home, and his mother and sister (who was in the driver's seat) were sitting in a vehicle parked nearby. Michael went to speak to his mother but, as he approached, Michael's sister started\n   the vehicle and began to drive away. Michael returned to the lawn chair, out of view of either officer's dash cam. He claimed that his sister had run over his foot on purpose. As recorded by the officers' microphones, the exchange went as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   TREVENA: You intentionally put your foot under the vehicle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   MICHAEL: No, I ... I did not intentionally do that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   TREVENA: Yeah, ya did.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   MICHAEL: I did not in ... you know I didn't; you are accusing me of nothin' just to provoke me and I did not do no such thing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   TREVENA: Yeah, ya did.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   MICHAEL: I did no such thing. She just ran over my foot.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   TREVENA: You were standing that far away....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   MICHAEL: She just ran over my foot, sir. She ran over my foot. You can be a witness against me in court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   TREVENA: Okay, she ran over your foot?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   MICHAEL: You can be a witness against me in court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   TREVENA: Okay, did she intentionally run over your foot?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   MICHAEL: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   TREVENA: I am going to arrest you for providing a false statement to a peace officer right now.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Both officers then moved in to arrest Michael.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Trevena ordered Michael to stand up, but he remained seated. The officers say Michael tensed up his body and gripped the chair, which Michael denies. Michael says Trevena grabbed his right arm and throat, which Trevena denies. Everyone agrees that Chaffee took out his police baton and placed it between Michael's left arm and chest. Chaffee then used the baton as a lever to get Michael out of the lawn chair, and broke Michael's arm. Michael was transported to the hospital. Trevena and Chaffee filed charges against Michael for making a false report, citing the exchange reproduced above. The North Dakota authorities declined to prosecute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Michael filed this\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   case against Trevena and Chaffee for excessive force and unlawful arrest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court granted both officers summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity, and Michael appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We review grants of summary judgment de novo.\n   <em>\n    Gilmore v.

Owing to the tree and the way the dash cam frames the front yard, the following events are missing from the video: (1) Michael's sister running over his foot (intentionally or otherwise); (2) Michael sitting in the lawn chair once he returns to the front lawn; (3) the officers approaching Michael; (4) Michael's posture and physical reaction to the officers; (5) the officers' actions to remove Michael from the lawn chair; and (6) the breaking of Michael's arm. Although the officers' audio recordings make it fairly clear who said what during the events, the recordings are insufficient to conclusively resolve whether Trevena and Chaffee violated Michael's constitutional rights. The officers' argument that the dash cam footage is dispositive of the case is wholly unsupported by the record. Accordingly, we conclude that this is one of those \"usual\" qualified immunity cases in which viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmovant \"means adopting ... the plaintiff's version of the facts.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3555943\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/372/#p378\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3555943\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/372/#p378\">\n    at 378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3555943\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/372/#p378\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1769\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   We turn now to Michael's two claims.

Michael's sister begins to drive away. We do not see Michael taking any steps backwards; his feet move but he remains immediately beside the van. As the van turns toward Michael and away from the curb, Michael's right foot moves under the rolling van. The van's rear tire-presumably the tire Michael says ran over his foot-is not visible because the van blocks the dash cam's view as it turns into the street.

Where an officer has already concluded that a suspect's statement is a lie, it is unreasonable to think that, by repeating the statement, the suspect may interfere with an investigation into whether the statement is, in fact, a lie. Equally unreasonable\n   is the notion that repeating a statement, which the officer has already decided is false, might materially mislead a law enforcement officer into believing the statement is true. Thus, the officers' belief, mistaken or otherwise, that they had probable cause to arrest Michael for violating\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.D.%20Cent.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2012.1-11-03\">\n    N.D.

As the court explains, because a tree partially obscures the only video of the arrest, there remain genuine questions of material fact concerning the extent to which Michael resisted arrest and the degree of force the officers employed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   at 532-33. Thus, I join that portion of the court's opinion. But, for two reasons, I respectfully dissent from the reversal of summary judgment as to Michael's unlawful-arrest claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   First, the court misconstrues the record in \"assuming, for the purpose of summary judgment, that Michael's sister intentionally ran over his foot.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 533. While we generally must view the facts and draw all reasonable inferences in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party, the Supreme Court has made clear that we cannot accept allegations that are contradicted by reliable video evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Scott v. Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3555943\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/372/#p378\">\n    550 U.S. 372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 380-81,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3555943\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/372/#p378\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1769\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3555943\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/372/#p378\">\n    167 L.Ed.2d 686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007). Having reviewed the video here, I simply disagree that \"[t]he recordings are at best inconclusive\" as to whether Michael's sister intentionally ran over his foot.\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 533. Officer Chaffee's dash-camera video clearly shows that, as Michael's sister begins to drive off, he takes three backward steps away from the van before suddenly extending his right foot under the vehicle's rear, passenger-side tire. This video disproves Michael's claim that his sister intentionally ran over his foot. Indeed, Michael moved into the path of the vehicle so quickly that it would have been impossible for her to deliberately speed up or fail to stop, even if she could have seen his foot under the rear tire of the forward-moving vehicle. Thus, I do not accept the court's characterization of Michael's report to officers as \"a matter of opinion (that, by definition, cannot be true or false).\"\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 534. The video conclusively demonstrates that Michael deliberately put his foot under the vehicle, that his sister could not have intended to run it over, and that he made a false report to officers on both scores.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Second, and more problematically, the court misapplies the arguable probable cause standard in light of relevant statutory ambiguity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walker v. City of Pine Bluff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8972127\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/414/989/#p992\">\n    414 F.3d 989\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 992 (8th Cir. 2005) (\"Because the qualified immunity privilege extends to a police officer who is wrong, so long as he is reasonable, the governing standard for a Fourth Amendment unlawful arrest claim is not probable cause in fact but arguable probable cause ... that is, whether the officer should have known that the arrest violated plaintiff's clearly established right.\" (internal quotation marks omitted) ). North Dakota's false-report statute makes it a crime to \"[g]ive[ ] false information or a false report to a law enforcement officer which that person knows to be false, and the information or report\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   interfere with an investigation\n   or\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   materially mislead a law enforcement officer.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.D.%20Cent.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2012.1-11-03\">\n    N.D. Cent. Code \u00a7 12.1-11-03\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1) (emphasis added). As this case demonstrates, the final clause of this provision allows for several plausible interpretations: (1) that the false information or report must,\n   <em>\n    in fact\n   </em>\n   , interfere or mislead-as Michael suggests; (2) that the false information or report must,\n   <em>\n    under the circumstances\n   </em>\n   , be\n   <em>\n    capable of\n   </em>\n   interfering or misleading, in light of the officer's subjective knowledge as to the validity of the information or report-the standard adopted by the court; or (3) that the false information or report is\n   <em>\n    of the type\n   </em>\n   that\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   interfere or mislead given its relation to an officer's law enforcement duties-as the officers contend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The officers' interpretation strikes me as the most natural reading of statute, as the alternatives each require a deviation from the text.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. Dept. of Transp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9228893\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/683/886/#p889\">\n    683 N.W.2d 886\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 889 (N.D. 2004) (explaining that North Dakota statutes are to be interpreted by looking at the \"plain language of the statute and giv[ing] every word of the statute its ordinary meaning\"). For example, the final clause of the provision refers generally to \"a law enforcement officer,\" not specifically to\n   <em>\n    the\n   </em>\n   officer who received the false report, which suggests a more objective standard than that adopted by the court. Nor is there any language in the provision indicating that the false report must actually interfere or mislead. Nevertheless, resolving this statutory ambiguity is not our task today. Instead, we must determine whether a reasonable officer could conclude that Michael's false report-that he did not deliberately put his foot under the vehicle and that his sister intentionally ran over his foot-was sufficient to constitute a violation of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Given that there is no North Dakota caselaw clarifying the ambiguous \"may\" provision and that the officers' interpretation is at the very least reasonable, their arrest of Michael did not violate clearly established law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lawyer v. City of Council Bluffs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"645567\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/361/1099/#p1108\">\n    361 F.3d 1099\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1108 (8th Cir. 2004) (emphasizing that \"[p]olice officers are not expected to parse code language as though they were participating in a law school seminar\" and concluding that a challenged arrest \"did not violate clearly established law\" where a reasonable officer could believe that the plaintiff-arrestee's conduct violated an ambiguous provision, even if a state court later concluded that it did not);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gorra v. Hanson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10529682\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/880/95/#p98\">\n    880 F.2d 95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 98 (8th Cir. 1989) (\"Because the law had not been construed at the time of the arrest, and because the troopers' interpretation was not inconsistent with common understanding, we cannot say that [their] interpretation of the statute was unreasonable.\"). Under the officers' reasonable reading of statute, both of Michael's statements would qualify as a false report because they may have led officers to investigate or even arrest his sister. Therefore, the officers had at least arguable probable cause to arrest Michael.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Accordingly, I concur in the court's reversal of summary judgment as to Michael's excessive-force claims but dissent from its reversal of summary judgment as to his wrongful-arrest claims.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
