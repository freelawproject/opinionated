After we affirmed his conviction, Johnson filed a petition for writ of certiorari. The Supreme Court granted the petition, vacated our judgment, and remanded for reconsideration in light of\n   <em>\n    Alleyne v.

After reviewing Johnson's arguments under\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   -as well as other arguments he raises-we will affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   During the late spring and summer of 2009, Dominique Johnson participated in five bank robberies in the Philadelphia area. In early May, Johnson committed the first robbery by himself, carrying a BB gun. In late May, he committed the second robbery, again carrying a BB gun, but this time assisted by two others: Gregory Lawrence and Jerry Taylor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In June, Johnson bought a .40 caliber Glock pistol. Johnson, Lawrence, and Taylor discussed another bank robbery, with the plan being that Taylor would commit the robbery using Johnson's newly-acquired pistol. Johnson and Lawrence advised Taylor on how to commit the robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In early July, the three friends (joined by a fourth who served as the getaway driver) executed their plan and committed the third robbery. Johnson served as the lookout while Taylor ran into the bank and demanded money. During the robbery, Taylor pointed his gun at one teller and hit another teller with it. In mid-July, the same group committed the fourth robbery in the same fashion: Taylor robbed the bank while brandishing the pistol, and Johnson served as the lookout.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After that, Lawrence and Taylor decided not to participate in any more robberies. Johnson recruited two others, Amin Dancy and Christopher Montague, to commit a fifth robbery at the end of July. As before, Johnson served as the lookout, and someone else (this time Dancy) went into the bank and demanded money while brandishing Johnson's pistol.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The FBI investigated the robberies and eventually arrested Johnson. A jury convicted him of two counts of conspiracy to commit armed bank robbery,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20371\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; one count of armed bank robbery,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202113\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) ; four counts of aiding\n   and abetting armed bank robbery,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 2113(d) ; and three counts of aiding and abetting the use and carrying of a firearm during a crime of violence,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 924(c)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   For the first count of using a firearm during a crime of violence, the District Court imposed a sentence of seven years pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1)(A)(ii), which provides that if a person \"uses or carries a firearm ... in furtherance of\" a \"crime of violence\" and \"the firearm is brandished,\" the minimum sentence is seven years. For the second and third firearm counts, the court imposed two 25-year sentences pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1)(C), which provides that \"[i]n the case of a second or subsequent conviction under this subsection, the person shall ... be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 25 years.\" Johnson's total sentence for all ten counts was 835 months of imprisonment, or nearly seventy years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Johnson appealed, and we affirmed his convictions and sentence in a non-precedential opinion.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In its response, the Government relied heavily on our post-\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   opinion,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

However, before we heard Johnson's appeal, we reheard\n   <em>\n    Lewis\n   </em>\n   en banc and decided it differently.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Lewis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341281\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/802/449/\">\n    802 F.3d 449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir. 2015) (en banc). In light of\n   <em>\n    Lewis\n   </em>\n   , we determined that Johnson needed counsel after all. We appointed counsel and asked for supplemental briefing. Johnson's counseled brief raised four issues: two relating to\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   , and two relying on other Supreme Court cases issued during the pendency of his appeal. We address those four issues first, and then turn to the arguments in Johnson's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   II.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   Arguments\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Johnson argues that the District Court committed\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   errors by not submitting to the jury the question of brandishing or the question of whether two of the three \u00a7 924(c) convictions were second or subsequent convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   To explain the significance of\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   , we begin with\n   <em>\n    Apprendi v.

There, the Supreme Court ruled that \"[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n    at 490\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Finally, in\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   , the Court concluded that\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   was inconsistent with\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   and overruled it, holding that \"there is no basis in principle or logic to distinguish facts that raise the maximum from those that increase the minimum.\"\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12699057\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/99/\">\n    570 U.S. at 116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12699057\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/99/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 2151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The jury \"indicated on the verdict form that Alleyne had used or carried a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, but did not indicate a finding that the firearm was brandished.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12699057\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/99/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12699057\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/99/\">\n    at 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12699057\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/99/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 2151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks, alterations, and citation omitted).

The Aiding And Abetting Instruction Did Not Amount To Plain Error\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Johnson argues that his aiding and abetting convictions should be vacated because the jury instruction on aiding and abetting violated\n   <em>\n    Rosemond\n   </em>\n   , 134 S.Ct. at 1243. We conclude that any such error does not survive plain error review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In order to aid and abet a \u00a7 924(c) offense (brandishing of a firearm), the defendant must know beforehand that a gun will be used.\n   <em>\n    Rosemond\n   </em>\n   , 134 S.Ct. at 1249.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Supreme Court ruled that a defendant like Johnson, who actively participates in a crime, \"has the intent needed to aid and abet a \u00a7 924(c) violation when he knows that one of his confederates will carry a gun.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The \"defendant's knowledge of a firearm must be advance knowledge\" because that \"enables him to make the relevant legal (and indeed, moral) choice.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   With advance knowledge, a defendant can try to persuade his confederates to alter the plan, or he can withdraw from it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Becoming aware of the gun as the crime is unfolding is not enough: the defendant \"may already have completed his acts of assistance; or even if not, he may at that\n   late point have no realistic opportunity to quit the crime.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Here, the jury was instructed that \"[t]he second element of aiding and abetting is that the defendant ... knew that the offense charged was going to be committed\n   <em>\n    or was being committed\n   </em>\n   by the principal.\" Supp. App. 1444 (emphasis added). Therefore, the jury could have convicted Johnson either on the basis that he knew the gun \"was going to be\" brandished, or that it \"was being\" brandished.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   The second alternative-that Johnson was aware of the brandishing only as it occurred-is erroneous under\n   <em>\n    Rosemond\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Johnson argues that the aiding and abetting instruction was also erroneous as applied to his bank robbery convictions. Although Johnson does not articulate his logic, we infer that it goes as follows. A \u00a7 924(c) violation consists of a predicate act (a crime of violence) and the use or carrying of a firearm. Similarly, a \u00a7 2113(d) violation consists of a predicate act (bank robbery) and the use of a dangerous weapon. Arguably, therefore, because the two statutes are similar in structure, the\n   <em>\n    Rosemond\n   </em>\n   advance knowledge requirement applies to \u00a7 2113(d) as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Stated this way, Johnson's reading of\n   <em>\n    Rosemond\n   </em>\n   has an appealing consistency. However, we need not decide whether\n   <em>\n    Rosemond\n   </em>\n   extends beyond \u00a7 924(c) because the plain-error standard is not met with regard to either the \u00a7 924(c) or \u00a7 2113(d) convictions.

If the jury had been properly instructed, there is not a reasonable probability that Johnson would have been acquitted, because there was ample evidence that he knew in advance that the firearm would be brandished (as \u00a7 924(c) puts it), and that a dangerous weapon would be used (as \u00a7 2113(d) puts it).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The overwhelming and uncontroverted evidence showing Johnson's foreknowledge of his confederates' use of the weapon begins with his first solo bank robbery. There, Johnson brandished what appeared to be a pistol (actually a BB gun), at one point putting it to the head of one of the tellers. Later, Johnson described the first bank robbery to Lawrence, who wanted to commit a bank robbery too, because he needed money. The two men planned and executed the second robbery together. As they were driving to the bank, Johnson gave Lawrence the same BB gun Johnson had used during the first robbery. When Lawrence entered the bank, he immediately pulled the gun from his pocket, jumped up on the bank counter, and demanded money.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Lawrence testified that he, Johnson, and Taylor planned the third robbery and that Taylor was to go in the bank, hop over the counter, and get the money while carrying a gun-this time, the real gun that Johnson had bought. The getaway driver also testified that the plan was for Taylor to use the gun. Taylor executed the robbery as planned. During the robbery, he pointed the gun at a teller's head.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The same group of individuals then planned the fourth robbery. The morning of the robbery, Johnson got his gun and brought it to where the friends met up. During the robbery, Taylor held the gun to a teller's head.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   For the fifth robbery, Amin Dancy was to be the stickup man, so Johnson gave\n   him the gun. Dancy carried the gun into the bank, and during the robbery, he put the gun to a teller's ribs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   At trial, Johnson admitted the essential facts of the five bank robberies, but argued that he was not the ringleader and that the cooperating witnesses' testimony lacked credibility. He did not present any evidence that would contradict the ample evidence showing that he helped plan each robbery, that the plan for each robbery included using and brandishing a gun, and that he provided the gun for each robbery. We therefore conclude that the third required factor of the plain-error analysis is not present: even if the jury had been instructed that Johnson needed to know in advance that the gun would be brandished, there is not a reasonable probability that it would have acquitted Johnson of the aiding and abetting charges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vazquez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9462308\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/271/93/#p96\">\n    271 F.3d at 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (third plain-error factor not met where \"there [was] never ... any question\" about the element that was not submitted to the jury).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, the\n   <em>\n    Rosemond\n   </em>\n   error does not meet the plain-error standard, and we will affirm the aiding and abetting convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   C.

To recap: Johnson was represented and lost his appeal; the Supreme Court granted his\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   petition for certiorari and issued its \"grant, vacate, and remand\" order; Johnson proceeded\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   with our permission and filed a brief; we appointed a new attorney to represent him; and the new attorney filed a brief as well.

However, there is no hybrid-representation case involving an appellant who, like Johnson, filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   brief with our permission and later filed a counseled brief after we appointed an attorney. Therefore, the usual rule against hybrid representation does not apply. In addition, the record does not show that Johnson was advised that the counseled brief would supersede his\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   brief, so it would be unfair to rule after the fact that his\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   arguments were for naught.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The rule requiring appellants to raise all arguments in their opening briefs \"yields in 'extraordinary circumstances.' \"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

FBI Agent's Alleged Perjury\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Johnson argues that the only witness at the suppression hearing, FBI Agent Donald Asper, committed perjury, and asks us to remand for an evidentiary hearing on this topic. We have carefully reviewed Johnson's lengthy argument, as well as Agent Asper's testimony, and there is no need for an evidentiary hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Agent Asper testified that a witness to one of the robberies observed the license plate number of the getaway car, a silver Buick. The getaway car was registered to a man named William Childs, whom Agent Asper found and interviewed. Childs provided Asper with an abundance of information. Among other things: Childs told Agent Asper that Johnson bought the Buick and asked Childs to register it in Childs' name; he identified photos of Taylor, Lawrence, and Johnson; and he said that Taylor, Lawrence, and Johnson had been involved in bank robberies and had told Childs to take the heat for the car. Agent Asper then set up surveillance to find Lawrence. The surveillance was doubly successful, locating not only Lawrence, but also Johnson, who was in the silver Buick at the time. Agents arrested both men. A few hours later-unrelated to the arrest-a witness to one of the robberies identified Johnson in a photo array.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Johnson contends there was no probable cause to arrest him, but instead of a traditional Fourth Amendment argument, he attacks Agent Asper's honesty on the witness stand. In doing so, Johnson ignores every fact except that the photo identification took place after his arrest. The judge's ruling at the evidentiary hearing puts this issue to rest:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   Mr. Johnson, I say some of this for your benefit, sir, because I can appreciate your thinking, honestly, because you're thinking, you know, but they didn't have the ID until later.... And I think here with the ... getaway car, Mr. Johnson's connection to that car, ownership of the car, Mr. Childs' report to the Special Agent as to Mr. Johnson's comments, ... Mr. Childs picking out Mr. Johnson ..., Mr. Johnson being in the car when they go to arrest Mr. Lawrence, and then Mr. Johnson getting out of the car and together they go into the house, I think when you put all of that together ... I do think that there is ample probable cause for the arrest of Mr. Johnson ... before the ID....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Supp. App. 44-45. Johnson's self-serving version of the facts does not undermine Agent Asper's testimony.

Viewed in the light most favorable to the Government, that same evidence permitted a rational trier of fact to convict Johnson of aiding and abetting.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Johnson's argument ignores much of the evidence and rests on his insistence that he was not present inside the banks, a fact that does not carry the legal weight he wishes to attribute to it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   5. Effect On Interstate Commerce\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Johnson argues that the indictment needed to allege, and the jury needed to find, that his crimes affected interstate commerce.

In addition, Johnson contends that the FDIC does not replace money lost to bank robbery, and without FDIC loss, there is no effect on interstate commerce. However, we have ruled that \u00a7 2113 bank robbery \"is an economic activity that ... substantially affects interstate commerce and, thus, is an activity that Congress was well within its rights to criminalize pursuant to its power under the Commerce Clause.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Motion In Limine\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Johnson argues that the District Court violated his constitutional rights by granting a motion in limine that would have allowed the Government to rebut Johnson's testimony (if he had testified) with evidence of his statements to investigators. Johnson clearly feels that this ruling constrained his defense. However, the authorities he cites do not show error. For example,\n   <em>\n    Sullivan v. Louisiana\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12227\" index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/275/\">\n    508 U.S. 275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12227\" index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/275/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2078\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12227\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/275/\">\n    124 L.Ed.2d 182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993), deals with deficient instructions regarding guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and\n   <em>\n    United States v.

We address these in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   First, Johnson argues that he was prevented from testifying because he feared for his family and was assaulted in pretrial detention. However, the facts he relies on either are outside the record or constitute a continuation of his self-serving (and unsupported) version of events.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Second, Johnson argues that the District Court should have severed the first, second, and fifth robberies and tried each one individually. Joinder was appropriate, however, because the five bank robberies were a \"series of acts or transactions.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 8(b) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Irizarry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9099029\" index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/341/273/#p287\">\n    341 F.3d 273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 287 (3d Cir. 2003) ( Rule 8(b) governs joinder of multiple offenses). A defendant arguing for severance \"must 'pinpoint clear and substantial prejudice resulting in an unfair trial.' \"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Riley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3785144\" index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/621/312/#p335\">\n    621 F.3d 312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 335 (3d Cir. 2010),\n   <em>\n    as\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    amended\n   </em>\n   (Oct. 21, 2010) (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v. McGlory\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10515283\" index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/968/309/#p340\">\n    968 F.2d 309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 340 (3d Cir. 1992) ). Johnson argues generally that the joint trial exposed the jury to evidence of his other bad acts in violation of Federal Rule of Evidence 404. However, he fails to identify any clear and substantial prejudice, and we perceive none.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Third, Johnson attacks the testimony of FBI agents and a cooperating witness. Johnson declares that Agent Shute relied on inaccurate data when testifying about cell site analysis, but he never hints at what the inaccuracies were. He argues that Agent Banis, who presented call detail records, had no independent evidence that Johnson's cell phone number was really his. However, Agent Banis testified that Lawrence and Johnson's sister identified the number as Johnson's. Finally, Johnson argues that Lawrence offered improper expert testimony about the meaning of a phone call between Johnson and Amin Dancy. Such testimony offered by a cooperating witness is lay opinion testimony, not expert testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Anderskow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9043799\" index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/88/245/#p250\">\n    88 F.3d 245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 250 (3d Cir. 1996). Lawrence's testimony was a proper lay opinion: it was rationally based on his perception (he was present during the phone call), was helpful to the jury, and was not based on specialized knowledge. Fed. R. Evid. 701.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Fourth, Johnson argues that certain evidence-video, pictures, and bank teller testimony\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     -\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   was cumulative and should not have been admitted under Federal Rule of Evidence 403. However, evidence about what took place inside the banks does not fail the Rule 403 balancing test merely because Johnson was the lookout, while his confederates-not Johnson himself-went into the banks. Nor is it needlessly cumulative to present evidence of the predicate crimes that Johnson conspired to commit and then aided and abetted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Fifth, Johnson argues that the cumulative weight of the errors rendered his trial unfair. This argument fails because his other assignments of error fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   For the reasons stated above, we will affirm.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    The District Court had jurisdiction under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203231\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
