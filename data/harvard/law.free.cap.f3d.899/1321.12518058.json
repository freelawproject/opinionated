BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A. The District Court Actions\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On June 8, 2001, Inforocket.com, Inc. (\"Inforocket\"), the exclusive licensee of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%205%2C818%2C836\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 5,818,836\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"the '836 patent\"), filed a civil action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Compl.,\n   <em>\n    Inforocket.Com, Inc. v. Keen, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , CA No. 1:01-cv-05130-LAP (S.D.N.Y.), ECF No. 1 (\n   <em>\n    Inforocket Action\n   </em>\n   ). Inforocket served a complaint asserting infringement of the '836 patent on defendant Keen, Inc. (\"Keen\") on September 14, 2001. Affidavit of Service,\n   <em>\n    Inforocket Action\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Shortly thereafter, Keen brought its own infringement suit against Inforocket based on\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%206%2C223%2C165%2C\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 6,223,165,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   which proceeded before the same district judge as the\n   <em>\n    Inforocket Action\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Keen, Inc. v. Inforocket.Com, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , CA No. 1:01-cv-8226-LAP (S.D.N.Y.) (\n   <em>\n    Keen Action\n   </em>\n   ). In the\n   <em>\n    Keen Action\n   </em>\n   , the district court granted Inforocket's motion for summary judgment of noninfringement and entered judgment in favor of Inforocket in July 2002.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order Granting Inforocket's Mot. for Summ. J.,\n   <em>\n    Keen Action\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 47; Judgment,\n   <em>\n    Keen Action\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 48. Keen filed a Notice of Appeal to this court on August 23, 2002. Notice of Appeal,\n   <em>\n    Keen Action\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In 2003, while its appeal was pending, Keen acquired Inforocket as its wholly-owned subsidiary. Thereafter, subject to the terms of the merger, Inforocket and Keen stipulated to a voluntary dismissal of both suits \"without prejudice,\" and the district court dismissed both actions on the same day-March 21, 2003.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stipulation and Order of Dismissal,\n   <em>\n    Inforocket Action\n   </em>\n   ; Stipulation and Order of Dismissal,\n   <em>\n    Keen Action\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Later in 2003, Keen changed its name to Ingenio, Inc. (\"Ingenio\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On April 20, 2004, Ingenio requested\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   reexamination of claims 1-21 of the '836 patent. The Director of the Patent &amp; Trademark Office (\"Director\") granted Ingenio's request, and issued an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   reexamination certificate on December 30, 2008. Several claims were cancelled, others were determined to be patentable as amended, and new claims 22-30 were added.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Meanwhile, in late 2007, non-party AT&amp;T announced its plan to acquire Ingenio and integrate Ingenio and YellowPages.com, also owned by AT&amp;T. In January 2008, Ingenio was acquired by a subsidiary of AT&amp;T Inc. and its name was changed to Ingenio, LLC (also \"Ingenio\"). In April\n   2012, AT&amp;T sold its interest in YellowPages.com and Ingenio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   CTC subsequently acquired the '836 patent, and, on May 29, 2012, asserted patent infringement claims against multiple parties in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. Compl.,\n   <em>\n    Click-to-Call Techs. LP v. AT&amp;T, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:12-cv-00465-LY (W.D.

Tex.), ECF No. 1 (\n   <em>\n    Oracle Action\n   </em>\n   ). Among the defendants named in the\n   <em>\n    AT&amp;T Action\n   </em>\n   was Ingenio, which subsequently changed its name to YP Interactive LLC (\"YP Interactive\"). Both the\n   <em>\n    AT&amp;T Action\n   </em>\n   and the\n   <em>\n    Oracle Action\n   </em>\n   are currently stayed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   B. The IPR Proceedings\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On May 28, 2013, Ingenio, together with Oracle Corp., Oracle OTC Subsidiary LLC, and YellowPages.com LLC (together, \"Petitioners\" or \"Appellees\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed a single IPR petition challenging claims of the '836 patent on anticipation and obviousness grounds. CTC filed its Preliminary Response on August 30, 2013, contending, among other things, that \u00a7 315(b) statutorily barred institution of IPR proceedings, and that Ingenio lacked standing under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=37%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2042.101\">\n    37 C.F.R. \u00a7 42.101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). In its Preliminary Response, CTC presented evidence that Ingenio was served with a complaint alleging infringement of the '836 patent in 2001.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Board held a conference call with counsel for CTC and Petitioners in September 2013, in part to discuss CTC's \u00a7 315(b) argument. The Board then issued an order pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=37%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2042.5\">\n    37 C.F.R. \u00a7 42.5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   in which it requested additional briefing addressing the terms of the dismissal of the\n   <em>\n    Inforocket Action\n   </em>\n   . Both parties submitted additional briefing in compliance with the Board's request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Board issued its Institution Decision on October 30, 2013. With respect to the \u00a7 315(b) issue, the Board acknowledged that Ingenio was served with a complaint alleging infringement of the '836 patent on June 8, 2001 and found CTC's timeline of events \"helpful in determining whether Ingenio, LLC is barred from filing an\n   <em>\n    inter partes\n   </em>\n   review of the '836 patent.\" J.A. 287. The Board then recited the language of \u00a7 315(b), and stated that the \"statute requires that the service date of the complaint be more than one year before the petition was filed-in this case more than one year before May 28, 2013.\" J.A. 288.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Notwithstanding the above, the Board concluded that CTC \"has not established that service of the complaint in the [\n   <em>\n    Inforocket Action\n   </em>\n   ] bars Ingenio, LLC from pursuing an\n   <em>\n    inter partes\n   </em>\n   review for the '836 patent\" because that infringement suit was \"dismissed voluntarily without prejudice on March 21, 2003, pursuant to a joint stipulation under Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a).\" J.A. 288-89. The Board wrote that \"[t]he Federal Circuit consistently has interpreted the effect of such dismissals as leaving the parties as though the action\n   had never been brought,\" citing this court's decisions in\n   <em>\n    Graves v. Principi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9343672,9413534\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/294/1350/\">\n    294 F.3d 1350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fed. Cir. 2002), and\n   <em>\n    Bonneville Associates, Ltd. Partnership v. Barram\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"762786,11785451\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/165/1360/\">\n    165 F.3d 1360\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fed. Cir. 1999). J.A. 289. The Board also relied on Wright &amp; Miller's Federal Practice and Procedure treatise for the proposition that, \"as numerous federal courts have made clear, a voluntary dismissal without prejudice under Rule 41(a) leaves the situation as if the action never had been filed.\" J.A. 289 (quoting 9 Wright, Miller, Kane, and Marcus, Federal Prac. &amp; Proc. Civ. \u00a7 2367 (3d ed.) ). The Board concluded by determining that \"the dismissal of the infringement suit brought by Inforocket against Keen-now Ingenio, LLC-nullifies the effect of the service of the complaint and, as a consequence, does not bar Ingenio, LLC or any of the other Petitioners from pursuing an\n   <em>\n    inter partes\n   </em>\n   review of the '836 patent.\" J.A. 289. In light of this determination, the Board did not address the following two contingent questions: (1) whether the patent at issue in the\n   <em>\n    Inforocket Action\n   </em>\n   is the same patent at issue in the IPR due to amendments made in the interim; and (2) whether \u00a7 315(b)'s time bar should be determined on a \"petitioner-by-petitioner\" basis. J.A. 289-90.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   CTC requested rehearing of this \u00a7 315(b) determination, but the Board denied its request. CTC filed its Patent Owner Response on January 16, 2014, addressing the merits of Petitioners' unpatentability arguments and again requesting dismissal of the petition because the Board lacked statutory authority to review the '836 patent under \u00a7 315(b), and because Petitioners lacked standing under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=37%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2042.101\">\n    37 C.F.R. \u00a7 42.101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Board issued its Final Written Decision on October 28, 2014, reaffirming its conclusion that Petitioners were not barred from filing an IPR petition by stating that, \"because [the\n   <em>\n    Inforocket Action\n   </em>\n   ] was dismissed without prejudice, Federal Circuit precedent interprets such a dismissal as leaving the parties in the same legal position as if the underlying complaint had never been served.\"\n   <em>\n    Final Written Decision\n   </em>\n   at *7. The Board also determined that claims 1, 2, 8, 12, 13, 15, 16, 19, 22, 23, 26, 29, and 30 either were anticipated by or would have been obvious in view of certain prior art references.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=37%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2042.101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=37%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2042.101\">\n    at *14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Black's Law Dictionary defines \"serve\" as \"[t]o make legal delivery of (a notice or process)\" or \"[t]o present (a person) with a notice or process as required by law,\" and defines \"service\" as \"[t]he formal delivery of a writ, summons, or other legal process[.]\" Black's Law Dictionary 1491 (9th ed. 2009).

Legislative History\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The legislative history of \u00a7 315(b) further supports the understanding that its time bar concerns only the date on which the complaint was formally served. For example, during the March 2011 Senate debates, Senator Kyl made clear that, under the version of \u00a7 315(b) then being considered, \"if a party has been sued for infringement and wants to seek inter partes review, he\n   <em>\n    must do so\n   </em>\n   within 6 months of\n   <em>\n    when he was served\n   </em>\n   with the infringement complaint.\" 157 Cong. Rec. S1375 (daily ed. Mar. 8, 2011) (statement of Sen. Kyl) (emphases added). This unequivocal reference to the date on which an accused infringer was served suggests that Congress did not contemplate subsequent events \"nullifying\" \u00a7 315(b)'s time bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The legislative history also clarifies that Congress chose the date of service, as opposed to some other event, as the trigger for \u00a7 315(b)'s time bar because service of a complaint is the seminal notice-conferring event in a district court action. As the Supreme Court has explained, \"the core function of service is to supply\n   <em>\n    notice\n   </em>\n   of the pendency of a legal action, in a manner and at a time that affords the defendant a fair opportunity to answer the complaint and present defenses and objections.\"\n   <em>\n    Henderson v.

During the September 2011 Senate debates, Senator Kyl offered the following justification for extending the previously contemplated six-month time bar to one year. He observed that companies, in particular those in the high-technology sector, \"are often sued by [patentees] asserting multiple patents with large numbers of vague claims, making it difficult to determine in the first few months of the litigation which claims will be relevant and how those claims are alleged to read on the defendant's products.\" 157 Cong. Rec. S5429 (daily ed. Sept. 8, 2011) (statement of Sen. Kyl). Recognizing that \"[c]urrent law imposes no deadline on seeking inter partes reexamination,\" he reasoned that, \"in light of the present bill's enhanced estoppels, it is important that the section 315(b) deadline afford defendants a\n   <em>\n    reasonable opportunity to identify and understand\n   </em>\n   the patent claims that are relevant to the litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11746082\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/654/#p672\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).

Instead, the provision asks on what date the petitioner, real party in interest, or privy of the petitioner \"is served with a complaint alleging infringement\n   <em>\n    of the patent\n   </em>\n   ,\" making clear that the timeliness analysis is to be made with reference to \"the patent.\" The Director agrees with this conclusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Intervenor Second Suppl.

We have held that, \"in the absence of a clear showing that such a material difference in fact exists in a disputed patentable reexamination claim, it can be assumed that the reexamined claims will be a subset of the original claims and that no new cause of action will be created.\"\n   <em>\n    Senju Pharm.

In Petitioners' view, these arguments are relevant because, if these entities\n   <em>\n    had\n   </em>\n   filed separate petitions, those petitions would not have been time barred under \u00a7 315(b). Moreover, they submit that,\n   <em>\n    had\n   </em>\n   YP Interactive filed a separate petition, the Director\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   have joined its petition with the hypothetical non-barred petitions pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20315\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), rendering any error in the Board's \u00a7 315(b) determination vis-\u00e0-vis YP Interactive harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   We reject these efforts to separate YP Interactive from the other Petitioners to save the petition as to the latter. We need not scrutinize the legal relationships between\n   YellowPages.com, Oracle Corporation, and Oracle OTC Subsidiary LLC, on the one hand, and Ingenio/YP Interactive, on the other, to address Petitioners' arguments.

Both the statute and the regulation ask only two questions: (1) when was \"the petition\" filed; and (2) when was \"the petitioner,\" the petitioner's real party in interest, or a privy of the petitioner served with a complaint? They do not differentiate between multiple petitioners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   We read section 315(b), as implemented by the existing regulation, to apply petition-by-petition, not petitioner-by-petitioner, with the collection of petitioners on a single petition treated as a unit indistinguishable from each member of that collection. This reading of the statutory and regulatory reference to the singular \"the petitioner\" for the one-year time bar is supported by the fact that, in the same statutory scheme, Congress expressly recognized the possibility of multiple petitioners and permitted separate treatment of them for different purposes.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20317\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (addressing continuation of IPR as to some petitioners after dismissal of others). In concluding that this is the best reading of the statute and its parroting regulation, we are not deciding whether the statute is ambiguous and could permissibly be implemented through a different regulation providing for separate treatment of multiple petitioners in assessing timeliness under the one-year time bar-a distinct question that would arise if the Director newly adopted such a regulation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Cable &amp; Telecomms.

The Director was therefore barred from instituting this IPR based on this petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Because this IPR was not instituted properly, the final written decision was entered contrary to a statutory command and must be set aside. Petitioners cite nothing to support a conclusion that the error in instituting on this petition could be deemed harmless just because a different petition might have been filed that would have permitted institution of a different IPR to review the same patent claims. Indeed, that circumstance would often be the case, since any \"person who is not the owner of a patent\" may file a petition for an IPR.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20311\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

Petitioners' \u00a7 315(c) theory would seem to be that the petition may be viewed as having been filed solely by the Oracle and YellowPages.com petitioners and merely joined by YP Interactive, so that the timeliness determination could disregard YP Interactive. Petitioners' \u00a7 317(a) theory would seem to be that YP Interactive might be dropped from the IPR, leaving only the other petitioners, as to which the Board may continue.

Although \u00a7 315(b) provides that its time bar \"shall not apply to a request for joinder under subsection (c),\" it is undisputed that no such \"request for joinder\" was made in this case. Indeed, the regulation governing joinder requires that \"[a]ny request for joinder\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   be filed ... no later than one month after the institution date of any [IPR] for which joinder is requested.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=37%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2042.122\">\n    37 C.F.R. \u00a7 42.122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (emphasis added).

The fact that Congress afforded petitioners the opportunity to settle with patent owners after institution does not address the predicate question of whether the IPR was properly instituted in the first place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Further support for our reading of \u00a7 315(b) is found in decisions of the Board's own panels.

Dec. 28, 2015), Paper No. 10, the panel con-fronted a situation involving multiple petitioners seeking institution of an IPR, in which some but not all of the petitioners were time-barred. In that case, CoxCom was the only petitioner that was not served with a complaint more than one year before the IPR petition was filed. 2015 Pat. App. LEXIS 12695, at *19. The petitioners argued that, because CoxCom was not time-barred, \u00a7 315(b) should not apply to the jointly filed IPR petition.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%203276880\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Board rejected this argument based on the reasoning set forth in an earlier decision,\n   <em>\n    PNC Bank, N.A. v.

June 3, 2014), Paper No. 19, in which the Board denied institution of CBM review where PNC Bank was \"both a petitioner ... and a real party in interest,\" and previously filed a civil action challenging the validity of claims of the challenged patent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. This set of facts resulted in institution being barred under \u00a7 325(a)(1), notwithstanding that other named petitioners were not barred by this provision.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Board held that, as a result, \"\u00a7 325(a)(1) precludes institution of a review in this proceeding,\" notwithstanding that other named petitioners were not barred by this provision.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Notably, the Board also considered, but rejected, the petitioners' argument that \u00a7 325(a)(1) would not bar institution if PNC were to \"forswear all further control and participation in this case\" or have adverse judgment entered against it, permitting the other petitioners to proceed without its involvement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Board reasoned that, because \"PNC has already exerted substantial control over the case\" and because \"granting PNC's request for adverse judgment would not obviate the control that PNC has already exerted in this proceeding by its filing of the Petition,\" ruling upon PNC's motion for judgment \"would not alter [its] conclusion that \u00a7 325(a)(1) precludes institution of a CBM review as requested in the Petition.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Turning back to\n   <em>\n    Terremark\n   </em>\n   , the Board there wrote that the non-CoxCom petitioners, like PNC, \"already have exerted substantial control over the case by participating in filing the Petition, appointing\n   counsel, etc.,\" and therefore \"[t]he presence of CoxCom ... does not remove the statutory bar.\" 2015 Pat. App. LEXIS 12695, at *21. Here, too, \"removing\" Ingenio/YP Interactive from the IPR would not alter the fact that it has participated for several years in this proceeding in violation of \u00a7 315(b). Appellees' unsupported assertion that there is nothing about the relationship between these parties that indicates control over the other joint petitioners by Ingenio/YP Interactive does not change our view. Where the parties choose to be joint petitioners in a single petition, the petition must-under current law-be assessed in light of that choice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   In conclusion, to the extent Petitioners rely on \u00a7\u00a7 315(b), 315(c), and 317(a) to argue that the Board's institution of IPR proceedings in this case was \"harmless,\" we have made clear that \"[t]he timely filing of a petition under \u00a7 315(b) is a condition precedent to the Director's authority to act\"-indeed, it \"sets limits on the Director's statutory authority to institute.\"\n   <em>\n    Wi-Fi One\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267278\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/878/1364/\">\n    878 F.3d at 1374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Neither Petitioners nor CTC seek a remand for further Board proceedings. That fact is significant not only because of the IPR regime's general policy of expedition,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20314\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), 316(a)(11), but also because the IPR regime creates \"a party-directed, adversarial process\" rather than an \"agency-led, inquisitorial process,\"\n   <em>\n    SAS\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611230,12611231\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1348/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 1355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But the Director identifies no material facts requiring further development on remand. And, the Director has not explained exactly what the Board might wish to, or be able to, consider on remand. The issue in this case thus raises only a legal question, and under current law, including the current regulation, the answer to the legal question is already determined in this opinion. The Board must follow the governing regulations,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Crediford v.

It is conceivable that the Director might promulgate a new regulation during remand-though the Director has not even taken a position on this issue, much less suggested that a regulation is on the horizon, and there would be a question about retroactive application of any such changed regulation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bowen v.

Here I add a few thoughts on why I am unpersuaded by the key rationales set forth in the dissent from the court's en banc holding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The en banc issue is governed by statutory language that, as the panel opinion explains, is plain in its meaning. In September 2001, Ingenio (then called Keen) was served with a complaint asserting that it infringed the '836 patent, and there is no dispute about the content of the complaint or the propriety of service. In 2013, Ingenio filed a petition for an inter partes review (IPR)-far more than one year after the 2001 service. With respect to the en banc issue, those facts make \u00a7 315(b)'s time bar applicable by its plain terms. Nothing in that language makes relevant whether the 2001 complaint was eventually dismissed voluntarily without prejudice; the fact that service occurred does not change when the complaint (or action) is later dismissed, whether voluntarily or otherwise, and whether with or without prejudice to the right to file another action on the same claims. No other provision of the statute calls for a different conclusion. Indeed, whereas Congress in \u00a7 315(a)(2)(C) specifically addressed the effect of a voluntary dismissal of an IPR petitioner's own district court complaint challenging a patent, Congress left \u00a7 315(b) unmodified by any language addressed to dismissals of patentees' complaints.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   This is not a case where the scope of a word or phrase in the statute, considered alone and in context, \"may be open to competing interpretations\" as in\n   <em>\n    Kasten v.

That is a mistake here because the federal courts do not\n   <em>\n    always\n   </em>\n   treat a voluntary, without-prejudice dismissal as leaving the dismissed action without legal effect. Only for some purposes does a voluntary, without-prejudice dismissal leave the dismissed action without legal effect, as if it had never been brought; for other purposes, the dismissed action continues to have legal\n   effect. And the legal effect at issue for \u00a7 315(b) -triggering the start of a clock for filing an action-has never been in the first category. The Director has noted that he knows of no case holding that a voluntary, without-prejudice dismissal of a complaint nullifies the statutory effect of the filing of that complaint (or, here, of its service) of starting a clock on initiating another proceeding. Oral Arg. at 30:08-31:20. We cannot soundly infer a nontextual exception to \u00a7 315(b)'s plain-meaning application based on a nullification principle that has not been applied, and certainly is not established, in the clock-starting situation present here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Some of this court's and other courts' cases deny certain legal effects to the filing of a complaint later voluntarily dismissed without prejudice. One such effect concerns what is needed to\n   <em>\n    satisfy\n   </em>\n   (or toll) a time limit on initiating an action or appeal. The rationale is simple. A particular case or appeal must\n   <em>\n    itself\n   </em>\n   be initiated within a prescribed time. A filing that initiated an earlier case or appeal, if voluntarily dismissed without prejudice, does not meet, or toll the running of the clock for meeting, the time limit for filing the document that initiates the later (even substantively identical) case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   This court so held in\n   <em>\n    Bonneville II\n   </em>\n   , a government-contract dispute in which Bonneville timely appealed to the General Services Administration Board of Contract Appeals; voluntarily dismissed that appeal to pursue relief in the Claims Court instead; was denied a forum for lack of jurisdiction there (as this court held in\n   <em>\n    Bonneville Assocs. v.

A legal effect of that type would be at issue if an IPR petitioner filed a petition within the one-year period, voluntarily dismissed the petition without prejudice, then filed another IPR petition outside the period: the earlier (timely) petition would be disregarded in assessing the timeliness of the later petition. Here, there were no successive IPR petitions, and the issue is not whether a voluntarily dismissed filing could be treated as satisfying the one-year rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Rather, the issue is whether the 2001 service of a complaint asserting that Ingenio infringed the '836 patent should be treated as losing its clock-\n   <em>\n    starting\n   </em>\n   legal effect for filing an IPR before the Board, just because the properly served complaint was later voluntarily dismissed without prejudice. None of the just-cited cases involved that legal effect. Indeed, while those cases insist on\n   <em>\n    enforcing\n   </em>\n   a time limit on initiating legal proceedings for the same or similar claims brought by the same party in (usually) the same forum, the Director's position here would have the opposite effect of nullifying a time limit-and doing so based on the filing of different claims (invalidity, not infringement) by a different party (accused infringer, not patent owner) in a different forum (Board, not district court). In multiple ways, then, the main line of authority invoking the \"as if never brought\" rationale does not apply to the circumstances addressed by \u00a7 315(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   The clock-starting effect that is at issue here is also different from certain other legal effects that are denied to a complaint once it has been voluntarily dismissed without prejudice. Notably, once a complaint has been voluntarily dismissed without prejudice, most further action in the very case initiated by that complaint is neither required nor permitted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Relatedly, as indicated by the \"without prejudice\" language, invocation of issue or claim preclusion is generally not available based on the action that was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Those legal effects are\n   not what is at stake here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   As just set forth, although a voluntary, without-prejudice dismissal has been held to eliminate some legal effects of a dismissed action, the clock-starting effect of \u00a7 315(b) is not among them. Nor does the law recognize a universal nullification rule that such a dismissal eliminates all legal effects of a dismissed action. To the contrary, in various circumstances, such a dismissed action has continuing legal effects,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   treated as if it had never been brought.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   For example, Rule 41 itself makes clear that a first voluntary dismissal has an effect in forbidding a without-prejudice dismissal of a second action \"based on or including the same claim.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(1)(B). Rule 41 adds that a first such dismissal may give rise to a court-imposed requirement that the costs of the first action be paid as a precondition to litigation of a second action based on or including the same claim against the same defendant. Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(d). And a voluntary, without-prejudice dismissal may give rise to costs and fees under Rule 11.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Wright &amp; Miller, \u00a7\u00a7 1336, 2367.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Continuing effects are also evident in sources outside the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. For example, as the Director appears to acknowledge, the filing of a patent infringement complaint, even if later voluntarily dismissed, can play a role, even a definitive role, in proving the defendant's knowledge of the patent if the defendant is later charged with willful infringement. Intervenor's Second Supp. Br. 8 (\"[D]ismissing a complaint without prejudice could have ongoing legal consequences because, for example, the notice turns a defendant's unwitting actions into intentional ones.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 201(b)(2) (allowing judicial notice of facts from \"sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned\"). And as the panel opinion notes, the filing of such a complaint, though later voluntarily dismissed, has formed the basis for declaratory judgment jurisdiction where the initial defendant later brings a validity challenge: the initial action by the patentee may establish the necessary case or controversy for the later action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    TransWeb, LLC v. 3M Innovative Props.

Cir. 1995). The earlier actions were not treated as if never brought. And in\n   <em>\n    Bonneville I\n   </em>\n   , this court held that the Claims Court lacked jurisdiction over Bonneville's claim because Bonneville had initially brought an appeal to the Board and had therefore elected that forum-even though Bonneville had later obtained a voluntary, without-prejudice dismissal of its Board appeal.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"771313,11308733\" index=\"248\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/43/649/\">\n    43 F.3d at 651, 653-55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The earlier action, though it had been voluntarily dismissed without prejudice, blocked the Claims Court case-the opposite of being treated as if it had never been brought.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   In short, the background law on the nullification effect of a voluntary, without-prejudice dismissal is a mixed bag, and it does not state a near-monolithic rule with only aberrational exceptions. Some effects are nullified, some not. More particularly, it is anything but established-in fact, the Director has acknowledged the absence of any authority holding-that such a dismissal nullifies the legal effect at issue here: a clock-starting effect prescribed by statute. In these circumstances, I conclude, there is no basis in the asserted background law for overriding the plain meaning of \u00a7 315(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   When the Director moves beyond his argument about background law, he presents nothing to indicate a clear congressional intent contrary to the plain meaning. Legislative history indications of congressional policy at most establish that \u00a7 315(b) is generally based on an assessment of the period suitable for a formally accused infringer (or privies or real parties in interest) to shape any IPR petition after formally receiving notice of a patentee's charges of infringement, with the patentee and district courts thereafter given repose against IPR petitions filed by that accused infringer (or privies or real parties in interest).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   157 Cong. Rec. S5429 (daily ed. Sept. 8, 2011) (statement of Sen. Kyl) (stating that the \" section 315(b) deadline afford[s] defendants a reasonable opportunity to identify and understand the patent claims that are relevant to the litigation\"); H.R. Rep. No. 112-98, at 48 (2011),\n   <em>\n    reprinted in\n   </em>\n   2011 U.S.C.C.A.N. 67, 78 (ex-pressing concern about use of IPR proceedings as a \"tool[ ] for harassment\" by \"repeated litigation and administrative attacks\"). Those policies do nothing to undermine the plain meaning of the text: a bright-line rule of one year from service is a sensible prescription for serving those purposes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   The dissent suggests that, when an action is voluntarily dismissed without prejudice, \"the accused infringer is led to think that the controversy has dissipated\" and \"the notice function of the filing is effectively eliminated.\" Dissent at 1354. Those suggestions, even if accepted on their own terms, do not establish the kind of incoherence or absurdity that would support adoption of an exception for voluntary dismissals without prejudice. Congress can sensibly choose a bright-line rule based on underlying notice concerns. In any event, the suggestions are, I think, weak on their own terms. The point of a dismissal \"without prejudice\" is to preserve, rather than eliminate, the ability of the plaintiff to sue the defendant again on the same claim. No defendant, if not given something more, such as a covenant not to sue, can reasonably understand a without-prejudice dismissal to give repose as to future assertion of that very patent; no defendant in that situation is entitled \"to think that the controversy has dissipated.\" Indeed, as already noted, the bringing of an infringement suit, even if later voluntarily dismissed, can play a role, even a decisive role, in establishing the case or controversy needed for the once-accused infringer to bring an action for a declaratory judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   The dissent and the Director (in the\n   <em>\n    Luminara\n   </em>\n   case to which the dissent refers) suggest another reason that the statutory purpose requires an exception to \u00a7 315(b) for service of a complaint that is later voluntarily dismissed without prejudice. Specifically, they suggest a possibility of manipulative abuse if \u00a7 315(b) is applied in accordance with its terms, without such an exception. Dissent at 1355-56; Oral Arg. at 19:45-20:22,\n   <em>\n    Luminara Worldwide, LLC v. Iancu\n   </em>\n   , Nos. 17-1629, -1631, -1633 (Fed Cir. Apr. 5, 2018). The scenario of abuse is this: A patent owner could sue many possible infringers, serve them with complaints, and then quickly and unilaterally dismiss all of those cases under Rule 41(a)(1)(A)(i), which applies before the filing of an answer or motion for summary judgment. Such a unilateral dismissal would start the one-year IPR clock for all such defendants under \u00a7 315(b), were there no exception. After the year had elapsed without any of those defendants filing an IPR challenge, the patent owner could again sue any of them on the same patent, without fear of an IPR initiation by any of them (or their privies or real parties in interest), though others could file IPR challenges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   This hypothesized scenario cannot support the suggested inference that Congress, to avoid such abuse, must have silently prescribed an exception to \u00a7 315(b) for voluntary dismissals without prejudice. Notably, the scenario is purely hypothetical, as far as we know. We have been pointed to no evidence that any patent owners have behaved in the way posited.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   \"[T]he Court rarely invokes [an absurd results] test to override unambiguous legislation.\"\n   <em>\n    Barnhart v.

U.S. Bureau of Citizenship &amp; Immigration Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5710267\" index=\"252\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/701/356/#p363\">\n    701 F.3d 356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 363-64 (11th Cir. 2012) (ruling that hypothetical scenarios did not show absurdity\n   sufficient to reject a provision's plain meaning).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   That is especially so because there are reasons to doubt the likely significance of the hypothesized scenario even beyond the fact that it has not yet shown up in reality. The scenario posits that the initially sued defendants, although already sued once on the patent, would decide to rely on the belief that they are substantially unlikely to be sued on it again-a premise that is dubious given that the initial dismissal was specifically without prejudice to the patentee's right to file again, there has been no covenant not to sue, and the posited legal stratagem for avoiding IPRs is apparent. Without such (doubtful) reliance, it is plausible that one or more of the defendants would initiate IPR challenges to the patent at issue within the one-year period, defeating the posited scheme of the patentee. The assumptions of legal ignorance, naivet\u00e9, or uniform fingers-crossed risk assessment seem strained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   The posited scenario also requires downplaying evident risks to the patentee of implementing the scheme. By suing many defendants in the first place, the patentee would be expanding the pool of persons objectively threatened by the patent, which would seem to increase the likelihood of an early IPR challenge and to lower the cost of an IPR for any individual defendant if the defendants file jointly. That risk to the patentee further diminishes the likelihood of the abuse scenario. So does the risk that the patentee would face sanctions-in the initial litigation or later litigation-for acting as posited in the scenario.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chambers v.

The suggested exception would also cover voluntary, without-prejudice dismissals under Rule 41(a)(1)(A)(ii) -which are within the control of the defendant (later petitioner)-and under Rule 41(a)(2) -which are within the control of the court. Unilateral manipulation is not possible under those provisions: for all of those dismissals, the defendant and the court have power to protect against the posited abuse.

The en banc court now agrees with the\n   <em>\n    Click-to-Call\n   </em>\n   panel and holds that section 315(b) applies, even when the earlier complaint was dismissed without prejudice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In our view, the use of traditional tools of statutory construction leads to a conclusion opposite to the en banc court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Section 315(b) provides that \"inter partes review may not be instituted if the petition requesting the proceeding is filed more than 1 year after the date on which the petitioner ... is served with a complaint alleging infringement of the patent.\" In our view, the Board's interpretation of the statute was correct, and section 315(b)'s time-bar should not apply when the underlying suit has been voluntarily dismissed without prejudice. We reach this conclusion for three reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   First, the panel opinion relies on the language of section 315(b) as being unambiguous, because, on its face, it does not exclude voluntary dismissals without prejudice. But, the meaning of \"service of a complaint\" is not on its face unambiguous. In closely comparable circumstances, the Supreme Court has held that it is necessary to look beyond the language, to the context and purpose of the statute.\n   <em>\n    Kasten v. Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Corp.\n   </em>\n   , involved language in the Fair Labor and Standards Act (the \"Act\").\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12457890,5910239\" index=\"271\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/1/\">\n    563 U.S. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12457890,5910239\" index=\"272\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/1/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12457890,5910239\" index=\"273\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/1/\">\n    179 L.Ed.2d 379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011).

In this context, the concept of service and filing seem to be equivalent. Section 315(b)'s phrase, \"served with a complaint,\" is almost the same as the phrase \"filed any complaint\" at issue in\n   <em>\n    Kasten\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Kasten\n   </em>\n   , the issue was whether the complaint could include written and oral complaints, whereas the issue here is whether the complaint could\n   include a complaint later voluntarily dismissed without prejudice.

One purpose of the statute was to require that the IPR petitioner file the IPR promptly after receiving notice of the patentee's claims through the filing of the infringement action. The panel opinion notes that Senator Kyl explained that the \"315(b) deadline afford[s] defendants a reasonable opportunity to identify and understand the patent claims that are relevant to the litigation.\" 157 Cong. Rec. S5429 (daily ed. Sept. 8, 2011) (statement of Sen. Kyl).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   While the panel opinion argues that the notice function supports their interpretation, in fact, the notice function would not be vindicated if the underlying complaint were voluntarily dismissed without prejudice. When an action is filed, and then later voluntarily dismissed, the accused infringer is led to think that the controversy has dissipated. In other words, the notice\n   function of the filing is effectively eliminated by the dismissal without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   As discussed earlier, in the comparable situation involving statutes of limitations, while the original filing provides notice to the defendant,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   that notice is nullified by a voluntary dismissal without prejudice, and the original filing does not toll the statute of limitations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Willard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3591423\" index=\"337\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/164/502/#p523\">\n    164 U.S. at 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3591423\" index=\"338\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/164/502/#p523\">\n    17 S.Ct. 176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, as in the limitations context, the underlying purpose of section 315(b) is not served by filing a complaint that is voluntary dismissed without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   The statute was designed to give the petitioner a full year after receiving notice of the filing of the action to file the IPR, so that the potential petitioner could be fully aware of the claims and products at issue in the infringement litigation. The one year time-bar was intended to go into effect only after the defendant knows \"which claims will be relevant and how those claims are alleged to read on the defendant's products.\" 157 Cong. Rec. S5429 (daily ed. 2011) (statement of Sen. Kyl). Despite the assertions to the contrary (Panel Op. 15-17), this purpose is thwart-ed by an early voluntary dismissal without prejudice. In that situation, the defendant is unlikely to have received the contemplated information, and that information will be of limited value, as the defendant has been led to believe that the underlying infringement action will no longer continue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   So too, one of the purposes of section 315(b) in setting a one year time period was to bar the filing of an IPR when, typically, the district court action would have already consumed the time and attention of the court and parties. We have pointed out that in the inter partes review context, the \"legislative history confirms ... 'Congress's desire to enhance the role of the PTO and limit the burden of litigation on courts and parties.' \"\n   <em>\n    Murata Mach. USA, Ltd. v. Daifuku Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5925667\" index=\"339\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/830/1357/#p1362\">\n    830 F.3d 1357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1362 (Fed.

Tex. 2015) ) (discussing AIA legislative history). However, the situations that result in a voluntary dismissal without prejudice do not implicate these concerns. This is because voluntary dismissals usually come early in the case, typically before the answer is filed or by agreement from both parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   Finally, the purposes of section 315(b) will be defeated if the patentee plaintiff is allowed to manipulate the filing of infringement actions in order to bar a future IPR challenge. Indeed, if dismissals without prejudice did not nullify the underlying complaint, patent owners would have an incentive to file suits alleging infringement and subsequently voluntarily dismiss these suits without prejudice after service of a complaint. Such actions would effectively begin the one year clock for the accused infringer to file an IPR, even when there was no longer an underlying infringement action. Congress could not have intended to provide a mechanism for such manipulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   Thus, we conclude that, contrary to the en banc holding, the section 315(b) time-bar should not apply when the underlying complaint alleging infringement has been voluntarily dismissed without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-185\">\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Jorge v.
