The district court remanded the action to state court on the ground that Swift failed to prove that the matter in controversy exceeded the sum or value of $5 million, as required for jurisdiction under CAFA. In reaching this conclusion, the court held that only attorneys' fees that had been incurred as of the date of removal could be included in the amount in controversy. We conclude that if a plaintiff would be entitled under a contract or statute to future attorneys' fees, such fees are at stake in the litigation and should be included in the amount in controversy. The defendant retains the burden, however, of proving the amount of future attorneys' fees by a preponderance of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Because the issues in this appeal arise from a defendant's removal of a case filed in state court to federal court, we begin with the relevant background principles for such a removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), a defendant may remove certain actions filed in state court to a district court so long as a federal court has jurisdiction over the action, and certain procedural requirements are met.

Fritsch filed this wage-and-hour class action in San Bernardino Superior Court. According to the third amended complaint filed in state court, Fritsch worked for Swift, a trucking and transportation company, as a local driver. He alleged that Swift denied him and other employees proper overtime pay, meal periods, and appropriate wage statements. Fritsch sought wages and premiums owed, prejudgment interest, statutory penalties, attorneys' fees under California Labor Code \u00a7\u00a7 218.5 and 1194,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and costs of suit. He also asked for equitable relief under California's unfair competition law and statutory damages under California's Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On October 18, 2017, Fritsch delivered a mediation brief to Swift. The brief included a damages chart that contained the following information:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 $1,806,080 Unpaid Overtime Wages\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 $361,216 Unpaid Double-time Wages\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 $531,404 Interest on Unpaid Overtime Wages\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 $948,192 Unpaid Meal Period Premiums\n   \u2022 $948,192 Unpaid Rest Period Premiums\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 $150,000 Attorneys' Fees and Costs (as of October 18, 2017)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022 $515,000 Wage Statement Penalties\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 $664,020 Waiting Time Penalties\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    Total:\n   </strong>\n   $5,924,104.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Fritsch also estimated that Swift faced PAGA penalties of $5,874,079.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On October 31, 2017, Swift filed a notice of removal in district court, alleging that the district court had jurisdiction under CAFA. To establish that the action exceeded $5 million, Swift relied on the damages chart. Subtracting estimated interest payments and PAGA penalties (which are not included in the amount in controversy,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2) ;\n   <em>\n    Yocupicio v.

In addition to the $150,000 in attorneys' fees and costs that had been incurred as of October 18, 2017 (according to the damages chart), Swift noted that the court could also recognize future attorneys' fees that would accrue over the course of the case. Based on Swift's estimate, such future fees would increase the amount in controversy to $6,553,375.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In determining its jurisdiction under CAFA, the district court first noted that the parties did not dispute that CAFA's minimum diversity and class numerosity requirements were met. The court rejected Fritsch's argument that the removal notice was untimely. The court reasoned that Fritsch's complaint did not establish the amount in controversy, and therefore Swift's first notice that Fritsch's claims were removable occurred when Swift received the damages chart on October 18, 2017. Swift timely removed the action within thirty days after receiving the chart.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Turning to the amount in controversy, the court held that because Fritsch's complaint did not include a claim for failure to provide rest periods, the entry in the damages chart-\"$948,192 Unpaid Rest Period Premiums\"-could not be included as part of the jurisdictional amount. With respect to the attorneys' fees, the court explained \"that when calculating attorneys' fees to establish jurisdiction, the only fees that can be considered are those incurred as of the date of removal.\" (internal quotations omitted).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court therefore included only the $150,000 of attorneys' fees that Fritsch had set forth in the damages chart as having been incurred prior to removal. The court held that Swift had not been able to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the amount in controversy exceeded $5 million; rather, Swift's evidence established that only $4,778,575 was at stake. Because this amount did not meet the minimum required by CAFA, the court held that it lacked jurisdiction, and remanded the action to the state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Swift timely petitioned this Court for permission to appeal under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201453\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   While the petition was pending, litigation proceeded in state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On April 20, 2018, we issued our decision in\n   <em>\n    Chavez v. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   , which, as explained in more detail below, held that \"the amount in controversy is not limited to damages incurred prior to removal-for example, it is not limited to wages a plaintiff-employee would have earned before removal (as opposed to after removal),\" but rather \"is determined by the complaint operative at the time of removal and encompasses all relief a court may grant on that complaint if the plaintiff is victorious.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516696\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/413/#p414\">\n    888 F.3d 413\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 414-15 (9th Cir. 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   We granted Swift's petition to appeal on June 11, 2018. Two days later, Swift filed a second notice of removal in district court, contending that our intervening decision in\n   <em>\n    Chavez\n   </em>\n   \"now demonstrates beyond any doubt that the amount in controversy in this action exceeds the jurisdictional minimum.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   We ordered the parties to submit supplemental briefing on whether Swift's second notice of removal rendered the present appeal moot. Shortly after we heard oral argument, Fritsch moved to remand Swift's second notice of removal on a number of grounds, including that it was untimely. Fritsch argued that our rule that a defendant can file a successive removal notice within 30 days after a change in law,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rea\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4070974\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/742/1234/#p1237\">\n    742 F.3d at 1237-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , did not help Swift, because Swift had filed its second removal order 59 days after we issued\n   <em>\n    Chavez\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   We first consider whether this appeal is moot due to Swift's second removal. There is no case or controversy, and an appeal becomes moot, when \"it is impossible for a court to grant any effectual relief whatever to the prevailing party.\"\n   <em>\n    Chafin v.

Fritsch contends that the present appeal is moot because the only relief available to Swift is a reversal of the district court's December 2017 remand order, which would merely return Swift to district court. Because Swift is already in district court, Fritsch argues, we cannot give it any effective relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Fritsch is correct that Swift's case is now pending in district court, which is the relief Swift seeks.

But while\n   <em>\n    Chavez\n   </em>\n   itself concerned a claim for future wage loss, its holding applies to any class of damages included in the amount in controversy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516696\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/413/#p414\">\n    888 F.3d at 418\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although we did not explicitly address attorneys' fees in\n   <em>\n    Chavez\n   </em>\n   , we noted that the amount in controversy \"may include 'damages ... as well as attorneys' fees awarded under fee shifting statutes.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516696\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/413/#p414\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516696\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/413/#p414\">\n    at 416\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Gonzales\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174578\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/840/644/#p648\">\n    840 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   648-49 ).

We may not depart from this reasoning to hold that one category of relief-future attorneys' fees-are excluded from the amount in controversy as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Moreover, we are confident that district courts are well equipped to determine whether defendants have carried their burden of proving future attorneys' fees, and to determine when a fee estimate is too speculative because of the likelihood of a prompt settlement. Unlike the Seventh Circuit, where the defendant need show only \"a reasonable probability\" that the amount in controversy exceeds the minimum,\n   <em>\n    Brill v.

We also require the defendant to make this showing with summary-judgment-type evidence,\n   <em>\n    Chavez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516696\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/413/#p414\">\n    888 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   416 ;\n   <em>\n    Corral v.

A district court may reject the defendant's attempts to include future attorneys' fees in the amount in controversy if the defendant fails to satisfy this burden of proof. Moreover, district courts have developed expertise in determining \"the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate\" when awarding attorneys' fees under a statute or contract authorizing recovery of \"reasonable attorneys' fees\" at the close of litigation.\n   <em>\n    Hensley v.

Given\n   district courts' expertise in evaluating litigation expenses and defendants' obligation to prove future attorneys' fees by a preponderance of the evidence, we do not share the Seventh Circuit's concern that calculating future attorneys' fees is inherently too speculative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   For the same reason, we reject Swift's argument that we should hold that, as a matter of law, the amount of attorneys' fees in controversy in class actions is 25 percent of all other alleged recovery. Swift argues that this per se rule is appropriate because, in common fund cases, we have estimated reasonable attorneys' fees to be 25 percent of the total recovery.\n   <em>\n    Vizcaino v. Microsoft Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9435960\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/290/1043/#p1047\">\n    290 F.3d 1043\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1047 (9th Cir. 2002) ;\n   <em>\n    Hanlon v.

Such a per se equitable rule is inapplicable in this context, however.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   As we have already explained, the defendant must prove the amount of attorneys' fees at stake by a preponderance of the evidence; we may not relieve the defendant of its evidentiary burden by adopting a per se rule for one element of the amount at stake in the underlying litigation. Moreover, a court's calculation of future attorneys' fees is limited by the applicable contractual or statutory requirements that allow fee-shifting in the first place.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Winterrowd v.
