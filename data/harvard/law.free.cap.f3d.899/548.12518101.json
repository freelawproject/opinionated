In the first, the Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry (\"DLI\") brought an administrative action against Minnesota Living Assistance, Inc. (\"Baywood\") for failing to pay overtime compensation to companionship-services employees in violation of the Minnesota Fair Labor Standards Act (\"MFLSA\"). In the second, the one before us today, Baywood sued in federal court the Commissioner and the Director of Labor Standards at the DLI, arguing that the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\") preempts the MFLSA and that Baywood therefore need not pay state penalties for any MFLSA violation. The district court\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   found that the\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   doctrine required it to abstain while the state proceeding was pending and dismissed the case.

But during the relevant time period, there were two pertinent differences between the statutes: (1) the FLSA standards were generally more protective than the MFLSA,\n   <em>\n    compare\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20206\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(C), 207(a)(1),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20177.24\">\n    Minn.

The DLI conducted an investigation into Baywood's practices and determined that Baywood had not paid its companionship-services employees the wages required by the MFLSA. The DLI issued a compliance order in May 2016. The order assessed a penalty of $1,000 for failure to keep records pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20177.30\">\n    Minn.

The order also indicated that Baywood should cease its illegal practices and comply with the MFLSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Baywood contested the compliance order, so, in August 2016, the DLI initiated a contested case proceeding before an administrative law judge (\"ALJ\") at the Minnesota Office of Administrative Hearings. In June 2017, the ALJ issued a report recommending that the DLI Commissioner enforce the compliance order as to backpay and liquidated damages but that he deny it as to the determination that Baywood failed to keep accurate records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   While the proceeding before the ALJ was pending, but before the June recommendation, Baywood filed suit in federal district court seeking (1) a declaration that the FLSA preempts the MFLSA and (2) injunctive relief prohibiting the DLI from further processing, investigating, or adjudicating its claims against Baywood. The DLI moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that the district court should abstain from exercising jurisdiction under\n   <em>\n    Younger v.

We address these three lines of inquiry in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   We begin by determining whether the underlying enforcement proceeding against Baywood fits within one of the three categories where\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   abstention applies.\n   <em>\n    Sprint\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12702001\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/571/69/\">\n    571 U.S. at 72-73, 78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12584672,12702001\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/584/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   abstention is applicable only where the state proceeding qualifies as (1) a criminal prosecution, (2) a civil enforcement proceeding that is akin to a criminal prosecution, or (3) a proceeding implicating a state's interest in enforcing the orders and judgments of its courts.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12584672,12702001\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/584/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Here, the parties agree that a civil enforcement proceeding resembling a criminal prosecution is the only abstention category into which the DLI proceeding could fit.\n   <em>\n    Sprint\n   </em>\n   identified three important characteristics for recognizing a civil proceeding that resembles a criminal prosecution: (1) the action was initiated by the State in its sovereign capacity; (2) the action involves sanctions against the federal plaintiff for some wrongful act; and (3) the action includes an investigation, often culminating in formal charges.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12702001\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/571/69/\">\n    571 U.S. at 79-80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12584672,12702001\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/584/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, the underlying proceeding meets all three criteria and thus falls within an applicable\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   category.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The DLI proceeding satisfies both the state-involvement and the investigation criteria because the action was initiated by the State, via the DLI, following an investigation into Baywood's failure to pay overtime wages to companionship-services employees. Baywood contests this conclusion by arguing that \"the case was initiated by an employee complaint about Baywood's nonpayment of overtime,\" rather than the State. According to Baywood, because the case was initiated by an employee, the DLI merely \"stepped in to settle the dispute between Baywood and its employees about overtime.\" Indeed, Baywood attempts to analogize the facts here to those in\n   <em>\n    Sprint\n   </em>\n   , where administrative proceedings were triggered by a private complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12702001\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/571/69/\">\n    571 U.S. at 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12584672,12702001\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/584/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But this analogy falls short.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Sprint\n   </em>\n   , \"[a] private corporation ... initiated the action[,] [n]o state authority conducted an investigation into Sprint's activities, and no state actor lodged a formal complaint against Sprint.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12702001\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/571/69/\">\n    571 U.S. at 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12584672,12702001\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/584/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under those circumstances, the Supreme Court concluded that Iowa's authority was merely \"invoked to settle a civil dispute between two private parties,\" and thus, the proceeding was not a civil proceeding akin to a criminal proceeding for purposes of\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12584672,12702001\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/584/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   By contrast, here, the DLI conducted the investigation, issued the compliance order, and brought the contested case proceeding against Baywood before the ALJ to enforce Minnesota law. The DLI was not merely an arbiter of a private dispute.

Under this view, the underlying proceeding satisfies the important-state-interest factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Baywood raises three counter arguments. First, it points to cases in which federal courts were found to be uniquely situated to adjudicate a claim even though it implicated a traditionally state-law matter. But those cases involved, at their core, non-state interests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barzilay v. Barzilay\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5764326\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/536/844/#p850\">\n    536 F.3d 844\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 850 (8th Cir. 2008) (addressing issues related to the Hague Convention on child abduction);\n   <em>\n    Ayers v.

Here, the state proceeding resolved a question of Minnesota wage and hour law. Second, Baywood claims that there can be no important state interest \"when the state law has been preempted and the state does not have the authority to regulate.\" But this argument assumes preemption when the very purpose of our inquiry is to determine whether we can address preemption.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In any case, the mere\n   <em>\n    allegation\n   </em>\n   of preemption does not undermine the propriety of abstention. Third, Baywood claims that finding an important state interest in this case would be the equivalent of finding an important interest any time a state enacts and enforces its own laws. But this fear is unfounded. Here, the Supreme Court has specifically confirmed the importance of the state interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morash\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605146\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/107/#p119\">\n    490 U.S. at 119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605146\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/107/#p119\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Because the underlying proceeding satisfies the first two layers of the abstention inquiry, we move to the final consideration: whether an exception to\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   applies. Even where the proceeding falls into a\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   category and satisfies the\n   <em>\n    Middlesex\n   </em>\n   factors, the Court in\n   <em>\n    NOPSI\n   </em>\n   left open the possibility that a \"facially conclusive\" claim of federal preemption may be sufficient to render abstention inappropriate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6214100\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/350/\">\n    491 U.S. at 367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6214100\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/350/\">\n    109 S.Ct. 2506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While many of our sister circuits have adopted such an exception to abstention, we have never addressed the question in those terms.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cedar Rapids Cellular Tel., L.P. v.

The courts that\n   have considered this question have found that preemption is facially conclusive if binding precedent already decided the issue or if it is otherwise \"readily apparent.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Woodfeathers, Inc. v.

In other words, preemption is not facially conclusive if it requires a \"detailed analysis.\"\n   <em>\n    Colonial Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co. v.

But Baywood cites no binding precedent deciding the issue, and we do not find preemption \"readily apparent.\" Although the MFLSA generally adopted a lower minimum wage and higher maximum hours than did the FLSA, the FLSA exempted companionship-services employees from its protection. Resolving the preemption question would require a detailed analysis of the relative protections of the two statutes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, as the district court correctly determined, preemption is not facially conclusive, and no exception to\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   abstention applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's decision to abstain.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    The Honorable David S.
