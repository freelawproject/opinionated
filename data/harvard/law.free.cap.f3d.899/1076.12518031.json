The Community argues that two provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act require the VA to reimburse it even absent an agreement defining the terms of reimbursement. The district court dismissed the Community's lawsuit after determining that the Veterans' Judicial Review Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20511\">\n    38 U.S.C. \u00a7 511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), deprived it of jurisdiction over the Community's claims.

We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Gila River Indian Community is a federally recognized American Indian tribe that occupies the Gila River reservation in Arizona. The Gila River Health Care Corporation (\"GRHC\") is a wholly owned tribal organization that provides health care services to eligible persons. The GRHC was formed pursuant to the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, which authorizes Indian tribes to contract with the federal government to provide services that were previously provided by the federal government.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205301\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 5301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   The health care that the GRHC provides is financed through funding agreements between the tribe and the Indian Health Service (\"IHS\"), an agency within the Department of Health &amp; Human Services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Relevant to this case, the Community provides health care services to Indian and non-Indian veterans who are entitled to receive services from the VA. The Community alleges that many veterans have opted to receive care through the GRHC, rather than through the VA, due to ongoing issues with the care provided at VA facilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2010, Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\"the ACA\"). Pub. L. No. 111-148,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=124%20Stat.%20119\">\n    124 Stat. 119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010). Two provisions of the ACA are relevant to this case. The first,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201623\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1623\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Health programs operated by the Indian Health Service, Indian tribes, tribal organizations, and Urban Indian organizations (as those terms are defined in section 1603 of this title) shall be the payer of last resort for services provided by such Service, tribes, or organizations to individuals eligible for such services through such programs, notwithstanding any Federal, State, or local law to the contrary.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Community argues that the effect of this provision is to guarantee that tribal health programs will pay for health care services only after other sources of funding, such as VA reimbursement, Medicare, Medicaid, or private health insurance, have been exhausted or have been shown to be unavailable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20136.61\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 136.61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The second provision, \u00a7 1645(a)(1), gives the Secretary of the VA authority to \"enter into (or expand) arrangements for the sharing of medical facilities and services between the Service, Indian tribes, and tribal organizations and the [VA].\" Section 1645(c) provides further that \"[t]he Service, Indian tribe, or tribal organization shall be reimbursed by the Department of Veterans Affairs or the Department of Defense ... where services are provided through the Service, an Indian tribe, or a tribal organization to beneficiaries eligible for services from either such Department, notwithstanding any other provision of law.\" The Community argues that \u00a7 1645(c) is designed to give Indian veterans flexibility in choosing where to receive health care services \"while ensuring that tribal budgets will not be drained when patients [choose] tribal services over care they could otherwise receive through the VA.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Instead of providing reimbursements directly under the ACA, the VA developed\n   template reimbursement agreements with the IHS, and it required recipients to enter into an agreement as a condition of receiving reimbursement. The Community argues that these template agreements improperly limit the scope of what it contends is a mandatory and self-executing right to reimbursement directly under the ACA. In the Community's view, the agreements, among other things, improperly require express consent by the VA to each reimbursement request, limit reimbursements to direct care services, and deny reimbursement to the Community for services provided to non-Indian veterans who receive treatment from the GRHC. The Community and the VA entered into lengthy negotiations, which failed to produce a mutually acceptable agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In March 2016, the Community filed suit against the VA and the Secretary. The Community alleged that the VA had violated \u00a7 1623(b) by \"forcing GRHC into a primary payer position on all services for which VA has refused to provide reimbursements.\" The Community further alleged that the VA violated\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201645\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1645\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) by refusing to process reimbursement requests and by conditioning reimbursement on entering into an agreement with the VA. The Community requested declaratory and injunctive relief, requiring reimbursement for services it had already provided to veterans as well as reimbursement for future services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The VA moved to dismiss the Community's complaint, arguing that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction under the Veterans' Judicial Review Act (\"VJRA\"), Pub. L. No. 100-687,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=102%20Stat.%204105\">\n    102 Stat. 4105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988), and that the complaint failed to state a claim. The VJRA provides that the Secretary of the VA \"shall decide all questions of law and fact necessary to a decision by the Secretary under a law that affects the provision of benefits by the Secretary to veterans.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20511\">\n    38 U.S.C. \u00a7 511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

The court noted that in\n   <em>\n    Veterans for Common Sense v.

The court did not reach the VA's alternative argument that the complaint failed to state a claim for relief under Rule 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Community appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   II. Standard of Review\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We review de novo a dismissal under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Warren v.

Discussion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The sole question presented in this appeal is whether \u00a7 511(a) bars the Community from bringing this suit in federal district court. Section 511(a) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   The Secretary shall decide all questions of law and fact necessary to a decision by the Secretary under a law that affects the provision of benefits by the Secretary to veterans or the dependents or survivors of veterans.

Shinseki\n   </em>\n   , we recognized that \u00a7 511(a), when read alongside provisions channeling claims through the Veterans Court and the Federal Circuit, \"demonstrate[s] that Congress was quite serious about limiting our jurisdiction over anything dealing with the provision of veterans' benefits.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3872768\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/678/1013/#p1025\">\n    678 F.3d at 1023\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To that end, \u00a7 511(a)\"extends not only to cases where adjudicating veterans' claims requires the district court to determine whether the VA acted properly in handling a veteran's request for benefits, but also to those [VA] decisions that may affect such cases.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3872768\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/678/1013/#p1025\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3872768\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/678/1013/#p1025\">\n    at 1025\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, the plain text of \u00a7 511(a) indicates that the bar applies not only to the VA's actual benefits decisions, but also to the VA's resolution of predicate \"questions of law and fact ... under a law that\n   <em>\n    affects\n   </em>\n   the provision of benefits.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20511\">\n    38 U.S.C. \u00a7 511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (emphasis added). However, \u00a7 511(a) allows the exercise of jurisdiction over certain facial constitutional challenges that require only a \"consideration of the constitutionality of the procedures in place,\" rather than \"a consideration of the decisions that emanate through the course of the presentation of those claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Veterans for Common Sense\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3872768\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/678/1013/#p1025\">\n    678 F.3d at 1034\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that \u00a7 511(a) did not strip jurisdiction over a facial procedural due process claim);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Recinto v.

The suit asks us to review the VA's determination that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201623\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1623\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and 1645(c) do not require it to reimburse the Community absent a sharing agreement. That determination is plainly a \"question of law ... necessary to a decision by the Secretary under a law that affects the provision of benefits by the Secretary to veterans.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20511\">\n    38 U.S.C. \u00a7 511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Further, the relief requested by the Community would clearly \"affect[ ] the provision of benefits\" by requiring the VA to reimburse the Community both retrospectively and prospectively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Community's arguments to the contrary are not persuasive. The Community first argues that its claims do not \"affect[ ] the provision of benefits\n   <em>\n    by\n   </em>\n   the Secretary\n   <em>\n    to\n   </em>\n   veterans.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20511\">\n    38 U.S.C. \u00a7 511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (emphasis added). The Community characterizes the ACA provisions as cost-shifting provisions that transfer the obligation to pay from one agency to another, but that do not\n   expand or diminish a veteran's entitlement to care. In the Community's view, its claims do not fall within \u00a7 511(a) because its lawsuit concerns reimbursement, rather than eligibility for services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   We do not read \u00a7 511(a) so narrowly. We recently rejected an argument very similar to the argument the Community makes here-that \u00a7 511(a) extends only \"to those claims addressing\n   <em>\n    entitlement\n   </em>\n   to benefits, rather than the manner in which those benefits [are] provided to eligible veterans.\"\n   <em>\n    Tunac v.

July 30, 2018). The relevant inquiry under \u00a7 511(a) is whether a suit would \"require[ ] the district court to review VA decisions that\n   <em>\n    relate to\n   </em>\n   benefits decisions, including any decision made by the Secretary in the course of making benefits decisions.\"\n   <em>\n    Veterans for Common Sense\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3872768\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/678/1013/#p1025\">\n    678 F.3d at 1025\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).
