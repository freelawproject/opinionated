Here the Director General of a Mexican government-owned corporation, Exportadora de Sal, S.A. de C.V. (\"ESSA\"), entered into a long-term, multi-million dollar contract with another Mexican corporation, Packsys, S.A. de C.V. (\"Packsys\"), to sell the briny residue from its salt production process. As it turned out, the Director General did not have actual authority to execute the contract, and when suit was filed in the United States, ESSA invoked sovereign immunity. Packsys, not having proof of actual authority, asks us to create a new rule that would extend the commercial activity exception to embrace activities of a foreign agent having only apparent authority to engage in them. The district court declined to do so, and so do we. Nor do we accept that principles of ratification or waiver improve Packsys's position. We therefore affirm the district court's dismissal of this case for lack of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Exportadora de Sal, S.A. de C.V., is a Mexican salt production corporation with its principal place of business at the Ojo de Liebre Lagoon on the west coast of Baja California Sur, Mexico.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ESSA, one of the world's largest producers of sea salt, is 51-percent owned by the government of Mexico. The other 49-percent ownership stake\n   is held by Mitsubishi Corporation. The Mexican government appoints a majority of ESSA's board of directors, and the company's Director General-a position equivalent to CEO-is appointed by the President of Mexico.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   ESSA produces sea salt using an evaporation method. Seawater is transferred from one pool to another, becoming more and more concentrated until salt begins to crystalize out of the water. At this point, the water is drained from the pool and the salt crystals are harvested. But the water that is drained from the collection pool-known as residual brine-contains high concentrations of chemicals and is potentially hazardous. What to do with this waste byproduct is thus a perpetual question for salt producers using this method of production. ESSA historically dumped its residual brine back into the Ojo de Liebre Lagoon, but public pressure over environmental damage led it to stop this practice. Since 1996, ESSA has stored its brine on land, at great and mounting expense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At a meeting of ESSA's board on October 28, 2013, the company's then-Director General, Jorge Lopez Portillo Basave (\"Portillo\"), presented the board with a proposal that would turn this liability into an asset: several companies had inquired about purchasing ESSA's residual brine for further processing into valuable industrial chemicals. At that meeting, the board passed Resolution 51, which approved Portillo's proposed \"comprehensive commercialization scheme\" for the brine. Resolution 51 states, in translation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   In keeping with Article 58(III) of the Federal Law on Government-Owned Entities, and due to the vital need to seek options for the use of the 17 million metric tons per year of residual brine originating from the process of producing sea salt, the approach is hereby approved for sales of residual brine in keeping with the criteria, factors, and alternatives presented for determination of sales prices on residual brine contained in the supporting report attached hereto as Annex 8.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Furthermore, and as part of any marketable transactions of residual brine that may take place, the Director General is hereby authorized to provide, assign, or transfer the related studies, investigations, records, or reports, that are not exclusively earmarked for use in the production process for natural salt (NaCl).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The board did not set prices or approve any particular contract for the sale of the brine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In December 2013 or January 2014, Portillo executed a contract for the sale of residual brine to Packsys, S.A. de C.V., a Mexican corporation with its principal place of business in Mexico. The contract fixes the price for the brine at $4.00 USD or $6.50 USD per ton, depending on the delivery site, and commits ESSA to sell at least ten million tons of brine per year for at least forty years. It provides that the brine will be delivered at one of two locations, both in Mexico. And it contains the following \"applicable law\" provision: \"For the event of controversy, interpretation or execution of the present agreement, the parties will subject themselves to the applicable federal laws of the City of Los Angeles California, thus renouncing to any other jurisdiction that might apply by virtue of their future or present domiciles.\" (as translated).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Portillo claims that he presented the executed contract to ESSA's board at a February 25, 2014 board meeting, and subsequently provided the board with additional updates on the arrangement. But multiple ESSA board members declared that the board never formally approved the contract, and Portillo's declaration does not contradict these statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Portillo was fired by ESSA's board in December 2014. Beginning in 2015, ESSA refused to honor Packsys's purchase orders for residual brine. And in September 2016, Mexican newspaper\n   <em>\n    La Jornada\n   </em>\n   reported that Portillo had been arrested by Mexican authorities for executing the residual brine contract without proper authority.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Packsys sued ESSA in California state court on September 17, 2015, asserting breach of the long-term contract for brine that Portillo had executed. ESSA removed the action to the United States District Court for the Central District of California and moved to dismiss it under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), on the grounds that the suit was barred by the FSIA, that Mexico was a better forum under the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   , and that international comity required that the case be decided in Mexico.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The district court dismissed the action on foreign sovereign immunity grounds without reaching the other arguments. It held that because ESSA is a foreign state for FSIA purposes and Packsys's lawsuit does not fit into any of the FSIA's exceptions, ESSA is immune from suit in the United States. Packsys timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In evaluating a district court's dismissal for lack of jurisdiction under the FSIA, \"[w]e review the district court's legal rulings de novo and its factual findings for clear error.\"\n   <em>\n    Terenkian v.

But Packsys argues that, notwithstanding its recital of the correct standards, the district court actually placed the burden of proof on Packsys. Packsys bases this contention on the fact that \"the district court repeatedly refers to Packsys's arguments and material cited before rejecting those arguments,\" as well as the district court's use of \"phrases such as 'Packsys attempts to establish' and 'Packsys does not offer any evidence to the contrary.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   But as ESSA rightly points out, the passages cited by Packsys are in portions of the district court's opinion in which it rejected Packsys's counterarguments, after the court had already concluded-presumably using the preponderance standard it had just articulated-that the FSIA exceptions did not apply. When viewed in context, the phrases highlighted by Packsys do not betray any improper allocation of the relative burdens of proof, especially given the district court's explicit recital of the correct standards.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reynoso v.

Mexican law provides that only ESSA's board may set prices for its products. Because ESSA is a government-owned entity, it is subject to Mexico's Federal Law on State-Owned Entities (Ley Federal de las Entidades Paraestatales, or \"LFEP\"). And Article 58(III) of the LFEP provides that \"[t]he governing bodies of parastatal entities\" shall have the authority \"[t]o fix and adjust the prices of the goods and services that the parastatal entity produces or provides,\" and that this authority \"may not be delegated.\" Diario Oficial de la Federaci\u00f3n [DOF] 14-05-1986, \u00faltimas reformas DOF 18-12-2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Moreover, ESSA's internal policies require a board resolution supported by a six-vote supermajority to enter a contract that will have a duration greater than two years. The same rule applies to contracts for the sale of goods worth more than $2 million USD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The contract with Packsys meets all three conditions for requiring a board resolution: it fixes a price for residual brine; it has a duration of at least forty years; and it provides for the sale of goods of at least $40 million per year-ten million tons multiplied by $4.00 per ton. Therefore, as the district court held, the Packsys contract required board approval under both Mexican federal law and ESSA's internal policies. And it is undisputed that the board never voted on or explicitly approved the Packsys contract either before or after its execution. Portillo therefore lacked actual authority to enter the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Nor did the ESSA board's Article 51, which approved a general \"approach ... for sales of residual brine\" provide Portillo with actual authority to execute the Packsys contract. Packsys does not really argue in its briefing that Article 51-or anything else, for that matter-empowered Portillo to make the contract on ESSA's behalf. Instead, it contends only that ESSA failed to carry its burden of disproving actual authority by a preponderance of the evidence. But ESSA submitted to the district court declarations from three ESSA board members and one substitute board member stating that the board never gave Portillo authority to enter the Packsys contract, either through Article 51 or otherwise. And, as the district court found, even Portillo's \"artfully worded declaration ... never states that the Board approved the Contract with Packsys, or that Resolution 51 fixed or set the actual price of residual brine.\" Furthermore, any disagreement between the parties' Mexican-law experts is not over the effect of Resolution 51, but over whether Mexican law requires board approval in the first place-which is a question of law for the court, not a fact that ESSA was required to prove.

Distinguishing\n   <em>\n    Phaneuf\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Much of Packsys's brief is devoted to an argument that attempts to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Phaneuf\n   </em>\n   's clear holding that acts undertaken with apparent-but not actual-authority are insufficient to trigger the FSIA's commercial activity exception. The core of Packsys's argument is that\n   <em>\n    Phaneuf\n   </em>\n   's actual-authority requirement should apply only to what it calls public and sovereign, as opposed to private and commercial, acts. We are not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Prior to the enactment of the FSIA, courts generally \"deferred to the decisions of the political branches ... on whether to take jurisdiction over actions against foreign sovereigns.\"\n   <em>\n    Rubin v.

Ratification\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Packsys argues that the commercial activity exception should apply for a separate reason: even if executing the contract was beyond Portillo's actual authority, ESSA's subsequent acts ratified the agreement. The district court rejected this theory on the basis that (a) only actual authority can trigger the commercial activity exception under\n   <em>\n    Phaneuf\n   </em>\n   , and (b) in any case, none of the actions cited by Packsys could constitute ratification.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Assuming without deciding that ratification could form the basis for application of the commercial activity exception, Packsys's argument fails. Under Mexican law and ESSA's policies, only an explicit board resolution could approve the Packsys contract. No resolution ratifying the contract was passed. Thus, any acts by individual officers or board members that purportedly show ratification would themselves have been ultra vires and therefore cannot satisfy the commercial activity exception under\n   <em>\n    Phaneuf\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Velasco\n   </em>\n   , 370 F.3d at 402 (rejecting a ratification argument under the commercial activity exception because \"Velasco has failed to offer any evidence that any Indonesian official with actual authority to issue the notes ... manifested an intention to ratify the notes\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    C.
