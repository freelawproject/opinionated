Bank &amp; Trust Co. v H. Frenkel, Ltd., </em>163 AD2d 154, 155). Moreover, the process server\u2019s log book was properly admitted into evidence as a business record, despite his failure to recall the specific events which occurred on the date that process was served (CPLR 4518 [a]).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">We have considered defendant\u2019s remaining arguments and find them without merit.
