We decline to review those contentions as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice <em>(see, </em>CPL 470.15 [6] [a]).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">We conclude, however, that the court erred in imposing a term of imprisonment for the third count, robbery in the first degree (Penal Law \u00a7 160.15 [4]), to run consecutively to the term of imprisonment for the first count, burglary in the first degree (Penal Law \u00a7 140.30 [4]). All other sentences were concurrent. Under the circumstances of this case, we conclude that those offenses were committed through a single act <em>(see, People v McCloud, </em>182 AD2d 835, 838, <em>lv denied </em>80 NY2d 906; <em>see also, People v Smiley, </em>121 AD2d 274, 275, <em>lv denied </em>68 NY2d 817; <em>People v Jackson, </em>73 AD2d 1060). Thus, we modify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>the sentence to direct that the term of imprisonment imposed for the third count of the indictment run concurrently to the term uf imprisonment imposed for the first count <em>(see, </em>Penal Law \u00a7 70.25 [2]).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-3\">There is no merit to defendant\u2019s contention that the sentence otherwise is harsh or excessive.
