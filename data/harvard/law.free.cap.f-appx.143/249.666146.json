After an evidentiary hearing on Nnani\u2019s petition for withholding of removal, pursuant to the INA, and request for CAT relief, the IJ concluded that Nnani was not eligible for withholding of removal because she previously was convicted of a drug trafficking offense involving a large quantity of drugs (117.6 grams of marijuana and 8.9 grams of heroin); she did not play a \u201cmerely peripheral\u201d role in the offense; and the drugs were kept in a house with Nnani\u2019s three small children. Thus, the IJ concluded Nnani had not presented a \u201crase case exception,\u201d within the meaning of <em>In re Y-L-, A-G-, R-S-R-, </em>2002 WL 358818, 23 I &amp; N Dec. 270, 276-77 (A.G.2002), meriting withholding of removal despite her prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-16\">As for CAT relief, Nnani\u2019s claim was based on a fear of retaliation by her in-laws for testimony she gave during her brother-in-law\u2019s trial for drug trafficking and a fear that her daughters would be circumcised if returned to Nigeria. The IJ found that Nnani had not satisfied the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>\u201cmore likely than not\u201d standard for CAT relief because she did not show that it was more likely than not that she would be suffer torture, <em>on behalf of the government, </em>if removed to Nigeria. The BIA, in turn, concluded that the IJ properly found Nnani ineligible for withholding of removal under the INA or CAT relief. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Pursuant to the REAL ID Act of 2005, H.R. 1268 109th Cong., Pub. L. No. 109-13, Div. B, 119 Stat. 231 (\u201cREAL ID Act\u201d), enacted on May 11, 2005, this Court\u2019s jurisdiction over the instant petition is governed by the permanent rules for judicial review, INA \u00a7 242, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a) (established by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d), Pub. L. No. 104-208, Div. C, 110 Stat. 3009), which became effective April 1, 1997.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The REAL ID Act further provides that its amendments to \u00a7 1252 \u201cshall take effect upon the date of the enactment of this division and shall apply to cases in which the final administrative order of removal, deportation, or exclusion was issued before, on, or after the date of the enactment of this division.\u201d REAL ID Act \u00a7 106(b), 119 Stat. at 311. Thus, the amendments apply to Nnani\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">Our jurisdiction to review denials of <em>CAT </em>relief arises only from our jurisdiction over final orders of removal. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(e)(1) (\u201c[T]here shall be no judicial appeal or review of any action, decision, or claim raised under [CAT] ..., except as part of the review of a final order of removal.\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, where we lack jurisdiction to review a final order of removal, we also are barred from considering any decisions with regard to CAT relief that were incident to that removal order.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">After enactment of the REAL ID Act, review of Nnani\u2019s petition continues to be governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), which prohibits the appellate courts from reviewing \u201cany final order of removal against an <em>alien who is </em>removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense,\u201d as defined by, <em>inter alia, </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B) (controlled substance offenses). However, the REAL ID Act amended \u00a7 1252(a)(2) to repeal the jurisdictional bar insofar as it affects \u201cconstitutional claims\u201d or \u201cquestions of law.\u201d REAL ID Act \u00a7 106(a)(l)(A)(iii) (codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(A)(2)(D)) (amending 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252 by adding a new provision, \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), as follows: \u201cJudicial Review of Certain Legal Claims\u2014Nothing in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>subparagraph (B) or (C), or in any other provision of this Act (other than this section) which limits or eliminates judicial review, shall be construed as precluding review of <em>constitutional claims or questions of law </em>raised upon a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this section.\u201d (emphasis added)).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">In this appeal, Nnani challenges the probative value of certain exhibits considered by the IJ at the evidentiary hearing and argues, among other things, that the IJ erred by placing too much weight on Nnani\u2019s own testimony and not fully considering the U.S. Department of State\u2019s 2004 Country Report on Nigeria and an International Family Planning Perspectives Report entitled \u201cRite of Passage Or Violation of Rights.\u201d Again, in order for us to have jurisdiction to review the denial of Nnani\u2019s petition for CAT relief, her petition for review must involve one of two types of issues: (1) constitutional claims, or (2) questions of law. <em>Id. </em>To the extent she challenges factual findings or credibility determinations, made at the administrative level by the IJ, or the IJ\u2019s rulings on admissibility and probative value, we do not have jurisdiction to grant review and dismiss her appeal as to those issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">As for Nnani\u2019s remaining arguments, which concern the sufficiency of the evidence to support her CAT claim, we are satisfied that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s denial of CAT relief and we discern nothing that would compel a reasonable factfinder to conclude that Nnani would be tortured by someone acting \u201cat the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1). Moreover, as found by the IJ, Nnani failed to demonstrate a \u201cwell founded fear\u201d of future persecution upon return to Nigeria, and it thus follows that Nnani failed to show that it was more likely than not she would be tortured on account of a protected factor. Accordingly, we can find no legal error in the denial of CAT relief and deny Nnani\u2019s petition as to the legal issues her petition raises.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b280-12\">. The IJ also denied her request for withholding of deportation under Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\u201d) \u00a7 243(h), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253(h), but Nnani does not challenge this finding on appeal. Accordingly, we treat any claims as to INA relief as waived. <em>See Rowe v. Schreiber, </em>139 F.3d 1381, 1382 n. 1 (11th Cir.1998) (issues not argued on appeal are deemed waived).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b281-6\">. Prior to the enactment of the REAL ID Act, our jurisdiction over this case was governed by the transitional rules for judicial review set out in IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c)(4), which applied to final orders issued after October 31, 1996, in cases that were begun before April 1, 1997. <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1276 (11th Cir.2001). Section 106(d) of the REAL ID Act provides the following: \"A petition for review filed under former section 106(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (as in effect before its repeal by [IIRIRA \u00a7 ]306(b)), shall be treated as if it had been filed as a petition for review under section 242 of the [INA] ..., as amended by this section____\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b281-8\">. <em>See also </em>Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 (\"FARRA\u201d), Pub.
