Biquet was granted a certificate of appealability (COA) by the district court on the issues whether trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to obtain medical records demonstrating that Biquet (1) suffered from asthma, thereby justifying his refusal to submit to a breathalyzer test and (2) had previously suffered two broken ankles, thereby explaining Biquet\u2019s failure to satisfactorily perform those roadside sobriety tests requiring balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-18\">Biquet fails to meet the standard for obtaining habeas relief on his certified claims of ineffective assistance. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1) &amp; (2); <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 697, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); <em>Dowthitt v. Johnson, </em>230 F.3d 733, 741 (5th Cir.2000). The introduction at trial of Biquet\u2019s medical records would have potentially had only a limited impact on the state\u2019s case. The record reveals other evidence of guilt presented at Biquet\u2019s trial that supports his conviction, including the arresting officers\u2019 observations of intoxication, Biquet\u2019s admission that he consumed alcoholic beverages prior to his arrest, and Biquet\u2019s inability to perform sobriety tests, including sobriety tests that did not require balance. Under these circumstances, Biquet fails to demonstrate prejudice resulting from counsel\u2019s alleged errors. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 697, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-19\">In a reply brief, Biquet asks this court to broaden the scope of the COA \u201cto include all issues presented that effected petitioners right to have received a fair trial.\u201d We reject this request as untimely. <em>See United States v. Williamson, </em>183 F.3d 458, 464 n. 11 (5th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Kimler, </em>150 F.3d 429, 431 (5th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Prince, </em>868 F.2d 1379, 1386 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b632-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
