In anticipation that the Supreme Court might hold that the United States Sentencing Guidelines were invalid under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), the district court imposed alternative sentences: one sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines and a second, discretionary sentence to take effect if the Sentencing Guidelines were invalidated. The government concedes that under the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), Henefield\u2019s sentence \u201cwas not harmless error\u201d because the district court would have imposed a lesser sentence under an advisory Sentencing Guideline scheme. Accordingly, we vacate Henefield\u2019s sentence and remand the case for resentencing. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511 (5th Cir.), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-21\">The record provides no support for Henefield\u2019s argument that his guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>1 F.3d 296, 302-03 (5th Cir.1993) (en banc). Henefield\u2019s argument that the district court erred by refusing to allow him to withdraw his plea is frivolous as Henefield did not make such a request in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-22\">AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b609-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
