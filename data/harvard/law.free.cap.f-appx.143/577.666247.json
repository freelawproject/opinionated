The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and dismissed Osborne\u2019s claims after finding that the decision to deny Osborne long term disability benefits was not arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. The district court denied Osborne\u2019s motion to proceed IFP on appeal and certified that her appeal was not taken in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>Osborne\u2019s financial affidavit establishes that she is unable to pay the costs of her appeal without undue hardship or deprivation of life\u2019s necessities. <em>See Adkins v. E.I. Du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>335 U.S. 331, 339, 69 S.Ct. 85, 93 L.Ed. 43 (1948). However, Osborne does not address the reasons for the district court\u2019s dismissal of her complaint. Osborne has failed to establish a nonfrivolous ground for appeal. <em>See Carson v. Polley, </em>689 F.2d 562, 586 (5th Cir.1982); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3). Her IFP motion is DENIED. As the appeal contains no nonfrivolous issues, it is DISMISSED. <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cm. R. 42.2. Osborne\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b599-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
