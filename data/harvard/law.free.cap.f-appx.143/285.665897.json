Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Gelinas argues that we should apply <em>Blakely </em>retroactively and invalidate his federal sentence for possession with the intent to distribute oxycodone. <em>Varela v. United States, </em>400 F.3d 864 (11th Cir.2005), controls squarely the question Gelinas\u2019s certificate of appealability presents. We affirm the denial of his motion under section 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-23\">Gelinas pleaded guilty to two counts of possession with intent to distribute oxycodone and was sentenced to concurrent sentences of 48 months in prison. Gelinas did not pursue a direct appeal. A retroactive amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines later reduced Gelinas\u2019s sentence to 26 months in prison. In August 2004, after the Supreme Court decided <em>Blakely, </em>Gelinas filed his first motion for collateral review and argued that his sentence was illegal under <em>Blakely.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-24\">The district court denied Gelinas\u2019s motion. Afterwards, the Supreme Court made advisory the federal Sentencing Guidelines in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Gelinas then applied for, and was granted, a certificate of appealability to answer the following two questions: first, should we apply <em>Blakely </em>\u201cand/or\u201d <em>Booker </em>retroactively to cases on collateral review; and second, if that rule is retroactive, was Gelinas\u2019s sentence enhanced improperly based on his possession of a firearm, a fact found by the judge? We review the issues of law <em>de novo. Varela, </em>400 F.3d at 867 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-27\">A panel of this Court has already answered the first of these questions, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>that answer is dispositive. In <em>Varela, </em>this Court determined that <em>\u201cSchriro v. Summerlin, </em>542 U.S. [348], 124 S.Ct. 2519 (2004), is essentially dispositive\u201d of this issue and, like the new rule announced in <em>Ring v. Arizona, </em>536 U.S. 584, 122 S.Ct. 2428, 153 L.Ed.2d 556 (2002), the \u201cprototypical procedural rule\u201d of <em>Booker </em>should not be applied retroactively to cases on collateral review. 400 F.3d at 867. The denial of Gelinas\u2019s motion is, therefore,</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
