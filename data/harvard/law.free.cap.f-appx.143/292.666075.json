(\u2018Van Bur\u00e9n\u201d), for a 345,000 square foot industrial building located in metropolitan Detroit, effective December 1, 1999. The debt- or/appellant, James Bronce Henderson, III, was DCT\u2019s principal officer and guaranteed DCT\u2019s obligations under the lease. In February 2002, DCT\u2019s creditors placed the company in involuntary Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and DCT stopped paying rent for the building. In August 2002, Henderson filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Subsequently, Van Bur\u00e9n filed a claim (Claim No. 71) in Henderson\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings for unpaid rent and other charges due under the lease as guarantor. The bankruptcy court allowed Van Buren\u2019s claim, but applied the one year cap under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 502(b)(6). The district court then affirmed. Henderson appeals, and we also affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d). \u201c[W]e independently examine the factual and legal determinations of the bankruptcy court and employ the same standards of review as the district court.\u201d <em>In re Int\u2019l Admin. Servs., Inc., </em>408 F.3d 689, 698 (11th Cir.2005). Specifically, we review the district court\u2019s and bankruptcy court\u2019s factual findings for clear error, <em>In re Cox, </em>338 F.3d 1238, 1241 (11th Cir.2003), and the legal conclusions de novo. <em>In re Int\u2019l Admin. Servs., Inc., </em>408 F.3d at 698.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-12\">After an evidentiary hearing, the bankruptcy court concluded that Henderson\u2019s objections lacked merit and correctly found that: Henderson is bound by the plain terms of the lease and is liable to Van Bur\u00e9n as guarantor; the amount of rent specified in the lease provided evidence of the fair market value for the building space; Van Bur\u00e9n satisfied its duty to mitigate its damages caused by the breach; and judicial estoppel does not apply. Upon review, the district court agreed with these findings. We too have reviewed the record and find no clear error. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court, which affirms the judgment of the bankruptcy court.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
