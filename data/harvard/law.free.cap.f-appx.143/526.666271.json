The district court, at the urging of the Government, construed the motions as motions to vacate pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000). As Freddie and Torrance have each filed a previous \u00a7 2255 motion, the court dismissed the current motions as unauthorized successive \u00a7 2255 motions. Freddie and Torrance have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-13\">We conclude that the district court erred in construing the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions as \u00a7 2255 motions. A motion under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is a post-conviction remedy for an improperly computed sentence that is separate and distinct from a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>United States v. Goines, </em>357 F.3d 469, 476 (4th Cir.2004). However, we conclude that these motions fail on their merits. We review the denial of a motion to modify sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Turner, </em>59 F.3d 481, 483 (4th Cir.1995). The sentencing court may reduce a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment if his sentence was based on a guideline range subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), and the amendment is listed in USSG \u00a7 lB1.10(e) as retroactive. USSG \u00a7 lB1.10(a), p.s. (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-14\">Amendment 591 is one of the listed amendments that applies retroactively. USSG \u00a7 1B1.10(c). Amendment 591 requires the sentencing court to apply the offense guideline referenced in the Statutory Index in Appendix A for the statute of conviction. USSG App. C, Amend. 591. The amendment clarified USSG \u00a7\u00a7 1B1.1 and 1B1.2, which some circuits had interpreted as permitting a court to use an offender\u2019s actual conduct in selecting the offense guideline, even if that conduct was not charged in the indictment. <em>See United States v. Rivera, </em>293 F.3d 584, 586-87 (2d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-15\">We find that the district court acted in accordance with USSG \u00a7\u00a7 1B1.1 and 1B1.2 at sentencing when it consulted the Statu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>tory Index and referred to USSG \u00a7 2D1.1 as the proper guideline for the Joneses\u2019 convictions under 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 841, 846 (West 1999 &amp; Supp.2005). <em>See </em>USSG, App. A. The Joneses argue that their guideline ranges were improperly based on quantities and types of drugs determined by the sentencing court, resulting in a base offense level higher than the offense level supported by the facts alleged in the indictment or found by the jury. However, Amendment 591 does not impact how the base offense level is calculated within the appropriate guideline. Instead, Amendment 591 affects which guideline will be used in determining the base offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">Therefore, the claims lack merit and entitle the Joneses to no relief. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of their \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
