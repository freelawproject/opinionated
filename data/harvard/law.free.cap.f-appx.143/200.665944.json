Bennett raises three issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-14\">First, Bennett argues that his Sixth Amendment rights were violated because the district court enhanced his sentence on the basis of facts that were found only by a preponderance of the evidence, instead of by the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard required by <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-17\">A defendant is permitted to waive certain constitutional rights through a plea agreement, so long as the agreement was made knowingly and voluntarily. <em>Parke v. Raley, </em>506 U.S. 20, 28-29, 113 S.Ct. 517, 523, 121 L.Ed.2d 391 (1992); <em>United States v. Brown, </em>117 F.3d 471, 476 (11th Cir.1997). In <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), the Supreme Court specifically stated that a defendant may waive his Sixth Amendment right to be sentenced only on the basis of facts found by the jury or admitted by him. \u201c[N]othing prevents a defendant from waiving his <em>Apprendi </em>rights. When a defendant pleads guilty, the [government] is free to seek judicial sentence enhancements so long as the defendant either stipulates to the relevant facts or consents to judicial factfinding.\u201d <em>Blakely, </em>124 S.Ct. at 2541.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-18\">Here, the plea agreement signed by Bennett and his counsel specifically stated that Bennett \u201cwaivefd] any right to have a jury resolve and decide sentencing issues, including possible enhancements to his sentence, [and] expressly conferred] upon the court the right to decide any and all sentencing issues by a preponderance of the evidence standard.\u201d Bennett does not contend that his waiver was uninformed or involuntary. Therefore, Bennett waived his Sixth Amendment rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>and his <em>Booker </em>argument is foreclosed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Second, Bennett contends that the district court erred in applying a six-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(3)(C) because one of the robbery victims sustained a permanent or life-threatening injury. The court applied the enhancement because Beverly Conner, one of the bank tellers present during the robbery, suffered a heart attack immediately afterward. Bennett argues that the district court erroneously enhanced his sentence because there was no evidence in the record to suggest that the teller\u2019s injury was either permanent or life-threatening. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">\u201cThis Court reviews the district court\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines <em>de novo </em>and its findings of fact for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Grant, </em>397 F.3d 1330, 1332 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cThe severity of a victim\u2019s injuries is a factual determination and thus reviewed for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Price, </em>149 F.3d 352, 353 (5th Cir.1998). \u201c[W]e will not find clear error unless our review of the record leaves us with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>335 F.3d 1314, 1319 (11th Cir.2003) (internal marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">The sentencing guidelines provide for a six-level enhancement if any victim of a robbery sustains a \u201c[permanent or life-threatening bodily injury.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(3)(C). \u201cPermanent or life-threatening bodily injury\u201d is defined as \u201cinjury involving a substantial risk of death; loss or substantial impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty that is likely to be permanent; or an obvious disfigurement that is likely to be permanent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.1, cmt. n. 1(J). We have said that this language \u201cencompasses injuries that may not be terribly severe but are permanent, hence the disjunctive: \u2018permanent or life-threatening injuries.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Torrealba, </em>339 F.3d 1238, 1246 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">We discern no clear error in the district court\u2019s determination that Conner\u2019s injury was \u201cpermanent or life-threatening,\u201d as defined by the guidelines. The record shows that immediately following the robbery Conner suffered a heart attack and had to be taken by ambulance to the hospital. She was hospitalized for four days and had to undergo a cardiac catheterization. Conner\u2019s treating physician indicated that her injuries are permanent; she will require a lifetime of medical care because of her heart attack. Conner stated that, as a result of the heart attack, she has to take four different medications and will have to continue doing so for the rest of her life.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-11\">Although Conner\u2019s heart attack was (fortunately) not as serious as it could have been, it has permanently affected her health. Furthermore, given that heart attacks are often fatal, we see no error in the district court\u2019s conclusion that even a relatively minor heart attack is an \u201cinjury involving a substantial risk of death.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1, cmt. n. 1(J). Therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>we conclude that it was not clearly erroneous for the district court to apply the six-level enhancement for permanent or life-threatening injuries under \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(3)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">Third, Bennett argues that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence by three levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 based on Bennett\u2019s role as a manager or supervisor in an offense that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive. Bennett contends that the imposition of this enhancement was erroneous because: (1) he neither managed nor supervised any of the bank robbery participants and (2) there were fewer than five participants in the robbery and the robbery was not otherwise extensive.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">\u201cA district court\u2019s enhancement of a defendant\u2019s offense level based on his role [in the offense] is a finding of fact reviewed for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Rendon, </em>354 F.3d 1320, 1331 (11th Cir.2003), <em>cert. denied </em>541 U.S. 1035, 124 S.Ct. 2110, 158 L.Ed.2d 720 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">A defendant\u2019s base offense level is to be increased by three levels if \u201cthe defendant was a manager or supervisor (but not an organizer or leader) and the criminal activity involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b). In determining the scope of the defendant\u2019s role in the offense, the court is to consider various factors. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3B1.1, cmt. n. 4; <em>Rendon, </em>354 F.3d at 1331-32. These factors include the extent to which the defendant planned the offense and exercised control or authority over the other participants, the nature of the defendant\u2019s participation in the commission of the crime, and whether the defendant claimed a right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime than the other participants. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, cmt. n. 4; <em>Rendon, </em>354 F.3d at 1331-32. A \u201cparticipant\u201d is defined as \u201ca person who is criminally responsible for the commission of the offense, but need not have been convicted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3B1.1, cmt. n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-11\">The district court\u2019s conclusion that Bennett acted as a manager or supervisor in the robbery was not clearly erroneous. Bennett helped plan the robbery with co-defendant Albert Young. He also tried to recruit a friend to help in the robbery, directed the actions of Young during the robbery and, along with Young, received a greater share of the proceeds than did the other participants.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-12\">Neither is the district court\u2019s conclusion that there were five or more participants in the bank robbery clearly erroneous. It is undisputed that there were four individuals involved in the robbery itself. Bennett and two codefendants, Albert and Timothy Young, entered and held up the bank. A third codefendant, Joiheeda Gibson, drove the get-away car. The district court also counted the girlfriends of Albert Young and Bennett as participants in the criminal activity because, after the robbery, they had held their boyfriend\u2019s share of the proceeds knowing that it was the fruit of the robbery. We find no clear error in their inclusion as \u201cparticipants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-13\">An individual need not be convicted of, or even charged with, an offense in order to be counted as a \u201cparticipant.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, cmt. n. 1; <em>Rendon, </em>354 F.3d at 1332. Instead, an individual is a participant if she is \u201ccriminally responsible for the commission of the offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, cmt. n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-14\">Here, there was no clear error in the district court\u2019s conclusion that Young\u2019s and Bennett\u2019s girlfriends are criminally responsible for the commission of the bank robbery. The girlfriends are criminally responsible under the principles of acces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>sory liability. By holding the stolen money for their boyfriends, the girlfriends acted as accessories after the fact. Knowing that a bank robbery had been committed, they assisted the robbers in order to prevent or hinder their apprehension. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3. Under \u00a7 3, one who acts as an accessory after the fact is punishable for up to one-half the maximum term of imprisonment that a principal would receive for the commission of the crime. <em>Id. </em>In other words, an accessory after the fact may be sent to jail as a result of her knowing assistance of a crime, even where that assistance didn\u2019t occur until after the crime had been committed. That after-the-fact assistance is enough to make an individual \u201ccriminally responsible\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 3B1.1. <em>See United States v. Hall, </em>101 F.3d 1174, 1178 (7th Cir.1996) (\u201c[Jjust as a party who knowingly assists a criminal enterprise is criminally responsible under principles of accessory liability, a party who gives knowing aid in some part of the criminal enterprise is a \u2018criminally responsible\u2019 participant under the Guidelines.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">We recognize that an individual who acts as an accessory after the fact is not treated as a principal in the crime as, for example, an individual who aided and abetted the commission of the offense would be. <em>See </em>18 U.S. \u00a7 2. Section 3B1.1 does not define \u201cparticipant\u201d as one who is treated as a principal in the commission of an offense, however, but as one who is \u201ccriminally responsible\u201d for it. We conclude that being subject to imprisonment in connection with the commission of a crime makes one \u201ccriminally responsible\u201d for, and a \u201cparticipant\u201d in, that crime for purposes of \u00a7 3B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Because the girlfriends were \u201ccriminally responsible\u201d for the commission of the bank robbery, the district court did not err by counting them as participants in the criminal enterprise. When the girlfriends are included there were at least six participants in the offense. Therefore, the imposition of the three-level enhancement to Bennett\u2019s offense level under \u00a7 3B1.1 was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b232-8\">. There are two types of <em>Booker </em>error. The first is the constitutional error, which Bennett waived his right to challenge in his plea agreement. The second is the statutory error of \"misappl[ing] the guidelines by considering them as binding as opposed to advisory.\u201d <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330-31 (11th Cir.2005). Because Bennett filed his brief after the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>Booker </em>and he argues only constitutional error, however, we need not consider whether there was statutory error in this case. <em>See United States v. Silvestri, </em>409 F.3d 1311, 1338 n. 18 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201d[A]n issue not raised in a party\u2019s initial appellate brief is considered waived....\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
