The issue on appeal is whether the district court erred when it granted Security\u2019s motion, due to Lucien\u2019s undisputed failure to provide a sworn proof of loss within 60 days of the date the damage was incurred. Lucien contends that because U.S. Security did not send an adjuster to his property for more than 90 days <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>after he notified them of the flood, they are estopped from asserting that he waived any objections to settlement amounts because he failed to adhere to the policy\u2019s 60 day filing period.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">In reviewing a district court\u2019s grant of a motion for judgment on partial findings pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(c), we review the district court\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo </em>and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>See Sanz v. U.S. Sec. Ins. Co., </em>328 F.3d 1314, 1317 n. 5 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">In <em>Federal Crop Ins. Corp. v. Merrill, </em>332 U.S. 380, 384-85, 68 S.Ct. 1, 92 L.Ed. 10 (1947), the Supreme Court held that an insured is required to unwaveringly adhere to the rules and regulations associated with a federal insurance policy. <em>Id. </em>Following the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate, several circuit courts interpreted an insured\u2019s failure to provide a proof of loss form within the required 60 days as a bar to recovery. <em>See, e.g., Dawkins v. Witt, </em>318 F.3d 606 (4th Cir.2003); <em>Mancini v. Redland Ins. Co., </em>248 F.3d 729 (8th Cir.2001); <em>Flick v. Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>205 F.3d 386 (9th Cir.2000); <em>Gowland v. Aetna, </em>143 F.3d 951 (5th Cir.1998); <em>Phelps v. Fed. Emergency Mgmt. Agency, </em>785 F.2d 13 (1st Cir.1986). In <em>Sanz, </em>we followed the other circuits\u2019 conclusions, also holding that an insured\u2019s failure to adhere to the proof of loss requirement barred recovery. <em>See Sanz, </em>382 F.3d at 1318.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">In <em>Sanz, </em>the homeowner never filed a proof of loss with U.S. Security, although he did consistently comply with the adjuster\u2019s and engineers\u2019 instructions to get an estimate for the amount of damage caused by the flood, which he forwarded to U.S. Security. <em>Id. </em>at 1317. Sometime thereafter, U.S. Security denied his claim. <em>Id. </em>In joining other circuits in holding that failure to file a proof of loss form in a timely fashion barred any type of recovery, we noted that it was undisputed that Sanz neither filed a proof of loss form at any time, nor did he submit a waiver from the Federal Insurance Administrator. <em>Id. </em>at 1319.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">In response to Sanz\u2019s estoppel argument, we noted that while the Supreme Court has not yet announced a <em>per se </em>rule barring individuals from asserting estoppel claims against the United States government, it has concluded that such claims are \u201cwarranted only if affirmative and egregious misconduct by government agents exists.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1319-20. Viewing the facts of Sanz\u2019s case through the prism of \u201caffirmative and egregious misconduct,\u201d we held that U.S. Security\u2019s failure to inform Sanz of the proof of loss requirement was an insufficient ground for estoppel, as were alleged assurances to Sanz \u201cthat he had filled out all the necessary paperwork and that Security would \u2018take care\u2019 of his claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1320.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">Because the Supreme Court has unequivocally held that a failure to adhere to the terms of a federal insurance bars recovery, and because we have interpreted that holding to include filing a proof of loss form beyond the 60 days following a flood as such a failure, we conclude that the district court did not err in granting U.S. Security\u2019s motion for judgment on partial findings. Moreover, the district court did not err in rejecting Lucien\u2019s estoppel claim, as none of the evidence showed any behavior on the part of U.S. Security that was \u201caggravated and egregious.\u201d Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
