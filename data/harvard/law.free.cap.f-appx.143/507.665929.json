The district court granted partial summary judgment to AFLAC on the ground that ERISA preempted plaintiffs\u2019 claims. The district court also granted summary judgment to the defendant on the ground that plaintiffs\u2019 claims were not covered by the insurance policy and defendant\u2019s refusal to pay those claims was not in bad faith. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the district court\u2019s holding that plaintiffs\u2019 claims are preempted by ERISA, but reverse its grant of summary judgment on the question of coverage and bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">Casselman and Ethridge were employees of Georgetown Steel Corporation (GSC). In the early 1990s, the Steelworkers Union requested that the company permit hourly employees to purchase supplemental Insurance on a pre-taxed basis. J.A. 427. GSC agreed, but required the employees to select two companies to offer these plans, which the union did. J.A. 427-28. In 1995, AFLAC became one of the companies whose policies were offered to hourly employees. J.A. 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-12\">Casselman and Ethridge each purchased an AFLAC supplemental insurance policy with a sickness rider and an off-the-job accident disability rider. J.A. 159-60; 242-43. After they had purchased the insurance policies, each was injured in a separate accident that occurred while at work. J.A. 436. Casselman slipped and fell, rupturing a disk in his back. J.A. 188. The ruptured disk injured the sciatic nerve, causing problems with Casselman\u2019s leg and foot that precluded his return to work. J.A. 185. Casselman\u2019s doctor alleges that Casselman has a lumbar disc disorder. J.A. 309. Ethridge hurt his knee in a fall. J.A. 248-51. His doctor submitted an affidavit that Ethridge suffered degenerative arthritis of the right knee and a right knee disorder. J.A. 311. Both men represent that their now disabling health problems did not afflict them until after their on-the-job falls. J.A. 218-19, 253.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-13\">The plaintiffs sued AFLAC for coverage of their disabling injuries under the sickness rider they had purchased from AF-LAC, alleging that these injuries fell under the policy\u2019s definition of sickness. They also alleged that AFLAC had acted in bad faith by not paying their claims. The defendant sought partial summary judgment on the grounds that ERISA preempted plaintiffs\u2019 claims and sought summary judgment on the question of coverage. The district court granted both of these motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-15\">On appeal, we review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Higgins v. E.I. Du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>863 F.2d 1162, 1167 (4th Cir.1988). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>Summary judgment is appropriate only if the moving party demonstrates that \u201cno genuine issue of material fact exists and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Kimmell v. Seven Up Bottling Co., </em>993 F.2d 410, 412 (4th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The district court did not provide any reasoning for its conclusion that ERISA preempted plaintiffs\u2019 claims. Both parties agree that the correctness of the district court\u2019s determination depends entirely on whether the AFLAC plan falls within a safe harbor exception removing certain plans from ERISA coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">The safe harbor exception provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-8\">(j) Certain group or group-type insurance programs. For purposes of Title I of the Act and this chapter, the terms \u201cemployee welfare benefit plan\u201d and \u201cwelfare plan\u201d shall not include a group or group-type insurance program offered by an insurer to employees or members of an employee organization, under which</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-9\">(1) No contributions are made by an employer or employee organization;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-10\">(2) Participation [in] the program is completely voluntary for employees or members;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-11\">(3) The sole functions of the employer or employee organization with respect to the program are, without endorsing the program, to permit the insurer to publicize the program to employees or members, to collect premiums through payroll deductions or dues checkoffs and to remit them to the insurer; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-12\">(4) The employer or employee organization receives no consideration in the form of cash or otherwise in connection with the program, other than reasonable compensation, excluding any profit, for administrative services actually rendered in connection with payroll deductions or dues checkoffs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-14\">29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2510.3-Kj). AFLAC maintains that GSC exceeded the limited employer role outlined in (1), (3), and (4), thereby removing the plan from the reach of the safe harbor provision. Because the employer served functions other than those outlined in (3), the safe harbor is inapplicable and we need not reach AF-LAC\u2019s remaining arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-15\">Courts applying the safe harbor exception have emphasized that employers can only assume a very limited role with respect to the plan if the third prong is to be satisfied. <em>See Butero v. Royal Maccabees Life Ins. Co., </em>174 F.3d 1207, 1213 (11th Cir.1999) (\u201cThe regulation explicitly obliges the employer who seeks its safe harbor to refrain from <em>any </em>functions other than permitting the insurer to publicize the program and collecting premiums.\u201d) (emphasis in original); <em>Hansen v. Continental Ins. Co., </em>940 F.2d 971, 977 (5th Cir.1991) (similar). Here, it is clear that the limited functions outlined in the regulation\u2014permitting publicizing of the program, collecting premiums, and remitting them to the insurer\u2014were exceeded by the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-16\">The plan administrator testified in a deposition that GSC \u201cchose to exclude salaried employees from participation in the plan,\u201d J.A. 344, an exclusion reflected in the plan documents. J.A. 407. Notwithstanding the Union\u2019s request for coverage specifically for hourly employees, plaintiffs present no evidence to contradict the administrator\u2019s representation that the <em>employer </em>selected the type of employees who would be eligible for the program. Although the Union selected the plans that would be offered based on a vote of its membership, J.A. 428, the employer reviewed those plans, and the plan administrator testified that \u201c[i]f they had come in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>here with somebody that was marginal or, you know, less than having a good company rating, we would have advised them that we didn\u2019t have much confidence in this carrier.\u201d J.A. 366. To ensure that AF-LAC was a \u201creputable and well thought of insurance company,\u201d GSC engaged a consulting firm to investigate AFLAC. J.A. 387.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">Both determining eligibility criteria and selecting the insurance company have been found relevant to the determination of whether the safe harbor is applicable. <em>See Butero, </em>174 F.3d at 1213 (recognizing, in holding the safe harbor inapplicable, that the employer picked the insurer and deemed certain employees ineligible to participate). Given the unequivocal language of the regulation limiting functions of the employer to the enumerated tasks, we conclude that the employer exceeded the bounds of the permissible interaction with the program under the safe harbor.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">The plaintiffs urge a contrary conclusion by focusing on a Department of Labor Advisory Opinion interpreting section 2510.3- 1\u00ae, which describes an employer as \u201cendorsing\u201d a program within the meaning of \u00ae(3) if \u201cthe employer or employee organization expresses to its employees or members any positive, normative judgment regarding the program.\u201d Op. Dep\u2019t of Labor 94-25a (1994), 1994 ERISA LEXIS 29, at *7. Plaintiffs argue that GSC did not endorse the program under this definition, and thus that the safe harbor applies. But the Advisory Opinion\u2019s discussion of endorsement does not purport to be a definition of section 2510.3- l(j)(3) in its entirety, but <em>only </em>an explanation of what constitutes \u201cendorsement.\u201d Contrary to plaintiffs apparent reading of section \u00ae(3), under the plain terms of that section, an employer can violate (j)(3) by exceeding the specifically enumerated permissible activities, even if such extra activity does not involve \u201cendorsement.\u201d In fact, the advisory opinion held that the safe harbor was not only inapplicable because the employer had endorsed the program at issue, but also because the employer had exceeded the specific function limitations of section 2510.3-1\u00ae(3). <em>Id. </em>at *8. The advisory opinion thus does not impact our conclusion that the employer\u2019s functions exceeded those permitted by the safe harbor exception, regardless of whether such functions entailed \u201cendorsement.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b532-10\">The group insurance program under which the plaintiffs purchased their insurance is thus an ERISA plan. And \u201cwhen the validity, interpretation or applicability of a plan term governs the participant\u2019s entitlement to a benefit or its amount, the claim for such a benefit falls within the scope of\u2019 ERISA\u2019s coverage provision, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a), which provides \u201cthe exclusive vehicle for actions by ERISA-plan participants and beneficiaries asserting improper processing of a claim for benefits.\u201d <em>Singh v. Prudential Health Care Plan, Inc., </em>335 F.3d 278, 291 (4th Cir.2003). Plaintiffs\u2019 claims clearly depend upon the interpretation of the language of the plan, specifically of the term \u201csickness.\u201d These claims are thus preempted under ERISA and the district court properly granted partial summary judgment in favor of the defendant with respect to ERISA preemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">We do not dismiss a claim that is preempted by ERISA, but rather \u201ctreat it as a federal claim under [29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132].\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Darcangelo v. Verizon Communications, Inc., </em>292 F.3d 181, 195 (4th Cir.2002). We have held that \u201cthe plain language of an ERISA plan must be enforced in accordance with \u2018its literal and natural meaning. \u201d <em>United McGill Corp. v. Stinnett, </em>154 F.3d 168, 172 (4th Cir.1998). Looking to the literal meaning of the terms in the AFLAC policy purchased by plaintiffs, it is clear that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">The policy purchased by plaintiffs provides that \u201c[i]f you [plaintiffs] are Totally Disabled due to Sickness, we will pay you one-thirtieth of the benefit shown in the Policy Schedule for each day you remain disabled.\u201d J.A. 124. \u201cSickness\u201d is defined as \u201ca disease or disorder first manifested more than 30 days after your Effective Date of coverage and while coverage is in force.\u201d J.A. 109.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">The defendant urges that any disorder that is caused by a workplace fall is necessarily outside the rider\u2019s definition of \u201csickness.\u201d But the sickness rider places no limitations on the permissible <em>causes of </em>a disorder that can constitute \u201csickness.\u201d Plaintiffs allege that they now suffer from long-term physical problems, namely lumber disc disorder and right knee disorder. The ordinary meaning of \u201cdisorder,\u201d as it appears in the policy\u2019s definition of \u201csickness,\u201d encompasses those problems <em>regardless </em>of their direct cause. The ordinary meaning of \u201cdisorder\u201d is \u201ca derangement of function: an abnormal physical or mental condition: sickness, ailment, malady.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>652 (1986). Each plaintiff clearly alleges that he suffers from a debilitating condition which is both a derangement of function and an abnormal physical condition, and thus each plaintiff suffers from \u201csickness\u201d under the policy definition, at least for the purpose of defeating defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. By defining \u201csickness\u201d in terms of \u201cdisorder\u201d and without regard to cause, the policy forecloses defendant\u2019s narrow definition of sickness and encompasses the plaintiffs\u2019 physical disorders arising from their on-the-job accidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-11\">To counteract the policy\u2019s language, AF-LAC focuses on the fact that the plaintiff's selected a sickness rider and <em>failed </em>to select an on-the-job disability rider, which also would clearly have covered their claims. But the fact that the plaintiffs did not select the on-the-job rider is irrelevant, given that the sickness rider that they did select provides, by its terms, coverage for the disorders for which they seek payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-12\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b533-13\">For the reasons stated herein, the judgment of the district court that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims are preempted by ERISA is affirmed. The district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants on the plaintiffs\u2019 claims for coverage and bad faith refusal to pay is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b532-8\">. Although a plan that satisfies the provisions of the safe harbor is necessarily excluded from coverage under ERISA, an insurance plan that does <em>not </em>fall within the safe harbor may still fail to qualify as a plan covered by ERISA. <em>See Butero, </em>174 F.3d at 1214; <em>Hansen, </em>940 F.2d at 976-77. But plaintiffs do not argue that the plan fails to qualify as an ERISA plan at all, but only that it is excepted from ERISA coverage by the safe harbor exception.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b533-8\">. To the extent the claims seek remedies that fall outside the scope of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a), however, those claims are rejected as preempted. <em>Singh, </em>335 F.3d at 290.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
