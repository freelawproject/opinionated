We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">I. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, \u201cexcept to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cInsofar as the Board adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In this case, the BIA issued an opinion and, although it agreed with the IJ\u2019s conclusion, it did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s opinion or its reasoning. Accordingly, our review is limited to the BIA\u2019s opinion. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">\u201cTo the extent that the BIA\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, this court\u2019s review is <em>de novo.\" D-Muhumed v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817 (11th Cir.2004). The BIA\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, and we \u201cmust affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is \u2018supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1283-84 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">An alien who arrives in, or is present in, the United States may apply for asylum. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-10\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality or, in the case of a person having no nationality, is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided, and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-11\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). \u201cThe asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u2018refugee\u2019 status.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 818.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-12\">To establish asylum eligibility, the petitioner must, with specific and credible evidence, demonstrate (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d the statutorily listed factor will cause future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b). If the petitioner demonstrates past persecution, there is a rebuttable presumption he has a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R \u00a7 208.13(b)(1). If he cannot show past persecution, then the petitioner must demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution that is both subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289. The subjective component can be proved \u201cby the applicant\u2019s credible testimony that he or she genuinely fears persecution,\u201d while the objective component \u201ccan be fulfilled either by establishing past persecution or that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>or she has a good reason to fear future persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Neither the INA nor the regulations define \u201cpersecution.\u201d We have stated, however, \u201cpersecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, and that mere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">The petitioner\u2019s well-founded fear of persecution must be on account of, or because of, one of the statutorily listed factors, such as his political opinion. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 112 S.Ct. 812, 816, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). The petitioner must establish this causal connection by \u201cpresenting specific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he or she will be <em>singled out </em>for persecution\u201d on account of the statutory factor. <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (quotation omitted). To establish a claim of persecution on account of a political opinion, a petitioner must establish the persecutors persecuted him or will seek to persecute him in the future because of his actual or imputed political opinion. It is not enough to show he was or will be persecuted or tortured due to refusal to cooperate with the persecutors. <em>Sanchez v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 438 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion Ginocchio failed to demonstrate either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of his political opinion, and thus, Petitioners were not eligible for asylum. The evidence in the record reveals the only alleged acts of past persecution were a number of threatening telephone calls between June 1998 and May 2001, allegedly from the MRTA, and an attempted home invasion in early 2001, which Ginocchio believed was perpetrated by the MRTA. We are not compelled by this evidence to reverse the BIA\u2019s finding these actions did not rise to the level of past persecution, as opposed to mere threats or harassment. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Substantial evidence also supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion Ginocchio did not have a well-founded fear of future persecution given Ginocchio (1) had been given police protection and had never been physically harmed by the MRTA; (2) had returned to Peru on a number of occasions, even after the alleged threats had begun; and (3) was no longer privy to the financial information the MRTA was allegedly seeking from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">Finally, even if Ginocchio had shown he suffered past persecution or had a well-founded fear of future persecution, his claim for asylum would have failed because he did not show a nexus between his alleged persecution and his political opinion. Rather, Ginocchio\u2019s claim was that the MRTA threatened him in order to obtain financial information he had because of his occupation. A petitioner\u2019s occupation is not one of the statutorily protected grounds to qualify as a refugee. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). Moreover, Ginocchio claimed the MRTA would persecute him because of his refusal to cooperate with their demands, which he asserts he did because of his own political opinion which is opposed to the MRTA. As we have explained before, however, Ginocchio\u2019s refusal to cooperate with the MRTA is insufficient to demonstrate the MRTA would persecute him in the future because of his actual political opinion. <em>See Sanchez, </em>392 F.3d at 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">II. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">Because substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusions, and because nothing in the record compels us to reverse the BIA\u2019s findings Petitioners were not elig\u00ed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>ble for asylum relief, we deny their petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b294-13\">. Petitioners abandoned their claims for withholding of removal under the INA and protection under the United Nations Convention on Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment by failing to raise any argument on these claims in their petition for review. See <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b295-9\">. Petitioners also argue they were persecuted on account of Ginocchio\u2019s social status. Social status is not one of the five statutorily protected grounds, however, and therefore cannot form the basis for asylum. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A); <em>see also Matter of Acosta, </em>19 I &amp; N Dec. 211, 233 (BIA 1985) (noting \"membership in a particular social group,\u201d refers to \"an individual who is a member of a group of persons all of whom share a common, immutable characteristic ... that the members of the group either cannot change, or should not be required to change because it is fundamental to their individual identities or consciences\u201d), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Matter of Mogharrabi, </em>19 I &amp; N Dec. 439 (BIA 1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
