Finding no reversible error, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-22\">Smith argues that, in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court reversibly erred in imposing a sentence utilizing the Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory. Smith contends that she preserved the issue at her sentencing hearing by citing <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), in connection with a request she made to the court that did not involve the court\u2019s determination of her sentence. This argument lacks merit because Smith\u2019s request was not relevant to her invocation of <em>Blakely </em>and also because counsel stated that there was no defense objection to the presentence report.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-25\">Since Smith did not preserve a <em>Booker </em>issue, we review only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517). Application of the Guidelines as mandatory in determining a defendant\u2019s sentence is plain or obvious error after <em>Booker. See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732-34 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>25, 2005) (No. 05-5556). However, Smith cannot show that the error affected her substantial rights because the record does not indicate that the district court would have imposed a lower sentence under an advisory, rather than a mandatory, guideline scheme. Therefore, Smith is not entitled to relief on grounds of plain error. <em>See id. </em>at 733-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b653-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
