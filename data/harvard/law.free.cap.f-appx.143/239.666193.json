He now appeals his sentence, contending that according to <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), the Sixth Amendment precluded the district court from treating him as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 and thereby imposing the sentence he received. The court overruled his objection on the ground that <em>Blakely </em>did not apply to the federal guidelines sentencing system. In <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), however, the Supreme Court made <em>Blakely\u2019s </em>rationale applicable to the federal system; hence, we therefore consider appellant\u2019s objection under <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b269-29\">We need not decide whether the district court committed Sixth Amendment error-\u2014-by basing appellant\u2019s sentence on facts appellant did not admit\u2014because the court erred in sentencing appellant under a mandatory guidelines scheme. The question thus becomes whether the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-30\">Sentencing a defendant under a mandatory guidelines scheme, such as the pre<em>Booker </em>federal scheme, is harmless error \u201cif, viewing the proceedings in their entirety ... the error did not affect the sentence, or had but very slight effect. If one can say with fair assurance that the sentence was not substantially swayed by the error, the sentence is due to be affirmed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>even though there was error.\u201d <em>United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, -, -, slip op. 2326, 2328 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">It is the Government\u2019s burden to satisfy us that the error in this case was harmless. The Government has not shown (on the record before the district court) that under the <em>Mathenia </em>test, the district court\u2019s error-\u2014treating the Guidelines as mandatory rather than advisory\u2014\u201cdid not affect the sentence, or had but very slight effect.\u201d In short, the Government has not carried its burden of proof to demonstrate harmless error. As a consequence, we must vacate appellant\u2019s sentence and remand the case for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
