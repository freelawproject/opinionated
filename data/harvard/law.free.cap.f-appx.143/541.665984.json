United States, </em>540 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>375, 383, 124 S.Ct. 786, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003); <em>United States v. Emmanuel, </em>288 F.3d 644, 649 (4th Cir.2002). Here, Brown was not entitled to notice before the court construed his mandamus petition as a \u00a7 2254 petition because the instant action is not his first \u00a7 2254 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">The order is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Brown has not made the requisite showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Accordingly, we deny Brown\u2019s motion for a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
