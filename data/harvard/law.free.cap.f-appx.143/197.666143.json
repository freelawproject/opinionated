He first contends that the district court erred in denying him a seven-level reduction in his offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Pl.l(b)(2). We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and the application of those facts to the sentencing guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Bradford, </em>277 F.3d 1311, 1312 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-17\">Section 2Pl.l(b)(2) provides for a seven-level reduction in a defendant\u2019s offense level if a defendant who escapes from a federal facility voluntarily returns within ninety-six hours of the escape. We have recognized that this section \u201cclearly assumes that the escapee has reconsidered his actions and intends to surrender.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b228-18\">In this case, shortly after escaping Zueco was spotted by a prison official and, instead of surrendering, evaded that official in order to avoid being apprehended. Only after that incident did Zueco decide to return to the prison camp. He did not return because he reconsidered his actions and decided they were wrong, he returned because he was spotted on the outside and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>wanted to avoid being prosecuted for escaping by pretending that he never left. Based on these facts, the district court did not err in denying Zueco a reduction under \u00a7 2Pl.l(b)(2). <em>See id.; see also United States v. Pynes, </em>5 F.3d 1139, 1140\u201441 (8th Cir.1993) (holding that a \u00a7 2P1.1(b)(2) reduction is not warranted where the defendant returned to custody only after being spotted by law enforcement).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The rest of Zucco\u2019s contentions rely on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). He first argues that the district court\u2019s denial of the \u00a7 2Pl.l(b)(2) reduction was a violation of <em>Booker. </em>A <em>Booker </em>error occurs in only two situations. The first is if, under a mandatory guidelines regime, a defendant\u2019s sentence was increased based on facts that were neither proven to a jury nor admitted by him. The second is if the defendant was sentenced under a mandatory guidelines regime. <em>See United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325 (11th Cir.2005). The denial of a reduction under \u00a7 2Pl.l(b)(2) implicates neither of those situations. As a result, Zucco\u2019s argument that the denial of a \u00a7 2Pl.l(b)(2) reduction violates <em>Booker </em>is without merit. <em>See United States v. Bermudez, </em>407 F.3d 536, 545 (1st Cir.2005) (holding that the denial of a sentencing reduction does not result in an error under Booker).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">Zueco next contends that the district court committed a <em>Booker </em>constitutional error by increasing his sentence based on facts that were neither proven to a jury nor admitted by him. He also argues that the district court committed a <em>Booker </em>statutory error by sentencing him under a mandatory guidelines system. Zueco is correct that the district court committed both kinds of <em>Booker </em>error. The district court committed a <em>Booker </em>constitutional error by imposing, under a mandatory guidelines system, a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice based on facts that were neither proven to a jury nor admitted by Zueco. Similarly, the district committed a <em>Booker </em>statutory error by sentencing him under a mandatory guidelines regime. Because he made a timely objection before the district court, we review the <em>Booker </em>errors to determine whether they were harmless. <em>See United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 1291 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">An error is harmless if it did not affect the substantial rights of the defendant. <em>Paz, </em>405 F.3d at 948. \u201cA constitutional error, such as a <em>Booker </em>error, must be disregarded as not affecting substantial rights, if the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. This standard is only met where it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the sentence obtained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-11\">In sentencing Zueco, the district court judge stated that he had fully considered all the factors from 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and found that Zucco\u2019s 24-month sentence met the sentencing goals of punishment and specific and general deterrence. Furthermore, the judge also stated that he \u201cwould certainly have sentenced Mr. Zueco to the sentence of 24 months if the guidelines were not otherwise controlling. In fact, it would have been a higher sentence than 24 months for Mr. Zueco.\u201d Given those statements, it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the <em>Booker </em>constitutional error did not contribute to the sentence Zueco received. <em>See United States v. Robles, </em>408 F.3d 1324, 1327\u201428 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that the <em>Booker </em>constitutional error in that case was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt where the district court stated that it would have given the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>same sentence even if the guidelines had been advisory).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Given that the <em>Booker </em>constitutional error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, the <em>Booker </em>statutory error, which is subject to a less onerous harmless error standard, is also harmless.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d at 1292; <em>Robles, </em>408 F.3d at 1327.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b230-18\">. Zueco also asserts that <em>Booker </em>was violated when the district court imposed his sentence to run consecutively to the term he was already incarcerated for. The district court, however, was bound to do so by the guidelines. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(a). As a result, Zucco\u2019s argument is subsumed by his larger argument that the district court committed a <em>Booker </em>statutory error by sentencing him under a mandatory guidelines regime.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
