After the district court entered its order, Muwakkil was transferred. Because Muwakkil sought only injunctive and declaratory relief, his subsequent transfer renders his appeal moot. <em>See Williams v. Griffin, </em>952 F.2d 820, 823 (4th Cir.1991). Nonetheless, after a review of the record, we conclude that the district court incorrectly decided that Muwakk\u00fc\u2019s complaint failed to state a claim. Accordingly, although we dismiss the appeal as moot, we note that the district court\u2019s dismissal should not count as a \u201cstrike\u201d for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) (2000). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-23\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
