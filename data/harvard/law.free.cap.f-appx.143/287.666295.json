Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>See Szabo v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1998, 161 L.Ed.2d 853 (2005). We previously affirmed Szabo\u2019s sentence. <em>United States v. Szabo, </em>127 Fed.Appx. 473 (11th Cir.2004). After reconsideration, we vacate Szabo\u2019s sentence and remand this case to the district court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-30\">Szabo, a federal prisoner convicted on two counts of bank robbery, appealed the imposition of a sentencing enhancement under section 2B3.1(b)(2)(F) of the United States Sentencing Guidelines for making a threat of death. Szabo argued, under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>524 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), that the admissions he made in his plea agreements that during the robberies he had told the bank tellers \u201c T have a gun\u2019 (or words to that effect)\u201d were insufficient to prove that he had made a threat of death. Because Szabo\u2019s admissions were sufficient to support the enhancement and this Court had held that <em>Blakely </em>did not apply to the federal sentencing guidelines, we affirmed Szabo\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-31\">On remand, Szabo does not argue that his admissions were insufficient to support the sentencing enhancement for making a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>threat of death. Szabo challenges only the imposition of his sentence under a mandatory guideline system. Because Szabo objected to his sentence on the grounds of <em>Blakely, </em>he properly preserved this objection. <em>See United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 1291 (11th Cir.2005). We review Szabo\u2019s <em>Booker </em>objection, therefore, to determine if the error was harmless. <em>Id. </em>Statutory <em>Booker </em>error \u201cis harmless if, viewing the proceedings in their entirety, a court determines that the error did not affect the [sentence], or had but very slight effect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1292 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The government bears the burden to show that the error was harmless. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">The government has not established that the error did not affect Szabo\u2019s sentence or \u201chad but very slight effect.\u201d The sentence, therefore, is vacated and this case remanded to the district court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
