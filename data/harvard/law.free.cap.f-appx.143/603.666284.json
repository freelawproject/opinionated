Linan-Gonzalez contends that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). He acknowledges that this argument is foreclosed, but he seeks to preserve the issue for possible Supreme Court review. <em>See Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 247, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998); <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>Linan-Gonzalez also argues that his sentence was unreasonable because the district court failed to consider whether, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), his unique mental condition in the form of severe depression warranted a sentence below the applicable guidelines range. While the district court found that he did not suffer from \u201cdiminished capacity,\u201d the defendant argues that consideration of a downward departure was warranted based on his mental and emotional condition. Under the Sentencing Guidelines, mental and emotional conditions are not ordinarily relevant to sentencing. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5H1.3. The defendant argues that, after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), this provision as to mental conditions is not mandatory and his depression warranted a lesser sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">The defendant\u2019s argument, now based upon <em>Booker, </em>is raised for the first time on appeal. Accordingly, our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732-33 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">Although Linan-Gonzalez does not explicitly argue that his sentence was erroneous because it was imposed under a mandatory guidelines system, it is the unstated premise for his argument that, based upon <em>Booker, </em>the district court should have taken his mental condition into consideration and given him a sentence below the applicable guidelines range. After <em>Booker, </em>the mandatory application of the guidelines is an error that is plain. <em>Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d at 733.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">Linan-Gonzalez has not shown, however, that his substantial rights were affected by the error. <em>Id. </em>at 733-34. He stops short of asserting that, if the district court has considered his mental condition under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), it would have imposed a lesser sentence. Moreover, even under an advisory guidelines scheme, the district court could have considered the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statement that mental and emotional conditions are not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a departure is warranted. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 518-19 (5th Cir.2005); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5H1.3, p.s.; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(5). Finally, the record indicates that the district court did not believe that Linan-Gonzalez suffered from diminished capacity, instead concluding that his problem was no different from other people who miss their families in the United States. As Linan-Gonzalez has not carried his burden of showing that he would have received a different sentence if the district court had sentenced him under an advisory guidelines scheme, his sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b625-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
