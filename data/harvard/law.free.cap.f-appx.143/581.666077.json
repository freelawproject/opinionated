Calhoun, </em>383 F.3d 281 (5th Cir.2004). The Supreme Court vacated and remanded for further consideration in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>Calhoun v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1068, 160 L.Ed.2d 999 (2005). We requested and received supplemental letter briefs addressing the impact of <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b604-19\">Calhoun contends that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights under <em>Booker </em>by imposing Sentencing Guidelines increases based on factors that were neither submitted to a jury for proof beyond a reasonable doubt nor admitted by him. He concedes that such argument is raised for the first time and is reviewable for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520-21 (5th Cir.2005), ce<em>rt. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. -, \u2014 S.Ct. -, \u2014 L.Ed.2d -, 2005 WL 816208 (Oct. 3, 2005). The parties do not dispute that the first two prongs of the plain-error test have been satisfied: There is Sixth Amendment error in Calhoun\u2019s case, and such error is \u201cplain\u201d under <em>Booker. See id. </em>at 521.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-23\">To satisfy the third prong of the plain-error test, Calhoun must show that his \u201csubstantial rights\u201d were affected. <em>See id. </em>\u201cThe pertinent question is whether [the appellant] demonstrated that the sentencing judge\u2014sentencing under an advisory scheme rather than a mandatory one\u2014 would have reached a significantly different result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This question requires us to assess whether \u201cthere is [an] indication in the record from the sentencing judge\u2019s remarks or otherwise that gives us any clue as to whether [ ]he would have reached a different conclusion\u201d if sentencing under an advisory scheme. <em>Id. </em>at 522. That the district court sentenced Calhoun to 60 months in prison, within a 51-to-63-month guideline imprisonment range, and that the court stated that it was \u201cgoing to follow the rules,\u201d are not indications that the court would have imposed a \u201csignificantly different result.\u201d No plain error is apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>Calhoun also contends that the application of a mandatory Guidelines regime was a \u201cstructural\u201d error that was \u201cper se prejudicial\u201d and \u201cinfeet[ed]\u201d his trial in a \u201cpervasive and systemic manner.\u201d Sentencing a defendant pursuant to a mandatory guideline scheme, standing alone, constitutes <em>\u201cFanfan\u201d </em>error, and such an error is \u201cplain.\u201d <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 750, 768-69 (addressing preserved challenge in companion case); <em>United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 733 (5th Cir.2005). For the reasons discussed above in connection with Calhoun\u2019s first argument, however, Calhoun has not established that such error affected his substantial rights. <em>See Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d at 733.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Calhoun\u2019s supplemental brief contains an informal request that this court grant en banc consideration to the issue whether <em>Mares\u2019s </em>plain-error formulation for <em>Booker </em>cases is correct. He also has filed a motion for leave to file a second supplemental brief addressing why he believes <em>Mares </em>was incorrectly decided. Calhoun has not remotely complied with Fed. R.App. P. 35 and 5th Cir. R. 35, which govern the filing of petitions for en banc consideration. The request for en banc consideration and the motion for leave to file a second supplemental brief are DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">AFFIRMED; REQUEST AND MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b604-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
