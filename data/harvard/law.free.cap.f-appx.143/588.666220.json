DeLeon-Garcia, </em>04-20316, 119 Fed. Appx. 605 (5th Cir.23 December 2004) (unpublished). The Supreme Court granted DeLeon-Garcia\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari and for leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis; </em>vacated our previous judgment; and remanded the case for further consideration in the light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>DeLeon-Garcia v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1997, 161 L.Ed.2d 852 (2005). We requested, and received, supplemental briefs addressing the impact of <em>Booker. </em>Having reconsidered our decision pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s instructions, we reinstate our judgment affirming the conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">DeLeon-Garcia first raised <em>Booker-error </em>on direct appeal; therefore, our review is only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. 31 Mar. 2005) (No. 04-9517). As DeLeonGarcia concedes, he cannot show \u201cthat the error ... affected the outcome of the district court proceedings\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 521 (quotation omitted). Accordingly, he fails the third prong of plain-error review.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">DeLeon-Garcia also contends: the district court committed \u201cstructural error\u201d when it sentenced him under a mandatory guidelines system; therefore, prejudice to his substantial rights should be presumed. He recognizes, however, that our court has rejected this contention as inconsistent with <em>Mares, see United States v. Malveaux, </em>411 F.3d 558, 561 n. 9 (5th Cir.2005), and raises it only to preserve it for possible further review by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b610-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
