Koon\u2019s argument that administrative remedies on the due process and equal protection claims he raised were unavailable to him under <em>Pope v. State, </em>792 So.2d 713 (La. 2001) , is unavailing as he is challenging the conditions of his confinement. <em>See Ferrington v. Louisiana Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>315 F.3d 529, 532 (5th Cir.2002); <em>Peterson v. Tofton, </em>828 So.2d 160, 163 (La.Ct.App. 2002) . Inasmuch as the prison\u2019s records show that Koon did not exhaust the instant claims, he has failed to exhaust his admin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>istrative remedies as is required by the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA). 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a); <em>Ferrington, </em>315 F.3d at 531.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">This appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Because it is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Koon now has one strike against him under the PLRA. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g); <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Koon is CAUTIONED that if he accumulates three strikes, he will no longer be allowed to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b652-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
