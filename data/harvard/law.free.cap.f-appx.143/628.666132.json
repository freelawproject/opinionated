Brown petitions for panel rehearing in light of the holding in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), that <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), is applicable to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. We now GRANT the petition for rehearing, withdraw our earlier opinion, and substitute the following. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 40(a)(4)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-20\">Brown appeals following his guilty plea to securities fraud, in violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77q(a) and 77x, and bank fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344. Brown pleaded guilty pursuant to a written plea agreement that contained a waiver of the right to appeal. We may examine Brown\u2019s plea agreement sua sponte to determine whether we may hear his claims. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>263 F.3d 436, 438 (5th Cir.2001). We conclude that the appeal is barred by the plain language of Brown\u2019s knowing and voluntary appeal waiver in the plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Bond, </em>414 F.3d 542, 546 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. McKinney, </em>406 F.3d 744, 746-47 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-25\">PETITION FOR REHEARING GRANTED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b650-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
