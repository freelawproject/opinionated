Hackney pled guilty to manufacturing methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (2000); possession of a firearm while an unlawful user of a controlled substance, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(3), 924(a)(2) (2000); and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>possession of an unregistered firearm, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5861(d), 5871 (2000). His sentencing occurred on March 21, 2005, after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014\u2014, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), ruling that its decision in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), was applicable to the federal sentencing guidelines. The district court, in sentencing Hackney, carefully and thoroughly applied the holding in <em>Booker. </em>The court sentenced Hackney to sixty-three months of imprisonment, followed by three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">On appeal, Hackney raises one issue, which he did not raise in the district court. He argues that his due process rights, as informed by ex post facto principles, are violated by the imposition of a sentence under the Supreme Court\u2019s remedial decision in <em>Booker </em>(referring to the Court\u2019s opinion expressed through Justice Breyer, which makes the guidelines advisory rather than mandatory), rather than under the mandatory guidelines applicable at the time of his offense. Reviewing this claim for plain error, we find none. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (plain error standard); <em>United States v. Jamison, </em>416 F.3d 538 (7th Cir.2005) (rejecting ex post facto claim); <em>United States v. Lata, </em>415 F.3d 107 (1st Cir.2005) (same); <em>United States v. Scroggins, </em>411 F.3d 572, 576 (5th Cir.2005) (same); <em>United States v. Duncan, </em>400 F.3d 1297 (11th Cir.2005) (same), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, \u2014 S.Ct. -, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (U.S. July 20, 2005) (No. 05-5467).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">Having found that Hackney failed to establish plain error under the <em>Olano </em>standard, we affirm his sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
