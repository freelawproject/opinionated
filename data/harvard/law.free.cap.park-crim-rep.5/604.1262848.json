Such company shall be entitled to collect and receive the same tolls as is provided by chapter 45 of the Laws of 1853.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b614-9\">The court then remarked that the last section read modified the first one; that if the defendant had changed the whole of their plank to broken stone or gravel, all that could be required of them was, that they should keep and maintain a good and substantial road as required by the last section last read. But in this case the question arises, inasmuch as a portion of the defendant\u2019s road is still laid with plank, and a part only relaid with broken stone and gravel, whether the defendant was not bound to keep and maintain a smooth and even surface in such part of their road as still remained laid with plank, or whether they were bound to keep only a good and substantial road, as required by the statute of 1855, read to them. That, as a matter of law, the court instruct the jury that the defendants were bound to keep the part of their road remaining laid with plank, so that the same should be substantially as required by the section of the statute first read; that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>not sufficient for them to keep that part of their road a good and substantial road, as required by the section last read to them ; they were bound to keep the part remaining laid with plank substantially as required by the statute first read in evidence, so as to keep a hard and even surface; that if from the evidence they should find that the defendant had failed to keep their road as required by the provisions of the statutes, as thus explained, or if they should find that the defendant suffered or permitted their road to remain out of repair for an unreasonable length of time, at any time within the time laid in the third and fourth counts of the indictment, they'should find the defendant guilty under those counts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b615-5\">The counsel for the defendant- then requested the court to charge and instruct the jury that before they would be warranted in finding the defendant guilty under either the third or .fourth counts in the indictment, they must find from the evidence that the defendant suffered and permitted some particular part of their road to be out of repair at some time within the time laid in the third and fourth counts in the indictment, and that such part so found by them to be out of repair, continued and remained out of repair down to the time of finding the indictment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b615-6\">The court refused to charge and instruct the jury as requested by the counsel for the defendant, and further charged and instructed the jury: That it was not necessary for them to find that the defendant\u2019s road was out of repair at the time of finding the indictment, in order to warrant a conviction; that if they should find that the defendant suffered and permitted their road to be out of repair for an unreasonable length of time at any time within the time laid in the third and fourth counts in the indictment, although it may have been repaired before the finding of the indictment, they should find the defendant guilty; that if they should be satisfied that the defendant, at any time in the month of June, after the time laid in the indictment, suffered or permitted that part of their road, described in the third count, to be and remain out of repair for an unreasonable length of time, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>although repaired by the defendant at the time of finding the indictment, yet they should find them guilty under the third count; and so.in respect to that portion of the road described in the fourth count.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-5\">The counsel for the defendant excepted to so much and such part of the charge as instructed the jury that the defendants were bound to keep that part of their road, which remained laid with plank, substantially as required by the first section of the statute read to them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-6\">And the counsel for the defendant excepted to the refusal of the court to charge and instruct the jury as requested by the defendant\u2019s counsel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-7\">The defendant also excepted to all that part of the charge of the court given after the request and refusal to charge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-8\">The jury found the defendant guilty as charged in the third and fourth counts in the indictment, and not guilty as to the other counts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-9\">The proceedings were removed to this court for review by <em>certiorari.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b616-10\"><em>David B. </em>Prosser, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b616-11\">I. The court erred in charging the jury that the defendants were bound to keep that part of their road'remaining laid with plank substantially as required by the statute read, and that it was not sufficient for them to keep that part of their road a good and substantial road, &amp;c. Because,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b616-12\">1st. The act of 1855 expressly authorized the defendants to relay their road, or any part thereof, with broken stone, gravel, or other hard substance, so as to keep a good and substantial road, and changed the rate of tolls. It is supposed the plank would come within the term, \u201c other hard substance,\u201d and the defendants might use plank, or any other hard substance, provided they keep a good and substantial road.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b616-13\">2d. If the road was a good and substantial one, the allegation in the indictment' that the road was ruinous, &amp;c., was negatived, and the defendants should have been acquitted. All. that the defendants were required to meet, was the charges' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>in the indictment.

The question presented by the indictment was, not whether the defendants had kept their road substantially as required by the statute, but the question was, whether the defendants\u2019 road was in a ruinous condition, as charged in the indictment. Under the charge of .the court, the jury would have been warranted in finding the defendants guilty, although they may have been satisfied, from the evidence, that the defendants had kept a- good and substantial road.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b617-6\">II.

Because,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b617-7\">1st. The remedy by indictment for not repairing roads, is intended and given for the purpose of compelling repairs. (1 <em>Russ, on Cr., </em>307, 317, 336.) It follows that, if the object of the prosecution is to compel repairs \u2014 that if none are wanting at the time of presentment \u2014 the prosecution must fail.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b617-8\">2d. All the authorities agree that one of the essential averments in all indictments for not repairing is, that the road is out of' repair; not that it was, or has been, but that it is, out of repair. <em>(Russ, on Cr., </em>366, 367; <em>Roscoe Cr. Ev., </em>571, 576; <em>Chit. Cr. Law, </em>576-579; 1 <em>Strange R., </em>180-183; 2 <em>Saund.

The charge in the indictment is, that, on the 6th day of June, 1863, and from thence until the finding of the indictment, the road had been, and still was, very ruinous, &amp;c. The substance of this allegation should.have been proven; yet the charge, in effect, instructs the jury that they might find the defendants guilty of the charge without proof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b617-10\">The jury have found the defendants guilty, as charged in the third and fourth counts, thereby finding that the road was, on the 9th day of June, and until the finding of the indictment, in a ruinous condition, as alleged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b617-11\">This they were justified in finding, under the charge, although they may have been fully satisfied, from the evidence, that, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>the time of finding the indictment, the road was in perfect order.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b618-5\"><em>John D.

There was no error in the charge \u201c that the defendants were bound to keep that part of the road, which remained laid with plank, substantially as required, by the first section read to them.\u201d <em>(The People </em>v. <em>Kingston &amp; Middletown Turnpike R.

To constitute a nuisance, it is not necessary that the road should be unsafe or impassable. Any contracting or narrowing of a highway is a nuisance. (1 <em>Buss, on Cr., </em>350.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b618-9\">Any obstruction left in the road, or omission to repair it, whereby it is less convenient for public use, falls within the same category. The public had a right to have that part of the road remaining laid with plank, continued substantially in the same manner,' as to width and safety, which the charter required at its first construction, until the defendants should relay the same with broken stone, gravel, shell or other hard material, whereby they keep a good and substantial road.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b618-10\">If the court' should not concur in the law of that part of the charge, it does not necessarily follow that it must set aside the verdict. The evidence did not make a case for laying down the law as to the manner in which the defendants were bound <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>to keep that part of the road which remained laid with plank; and an error of the court, concerning an abstract proposition, having nothing to do with the matter in hand, is not sufficient ground for reversing a judgment. <em>(Shorter </em>v.

Darwin Smith, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6K\">The defendants were convicted on the trial under the third and fourth counts of the indictment, and acquitted under other counts. The third and fourth counts were counts at common law, for a nuisance, in suffering their road to be out of repair. These counts both alleged that the defendant\u2019s road was, and had been, and still was, at and until the finding of said indictment, out of repair, to the damage and common nuisance of the citizens of the State, so that they cannot go, return and pass over the same, without great trouble, annoyance and inconvenience. On the trial the defendant\u2019s counsel requested the presiding judge to instruct and charge the jury that before they would be warranted in finding the defendant guilty under either the third or fourth count in the indictment, they must find from the evidence that the defendant suffered and permitted some par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>ticular part of their road to be out of repair at some time laid in the third and fourth counts in the indictment, and that such part so found to be out of repair, continued and remained out of repair down to the time of finding the indictment. The court refused to charge and instruct the jury as requested. by the counsel, but, on the contrary, charged them that it was not necessary for them to find that the defendant\u2019s road was out of repair at the time of the finding of the indictment in order to warrant a conviction, and that if the defendant had suffered their road to be out of repair, although it may have been repaired before the finding of the indictment, they should find the defendants guilty. To the charge as made, and to the refusal to charge as requested, the defendant\u2019s counsel duly excepted. These exceptions, I think, both well taken. The request to charge was nothing more than a request to the court to require the People to sustain by proof the material allegations of the indictment, or allegations without which the indictment would have been clearly demurrable. The object of the prosecution by indictment for nuisance to highways, is not for the punishment of the defendant, but the,repair of the highway, when it is out of repair, or the removal of the nuisance when the highway is obstructed. (3 <em>Chitty's Cr. L., </em>575; 1 <em>Russ, on Cr., </em>355.) The judgment in such oases is that the defendant pay a fine and abate the nuisance. (Id.; <em>Bac. Abr., Nuisance, </em>49, and <em>Term R., </em>142, 143.) In 1 <em>Russ, on Cr., </em>356, it is said: <em>\u201c </em>In order to warrant a judgment for abating a nuisance, it must be stated in the indictment to be <em>continuing, </em>as otherwise such judgment would be absurd.\u201d It follows, if such allegation was essential to maintain the indictment, it was error in the court below to hold that it need not be proved when contained in the indictment. The exceptions to the refusal of the judge to charge as requested, and to his charge in distinct conflict with such request, were, therefore, well taken, and the conviction below must, for that reason, be reversed, and a new trial directed in the Court of. Sessions of Yates county, and the case remitted for that purpose.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
