Witness said that on the 31st day of July, 1861, some unknown man came to his store and presented this said order; that, believing it was genuine, he delivered the goods mentioned upon its face; the goods sold were worth $161. Witness added, that within the next ten days after the delivery of said knives, he saw at the store of Samuel Basford several dozen of the same knives he gave upon the order ; they were all of the Meriden Cutlery Company manufacture.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-12\"><em>Samuel Basford </em>testified that he knew the prisoner; that he bought thirty-six dozen knives of Meriden Cutlery Company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>manufacture; the knives shown to the witness, Beadle, and seen by him, were bought from the prisoner by him only a few days before Beadle came there and saw them; he paid the prisoner $84 for the thirty-six dozen knives; .the thirty-six dozen knives were of the Meriden Cutlery Company manufacture.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-5\"><em>O.scar </em>Nathusius, sworn, said he was a member of the firm of Nathusius, Buggies &amp; Morrison, hardware dealers; that he knew the prisoner; that the prisoner was once (about four or five years before) a clerk for his firm for about three months; that during that time he saw him write; knows his handwriting; that he also saw him write his name, at the request of witness, in the Police Court, on the day of his arrest; that \u2022 he compared the writing of his name with this order, and from these facts was able to say that the order mentioned and set out in the indictment was, to the best of his knowledge and belief, in the handwriting of . the prisoner.

H. </em>Stuart, for the prisoner.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b294-9\">I. This instrument is not, upon its face, the subject of forgery, and the court erred in refusing so to charge, and in charging that it was, upon its face, a forgery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b294-10\">It is submitted that this writing is neither an order, warrant, nor request for the delivery of goods:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b294-11\">It is not addressed to any one.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b294-12\">An order is the mandate from one who professes to have control over the property named, addressed to another, who appears to be possessed of the same, and who, from the face of the paper, seems to be under an obligation to obey. The test of a written order for the delivery of goods is that, upon its face, there appears to be a drawer; that, upon its face, there appears to be property over which he has .control; that, upon its face, there appears to be a person drawn upon, to whom it must be addressed, and who, from its face, appears \"to be bound to deliver. <em>(See </em>1 <em>Bishop Cr. L., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 205, 206; <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>1 <em>Moody, </em>231; <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Church, </em>1 <em>Leach, </em>540-544; <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>2 <em>East. P.

In all else they are alike; the elements of their composition, and the facts necessary to their constitution, are the same. A warrant, instead of a written order, is a written authority from one to another, to do the thing mentioned. Both the authorizor and the authorized must be named in the writing to bind the one and justify the other in the transaction. A bill of exchange or a letter of credit, and instruments of like character, are warrants; they may also, under certain intrinsic circumstances, be orders.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-5\">The only difference \u2022 between an order, a warrant and a request, is, that while the one orders and the other authorizes, the third solicits. It, like them, must be addressed to some one; there must be a party requested as well as a requesting party. There must be some one to whom application is made, as well as some one applying for the favor prayed; each is equally essential to the perfection of the instrument. The absence of the one is as fatal to its legal existence as that of the other.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-6\">\u201c Forgery is the false making of an instrument which purports, on its face, to be good and valid for the purpose for which it was created.\u201d (1 Hawkins, <em>ch. </em>70, \u00a7 7; 2 <em>East P. </em>C., <em>ch. </em>19, \u00a7 45; 1 Leach, 407, 547; 9 <em>Wend. R., Shall's Case.)</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-7\">\u201cA false token,\u201d says Chief Justice .Savage, in the case of Gates (13 <em>Wend. R., </em>311), \u201cis a false writing in the name of another, so framed as to obtain more credit than the mere assertion of the. party defrauding.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-8\">IL The court erred in refusing to charge, \u201c that the \u2018Meriden Cutlery Company \u2019 could not be regarded as the subject of an-intended fraud by the prisoner, in forging or uttering the instrument set forth in the indictments.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-9\">An indictment in a case of forgery with intent,to defraud must charge the intent to be to defraud either a natural person or some creature of or being known to the law, which, has a legal existence corresponding to a natural person.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-10\">There is a case in' 27 <em>Vermont R., </em>277, where a prisoner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>(Meade) was convicted of obstructing an engine of a \u201c railroad company,\u201d which was reversed upon the ground that the indictment did not aver that the company was a corporation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-5\">Henry Wilber (4 <em>Park Cr. R., </em>19) was indicted under an \u201c act for the protection of Gas Light Companies,\u201d for defrauding a Gas Light Company. The court (Judge Brown) held that even here it must appear that the company defrauded was a corporation, in order to convict the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-6\">In the case of <em>The People </em>v. <em>Chadwick </em>(2 <em>Park Cr. R., </em>163), indicted for having counterfeit bank notes in possession, with. intent to utter and cheat the Commercial Bank, the court say, in its opinion, among other things, that if there was no corporation shown to exist, it could not be said that the prisoner intended the fraud charged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-7\">III. The court erred in refusing to charge that, \u201cif the grand jury, at the time of finding the indictment, and the petit jury, at. the trial of the same, knew from testimony who was to be defrauded in the making and uttering this instrument, then the charge in the indictment that the prisoner intended to 1 cheat and defraud certain persons to the jurors unknown,\u2019 must be disregarded for variance from the evidence.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-8\">In the case of <em>The King </em>v. <em>Walker </em>(3 <em>Campb., </em>264), the principal felon was described as a person to the jurors unknown. It appeared that he was known to the grand jury at the time they indicted, and the receiver was acquitted for the variance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-9\">The same rule was observed, under, like circumstances, in the case of <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Robinson </em>(1 <em>Holt, </em>595).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-10\">It is said (2 <em>Hawk, </em>319), that the indictment must be certain as to the party, if known against whom the offense 'was committed, that the prisoner may be informed as 'well who he is charged with having injured, as what the offense preferred against him is.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-11\">An error in setting forth the name \u00f3f \"the injured party is much more serious than an error in setting forth the name of the offender himself, as. the former is proper ground for acquittal, in case of variance in the evidence; while the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>latter can only be taken advantage of by abatement. <em>(Whart. Cr. L., </em>71.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-5\">Where the name of an inj ured party cannot be ascertained, as where the body of a murdered man is found, who cannot be identified, the indictment may allege the name to be to the jurors unknown. (2 Hale, 181.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-6\">To support a description of \u201c unknown,\u201d it must appear, said Mr. Sergeant Talfourd, in the case of <em>The Queen </em>v. <em>Strand </em>(Car. <em>&amp; Kir., </em>187), from the evidence at the trial, that the name of the party injured could not have been known to the grand jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-7\">IV. The verdict ought to be set aside for that the prisoner has been convicted of two several crimes \u2014 forging and uttering \u2014 each a distinct, independent, substantive felony.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b297-8\"><em>Nelson J. Waterbury </em>(District Attorney), for the People.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b297-9\"><em>By the Qourt, </em>Ingraham, P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1t\">The exceptions relied upon in this case were to the judge\u2019s charge. The prisoner was indicted for forgery of an order for the delivery of goods. The prisoner\u2019s counsel requested the court to charge the jury that the instrument set out in the indictment was not upon its face the subject of forgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-10\">All the questions as to this \u2022 order and the nature of the offense, except the one which is based upon the want of a direction in the order, were raised and decided in <em>Harris </em>v. <em>The People </em>(9 <em>Barb. R., </em>664), and the court there held that such an order was within the provisions of \u00a7 33, 2 <em>R. S., </em>673.</p>\n<p id=\"AFa\">In <em>The People </em>v. <em>Stearns </em>(21 <em>Wend. R., </em>409), Cowen, J., says: \u201c Every instrument in writing which may affect property\u2014 for example, an order, a letter, or a mere license \u2014 is made the subject of a felonious forgery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-12\">The construction which was given to the crime of forgery, as defined in the thirty-third section, is so sweeping as to cover almost any writing by which another person may be in any way deprived of property, and the cases cited are conclusive on this question. Mor do I think the objection fatal that the order has no special direction. Under the English statute such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>direction seems to have been considered necessary; but that statute is not as broad as ours, and the same necessity for the application of the rule does not apply. It is sufficient if the order is of such a. character that another can, by the use of it, be deprived of property. If so, then it may be the subject of forgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The next objection is, that the indictment charges the intent of the prisoner to have been to defraud the \u201cMeriden Cutlery Company, and divers other persons to the jury unknown,\u201d and that the court refused to charge that the Meriden Cutlery Company could not be regarded as the subject of fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">This point was also the subject of consideration in the case of tStearns, and in that case in the Court of Errors (23 <em>Wend., </em>634), the Chancellor says: \u201c The indictment charges that the forged order was made with intent to defraud the Bank of Kentucky, and divers-other persons to the jurors unknown. If there is no corporation of that name, it necessarily follows that the indictment is broad enough to reach the unknown individuals, who constituted the company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">So in this case, if there is no such corporation' as the Meriden Cutlery Company, then the indictment is broad enough to reach the unknown individuals who constitute the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">The case of <em>Be Bow </em>(1 <em>Denio R., </em>9), does not conflict with these decisions, because in that case the indictment charged an. intent to defraud the Bank of Nassau, and no other person, although it does conflict with the former decision of the same court in <em>The People </em>v. <em>Peabody </em>(25 <em>Wend. R., </em>472), where it was held that it was immaterial whether the bank really had a legal existence, if the forged instrument <em>purported </em>to be issued by an institution authorized for such a purpose, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">The third exception was to the refusal of the judge to charg\u00e9 the jury, that if the grand jury knew, at the finding of the indictment, whom the prison.er intended to defraud, he could not be convicted of an intent to defraud persons unknown.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">It is sufficient for this objection to say that there was no evidence to show, that the grand jury had any knowledge of that kind. A judge is never required to submit to the jury a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>question which has no evidence in the case to support it. On the contrary, it would be error to do so. <em>(The People </em>v. Rynders, 12 <em>Wend. R., </em>432.)</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">We think the conviction in this case was right, and that the court below should proceed to sentence the prisoner. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">The case must be remitted to the court below, and that court is advised to pass sentence upon the prisoner.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
