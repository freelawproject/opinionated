It is only by proving specific acts that her previous character can be assailed.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b254-10\">Nor is it competent on the trial of such an indictment, to prove by general reputation that the house of the mother of the prosecutrix, where the prosecutrix . lived, was a house of ill-fame. If such a fact is proper to be proved, it should be established, not by hearsay, but by positive testimony.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b254-12\">To convict under this statute, which subjects to punishment \u201c any <em>man </em>who shall, under promise of marriage, seduce,\" &amp;c., it is not necessary to prove on the trial that the defendant is twenty-one years of age. If he is old enough to be the father of the child begotten by him, he is sufficiently within the description of the statute to- be amenable to punishment for the offense.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b254-13\">The statute, in providing that no \"conviction shall be had on the testimony of the female seduced, unsupported by other evidence, does not require the testimony of an additional witness. The corroborating evidence may be supplied by the facts and circumstances surrounding the transaction and otherwise established in the case.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b254-14\">Where the prosecutrix testified that she was unmarried, and it appeared that she was sixteen years of age at the time of the alleged offense, and living with her mother, the fact that she was unmarried was held to be, <em>prima fade, </em>sufficiently established within the requirement of the statute.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b254-15\">Where a seduction is accomplished by means of a promise of marriage on the part of the seducer, a consent of the female to. marry the seducer, amounting to a mutual promise on her part to marry,- is implied.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b254-16\">Where it was proved on the trial that the defendant was a frequent visitor at 'the house of the mother of the female seduced, that he waited on her to balls and parties, and took her out frequently to ride, and when her mother spoke; to him about his keeping company with her daughter, said his motives were good, it was held that such facts were\u2019 proper evidence for the consideration of the jury, in corroboration of her testimony, to prove that he had made to her a promise of marriage.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b255-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>The testimony of the female, as to the illicit connection with the defendant, is corroborated by evidence that she was delivered of a child, of the abundant opportunity afforded for the defendant to become the father of it, and of the external evidence's of the intimacy existing between the parties.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b255-5\">The statute does not require that the testimony of the female shall be corroborated in every particular. It is only necessary that it should be supported in the main features of the case.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b255-6\">\u2022 The defendant was indicted for seduction under a promise of marriage.

That the defendant seduced and had illicit connection with her under promise of marriage. (5.) That the defendant seduced the said Mary Chissom. (6.) That no legal promise of 'marriage had been proven in the case. (7.) That the People had failed to prove that defendant was a man within the intention and meaning of the statute. (8.) The promise proved in this case, if there is any, is a conditional one. The promise alleged in the indictment is absolute, and hence there is a variance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-7\">Ho conviction can be had under the second count, because the promise therein alleged is, that he would marry when requested, and there is no proof of such a promise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-8\">The court denied the motion, and the counsel for the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-9\">Several witnesses were examined on the part of the defense. During their examination the counsel for the defendant offered to prove that .the witness and prosecutrix, Mary Chissom\u2019s, character for chastity was, by general reputation among her neighbors, bad, which offer was objected to by the district attorney, upon the ground that the evidence is incompetent, and that the defendant, if he wishes to attack the character of Mary for chastity, must do so by specific acts, and that it cannot be shown by general reputation. The court sustained the objection. To which decision of the court the counsel for the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-10\">The defendant also offered to prove that, from general repu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>tation among the neighbors in the neighborhood where the witne\u00e1s, Eliza Chissom, resided and kept house, and with whom the witness, Mary Chissom, lived, the house kept by the said Eliza Chissom was a house of ill fame.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-5\">The district attorney, on behalf of the People, objected to such offer and the reception of the evidence, upon the ground that the same is improper and incompetent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-6\">The court sustained the objection, and refused to receive the evidence. To which decision of the court the counsel for the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-7\">After the evidence on both sides was closed, the counsel for the defendant again asked that the defendant be discharged, and that the jury be directed to find a verdict of \u201c not guilty,\u201d on the same .grounds as stated on the previous motion. The court denied the motion, and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-8\">After the counsel on both sides had addressed the jury, the presiding judge charged as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-9\">Gentlemen of the jury : The statute upon which this indictment is based is one rather peculiar in its provisions, and (as has been stated) up to the time of its passage there-was no statute law, whatever, punishing seduction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-10\">bTor was seduction a crime at common law; but the legislature has deemed the subject of sufficient importance to enact such a law. It is the law of the land, and you are to admin-, ister this law as you find it. If a clear case of guilt has been established, then your duty is plain.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-11\">There are several leading principles to- which we propose to call your attention, without reciting the proofs, for these are as fresh\u2014and probably more so\u2014in your minds than our own. We merely intend to call your attention to such points, and to such proofs under such points, as will aid you in arriving at a just conclusion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-12\">The first point to be shown on the part of the People is this: Was the prosecutrix an unmarried female? There was no testimony, except that of Mary Chissom herself, upon that point. She testifies that she was an unmarried female.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>The next proposition in order is this: Was there a promise of marriage ? Because, unless there was a promise of marriage on the part of the defendant, then, although the evidence of \u25a0 the seduction of the prosecutrix be clear, this of itself would . not constitute an offense \u00abgainst the statute-. The promise of marriage is a condition precedent, and must be proved. Unless the People, therefore, have made out a sufficient promise of marriage, then there can be no conviction. For, although it be conceded that this prosecutrix was seduced, as claimed, yet, if such seduction was not accomplished under a promise of marriage, then it it is not an offense under the statute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-5\">The first laboring point in the case will be this -: Was there a promise of marriage ? Upon the question of the mutuality of this promise, the authorities are somewhat in cpnflict. By some, it has been held that it should be mutual, <em>i. e., </em>a valid promise; while, on the other hand, it has been held that whether the promise is binding at law or not, if the prosecutrix believed it, and it was the consideration for, or the inducement to, the illicit intercourse, the promise is sufficient.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-6\">Now, in respect to this question, we prefer to charge you in the language we have written out: If ypu shall be fully satisfied from the evidence that the defendant promised to marry the prosecutrix if she would have carnal connection with him, and she, believing and confiding in such promise, and intending on her part to accept such offer of marriage, did have such - carnal connection, it is a sufficient promise of marriage under the statute. The evidence upon this point is that of the prosecutrix. She testifies in respect to it. I might refer to -her testimony; but, as counsel have commented fully and at length upon her evidence touching this promise and its terms, it it will be unnecessary for me to do so. If you find from her evidence that it complies with the definition we have given you\u2014in other words, if the defendant promised to marry her if she would submit to have carnal and illicit intercourse with him, and she, believing such promise to have been made in good faith, and on her part intending to accept such offer of marriage, and then yielded\u2014we say that such a promise is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>sufficient to bring the prosecutrix within the protection of the statute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-6\">But, in respect to this, as well as to every other point, you-should be fully satisfied. You should be satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt that there was such a promise made. If you come to the conclusion from the whole evidence, beyond reasonable doubt, <em>i. </em>e., if you have no reasonable doubt that there . was such a promise made, the next point to be taken into consideration will be, did he have sexual connection with her? In other words, did he seduce and have illicit-connection with the prosecutrix ? How she is the only person who has testified upon that point directly\u2014the only one who has given direct evidence upon that point. If she has testified truly upon that point, there was a sexual connection as stated. But whether she has stated truly, or stated it as it was, we do not undertake to say, but submit it to you for your consideration and determination.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-7\">- The question of seduction is one of the leading questions in this case. Because, as we before remarked, even though there was a promise of marriage, and yet he did not seduce her, then no offense has been committed. Bui, even if these two propositions are found in the affirmative, \"still there can be no conviction, unless the prosecutrix is supported by other evidence. \u2019 Because the statute goes farther, and provides that no conviction can be had upon the unsupported evidence of the female, hence the prosecutrix must be supported. Has she been supported by evidence in respect to a promise of marriage ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-8\">The evidence relied upon by the People upon this point is that of her-mother, who appears as a witness and testifies that the prosecutrix lived with her at and during the time the defendant called upon Mary. She testifies to you the frequency \"of these visits and their duration, that he called sometimes in the day time, and more frequently in the evening, and that he stayed during the evening; and she stated to you the length of time that he remained there, and the length of time over which the calls extended. This is all proper evidence, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>bearing upon the promise of marriage, and it is submitted to you, and you are to say whether you infer from this evidence of the mother that such a promise of marriage was made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-5\">Formerly, in civil cases, in actions for a breach of promise, it was not necessary to prove positively and directly, an absolute promise of marriage. It was sufficient if the circumstances given in evidence were such that the jury might infer a promise of marriage, and we say to you now that this is competent evidence, as bearing upon this question. Does it impress your minds to that extent that you can infer a promise of marriage ? If so, it corroborates the prosecutrix.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-6\">It is not for us to determine, nor do we intend to give you any direction in respect to the force or strength of this testimony, for you will understand, as well as we, and better too, the proper inference to be drawn from it. You will say what impression this evidence makes upon your minds as corroborating Mary upon the question of. a promise of marriage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-7\">Again, this same evidence is competent upon another question -\u2014 that of seduction, and illicit intercourse. Mrs. Chissom testifies that he was there frequently, and that they occupied the parlor, and were generally alone. She puts them in a position where an act of this kind could be done; and you will say what inference you draw from this testimony, and whether it corroborates Mary upon the point as to being seduced by, and having illicit intercourse with, the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-8\">Eight here, it is claimed, on the part of the defendant, that Mrs. Chissom is not entitled to credit; and, in order to impeach her, eight witnesses have sworn in respect to her character in that neighborhood, some of whom say it is not good; others, that it is bad. I think the farthest any of them state in respect to her character for truth is, that they would hate to say that they would not believe her under oath.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-9\">On the other hand the People have introduced eight witnesses who have sworn as to her character, all swearing they would believe her under oath. The question of credibility is with you. Her appearance on the stand, the probability of the story she tells, and this proof tending to impeach her charae<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>ter, offered by the defendant, as well as the proof to sustain her, all is competent, all proper to be submitted to you upon the question of credibility ; and you will say, upon this whole evidence.\u2014 her story, its probability, and the evidence introduced on the part of the defendant, and on the part of the People, and her appearance upon the stand, whether she is entitled to your credit. If she is not entitled to your credit, then Mary stands uncorroborated, and there can be no conviction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-5\">Another question to be considered, involves the credit of the prosecutrix as a witness upon the stand. It is conceded here, on the part of the People, that there were some discrepancies in some parts of her testimony. For instance : that she did not go upon Flat street with Bennett; and in another respect: she testifies that she did not go out of the church at a certain time ;\u25a0 and Bennett in that respect contradicts her. You will say whether, if at all, this shakes her credibility. Her appearance upon the stand, and her testimony, are before you, and you have a right to judge of her credit, and you will say, therefore, whether she, as a witness, is fully entitled to your credit; and if not fully, to what extent. The question of credibility is entirely with you.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-6\">It is claimed on the part of the defendant, that no -conviction can be had unless Mary is corroborated, not only in respect to a promise of marriage' and seduction, but also that she must be corroborated as to being an Unmarried female, and having been of previous chaste character. We advise and instruct you that, in respect to her being an unmarried female, she needs no corroboration. The prosecutrix testifies to her chastity, and if entitled to credit, this is sufficient, and she need not be corroborated as to chastity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-7\">The statute, evidently, was drawn with care, hence it requires that the prosecutrix shall be supported, in respect to the material points; but whether this extends to any other points than the promise of marriage and seduction, has been made a question. Seductions generally take place when the parties are alone, and the legislature, in order to guard parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>from .false charges, required that the feihale making such charges shpuld be supported by other evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-5\">It is important, and necessary to a conviction, that she be an unmarried female, but having testified to it herself, it is not necessary, as before remarked, that she should be corroborated on that point. Were she a married female, this would be' matter of defense, and could be taken advantage of by the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-6\">We come now to speak of a question vital to this issue: Upon the whole evidence, was Mary, the prosecutrix, prior to this alleged seduction, a person of chaste character? This is a vital question, because, if the defendant has shown, of if it appears from the whole proof, to your satisfaction, that, prior to the time alleged, she was a person of unchaste character, then she is not entitled to the protection of. the statute. A person claiming the protection of this statute must be of chaste character; and, that we may have the definition of the word \u201c chaste,\u201d I read its definition, as given by Webster: 1. <em>\u201c </em>Pure, free from unlawful commerce, undefiled; applied to married persons, true to the marriage bed.\u201d ' 2. <em>\u25a0\u201c </em>Free from obscenity.\u201d This is the definition of \u201c chastity,\u201d and we think it is a proper one to be applied to this word, as used in the statute. The question recurs: Is the prosecutrix a person of chaste character? Did she, prior to the time alleged, possess a chaste character?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-7\">Upon this point there has been a good deal of testimony introduced by the defendant. As we before remarked,' we are not going to detail it to you; it is fresh in your minds. You will carefully examine the whole evidence bearing upon this question, and say whether she was a person of chaste character.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-8\">\u201c Character,\u201d as has been defined by the courts (and we think properly), means \u201c personal virtuebut it is not necessary that the defendant should prove before you actual connection with any person, in order to establish her want of chaste character. . It is sufficient if he prove such a state of facts as will warrant you in the inference that she is not a chaste character.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>The defendant has proved certain specific acts which he claims are unchaste, and asks you, from these acts, to say by your verdict, that the prosecutrix was not of chaste character previous to the alleged commission of this offense. These acts are fresh in your minds, and we need not refer to them. It is sufficient for us to say that they do bear upon the question of chastity, but to what extent it is not our province to decide. This is a question purely for yo\u00far consideration. It is for you to say whether this evidence is of that character and that force that your minds are led to the conviction that she was a lewd person, or of unchaste character.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-5\">Gentlemen, you are practical men, and you are, I think, capable of weighing the force and effect of this testimony, and will therefore give it that force and effect which properly belongs to it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-6\">In conclusion, we need scarcely add that this is an important case. It is the first one tried in this county. It is important to the defendant; it is important to the People; and as you retire to your room for deliberation, you will not allow those deliberations to be influenced by any considerations of sympathy. This case (as I doubt not it will be), should be decided upon the evidence as it appears in the case, as it has been detailed before you, and not by sympathy for the prosecutrix or the defendant. If he is guilty of the offense charged, then, gentlemen, it will be your duty to convict him. But you will not convict unless you are satisfied beyond, reasonable doubt upon all the points which we have presented to you; and if you are thus satisfied, your duty, though unpleasant and painful, is nevertheless imperative.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-7\">As we have stated,- this is an important case. Indeed it is a sad one. We hope your verdict will vindicate the right of the case, wherever it maybe found. We submit the case to you. . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-8\">At the request of the defendant\u2019s counsel, we further charge you that the evidence as to Bennett\u2019s calling on the prosecutrix should be taken into consideration, as bearing upon the question as to the defendant being a suitor, and upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>alleged promise of marriage; and you will say whether or not it repels the claim as to whether he was a suitor, or there was a promise of marriage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-5\">The counsel for the defendant excepted to so much of the charge which is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-6\">\u201c If you shall be fully satisfied from the evidence that the defendant promised to marry the prosecutrix if she would have carnal connection with him, and she, believing and confiding in such promise, and intending on her part to accept such offer of marriage, did have such carnal connection, it is a sufficient promise of marriage under the statute.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-7\">The counsel for the defendant also excepted to so much of said charge which is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-8\">\u201c If you find from her evidence that it complies with the definition we have given you \u2014 in other words, if the defendant promised to marry her if she would submit to have carnal and illicit intercourse with him, and she believing such promise to have been made in good faith, and on her part intending to accept such offer of marriage, and then yielded\u2014we say that such a promise is sufficient to bring the prosecutrix within the protection of the statute.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-9\">.The defendant\u2019s counsel also excepted to so much of said charge as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-10\">\u201cWe advise and instruct you that, in respect to her being an unmarried female, she needs no corroboration.

(1.) In regard to the promise of marriage made by the defendant. (2.) To the seduction. (3.) To the illicit connection. (4.) That she was unmarried. (5.) That she was of previous chaste character.

V. </em>Harpending, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"131\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-5\">I. The defendant was indicted at the Yates Oyer and Terminer, in March, 1861, .under \u201c an act to punish seduction as a crime \u201d <em>(ch. </em>111, <em>Laws of </em>1848, <em>p. </em>148), and convicted at the Yates County Sessions in November last. The following is a copy of the act:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"132\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-6\">\u201cAny man who shall, under promise of marriage, seduce and have illicit connection with any unmarried female of previous chaste character, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and, upon conviction, shall be punished by imprisonment in a State prison not exceeding five years, or by imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding one year; provided that no conviction shall be had under the provisions of this act, on the testimony of the' female seduced, unsupported by'other evidence, nor unless indictment shall be found within two years' after the commission of the offense ; and provided further, that the subsequent marriage of the parties may be pleaded in bar of a conviction.\u201d <em>(Laws of </em>1848, <em>p. </em>148.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"133\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-7\">Under this statute the word \u201cman,\u201d we think, must mean an adult of twenty-one years. It certainly cannot mean an infant nor a mere boy or youth. It seems to be used in contradistinction from either of those. He must be a <em>man, </em>capable in law of making a legal and binding promise of marriage, and such an \u2018one that the promisee could maintain an action at law upon. Not an infant of sufficient age to lisp out the promise, but a man whom the law declares of sufficient age to make a contract. This view is strengthened by the words, <em>\u201cpromise of </em>marriage,\u201d meaning a contract binding in law between the promisor and promisee, and one for the breach of which on either side an action could be maintained at law. No civil action could be maintained by the prosecutrix in this case against the defendant for a breach of promise of marriage, provided the defendant was, at the time of making such promise, an infant under the age of twenty-one. (5 <em>Cow. R., </em>175.) It is true that in such a case the <em>onus </em>of proof would be' on the defendant to show infancy; but in this-case <em>that.onus </em>of proof has been changed by the statute, and hence the People <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>must show that the defendant was a man of the age of twenty-one. \u00a1No such proof was given in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"134\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b275-5\">II.- It is also plain that it must be a legal and binding contract, and in order to be so it must be mutual, otherwise it would be a mere <em>nudum pactum. </em>In this case there was no such contract or promise proven. The prosecutrix did not promise or agree on her part to marry the defendant \u201c He said if I would do so and so he would marry me \u201d (meaning to have sexual intercourse with me). <em>\u201c </em>I told him, no, sir. \u2022 He had sexual intercourse with me after this conversation.\u201d \u25a0 \u201cI don\u2019t remember whether there was anything said by me as to my being willing to marry him.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"135\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b275-6\">This is the substance of all the evidence given upon this subject, and fails t\u00f3 show such a promise of marriage as the law contemplates. It wants mutuality. She does not agree to marry him, but expressly refuses. The defendant could not maintain an action against, the prosecutrix upon these facts for a breach of promise of marriage, were she of age and refused to fulfill. Seduction and illicit connection is not a crime by this act, unless it takes place <em>u under promise of marriage </em>meaning that before and at the time of the seduction and illicit connection there must be a binding and <em>subsisting </em>promise of marriage; otherwise the intercourse could not take place under promise of marriage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"136\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b275-7\">The spirit of mutuality must be breathed into it, and it -must become a living contract before the seduction and. illicit connection take place, or it is no crime; and so the judge held in the well considered opinion of the <em>People </em>v. <em>Alger </em>(1 <em>Park. Cr. R., </em>323). <em>(Newcomb </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>1 <em>Denio, </em>226, 228, 229.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"137\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b275-8\">HI. Again, the promise of marriage in this'case on the part of the defendant was made to depend upon the fact that illicit intercourse should take place. \u201c He said, if I would do so and so he would marry me.\u201d The condition precedent was, that she should have sexual intercourse with him. \u00a1No action could be maintained by the prosecutrix against the defendant for the breach of such a promise, without showing a compliance upon her part with the condition precedent The promise of mar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>riage does not become complete until illicit connection takes place. It cannot be said, therefore, that \u201c seduction and illicit connection \u201d take place \u201c <em>under promise of </em>marriage,\u201d when such intercourse must take place before and in1 order to complete the promise. Hence the court erred in his charge to the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"138\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b276-5\">IV\". Again, the promise of marriage proven in this case was not binding upon the defendant in any view whatever, not even after illicit connection had taken place between the parties, and no action could have been maintained by the prosecutrix against the-defendant thereon for a breach thereof, because the same was in contravention of good morals. (5 <em>Cow., </em>253; 4 <em>Denio, </em>439; 13 <em>Barb, </em>92.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"139\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b276-6\">Again, suppose the defendant had promised the prosecutrix to pay her fifty dollars if she would have carnal connection with him, and she believing and confiding in such promise, and intending on her part to accept such offer, and then yielded, would it be such a promise in law as the prosecutrix could maintain an action upon against the defendant for the fifty dollars ? Clearly not, and as everybody, \u201c females as well as males, are presumed to know the law.\u201d (1 <em>Park. Cr. R., </em>337.) Hence the prosecutrix and the defendant both knew that such a promise as he made was not binding in law, and, therefore, the illicit connection took place without any legal or valid promise of marriage whatever.

The statute does not contemplate that the female shall be supported or corroborated upon every material fact alleged.

The support, or corroboration, is, at all events, only necessary fo those.points which constitute the offense, viz., the promise and intercourse, and is not necessary as to those points which merely indicate the person to be protected, viz., that she was unmarried and of previous chaste character. Chaste character means \u201c personal purity \u201d (8 <em>Barb. S. C. Rep., </em>603; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>1 <em>Park. Cr.

The principles on which rules of evidence are founded require, then, that the evidence of the female seduced that she was unmarried should be deemed sufficient without support, and it should be left to the defense to controvert it if they can; and the same rule applies in regard to chastity of character.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"192\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-6\">3.

He was indicted under an act passed by the legislature of this State in 1848, and entitled \u201cAn act to punish seduction as a crime.\u201d There was an act passed in England, as far back as the reign of Henry VII, which made the forcible abduction and marriage or defilement of a woman a crime, provided the woman was an heiress. \u25a0 That statute declared that any person should be deemed and punished as a felon who, for <em>lucre, </em>should take any woman, contrary to her will, and be married to her or defile her. If the first 'taking was against her will, it was still felony even if the subsequent marriage or defilement was with her consent. Still, the filthy <em>lucre </em>was the ground of offense. There could be no conviction unless, in addition to the woman, there was money in the case. It must appear that she had real or personal estate, or was an heir apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">Our statute was enacted for a higher and nobler purpose; not to prevent or to punish simply what was known commonly as the \u201c stealing of an heiress,\u201d but, under threatened punishment, to prevent men from .stealing from young and confiding women, under the solemn promise of marriage, that which is often dearer to them than their money or even their life\u2014their personal chastity. Hence, all that the act requires is that she shall be unmarried and of a \u201c previous chaste character.\u201d What, then, is meant by the expression, \u201c a previous chaste character?\u201d I answer, in the language of this court in this district, as expressed by Judge Welles, in <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>The People </em>(8 Barb.): <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>\u201cWe think the words referred to do mean actual personal virtue; that the female must be actually chaste and pure in conduct and principle, up to the time-of the commission of the offense.\u201d That case arose under another statute\u2014a statute enacted for the punishment of those who abducted or seduced away females for the purpose of prostitution. It was enacted by the same legislature, and was emphatically a kindred statute. The precise phrase is used in both acts, and, manifestly, what is a correct interpretation of the expression in one act, would also be in the other. But that construction was approved in the 3d district, in the case, of <em>Crozier </em>v. <em>The People (reported in 1 Park. Cr. </em>R, 453) \u2014 a case which arose under the. statute which we are considering, and for violating which the prisoner was indicted and convicted. Then, following the language of Judge Parker, in the latter case, I should sayowith him, expressing the'-Views of the court in that district, \u201c Chastity is the general law of society. A want of chastity is the exception. It could only be impeached by showing acts of illicit intercourse.\u201d It follows, that the offer on the part of the defendant to prove that the character of the witness and prosecutrix, Mary Chissom, for chastity, was, by general reputation, bad,, was properly, excluded. The question was, not what her reputation for chastity was, but what was her real, her actual character. Was she, in truth and in fact, a virtuous and chaste woman, or was she lewd and unchaste ? She had testified to her acquaintance with the defendant; his attention and courtship; his promise of marriage; the illicit intercourse with him; that no other person had addressed her as a suitor; that she was unmarried, and that she had never had sexual intercourse with any person other than the defendant, the prisoner at the bar. It Was competent for the defendant to show, if he could, that she was unchaste, and that others beside himself had had illicit intercourse with her. He called his and her companions, and by the testimony of Stephen Bennett and others sought to show that she was lascivious, but failed to satisfy the jury that she was not, in the language of the statute, of \u201c previous chaste character.\u201d I am inclined- to think that the testimony given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>by Bennett of his attempts upon her virtue, and of her resistance, would tend to satisfy the jury that she fell only when an avowed suitor offered his hand and made the sacred promise of marriage. But be that as it may, it is very clear to my mind that it was not by general reputation, but only by specific acts, that he could impeach her character for chastity. The offer was made, both in reference to her being a witness as well as prosecutrix. If the offer had been made as to both in distinct propositions, it still would have been rightly rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">It was expressly held in the late. Court of Errors, in <em>Bakeman </em>v. <em>Rose and wife </em>(18 <em>Wend. R., </em>146), that evidence of general reputation that a female witness was a prostitute was inadmissible for the purpose of impeaching the witness. So, too, the offer to prove that from general reputation the house where Eliza Chissom lived, and who was the mother of Mary, and with whom Mary lived, was a house of ill fame, was properly rejected and the evidence excluded. If true, it was a fact which could be proved by specific acts also. The general rule undoubtedly is, that hearsay evidence is incompetent to establish any specific fact which is in its nature susceptible of being proved by witnesses who speak, from their own knowledge. If this house was the home of lewd women, and the resort of unprincipled men, and was in truth a house of prostitution, it would very, evidently have been in the power of the defendant, who was a frequent visitor there, to have made proof of specific facts tending to show its real character; but he could not-show it by general reputation. <em>(See note to </em>1 <em>Phil. Ev., Cow. &amp; Hill\u2019s Notes, note </em>432.)</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">I have thus considered one of the provisions of the act \u2014 that which requires the female to be of chaste character, as it became necessary to do so in connection with the offer of proof made by the defendant. But the objections made and exceptions taken by the defendant on the trial, were so numerous, and directed to every provision of the statute, that it becomes necessary to refer to them all somewhat in detail. Beferring, then, again to the language of the act, \u201c Any man who shall, under promise of marriage, seduce and have illicit connection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>with any unmarried female of previous chaste character, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor,\u201d &amp;c., \u201c provided that no convic; tion shall be had under the provisions of this act on the testimony of the female seduced, unsupported by other <em>evidence.\" </em>It may be well to bear in mind that there is a marked difference between testimony and <em>evidence. </em>The latter is much more comprehensive than the former\u2014testimony being the statements or the declarations of a witness, and evidence being rather the result or .deduction from all the facts established, whether by testimony, -byv events or by circumstances, by writings, records or other memorials. It is called evidence, saith Ooke, because thereby the point in issue in a cause to be tried is to be made evident to the jury, and the evidence to a jury containeth testimony of witnesses and all other proofs to be given and produced to a jury for the finding of any issue joined between parties. <em>(See Jacobs' Law Dictionary, Title, </em>\u201c <em>Dvidence.\")</em></p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Now, in the act we. are considering, the testimony of the female seduced must be supported by other evidence. Not necessarily the testimony of another witness, as in our statute relating to the crime of treason, where it is required that there shall be the testimony of two lawful witnesses to the same overt act, but other evidence besides the testimony of her upon whom the wrong was inflicted. Proceeding, then, with the provisions of this act, the first of which is, that \u201c any man who shall,\u201d &amp;c. Even upon this phrase the defendant raised the question of the sufficiency of the proof to convict, as it did not appear by any proof that he was a <em>man. </em>He was in court, present before the jury, and not sued upon a promise to marry, but charged with a crime. If he was old enough to be, and was; the father of the child begotten upon the body of the prosecutrix, under a promise of marriage, I apprehend there can be no doubt that he was a man within the meaning' of the statute, and old enough to be punished for the crime. This objection can hardly require any serious discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">The female seduced must be an unmarried female. In her testimony in this case, she states distinctly and positively that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>she was unmarried. Is it necessary that in this she should be supported ? I think not. On the contrary, if the female were married, in almost every case it would be a fact capable of direct proof. But, in the case before us, the female is supported. It appears by evidence other than her testimony, that she was\u2019a young woman \u2014 perhaps a better expression would be, a girl-\u2014living at home with her mother, scarcely fifteen years of age when the defendant commenced visiting her, and that she was born and had always resided in the same neighborhood. It appears that, on the trial, there must have been \u2022 present many of her companions, those- who would have known if she had been married. The People could not well prove a negative, that is, that she was not married, except by her own testimony. From her testimony and all the surrounding circumstances, was it not evident to the jury that she was an unmarried female ? Again, the seduction must be effected under a promise of marriage, and the defendant contends that that promise must be mutual. Conceding this, we may still inquire what is meant by mutual promises to marry. If a man, having paid his addresses to a woman, makes to her an offer of marriage, that is, simply offers to marry her, and she says in reply that she accepts his offer, would not the law imply the promises ? In this case, the testimony of the prosecutrix is that the defendant said to her, if she would do so and so, he would marry her, that is, if she would have connection with him. At first she said no, sir; but afterward she assented. In other words, she accepted his offer of marriage. That she so understood it, is evident from her answer to the question as to what influence the promise of marriage had upon her by way Of inducement to her to consent to the intercourse. She says : \u201cI thought he was going to have me, and nobody would know it.\u201d If he was to have .her, she must have understood that she was to marry him. As to the support by other evidence, it appears that the defendant was a frequent visitor at her mother\u2019s house, that he waited on her to balls and parties, and took her out frequently to ride, and when the mother spoke to him about keeping company with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>her daughter, he said his motives were good. Surely there was evidence tending to show to the jury that there may well have been a promise of marriage. The mother may have well supposed, from his declarations, that his motives were good; that he was addressing her daughter with honorable intentions, and with a view to marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">As to the illicit connection, the fact stands out that the prosecutrix was delivered of a child, and the whole case shows evidence on both sides that there was abundant opportunity for the defendant to have become the father of it, if there were such promises as she has sworn to. The act under which the defendant was convicted does not require that the female shall be supported in every particular, nor even in every important particular. The language is, \u201c unsupported by other evidence.\u201d Undoubtedly, in the main features of the case, as to the important points, she should be supported. How direct and how positive, and conclusive the supporting evidence should be, is quite another question. In administering such a law, I apprehend no precise rule can be laid down. Each case will be governed, in a great measure, by its own particular circumstances. I have gone carefully over this case. The charge of the county judge was able and elaborate, and, I think,' entirely fair and impartial. I do not think, in his charge, or in his refusal to charge, he committed any error in the admission or rejection of evidence. \u25a0 \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">In my judgment; there is no sufficient ground for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">Conviction affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
