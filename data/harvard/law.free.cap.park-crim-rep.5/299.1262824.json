That the facts, as stated by the complaining witness, do' not constitute such violence as to bring the case within the definition of robbery in the first degree.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-8\">3d. That the violence contemplated by the statute means .actual violence, and the laying of the arm over the shoulder, as testified to by the witness, does not constitute such actual violence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-9\">4th. That there is no evidence whatever in the case to constitute the charge of robbery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-10\">5th. That the degree of violence that would constitute an assault and battery, would not necessarily be such violence as to constitute robbery by violence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-11\">6th. That the sudden snatching of the money from the complainant, in the manner described by the witness, as testified to, does not amount to robbery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-12\">7th.

That there is no evidence to show that the taking was against the'will of the complainant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-14\">The court refused to charge each and all of said propositions separately, and the prisoner\u2019s counsel excepted separately to each of said refusals.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-15\">The court charged the jury, among other things, as follows: That if the jury believed the testimony of the witness, that the prisoner thrust his arm around his neck and thrust his hand in Ms pocket, and took therefrom the coin or money in the manner testified to, with felonious intent, then he is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>guilty as charged. To which charge prisoner\u2019s counsel excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b303-5\">The court also charged the jury that the same degree of violence that would constitute an assault and battery in any case, would be sufficient violence to constitute a robbery by violence to the person. To which charge prisoner\u2019s counsel also excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b303-6\">The court also charged the jury, that if they found that defendant committed an assault and battery, with intent to rob, he could be so convicted under the indictment.

From the person or in the presence of the owner; 4th. Against his will; 5th. That they were taken either by violence to the person, or by putting the owner in fear. The 1st and 3d ingredients of this offense are not denied; the 4th and 5th are expressly disproved by Wing himself; and the 2d by fair implication.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-5\">II. The gist of the offense of robbery is the <em>force </em>and terror. (1 <em>Hale P. C., </em>532 ; 2 <em>East P. C, </em>707; 1 <em>Russ., </em>869; <em>R. </em>v. <em>Norris, </em>2 <em>Car. &amp; P., </em>349; <em>Roscoe Cr. Ev., </em>893.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-6\">Ho taking by violence will, at the present day, be considered as sufficient to constitute robbery, unless some injury be done to the person <em>(Lapier\u2019s Case, </em>2 <em>East P. C., </em>557), or unless there be some previous struggle for the possession of the property, or some force used to obtain it. (1 <em>Russ., </em>871; <em>Lapier\u2019s Case, supra Roscoe; Cr. Ev., </em>894, 898; <em>Moore's Case, </em>1 <em>Leach, </em>335; <em>Mason\u2019s Case, Russ. &amp; Ry., </em>419; <em>Roscoe Cr. Ev., </em>419, 899; 2 <em>Archb. Cr.

Law, </em>144.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-8\">ITT. The court erred in refusing to charge the jury, \u201cthat the degree of violence that would constitute an assault and battery would not necessarily be such violence as to constitute robbery by violence.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-9\">1. Any injury whatsoever, be it ever so small, to the person in an angry, or revengeful, or rude, or insolent manner, as by spitting in the face, or throwing water on the person, is a battery. (R<em>oscoe Cr. Ev., </em>288.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-10\">2. The snatching of a bundle from under the arm in a rude manner, is an assault and battery; but if done with a felonious intent it is not robbery. <em>(Macauley\u2019s Case, </em>1 <em>Leach, </em>287; <em>Roscoe Cr. Ev., </em>898.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-11\">IY. The court erred in refusing to charge the jury, \u201cthat the sudden snatching of the money from the complainant in the manner described by witness, does not amount to a robbery.\u201d <em>(Roscoe Cr. Ev., </em>893; <em>Macauley's Case, </em>1 <em>Leach, </em>290.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-12\">Y. The court erred in charging the jury, \u201c that if they believed the testimony of the witness that the prisoner thrust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>his arm around his neck, and thrust his hand in his pocket, and took therefrom the coin or money in the manner testified to with the felonious intent, then he is guilty as charged.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b305-5\">1. This charge took from the jury the right to say whether the money was taken by Wing\u2019s assent or not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b305-6\">2. It was equivalent to a direction to the jury to convict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b305-7\">VI. The court erred in charging the jury, \u201c that the same</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b305-8\">degree of violence that would constitute an assault and battery in any case would be sufficient violence to constitute robbery by violence to the person.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b305-9\">1. The sudden snatching of a bundle out of the hand would be an assault and battery, yet it was holden not to be robbery. <em>(Macauley's Case, supra.)</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b305-10\">2. \u201c An umbrella was snatched suddenly out of the hand of a woman, as she was walking along the street.\u201d The act was clearly an assault and battery, but no robbery. (1 <em>Russ, on Cr., </em>874, <em>Am. note C.)</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b305-11\">3. \u201c The mere act of taking being forcible, will not make this offense highway robbery; to constitute the crime of highway robbery the force used must be of such a nature as to show that it was intended to overpower the party robbed, and prevent his resisting, and not merely to get possession of the property stolen;, thus, if a man walking.after a woman in the street, were, by violence, to pull her shawl from her shoulders, though he might use considerable violence, it would not, in my opinion, be highway robbery, because the violence was not for the purpose of overpowering the party robbed, but only to get possession of the property.\u201d (1 <em>Russ., </em>871, <em>note C.)</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b305-12\"><em>John Winslow </em>(District Attorney), for the People.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b305-13\">I. All the propositions involving questions of fact were properly left to the jury by the court. And all requests of counsel for defendant to take such questions from the jury were rightly refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b305-14\">The first, third, sixth, seventh and eighth propositions, which the defendant\u2019s counsel requested'the court to charge, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>involved questions of fact, which should be left to the consideration of the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b306-5\">II. The proposition charged by the court,- \u201c that if the jury believed the testimony of the witness, that the prisoner thrust his arm,\u201d &amp;c., &amp;c., \u201c <em>in the manner testified to, with the felonious intent, then he is guilty as charged,\" </em>was, in effect, only saying to the jury that if they believed the testimony of the complaining witness, the case for the People was made out, and the defendant must be convicted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b306-6\">III. The next proposition charged by the court, as to the degree of violence necessary, with the other elements that make up the offense, is correct.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b306-7\">The court on this point only said, in effect, that if all the other conditions required by the statute to constitute robbery, such as taking the property against the will, &amp;c., are proved, then the violence that would make assault and battery would t&gt;e sufficient in the case at bar.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b306-8\">IV. The next proposition charged, as to fear, is of no importance here, inasmuch as the jury found the principal offense.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b306-9\">V. The facte testified to by the complaining witness, Mr. Wing, clearly establish the offense charged in the indictment, and were properly submitted to the jury.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b306-10\"><em>By the Court, </em>Emott, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3l\">The Revised Statutes define robbery in the first degree to consist in feloniously taking personal property of another from his person or in his-presence' against his will, by violence to his person, or by putting such person in fear of immediate injury to his person. (2 <em>B.</em></p>\n<p id=\"ANU\">S., 677, \u00a7 55.) The common law definition of robbery was the same. (4 <em>Bl. Com., </em>243; 1 <em>Hale Pl, vol. </em>1, <em>ch. </em>46; 2 <em>East Cr. Law, ch. </em>16, \u00a7 124, <em>seq.) </em>The mere snatching anything from the hand or the person of any one, without, any struggle or resistance by the owner, or any force or violence on the part of the thief, will not constitute robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-12\">In <em>Gascoigne's Case (Leach, </em>313; <em>East Cr. Law, vol. 2, p. </em>709), the prisoner snatched some money out of the. pocket of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>woman whom he was conveying to prison on a criminal charge. The prisoner was not a constable, but' attended the police office as a runner. He was convicted of robbery, and the conviction was sustained on the ground, which was. proved, that he had violently forced the woman into a coach and handcuffed her, with the felonious intent of getting her money, and the direction to the jury at the trial put the case upon this exclusively. The cases which are often cited of taking an ear ring, which was held to be a robbery when it was taken with such violence as to lacerate the ear of the wearer, or a diamond hair ornament tearing out with it a part of a lady\u2019s hair from her head, are illustrations of the rule as to the degree of violence necessary to constitute the offense of robbery. (Leach, 238.)</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">The court below, in the present case, instructed the jury in effect that feloniously taking another\u2019s property with violence sufficient to constitute an assault and battery, would make out the crime of robbery; and again, that if they believed the story of the principal witness, the offense was made out.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">In these instructions the judge was in error. In the cases to which I have referred, as well as in many others to be found in the books, the snatching the property was sufficient to constitute an assault and battery, yet that alone\" did not make the felonious taking more than a larceny. The property must be taken by violence to the person, which means more than a simple assault and battery. The violence must be sufficient to force the person to part with his property, not only against his will, but in spite of his resistance. The rule of law laid down by the court below went farther than the authorities justify, and the application of the rule to the facts was also incorrect. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">The proof showed that the prisoner took the money which he stole out-of the prosecutor\u2019s pocket, while they were walking together in a friendly manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">Ho more force was used than sufficient to pull the money out of the pocket of the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">Both the men had been drinking, and the prosecutor, at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>time of the act, evidently considered and treated the prisoner\u2019s conduct as a joke. He made no resistance, and yielded neither to force or fear. If he was led to entertain the idea that the prisoner intended to rob him, or to any fear or apprehension of violence or injury from him, it was not, as he himself states, until after this offense was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Under these circumstances, the violence to the person in taking the property, which is the essential element of robbery, was wanting, and the prisoner\u2019s offense was simply a larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">The judgment of the Court of Sessions must be reversed and a new trial ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
