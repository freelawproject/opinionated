Keough, or Keoll, was my side partner then; I did not see Burns throw away any roll of bills; I saw him throw something away; it was not a segar; we were then five or six blocks from the station house; boy came in with the roll three or five minutes after us; when Burns threw something away there was a crowd around us, two or three dozen persons or more; I was present when the boy gave in his testimony; he told Judge Steers distinctly, and swore to it, that Burns threw it away; he stated no differently to me; I don\u2019t know that Eutzky was told not to tell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>defendant the bill was bad; I never heard of any such plan; never heard it spoken of from time I saw Eutzky come out of the grocery store; I and the other officer watched the defendant; I don\u2019t know the other officer\u2019s name; I am sure defendant waited in Burns\u2019 thirty or forty minutes at least; I did not look at watch; I could form an opinion; I saw the defendant come out of Eutzky\u2019s place; he went right down to Burns\u2019 place; Burns\u2019 place is on same side as Eutzky\u2019s, and is between Eutzky\u2019s and Sweeny\u2019s, but nearer to Sweeny\u2019s.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-5\">The prisoner\u2019s counsel admitted the existence of the bank, as a corporation, by which the bill passed to Sweeny purported to have been issued, and that such bill was counterfeit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-6\">After other evidence had been given, the district attorney proposed to put in evidence the sixteen counterfeit bank bills identified by the witness O\u2019Eourke as those brought to the station house by the boy. Counsel for defendant objected to the introduction of such bills in evidence. The court overruled the objection, and allowed the bills to be put in evidence, to which the counsel for the defendant excepted. The bills were thereupon read in evidence. The sixteen bills were each and\" all five dollar bills, on the same bank, and same date, as the counterfeit bill described in the indictment, and were all put in evidence.

If these bills were thrown away by Burns (and there was some testimony tending to show this), what he did after the counterfeit bill had been passed could not bind the defendant, nor was it admissible in evidence against him; although where two or more are jointly engaged in the commission of a crime, the acts of any one (after the concert of action between them is proved) may be given in evidence against the others, yet, <em>after </em>a crime is committed, the acts or declarations of any one are not evidence against the others. Wharton', in his American Criminal Law <em>(Ath ed., </em>\u00a7 <em>70S), </em>correctly states the rule as follows : \u201c When, however, the common enterprise is at an end, whether by accomplishment or abandonment, it is not material, no one is permitted, by any subsequent act or declaration of his own, to affect the others.\u201d ****** \u201cThus, on an indictment against A. for concealing a horse thief, knowing him to be such, <em>it is not competent for the prosecution to give evidence of what the alleged horse thief subsequently confessed in the presence of A., to establish the fact that a horse was stolen.\" </em>Clearly, anything Burns might have said, or any act of his, such as throwing away a roll of counterfeit bills after the offense in question had been committed, could not be evidence against the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b226-5\">2. There was no proof, but <em>hearsay, </em>that the boy had picked up these bills at all, and brought them to the station house. The only proof adduced by the prosecution, on the subject of these sixteen counterfeit bills, before introducing them in evidence, was that the boy said he picked them up, and that one of the prisoners (Bums) had thrown them away. Clearly, the only way to prove that fact (if it were competent evidence) was to call the boy as a witness on the trial. Certainly, it cannot be necessary to cite authorities to show that <em>hearsay </em>is not evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b226-6\">H. The prosecution failed to prove the <em>scienter </em>or guilty knowledge. The court below erred in refusing so to charge the jury.
