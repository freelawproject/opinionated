M. Pat\u00f3n, knowing the property to have been stolen.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-9\">A plea of not guilty was put in, and the' issue was tried before McCunn, city judge, at a Court of General Sessions held in the city of New York on the 27th November, 1861.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-10\">On the trial, the district attorney called <em>Robert Thompson </em>as a witness. It was admitted he was the same person who stole the goods from Pat\u00f3n.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-11\">The counsel for the prisoner objected to the witness being allowed to testify, on the grounds,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-12\">' 1. That no application had been made to the court to allow the witness to be examined, and that such application, showing the grounds upon which it was based, was a legal prerequisite to the examination of an accomplice, and that, before the court could exercise its discretion in admitting or rejecting the accomplice, this formal application must be made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-13\">2. That in this case the accomplice was the principal offender, even on the theory that the accused was guilty of the offense imputed to him, ajnd that it was the duty of the court, in the exercise of a sound discretion, and under the principles of law governing such discretion, to refuse to allow the thief to testify.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-14\">The court overruled the objections to the admissibility of the witness, and the defendant\u2019s counsel excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-15\">The witness was then sworn, and ga^e material evidence in the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>After the evidence was closed, the recorder charged the jury, among other things, that, although the jury might convict a person upon the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice, it was not a safe practice, and he should recommend -\u00bfhe jury not to convict upon the uncorroborated testimony of Thompson.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-5\">The jury rendered a verdict of guilty; and the proceedings were removed by <em>certiorari </em>to this court for review.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b352-6\"><em>Nelson J.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqc\">The rule is too well settled, both in England and this country, to admit of any doubt of the right of the public prosecutor to use an accomplice as a witness. Chitty says, it was formerly held that though- an accomplice may be admitted as a witness, his testimony could only be left to the jury when corroborated; but it is now settled that such evidence may be left to the jury, and if they regard it sufficient, the prisoner may be convicted. (1 <em>Chit. Cr. L., </em>604; 2 <em>Campb., </em>132; 7 <em>Term R., </em>609.)</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">So in this country it has been held, that new trials will be refused even when the verdict was obtained on such testimony uncorroborated. (1 Denio, 83; <em>Whart. Cr. L., </em>784.)</p>\n<p id=\"b352-10\">But in this case the witness was not an accomplice. He was guilty of another offense, committed previous to that of which the prisoner was convicted. Such an objection is never sufficient to prevent his examination, though it may affect his credibility. This was conceded by Duer, J., in <em>The People </em>v. <em>Whipple </em>(9 <em>Cow., </em>707), relied on by the prisoner\u2019s counsel. Nor in such a case is any application necessary to the court, even if it be -conceded that it would be proper in the case of an accomplice.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-11\">The conviction must be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
