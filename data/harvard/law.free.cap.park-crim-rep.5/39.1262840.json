Kelson asked if the harness should be removed, and the stove and chairs; I said no, there will be no necessity for removing any thing but the chairs; I then took hold of one or two chairs and walked into the bed room and set the chairs down and turned to come out, and that was the last I knew; the next I recollect of, was being at home at my father\u2019s house; the first day I remember of, after that day, was the 14th of January; this fight occurred on the 26th day of December, 1859; my father lives about a mile from the village, and is a farmer; defendant is not a married man; I understood we were to have a fair <em>Jcnoclc </em>down.;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b45-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number><em>Dewitt C. </em>Bates, testified among other things as follows: \u25a0 On the 26th day of December last, I went to my office at 9 A. M. ; I heard a noise above pretty heavy and solid like throwing flown a heavy body on the floor; it attracted my attention, then I heard a most unearthly and terrible groan, a forced groan, between a loud scream and a groan, I listened an instant, and heard it once or twice; I went up stairs into the third story; I went to the door, which was\u2019locked, heard no answer, when I called to him again to open the door; while I was at the door Mr. Cooper came up and suggested breaking open the door, and we broke it open and both entered the room; Allanson\u2019s head lay within a few feet of the door; I did not know him, his face and bosom were covered with blood; his face was badly disfigured; he was apparently dead; I had known Allanson from his boyhood, but I did not know who this person was on the floor until defendant spoke his name; there was a spasmodic action of his head and breast; defendant then stood in the middle of the room, covered with blood, and said, I- have done it, I have whipped him, it was \"fair play; ask Dick, and he will say so; the sheriff then came in and took defendant out of the room; Nelson was taken before a justice of the peace, and I appeared and made the complaint; after the defendant left the room I saw a large knife; Judge Clyde held it in his hand when I first saw it; I did not see Allanson again for a long time; there was a chair in the room near where Allanson lay, a Windsor chair, plank bottom; I discovered small spots of blood under the bottom of the chair and on the rounds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b45-5\"><em>George C. Clyde, </em>called for the People, testified, among other things, as follows: I went up to the room after the affray was over, and found a man there called Allanson, and the doctor; I felt something under the carpet in the bedroom with my foot, and stooped down and picked it up and found it was a large knife. The knife was here produced and identified by the witness as the one he found; witness said he handed it to Dr. Merritt. Nelson was present when the knife was produced before Esq. McLean.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b46-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number><em>George Merritt, </em>called, testifiedI live at Cherry Yalley; am a physician and surgeon; saw a wounded man, Allanson, at the house of Mr. Bates shortly after the fight; there were three or four wounds on his face ; there were two under the) right eye and on the right side of the upper lip, and a very slight wound across the nose ; the wounds under the eye were nearly parallel with each other, extending round near to the corner of the right eye, and near one-fourth of an inch apart, circular form like a half moon; they appeared one and one-fourth inches long; the depth of the wounds was from a quarter to half an inch; the face was swollen; the wounds under the eye looked like cuts made by something, I do not know what; they were not bruised cuts, but appeared to me to be cuts, clean cuts. The lip was cut perpendicular, which appeared to be made with same thing as the cuts under the eye, and the cut across the nose very slight; did not bleed ; in my opinion the wounds under' the eye and on the lip could not have been made with the naked fist; they were made with a cutting instrument; no other wounds in the shape of cuts; the face was bruised and swollen a good deal; the eyes were closed, not blind; there was a swelling or ridge on the back part of the head; I saw some marks or wounds on the shoulders, on the point of each; two or three scratches on the throat; seemed to have been made by finger nails; he was not sensible, but he could be roused by special effort; I treated him, perhaps, two weeks or less ; in five or six days he was convalescent; he was considerable delirious; I afterward measured the chair in the room where the fight occurred, and the distance between the hind legs corresponded with the distance between the marks on the shoulders of Allanson; the chair I measured was an old plank bottom Windsor chair; defendant asked me if the wounds were made by a ring on his finger; I told him I thought they were not; he, defendant, said he knocked Dick down, and that he held Allanson by the hair of his head on his knee, and struck him with his right hand in his face.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b46-5\"><em>Cross-examined: </em>Defendant said they squared off for a fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>fight, and struck at each other, and Allanson did not hit him, but that he knocked Allanson down with his fist, and then drew his head upon his knee and struck him with his right hand in the face; this was at the time the defendant was claiming that the cuts were made with the ring; defendant showed me his right hand after the occurrence; it was swollen; defendant said the agreement was that when either called out enough, they were to stop, and said that it was a fair fight between two gentlemen ; I was sworn before the justice, and testified that they were not made by the fist; these cuts could have been made by a dull knife; the depths of the wounds were a bad thing to judge of, for the reason that they were swollen badly; the face was badly beaten and discolored; the wounds healed up readily.-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b47-5\"><em>William </em>Bast\u00edan, called by the People, said: He lived in Cherry Valley; knew the defendant, and made the knife shown in court, for defendant, at his request; it was intended for a bowie-knife; I have seen it in defendant\u2019s possession at different times since.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b47-6\">The district attorney here rested and the defendant called</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ag8\"><em>Edward </em>Peatt, .who testified: I roomed in the building where the fight was; in the morning about 9 o\u2019clock, Allan-son came to my room and wanted to know if he could have the use of the room for fifteen minutes; I told him I had nothing to do with the room; Mr. Kinne then came in, and Dick asked him if he could have it; Kinne said yes, and told me to take the key and unlock the door; I unlocked the room, and defendant and Allanson went into the room with me; the chairs were taken out of the room; Charlie carried some out, and I carried-one out; I think all the chairs were carried out, but I will not be certain; the first thing Allanson did was to take off his clothes, and he laid them on a table in the square room; Charlie took off his coat and vest, and then I saw him take an instrument out of his pants and throw it on the bed; Allanson then stood out in the square room, and Charlie was in the bed room; we all went out in the square room; defendant spoke and said, \u201cEd., are you going to stay?\u201d I said no,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ag\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>and handed him the key and then left; Charlie had on a ring at the same time; the ring appeared more like a square top-than this, the one shown me now by defendant; this ring now shown me he had worn for the last 15 months; this ring shown to me does not look like the same ring he then wore; that was more of a square top ring; I did not notice anything else on his hand or in his hand; the next I saw of Allanson was after the fight, and he was lying on the floor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b48-5\"><em>Cross-examined: </em>I do not recollect of seeing a chair in the room after the fight; I think there were five or six chairs in all, in the room; .1 don\u2019t mean to be-understood that all the chairs were taken out.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b48-6\"><em>John </em>Hubbard, called for the defendant, testified, among other things, as follows: I went to the room after the affray; I asked Allanson if there was any foul play or anything wrong; if it was all fair; he said it was all fair, just as they had agreed upon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b48-7\"><em>Phillip B. </em>Wales, called by defendant: I was deputy sheriff when this transaction took place; I arrested defendant in the room where the fight took place; the night after the fight took place, the right hand of the defendant was badly swollen and inflamed; he took dinner with me that day; I had to cut his meat for him, and pour out his coffee; he could not use his hand; there was a scratch on his right' hand, and a mark on his nose; there was skin broken on the ridge of his nose; he had a ring on his finger when I arrested him; this is the ring; I have no doubt of it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b48-8\"><em>Cross-examined: </em>I did not notice the ring on his finger until in the evening of the same day of the fight, when he went to bed; that is the first I saw of the ring; I- do not know that he had the ring on when I arrested him; he was away from me several times during the day, fifteen minutes to a time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b48-9\"><em>Davis W. Bates, </em>qalled on the part of the people, testified: I heard defendant say the same day of the fight, that Allanson was a pretty man to go into a room to fight, as he had not got a clip at defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b49-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>The cause was then and there rested, and the district attorney stated that he would not insist to the jury, on the evidence in the case, upon a conviction of the defendant for an assault with an intent to kill of maim as alleged in the first six counts in the indictment,- but he declined to abandon the counts in any manner, insisting that the defendant, under those counts, could be convicted of the minor offense of assault and battery, or under the statute of 1854.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b49-5\">Whereupon, and after the argument of .counsel, his honor, L. 0. Turner, presiding judge, proceeded to charge the jury, and among other things as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b49-6\">\u201c The defendant is indicted for an offense of no ordinary character, at least in this county, and, although the evidence discloses a disgusting and brutal scene, it should not divert your minds from the impartial consideration of .the real issue presented for your determination.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b49-7\">The indictment contains several counts; the district attorney, however, does not ask a conviction for a felony, as charged in either of the first six counts, but he asks a conviction upon the 7th and 8th counts, and insists that the defendant is guilty of the minor offense of a simple assault and battery in any event, and under any and all of the counts of the indictment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b49-8\">The major offense, and the only one charged in the indictment which you are to pass upon, is for a violation of the law of 1854, which declares that any person, who, with intent to do bodily harm, and without justifiable or excusable cause,\u00bb shall commit an assault upon the person of another with any knife, dirk, dagger or other sharp, dangerous weapon, shall, upon conviction thereof, be punished by imprisonment in a State prison for a term not more than five years, or by imprisonment in the county jail for a term of not exceeding one year.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b49-9\">You will, therefore, first consider and determine from the evidence that has been submitted to you, whether or not the defendant (Nelson), with intent to do bodily harm, and without justifiable or excusable cause, did' commit an assault <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>upon the person <em>of </em>Allanson with any knife, dirk, dagger, dr <em>other sharp, dangerous weapon. .</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b50-7\">It is not disputed, indeed 'it is conceded, that these parties mutually agreed to go into a room and have a \u201c fair fight; \u201d that they did go into a room, lock themselves therein, and the result was that Allanson was dreadfully injured,' and the defendant unhurt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b50-8\">It is a disturbance of the public peace, promotive of disorder, violence and immorality, and a violation of law for two persons, by mutual agreement, to lock themselves into a room and fight; but the defendant is not guilty of the major offense as charged in the 7th and 8th counts of the indictment, although he intended to do bodily harm, and without justifiable dr excusable cause, unless he committed the assault upon-the person of Allanson with a <em>sharp, dangerous weapon, </em>no matter how badly Allanson may have been beaten, bruised and disabled; unless the assault was committed with some <em>sharp, dangerous tueapon, </em>the defendant is not guilty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b50-9\">The only evidence as to what took place immediately preceding the fight is that given by Allanson and Peatt (which was read by the judge to the jury), and there is no positive evidence that any <em>sharp, dangerous weapon </em>was used ; that such a weapon was used is only to be inferred from the wounds inflicted as described by the witness, Dr. Merritt. (The evidence of Dr. Merritt was read by the judge to the jury.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b50-10\">- You will therefore carefully scrutinize, and impartially consider the evidence before you, and if you determine therefrom that the defendant did assault Allanson with intent to do him bodily harm, and without justifiable or excusable cause, with <em>a sharp, dangerous weapon </em>as charged in the 7th and 8th counts of the indictment, or either of them, then you will render a verdict of guilty; but if you do not so determine or- entertain a reasonable doubt in relation thereto, then render a verdict of not guilty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b50-11\">Should you find that the defendant is not guilty of the major offense as charged in the 7th and 8th counts, then you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>have the right, should you regard the evidence as warranting it, to find the defendant guilty of a simple assault and battery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b51-5\">And as regards the commission of this minor offense, I charge you as matter of law, that, if the defendant and Allan-son, by mutual agreement, went into the room to fight, and the defendant struck Allanson first, he is guilty of an assault and battery. That if Allanson struck the first blow, and the defendant only used sufficient force and no more than was necessary to defend himself, then he is not guilty, but although Allanson did strike first, and the defendant used more force and violence than was necessary to protect and defend himself, then he is guilty of an assault and battery.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b51-6\">The jury thereupon retired under the charge of a constable duly sworn, and afterward returned into court, and the foreman of the jury, in the presence of the defendant, handed the clerk their verdict in writing, which the clerk read as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b51-7\">\u201cWe find the defendant guilty of assault and battery, with intent to do bodily harm with some sharp, dangerous instrument.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b51-8\">The court refused to receive said verdict, and directed the jury to amend their verdict, and if they intended to find the defendant guilty of the offense charged in the 7th and 8th counts in the indictment, to reconsider their verdict and to respond directly to these counts, to which refusal 'to receive, and direction to amend, the counsel for the defendant excepted. Whereupon the jury consulted together in the box without leaving court, and after such consultation, the foreman announced that the jury could not agree to find the defendant guilty under the seventh count, which had been read to them, and the court directed them to retire again, to which the defendant, by his counsel, excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b51-9\">The jury again retired, under the charge of the same constable, duly sworn as aforesaid, and after- being absent about twenty minutes, returned and rendered the following verdict, in the presence of defendant: \u201cWe find the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>guilty of the offense charged in the eighth count of the indictment.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b52-5\">The counsel for the defendant then moved the court in arrest of judgment, upon the grounds stated in the motion to quash the indictment, for the reason that the court was not properly constituted, and also on the ground that no offense was charged in the eighth count in the indictment, which motion, so made, the court overruled, to which decision th\u00f3 counsel for the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b52-6\">The prisoner was sentenced to imprisonment at hard labor in the State prison at Auburn, for two years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b52-7\">The cause was argued in this court, on the bill of exceptions . brought up by the writ of error, by</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b52-8\"><em>James A. Lynes, </em>for the plaintiff in error, and</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b52-9\"><em>E Countryman </em>(District Attorney), for the People.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b52-10\">The Supreme Court, after advisement, decided that the right or title of the justices of sessions to their office, could not be collaterally inquired into, but only by a direct proceeding against them by information, in the nature of a <em>quo warranto ; </em>and that no error had been committed on the trial, and affirmed the judgment of the Court of Sessions.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
