The verdict of the jury was, \u201cMot guilty of manslatighter in the second degree, but guilty of a misdemeanor, to wit, in the use. and employment of instruments and <em>other means </em>upon the person of a pregnant woman, with intent thereby to procure the miscarriage of such woman.\u201d The indictment charged the commission of the offense to have been on .Mary Ann Baker only. The finding should have been that such offense was committed upon her, or the indictment is not sustained. - Finding the offense to have been committed upon, <em>a woman, </em>who is not named, does not show that the offense charged has been proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">We think the judgment was erroneous, and must be reversed, and a new trial ordered in the Sessions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
