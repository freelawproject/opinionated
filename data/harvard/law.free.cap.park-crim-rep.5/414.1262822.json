The court refused to charge the triers, that assuming what the juror had sworn to to be true, no cause was shown which would justify the triers in finding the challenge true.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b414-9\">The prosecution challenged a juror for favor, on the ground that he was not indifferent between the People and the prisoner. The prisoner\u2019s counsel demurred to the challenge and assigned for cause that the challenge did not specify any sufficient ground in law, and the district attorney joined in demurrer. <em>Held, </em>that the demurrer was not sustainable,, and it was overruled.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b414-10\">On such a challenge the juror, when examined as a witness before the triers, was asked, \u201chave you any conscientious scruples against rendering a verdict of guilty, in a case where the punishment, upon conviction, is death? \u2019\u2019 On objection, held that the question was competent.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b414-11\">Charge of the recorder of the city of New York,'in a case of murder committed \u2022 after the passing .of the act of 1860, stating the rules by which the jurors were to discriminate between murder in the first and second degrees, and manslaughter in the third and fourth degrees, and explaining the law of excusable and justifiable homicide.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b414-13\">Where statements, made by the prisoner, have been proved and put in evidence on the part of the prosecution, they are only evidence to be considered in connection with all the other evidence in the case.

The taking of human life, under any circumstances, is a terrible thing \u2014 the taking it with malice and design is very terrible, indeed. Your duty as jurors is a solemn and responsible one, and the close attention you have given to the details of this case, assures me that you find it to be so.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"156\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-8\">It is proper that in the outset of my charge I should briefly review the evidence in the case. When I have done that, and instructed you upon the law, you will do your duty without regard to the consequences which may ensue. Moses Lowenberg is charged with the murder of Hoffman, on the 14th day of November, 1861. It seems from the evidence that they lived in the same house, 141 First avenue. The prisoner occupying the front basement room, and Hoffman and his wife the rear basement rooms. The location of these rooms, as well as of the rear hall door and door leading to the street, you understand perfectly from the explanations given. Mrs. Hoffman states that on the morning of the 14th of November, she went out of her room, through the hall, and closed the street door, which had been open; that immediately after she had closed it, the prisoner came out of his room and opened it again, slamming it back; that in a few minutes she went and closed it again; that the prisoner again came out of his room and threw it open. ' As she passed the second time to close the door, the prisoner\u2019s door was ajar, and she saw him sitting in his room. A few minutes elapsed between the shutting of the door the first and second times. After the lapse of some minutes from the second time (she thinks five or six minutes, but is not certain), her'husband said, I will go and close the door. She said to him, \u201c.No, wait and I will see the landlady about it.\u201d She adds that as she said this-her husband was already out; I saw him go toward the door; he had his left hand upon the door to close it, when the prisoner came <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>out of the room, having some object in bis right hand; she' could not see what it was, nor could she tell the color. There has been some difference between prisoner\u2019s counsel and the district attorney, as to what she did say about seeing \u201csomething bright.\u201d In the latter \"part of her direct examination, she said, as appears by my minutes, \u201c I saw some article about a foot and a half long; it did not look very bright or very dark; I saw something bright behind the hand; it was dark near the door, and I could not see well.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"157\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-5\">She says her husband had his hand on the door to close it. The prisoner also put his hand on the door, and the next thing she saw was a motion of the prisoner\u2019s right hand, thus (illustrating), and her husband starting back, throwing both his hands upon his breast, told her he was stabbed. He went into their room. She asked him if he was stabbed hard. He said \u201c yes, the blood is now running inside,\u201d referring, I suppose,' to what the doctor called internal hemorrhage. Such, gentlemen, is her simple statement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"158\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-6\">On her cross-examination, she was asked a great many questions, having reference mainly to the degree of darkness which pervaded the hall, and as to whether she could or could not see distinctly. You have heard all her testimony, and will judge for yourselves whether she could.or could not see what transpired, and it will be an easy matter for you, on all the evidence in the case, to determine whether the prisoner had in his hand this sword-cane, whether he stabbed the deceased with it, and whether death was the consequence of the\" wound.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"159\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-7\">A number of questions were put to Mrs. Hoffman for the \u2019 purpose of ascertaining from her whether there was any grappling in the hall, any seizing hold of each other by the two men. She says she did not see any, and that if there had been she could have seen it. -Now, there is no evidence of any wound having been inflicted' by the deceased upon the' prisoner, unless it be the mark upon the prisoner\u2019s forehead, to which he called the attention of- the officer when he was arrested, and in connection with which prisoner stated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>what he did was in self defense, and that he was assaulted. I do not recollect any other evidence upon this point; if there is, you will recollect it, and the prisoner\u2019^ counsel can now call attention to it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"160\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b443-5\">How, if the prisoner did have the sword-cane, if he took it from his room into the hall, if while there he stabbed Hoffman with the sword, and from the wound Hoffman died, are there any other facts proven which show the act to be excusable or justifiable, or which would reduce the killing to manslaughter? If there are no such facts, and the intent to take life existed, it is under the law, as I shall explain it to you, murder. The facts in the case -are few and easily got at. There is but one living witness who saw the whole transaction, and she has given to you her statement, and it is for you to determine the degree of consideration to which it is entitled. You will, of course, gentlemen, bear in mind the,prisoner\u2019s own statements in respect to the facts which occurred. They are before you, and are evidence in the case. The prisoner\u2019s counsel has requested me to charge you, that inasmuch as the prosecution have drawn out these statements, that it is bound and concluded by them. This is not so. They are evidence, and are to be considered in connection with all the other evidence in the case, and it is for you to determine which is true, the prisoner\u2019s statement or those of Mrs. Hoffman. I will make no further reference to the evidence, except such as bears upon the question of character.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"161\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b443-6\">' You have heard witnesses on part of the prisoner testify that they knew him as a peaceable and quiet man. You have also heard one of them, a woman, say that he was quarrelsome, had struck her children, had struck her, and threatened to kill her son. The good character of a prisoner is always a proper subject for the consideration of a jury, and is to be taken into consideration, not only in case where doubt of guilt exists, but it may sometimes of itself generate a doubt in the mind of the jury. This is what prisoner\u2019s, counsel has requested me to charge, and I charge the proposition as fully as he requests. But, gentlemen, you will perceive at once <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>that where a clear case of guilt is made out on the proof, evidence of good character is of comparatively little importance. Having thus reviewed the evidence in this case, I will explain to you the law applicable to the facts proven.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"162\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-5\">The taking of human life, with premeditated design and with malice, is murder; such is the common law definition, and about the briefest one I can give you. The legislature of this State, by the law of 1860, divid\u00e9d murder into two degrees. It declared \u201c that all murder which should be perpetrated by means of poison, or by lying in wait, or by any other kind of willful, deliberate and premeditated killing, or which shall be committed in the perpetration, or the attempt to perpetrate, any arson, rape, robbery or burglary, or in attempt to escape from imprisonment, shall be deemed murder in the first degree, and all other kinds of murder shall be deemed murder in the second degree; and it is made the duty of the jury, if they find a man guilty, to specify in the verdict whether it is of murder in the first or second degree.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"163\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-6\">This law is pretty nearly, if not exactly, a transcript of the Pennsylvania statute. The courts in that State, in construing the law, have held that there could be no murder in the first degree (except in the cases particularly specified in this act), unless there was the specific intention to kill. They have held that where there is malice and a willful, deliberate and premeditated intent to take life, and death ensues, it is murder in the first degree, but if the intent is not to kill, but to do bodily harm merely, and death ensues, it would be only murder in the second degree. In this case, the district attorney, construing the law of 1860 in its most liberal aspect, has claimed and stated it to be, that to constitute murder in the first degree, there must be .some deliberation and premeditation preceding the act, that the mere striking of .a blow, with intent to kill, is not sufficient, unless it is done' after some deliberation, and if that is lacking, though the intent to kill exists, it is only murder in the second degree.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"164\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-7\">But, gentlemen, if you find that premeditation and delibera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>tion existed, it is of no consequence how long it may have preceded the fatal blow. It is sufficient if it came into existence with the intent to kill on the instant of striking the blow. But, though there is the intent to kill, if you are satisfied the mind did not deliberate, then it can only be murder in the second degree. I say if there is an absence of deliberation, if there is merely the intent to kill, formed on the instant, it would be murder in the second degree. I charge the law in this way because it is all the prosecution asks. It is not as strict as laid down by the court of Pennsylvania, and not as strict as I would charge if the district attorney had asked it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"165\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-5\">Upon this point the counsel for the prisoner has requested me to charge, that unless the killing of the deceased by the prisoner was willful, deliberate and premeditated, the jury should not convict the prisoner of murder in any degree, and that the intent to take life, formed at the instant the fatal blow is struck, is not sufficient to constitute murder, unless such intent be willful, deliberate and premeditated. These propositions, as stated by the counsel for the prisoner, are not correct, because, as you perceive, they claim, that except as therein stated, there can be no conviction for <em>murder in any degree. </em>I have explained to.you what the law is upon this subject, and it is unnecessary for me to' repeat what I have said. How, all homicide which is not excusable or justifiable, is, under our statute, either murder in the first or second degree, or manslaughter in some of the degrees. Let us first see whether, under any view of this evidence, this is a case of either excusable or justifiable homicide. There is a distinction between the two, and I do not know that the prisoner\u2019s counsel claims that this case is under either of the statutory definitions of excusable homicide. Homicide is excusable:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"166\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-6\"><em>First. </em>When committed by accident and misfortune in lawfully correcting a child or servant, or doing any other lawful act by lawful means, with usual and ordinary caution, and without any unlawful intent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"167\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-7\"><em>Second. </em>By accident and misfortune in the heat of passion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>upon any sudden and sufficient provocation, or upon a sudden combat, without any undue advantage being taken, and without any dangerous weapon being used, and not done in a cruel and unusual manner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"168\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-5\">It cannot be claimed that this case comes under this sub division. It is conceded that the weapon used was a sword' cane, and I need not say that it can hardly be denied that such a weapon is a dangerous one to plunge into a vital part.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"169\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-6\">Homicide is justifiable under our statute in the following cases: (The judge here read the statute relating to justifiable homicide.) -It is not claimed that the deceased, Hoffman, was' attempting to murder the prisoner, or to commit any felony. But prisoner\u2019s counsel refers to the prisoner\u2019s own statement to the policeman, that what he did was in self defense. The courts in this State have laid' down this rule, viz., that one who is without fault himself, when attacked by another, may kill his assailant, if the circumstances be such as to furnish reasonable grounds for apprehending a design to take away his life, or do him some great bodily harm, and there is reasonable ground for believing the danger imminent that such design would be accomplished, although it may afterward turn out that the appearances were false, and there was, in-fact, no such design, nor any danger that it would be accomplished.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"170\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-7\">Before you can find this homicide to be justifiable, on the ground that it was committed in self defense, you must therefore find, that prisoner being without fault himself, was attacked by Hoffman under such circumstances as to furnish reasonable grounds for apprehending a design to take his life, or do him. some great bodily harm, &amp;c. It is for you, gentlemen, to say whether there is any evidence to show such a state of facts;' if there is, you are bound to give it consideration. The courts, have said that a blow with a naked hand does not justify one in returning the blow with a dangerous weapon; and if you find Hoffman did strike prisoner with his hand, it would not: justify prisoner in returning, the blow with the sword-cane, where there was no reason to apprehend any danger. There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>is no evidence to show that Hoffman was armed. \u00a1Nor is there evidence to show the comparative strength and power of the two men. Having defined to you the law of murder, and explained to you what homicide is excusable, and what is \u25a0justifiable, I will instruct you upon the law of manslaughter, so far as it can have any possible bearing in this case. I need not define to you manslaughter in the first and second degrees, it being conceded that this cannot be either one or the other.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"171\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-5\">The prisoner\u2019s counsel has urged that this case may be one of manslaughter in the third or fourth degree. The statute relating to manslaughter in the third degree, so far as it can by any possibility have any application to this c\u00e1se, is as follows, viz.: \u201c The killing of another in the heat of passion, without a design to effect death, by a dangerous weapon, in any case except such where the killing is declared to be justifiable or excusable, shall be deemed manslaughter in the third degree.\u2019\u2019 There must, you perceive, be the heat of passion, and the absence of any design to kill. By the heat of passion is not meant merely anger, it is rather what is commonly understood as fever heat; passion excited in such a degree as- to deprive a man of his self control. A man may be in anger and yet not be in this heat of passion. If a man in this heat of passion, upon provocation, strikes a blow without intent to kill, and death ensues, he is guilty \u00f3f manslaughter in the third degree. \u00a1Now, if you consider whether the prisoner at the bar is guilty to this degree, the first thing you have to ask, as conscientious jurors, is, was he in the heat of passion ? and I have explained what that meant. If he was, what provoked it? Was it the mere shutting of the door ? was there sufficient provocation? did he design to effect death or not? If he-designed to kill, as I have explained to you, it is not manslaughter in the third degree.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"172\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-6\">The prisoner\u2019s counsel claims that the case may come within the statutory definition of manslaughter in the fourth degree, as follows, viz.: <em>\u201c </em>The involuntary killing of another, by any weapon or by means neither cruel nor unusual, in the heat of passion, in any cases, other than such as are declared to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>excusable homicide, shall be deemed manslaughter in the fourth degree.\u201d You will perceive in the definition of manslaughter in the third degree, there is enumerated \u201c heat of passion,\u201d \u201c absence of design to\" kill,\u201d and the \u201c use of dangerous weapon.\u201d In the fourth degree the words are \u201c involuntary killing,\" and \u201c any weapon.\u201d How, gentlemen, if this is not manslaughter in the third or fourth degree, and is not excusable or justifiable homicide, then determine whether it is murder in the first or second degree. As I have said to you before, the taking of human life is a serious matter, and-must be dealt with seriously. If a man uses a dangerous weapon, and strikes a blow calculated to produce death, the law presumes that he intends the natural consequences of his act. The presumption in law is that it is done with malice, and it is for you to say whether there is anything proven in this case to rebut or change that presumption.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"173\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-5\">The prisoner\u2019s counsel has requested me to charge upon certain propositions; part of them have been covered by what I have already said. He asks me to charge that the prosecution having proved that the defendant stated, immediately after the stabbing of deceased, that he did it in self defense, have made that statement evidence. I have already so charged you. You are the judges of the facts, and are to render your, verdict upon all the evidence before you. He also requests me to charge that if the jury have any reasonable doubt, on the evidence, as to whether defendant is guilty of murder or manslaughter, they ought not to convict of the higher offense and if they have any doubt as to whether the defendant is guilty of manslaughter or whether the killing was in self defense, they should acquit him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"174\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-6\">These propositions are undoubtedly correct. You are bound to give the prisoner the benefit of every reasonable doubt. He also requests me to charge, that if the prisoner is proven by the evidence to have been guilty of killing deceased in the heat of passion, with a sword-cane, without a premeditated design to effect death, the jury should not convict of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>higher offense than manslaughter in the third degree. I have already charged you that in substance. He also asks me to charge, that if the jury have any reasonable doubt arising, on the evidence, as to whether defendant is guilty or not of manslaughter in the third or fourth degree, they should (if they convict at all) convict only of manslaughter in the fourth degree. I have already charged you that upon any point upon which any reasonable doubt exists, the prisoner is entitled to the benefit of it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"175\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-5\">The case, gentlemen, is with you You \u00e1re to decide of what offense, if any, the prisoner is guilty. If you find as matter of fact, that there was a mere dispute about opening a door, that the deceased went to close it, that the prisoner followed him with a sword-cane in his hand, it is for you to determine the purpose for which he did it. He has offered you no explanation in evidence on that point. It was not necessary for the opening or shutting of the door. If he carried it out with him, and then, upon a quarrel as to whether the door should be open or shut, struck three blows with it, which caused the death of the deceased, it is for you to say whether he is guilty of murder; if not what he is guilty of. There was, I have before stated, but one living witness to the transaction, and you have heard her story.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"176\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-6\">The doctor has told you that the second wound extended six inches into the body, and that the man died from the internal hemorrhage in a few minutes. Do you believe, on the evidence, that when the prisoner plunged this sword-cane three times into the deceased, he meant to kill him ? If he meant to kill him, did he do it with premeditation and deliberation ? If he did, it is, under the statute, murder in the first degree. If there was not that deliberation and premeditation I have before mentioned, it is murder, in the second degree. If the act was willful, premeditated and deliberated, and the intent was not to kill, but to do bodily harm, and death ensued, it is, under the statute, murder in the second degree. If the act was done upon provocation, such as I have described, and in the heat of passion, without a design to Mil, it would be manslaughter in</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"177\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>the third degree; but if not in the heat of passion, and if it was with a design to effect death, it cannot be manslaughter, it must be murder. I. shall say nothing further in the case. It is for you now to determine it upon the evidence before you.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"178\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-5\">The jury thereupon retired, and soon after came into court and rendered a verdict of guilty of murder in the first degree.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"179\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-6\">Subsequently, and on the fourth day of January, 1862, the counsel of said defendant, Moses Lowenberg, moved the court in arrest of judgment.

The general words of a penal statute shall be restrained for the benefit of him against whom the penalty is\"inflicted.\" <em>(Dwarr. on Stat., </em>634.) This author also very correctly observes (pp. 634, 635), \u201c A penal law, then, shall not be extended by equity; that is, things which do not come within the words, shall not be brought within it by construction. The law of England does not allow of constructive offenses, or of arbitrary punishments. \u00a1No man i ncurs a penalty, unless the act which subj ects him to it is clearly both within the spirit and the letter of the statute imposing such penalty.\" \u201c If these rules are violated,\u201d said Best, Oh. J., in the case of <em>Fletcher </em>v. <em>Lord Lindes, </em>\u201c the fate of accused persons is decided by the arbitrary discretion of judges, and not by the express authority of the laws.\"</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"205\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b453-8\">Penal statutes must be construed- strictly as \"against the citizen ; and it is not sufficient that the offense charged be within the mischief which the legislature intended to prevent or redress, if it be not within the words which they have used.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"206\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b453-9\">Therefore, where a statute prohibited, within certain limits, the erection of wooden buildings and of wooden additions to buildings already erected, having in them a chimney or fire place, and the party had erected within such limits an addition to an old building, and had placed a chimney and fire place entirely <em>without </em>such addition, but looking into it, and fitted solely for its accommodation, it was held that these acts constituted no violation of the statute. <em>(Daggett </em>v. <em>State, </em>4 <em>Conn. R., </em>60.) In this case, Hosmer, Oh. J., in delivering the opinion of the court, said: \u201c The rule has long been established, that penal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>statutes must be construed strictly. <em>(Reniger </em>v. <em>Fogossa, </em>1 <em>Plowd. R, </em>17; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bowles, </em>1 Salk; 1 <em>Bl. </em>Com.., 88.) More correctly it may be said, that such laws are to be expounded strictly against an offender, and liberally in his favor. This can only be accomplished by giving to them a literal construction, so far as they operate penally; or, at most,'by deducing the intention of the legislature \u2022 from the words of the act. <em>(Heydon's Case, </em>3 <em>Co. R., </em>7; <em>The King </em>v. <em>Gage, </em>3 <em>Mod. R., </em>64.) In extension of the letter of the law, <em>nothing may be assumed by implication, </em>nor may the mischief <em>intended </em>to be prevented or redressed, as against the offender, be regarded in its construction. It was the object of the principle to establish a certain rule, by conformity to which mankind should be safe, and the discretion of the judge limited. How much this must contribute to the security and enjoyment of the citizen, is too palpably obvious to require illustration. Upon the before mentioned principle, it has been adjudged that an act made to punish the person who stole a <em>cow </em>is not applicable to him who steals a <em>heifer (Richard Cooke's Case, Leach's C. L., </em>109); and a law prohibiting the transportation of provisions in any wagon or otherwise to an enemy, is not infringed by driving fat oxen on the leg. <em>(The United States </em>v. <em>Sheldon, </em>2 <em>Wheat. R., </em>119.) That the mischiefs at which these laws were aimed existed in both the cases alluded to, is past a question; but the acts prosecuted, \"not being within the words of the legislature, were considered as not within the prohibitions of the laws. I will only add, that the moment the strict construction of penal laws is abandoned, the difference between their interpretation and that of remedial laws must terminate, as there is no middle ground between them.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>63 <em>and </em>64.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"207\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b454-6\"><em>And </em>cannot be construed to mean <em>or, </em>in a penal statute. The 14th section of the act of the 14th July, 1832, as it stands, does not declare any forfeiture to attach upon the mere want of correspondence between the goods and the entry as a substantive and independent ground of forfeiture. Possibly there may be an omission of some words, by which it was intended to declare a forfeiture in such case; but as it is a penal statute, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>they cannot be supplied by intendment <em>(The United States </em>v. <em>Ten cases of shawls, </em>2 <em>Paine's C.

The disjunctive particle <em>or </em>being used, the forfeiture declared may attach to the want of correspondence as well as to the fraudulent intent; but in the act of 1832 the conjunctive particle <em>and </em>is used in the like connection, and which, in a penal statute, cannot be construed <em>or.\" (Id., </em>165, 166.)</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">In <em>The Case of the Schooner Enterprise </em>(1 <em>Paine's C. C. R., </em>32), Livingston, J., in delivering the opinion of the court, says: \u201c For, although ignorance of the existence of a law be no excuse for its violation, yet, if this ignorance .be the consequence of an ambiguous or obscure phraseology, some indulgence is due to it. It should be a principle of every criminal code, and certainly belongs to.ours, that no person be adjudged guilty of an offense unless it be created and promulgated in terms which leave no reasonable doubt of their meaning. If it be the duty of a jury to acquit where such doubts exist concerning a fact, it is equally incumbent on a judge not to apply the law to a case where he labors under the same uncertainty as to the meaning of the legislature. If this be involved in considerable difficulty, from the use of language not perfectly intelligible, unusual circumspection becomes necessary, especially if the consequence be so penal as scarcely to admit of aggravation. When the sense of a penal statute ,is obvious, consequences are to be disregarded; but if doubtful, they are to have their weight in its interpretation. It will at once be conceded that no man should be stripped of a valuable property, perhaps of his all; be disfranchised, and consigned to public ignominy and reproach; unless it be <em>very clear </em>that such high penalties have been annexed by law to the act which he has committed.\u201d <em>(Id., p. </em>34.)</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>If. the statute is ambiguous, the court ought not to inflict the penalty.

Y. R., </em>95), con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>tains nothing in the. slightest degree conflicting with the authorities above cited. Judge Denio, in his very able and elaborate opinion, nowhere intimates that penal statutes are not to be construed strictly, and in accordance with the authorities here cited. .He does intimate, however, that it was the intention of the legislature of 1860, to preserve the punishment of death. \u25a0 He does not, however, express the opinion that the legislature did preserve capital punishment. The subject of construing penal or criminal statutes strictly, was not before the court. The question was, whether the legislature possessed the power, no matter with what certainty and precision the act was worded, to impose a punishment for an offense different in kind from that which existed when the crime was committed. The court held that no such power existed, and that a law which had that effect, was <em>ex post facto </em>and unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">In reference to the law of 1860, Judge Denio observes, that it is \u201c inferable from the 1st section, and also from the 4th and 5th sections, that capital punishment was intended to be retained.\u201d All the authorities show, that if such an intention be merely \u201cinferable,\u201d and not contained in express words, it is of no avail; for, in the language of Green, Oh. J. (1 <em>Duck. R., </em>522, <em>above cited), </em>\u201c In defining the crime and the punishment, penal statutes are to be taken strictly and literally. The penal law cannot be extended by construction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Judge Denio further observes: \u201cIt is true that in the declaration of the first section, that no crime, except treason and the first degree of murder, should be punished with death, there is an implication, in the nature of a negative pregnant, that those crimes shall be so punished.\u201d In reference to the 4th section, he says: It may be \u201cimplied\u201d that such was the intention of the legislature, and that in the 5th section there is an \u201c implication \u201d to the same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">While, with reference to the intention of the legislature to preserve capital punishment, the learned judge only uses the words \u201cinferable,\u201d \u201cimplied\u201d and \u201cimplication,\u201d he quite as distinctly concedes that \u201cthere was not in.either of these sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>tions, or elsewhere in the act, any separate provision for the punishment of that crime (murder in the first degree), or which declared that any crime should be punished with'death.\u201d This is quite sufficient to dispose of the case of the plaintiff in error in his favor, for all must concede that the \u201c letter of the law \u201d of 1860, does not prescribe the punishment of death. In the language of Hosmer, Ch. J., in <em>Dagget </em>v. <em>The State </em>(4 <em>Conn. R., </em>63), \u201c In extension of the letter of the law, nothing may be assumed by implication; nor may the mischief intended to be prevented or redressed, as against the offender, be regarded in its construction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Although the counsel for the plaintiff in error have no doubt that the legislature of 1860 intended to abolish capital punishment, founding their opinion upon the skillful manner in which every section of any statute which could, within the rules of construction of criminal statutes, have the effect to continue that punishment, was abolished, yet they do not deem it of any particular importance whether the legislature 80 intended or not, it being sufficient, that if they intended to. continue capital punishment, they did not carry that intention into effect, but, on the contrary, abolished capital punishment. Whether that was the result of deliberate design or inadvertence, can make no difference in the result of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">III. The sentence of the plaintiff in error, that he shall \u201c suffer death,\" is vague, indefinite and uncertain, and for that reason not susceptible of enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">The sentence does not even provide that the prisoner shall suffer death by violence. The sentence is as-uncertain as the law under which it was pronounced. The officer appointed to execute the sentence has no power to select the mode of death; to give him this power would be to clothe him with judicial functions and attributes. The sentence, within every rule of law applicable to the case, is a nullity.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">IV. The plaintiff in error was. tried and convicted in the Court of General Sessions of the peace, in and for the city and county of Hew York, on the 11th day of December, 1861, and was sentenced on 4th of January, 1862. The Decent-, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>her term of the court expired on the third Saturday of that month,' and the next term of the court could not begin until the first Monday of January, 1862, which came on the sixth day of the month. There was no law in existence at that time which permitted the Mew York General Sessions of the peace to hold court and pass sentence between the third Saturday of December and the sixth day of January following, the latter being the first Monday of the month. That court being one of limited jurisdiction, and deriving its powers only from express statutes, of course could not sit, except at the times specified in the statutes. The following are the only statutes applicable to the subject:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-5\">\u201c The said Court of General Sessions (that is, 1 the Court of General Sessions of the Peace in and for the city and county of Mew York\u2019) (3 <em>R. S., </em>311, \u00a7 66, <em>5th ed.) </em>shall commence and be held on the first Monday in every month, and may continue and be held every day from the commencement thereof, until and including Saturday in the third week thereafter.\u201d (3 <em>R. S., </em>312, \u00a7 70, <em>5th ed.)</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-6\"><em>\u201c </em>Whenever the trial of a cause shall have been commenced in the Court of General Sessions of the Peace, in and for the city and county of Mew York, and the same shall not be concluded before the expiration of the term of said court, it shall be lawful for the said court to continue in session until the conclusion of said trial, and to proceed to judgment if they shall so deem necessary, in cases where conviction shall be had.\u201d <em>(Laws of </em>1846, <em>p. </em>4.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-7\">An act to empower Courts of Sessions, in the several counties of this State, to extend their terms, and authorizing certain adjournments of such courts, passed April 9, 1859, provides as follows <em>(Laws </em>1859, <em>p. </em>465, \u00a7 1): \u201c It shall be lawful for the Court of Sessions of any county of this State, to continue its sittings at any term thereof, so long as it may be necessary, in the opinion of such court, for the dispatch of any business, or the determination of any cases that may be pending before such court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-8\">\u201c'\u00a7 2. The Court of Sessions of any county in this State,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>shall hereafter have, and may, in their discretion, exercise all the powers in regard to adjournments thereof, from time to time, which are now by law conferred upon or exercised by the Court of Oyer and Terminer of such county, in relation to adjournments of said last named court\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Hone of the statutes above cited gives the Hew York General Sessions of the Peace the power to extend its terms beyond the third Saturday after the first Monday of the month.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">The act of 1859 does not confer this power, for the reason that it refers to the \u201c Court of Sessions of any county.\u201d This language does not embrace the Hew York General Sessions of the Peace, in and for the city and county of Hew York.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">This court expressly held, at the last General Term, that the phrase, \u201cthe Courts of Sessions of the several counties,\u201d did not include \u201c the General Sessions of the Peace in the city and county of Hew York.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Court of General Sessions of the city and county of New York, reported in N. Y. Transcript, Oct. </em>16, 1862.)</p>\n<author id=\"b460-8\">Justice Ingraham,</author>\n<p id=\"A0o\">in delivering the opinion of the court, observes: \u201c These various provisions, to-which I have referred, show, I think conclusively, that the old courts of General Ses-sions, <em>except in the city of New York, </em>were not continued after the Constitution of 1847, but that new courts were organized in all the other counties of the- State under a different name, while the General Sessions in Hew York was continued with all its then powers and jurisdiction, and has been so recognized by the legislature in all laws passed since the adoption of the Constitution relating to the said court.\u201d * * \u201cIf this view be correct, the only question would be, whether the term \u2018 Courts of Sessions,\u2019 as used in the act of 1859, is to be construed as applying to all the courts in this State of that name, and also to the General Sessions of the Peace in the city of Hew York.\u201d'</p>\n<p id=\"AYn\">The learned judge then proceeds .to show that the language, \u201c Courts of Sessions of the several counties \u201d has no reference to the \u201c General Sessions of the Peace in this city and county.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AJO\">The act of 1846, above cited, does not give the court the power to extend its term, except in a case the trial of which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>\u201c sha.ll not be concluded before the expiration of the term of said court.\u201d In that event it merely gives the court power \u201c to continue in session until the conclusion of said trial, and t\u00f3 proceed to judgment, &amp;e.\u201d In the case of Lowenberg, the trial ended on the eleventh day of December, A. D. 1861, about two weeks before the third Saturday of term.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">It is clear, therefore, that none of these statutes gives the court the power to sit and pass judgment between the third Saturday of one term-and the first Monday of the next term.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">In construing these statutes, the attention of the court is invited to the authorities cited under point II. The rule of strict construction must prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">The sentence is not only vague, indefinite, uncertain, and not only susceptible of enforcement, but was passed by a court not in existence at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">Y. The judgment oft the court below should have been arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\"><em>Nelson J. Waterbury </em>(district attorney), for the People, contended that the sentence of the prisoner was not illegal, and was capable of enforcement.</p>\n<author id=\"b461-10\">\u25a0 Peckham, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ars\">I incline to think enough may be gathered by putting together parts of its different sections to hold and adjudge that murder, \u201c of the first degree,\u201d as therein defined, was a \u201c crime punishable with death,\u201d as prescribed in the 4th and 5th sections of the laws of 1860, page 712.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-11\">The first section of that act declares that \u201cno crime hereafter committed, except treason and murder \u00f3f the first degree, shall be punished with death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-12\">It is true this section does not affirmatively enact that these crimes shall be so punished, but it does declare that no others shall.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-13\">The 2d section defines murder \u201c of the first degree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-14\">The 4th and 5th sections prescribe the punishment of persons \u201c convicted of any crime punishable with death,\u201d but do not declare or define crimes so punishable. The 6th section prescribes the punishment of \u201c murder in the second degree.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>Section 9th declares that \u201c the provisions of this act for the punishment of murder in the first degree shall apply to the crime of treason.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">This is a strong implication that the punishment prescribed in the 4th and 5th sections, for persons \u201cconvicted of any crime punishable with death,\u201d applies to the crime of murder of the first degree, as there are but two punishments prescribed in that act, and one is confined expressly to persons guilty of \u201c murder in the second degree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">The other punishment is therefore necessarily applied to murder 'in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">The 8th section recognizes the same thing.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">The 7th section is only confusing, but does not destroy toe enactments of the others.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">But, assuming that \u201c murder of the first degree,\u201d of which the prisoner is convicted, is by this act punishable with death, is the act, in that respect, constitutional ?</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">The 5th section of the 1st article of the Constitution of 1846, declares that \u201c cruel and unusual punishments \u201d shall not be inflicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-11\">Execution by hanging was the mode adopted and required \u2022 by law prior to the act of 1860, but that act expressly repealed the statute as to hanging, and has substituted nothing in its place.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-12\">In <em>The People </em>v. <em>Hartung </em>(22 <em>N. Y. R, </em>107), Judge Denio properly says that it is not clear whether, under this act, \u201c the manner of the execution should be determined by the court, the governor, or the sheriff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-13\">If it cannot be decided which one has the power to direct the manner of the execution, can either one exercise any such power ? I think all would agree, having reference to the duties of the different officers, that the manner of the execution should be directed by the court. Prior to this statute, I think, the court has always so directed in this State. If it were the duty of the court, then the court committed an error in this case, in omitting to give such direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-14\">It may justly be added, that there is nothing in the act in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>terms authorizing either the court or the governor to direct the manner of the execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">If the execution, then, shall ever be effected, its manner, practically, will rest entirely in the discretion of the sheriff.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">The prisoner may thus \u201csuffer\u201d death in any manner agreeable to the discretion or the caprice of the sheriff. He may shoot, burn or torture him, or even starve him to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">It is no answer to say that the prohibition in the Constitution is equally obligatory upon the sheriff as upon other officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">Where is the remedy in case of its violation in such a case ? This constitutional prohibition was directed to the legislature. It was intended to guide and govern their legislation. It was never aimed at a mere executive officer, whose whole duty, under our government, is simply to carry into effect a certain and declared law.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">Suppose the legislature should enact that a person guilty, of a certain offense should suffer such punishment, except hanging, as the sheriff df the county where he should be sentenced to jail, should think proper to inflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">Would that be a valid law? I think not, for one reason\u2014 because it would permit, not that it directed, cruel and unusual punishments. The Constitution intended that the legislature should declare punishments not cruel and unusual \u2014 not leave it to the discretion of a sheriff whether they should be inflicted \u2014 and that is the view of this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-11\">But there is another difficulty in the record in this case which I think fatal to this conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-12\">The Court of Sessions, sitting on the fourth day of January, 1862, sentenced the prisoner to be executed on the 20th day of February, 1863, and \u201c to imprisonment at hard labor until such punishment of death shall be inflicted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-13\">The court thus inflict a punishment of over thirteen and a half months at hard labor, besides the punishment of death, when the act only authorizes a sentence of a year at hard labor.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-14\">In the <em>People </em>v. <em>Hartung, </em>before cited, the court expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>held that imprisonment at hard labor before execution, was an additional punishment, and in that case, as it was imposed by an act passed after the offense had been committed, the court held it to be an <em>ex post facto </em>law, unconstitutional and void. In the case at bar this additional imprisonment or punishment being wholly unauthorized by law, is therefore illegal and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">It may be urged that the governor, being authorized to issue his warrant for the prisoner\u2019s execution, may do so under the. act at any time after a year from such sentence, whether the time shall have arrived for the execution, according to the sentence, or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">It is true he may and must wait until after-the expiration of the year from the time sentence was pronounced, but has he any authority to issue his warrant for the execution before the time fixed by the sentence ? Ho such authority is given him. He does not pass or pronounce the sentence. He simply commands it \u201cto be carried into execution.\u2019\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">But assuming that this act is utterly void-for any reason, so far as regards the death penalty, is the punishment of imprisonment thereby rendered ineffectual, or in any degree impaired ? I incline to think not.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">Suppose the act had declared that any person guilty of murder in the first degree should be confined in prison until the legislature should pass a valid law to hang him. \"V ery probably the legislature might not have the power to pass a valid law to that effect. It might be regarded as an <em>ex post facto </em>law; but would such a provision nullify or impair the penalty of imprisonment? I think not. -It would be simply another way \u2014 an oblique and crooked way, perhaps\u2014of imposing a penalty of imprisonment for life.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">It is by no means clear that the legislature, or the author of this statute, intended that the convict should be ever actually executed. All the provisions as to inflicting death seem intended rather for alarm than for real peril to the convict.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">By the fifth section it is declared that no execution shall take place until the whole record of the proceedings shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>certified by the clerk of the court to the governor, nor until the governor shall issue his warrant, &amp;c. Yet there is no statute making it the duty of the clerk to transmit such certified copy. Hor is the governor required ever to issue his warrant. He is not, even affirmatively, in terms authorized to issue it.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Holding the statute effective, therefore, as to the imprisonment, and void as to the death penalty \u2014 that passing a formal sentence of death, in itself utterly void and that cannot be executed, accompanied with a sentence of imprisonment until the punishment of death shall be inflicted, is simply a mode of sentencing to imprisonmentfor life, this judgment may be sustained.</p>\n<author id=\"b465-6\">Leohard, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3C\">The act of 1860 distinctly recognizes, as an existing fact, that certain crimes are punishable with death.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">Is murder such a crime ? From the earliest ages until the enactment of the statute referred to, murder has been uniformly punished with death by the nation to which the colony of Hew York belonged in 1775, and at the time of our separation from the mother country. The statutes and common law of that country are, by the Constitution of this State, continued in force, except so far as they are repealed or abrogated.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">The act in question has not repealed or abrogated the penalty of death in case of murder, nor has any other statute of this State. On the contrary, the act of 1860 excepts murder in the first degree, from the abrogation of the death penalty as a punishment for crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">The 4th section provides a distinct penalty for crimes punishable with death. The offender shall be sentenced to confinement at hard labor in the State prison until the punishment of death shall be inflicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">It is made the duty of the court to pass this sentence upon the conviction of the offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-11\">The mode of inflicting death is not prescribed. Ho warrant can therefore be issued by the governor for the execution of the person convicted and sentenced. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b465-12\">The condemned offender will .remain, necessarily, in the State prison, awaiting the warrant, the residue of his life.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>This result was, perhaps, the intention of the author of the act, although not probably that of the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">The intention of the author or of the legislature, is not, however, referred to as an argument for or against the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">The sentence pronounced is within the letter of the statute, in my opinion.,</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">The crimes punishable with death, referred to in the 4th section of the act of 1860, are not limited to cases where the penalty of death is provided by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">The first section of the late act is inconsistent with, and must be held to have repealed the first section of title one, chapter one, part fourth -of the Revised Statutes, without the amendment provided by section seven of the act. That amendment is, however, disconnected from everything else in the chapter, and stands without any legal effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">No argument is to be drawn, therefore, from the words \u201c as herein provided,\u201d contained in the amended section, limiting the description of the offender contained in 4th section of the act, so as to require a statutory direction to include the offender who is to be sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">The objection that the sentence was passed after the expiration of the term of the court, or in vacation, is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">It does not appear that the term had closed. The Court of General Sessions of the peace is authorised to continue its term so as to complete any unfinished trial. The term may have been prolonged from that cause. The presumption of law is in favor of the regularity of the proceedings of courts of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-12\">The judgment ought to be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"210\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b466-13\">Ingraham, P. J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"AaZo\">The prisoner was tried and convicted in the Court of General Sessions, of the crime of murder in the first degree, and was sentenced to imprisonment and death.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-14\">The murder was committed on the 14th of November, 1861. The trial took place on the 11th of December, 1861, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>prisoner was sentenced on the 4th of January, 1862, in the fourth week after the commencement of the December .term. The court had been extended for the trial of another case, and during the week for which it was so extended, the sentence took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">The great question we are called upon to decide in this case, arises, upon the construction of the act passed in 1860, in \u201c relation to capital punishment, and to provide for the more certain punishment of the crime of murder.\u201d <em>(Laws of </em>1860, <em>ch. </em>410.)</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Prior to the passage of this act, the law for the punishment of murder was contained in the Eevised Statutes' <em>(3d vol., p. </em>935).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">The 1st section of this statute was simple and easily understood, and provided \u201c that every person who should thereafter be' convicted of treason, of murder, or of arson in the first degree, should suffer death for the same.\u201d The same chapter provided for the mode of execution, and the time within which it should take place.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">By the act of 1860, the 1st section of the chapter of the Eevised Statutes above referred to was amended so as to read as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">\u201c Every person \u25a0 who shall hereafter be convicted of, 1st, treason against the People of this State, or 2d, of murder, or 3d, of arson in the first degree, as those crimes are declared in this title, shall be punished as herein provided.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">The effect of this amendment was-to abolish the section of the Eevised Statutes as it existed at the time of the passage of the act of 1860, and to substitute in its place the section as adopted in that act.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-11\">It was thus enacted by the 1st section of that chapter of the Eevised Statutes, as amended, that the. crime of murder should be punished as provided for in the title 1, chapter 1, of part 4, of Eevised Statutes. \u2022 There is no section in the whole title, which provides-any punishm\u00e9nt for murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-12\">There never was any such provision, except in the first section, which was virtually repealed and taken away by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>amendment of 1860, and we look in vain throughout the whole chapter for any punishment to be inflicted for .this offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">But, as if to destroy entirely the supposition that anything was to be left in the statute sanctioning the punishment of death for murder, under the provisions of that act, the law of 1860 also repealed the section fixing the time for executing such punishment, the provisions for submitting the case to the governor for revision before execution, the provisions for reprieves in certain cases for females, the mode of execution by hanging, the directing the execution in the prison yard, and the provision for another place of execution, in case the prison of the county was unfit therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">While, therefore, the amended first section' required the crime of murder to be punished as therein provided, the only portion of the chapter that contained any punishment had been taken away, and every portion of the chapter that contained anything relating to the punishment of death was utterly repealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">We look in vain, therefore, throughout this title of the \u00a1Revised Statutes for any punishment prescribed for the crime of murder, and unless some other provision is made in another statute, no such punishment can be found in the laws of this State as they existed at the time of this offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">In the act of 1860, there is no punishment expressly provided for murder in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">. The 1st section enacts that no other crime than treason and murder, in the first degree, shall be punished with death. .This is a provision for limiting the punishment of other offenses, not providing punishment for the excepted cases, and while the statute provides a punishment for murder in the second degree, for arson and other offenses, it leaves the punishment for the greater offenses not only undefined, but if they can be discovered at all from the act, to rest on inferences merely to be drawn from the negative provisions of the first section.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-10\">It cannot be denied that at the time of the commission of this offense there was no provision of the law directly pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>scribing the punishment of death for treason or murder in the first degree, or directing any punishment whatever, and if the court directs the execution of the prisoner, or the sheriff carries out such direction, the court and sheriff must act, in taking the life of a human being, without any direct authority of law, and upon a mere inference to be drawn from a negative provision of a statute, and from the absence of any law providing any other punishments. When a public officer is called upon to take the life of another, he may well ask that his duty should be clearly laid down by the law; that such acts should not rest on mere inference or implication, but that he should have his warrant for what he does in the clear provisions of the statute and the mandate of the court. To take away the life of a prisoner under a doubtful construction of the law, or on a mere inference or implied authority from the absence of legislative provisions, might lead to a judicial murder rather than to carrying into effect the law of the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">It is very clear that the legislature did not intend that all the offenses enumerated in the first section of the title in the Eevised Statutes above referred to, should be punished with death. In that section was included the offense of arson in the first degree, and not even by inference can any authority be found for a greater punishment for this offense than imprisonment at hard labor in the State prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">So the General Term of this district held, in the case of <em>Shepherd, </em>and in that case the Court of Appeals have since-held that under the act of 1860 he could not be sentenced to any punishment. Whether such was the intent of the author of the act of 1860, in regard to the crime of murder, is a question not free from difficulty. The omission to provide, by direct enactment, any punishment for the highest crimes known to the law\u2014treason and murder \u2014 the cautious repeal of every provision of the Eevised Statutes bearing upon the death penalty or relating thereto, especially the absolute repeal of the section providing the mode of execution by hanging, without substituting any other direction as to the mode by which death was to be inflicted, do not make the duty of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>court clear or free from doubt, so as to warrant us in saying that the legislature clearly intended to retain the punishment of death for this offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">I purpose now to examine the cases decided in the Court of Appeals, in which the act of 1860 has been tlie subject of discussion. These are, <em>The People </em>v. <em>Hartung </em>(22 <em>N. Y. R., </em>95), and <em>The People </em>v. <em>Shay </em>(22 <em>N. Y. R., </em>317).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">It must be remembered that these cases were for offenses committed before the passage of the act of 1860, and the question involved in these cases was not whether offenses committed after its passage could be punished under it, but whether the repeal of the statute and the additional punishment of one year\u2019s imprisonment, as provided for in the fourth section, did not prevent the execution of the judgment, and the court decided such to be its effects.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">The reason given for the reversal of the judgment, was that there was not at the time any law which authorized or' sustained it, or which would warrant its execution; and in the case of <em>Shay, </em>all the exceptions at the trial, and the motion in arrest, were decided against the prisoner, but that judgment was also reversed, for the reasons stated, in the case of <em>Hartung.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">We have been referred to the views of the learned justice who delivered the opinion in those cases, as authority for holding that the punishment of death was retained by the act .of 1860.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">The substance of these views is, that no law at the time contained any separate provision for the punishment of murder in the first degree, or which declared that any crime should be punished with death; that if there was any punishment, it could only be known by inference or implication; that in the first section, which declared that no crime but treason and murder in the first degree should be punished with -death, there \u201c is an implication in the nature of a negative pregnant, that those crimes should be so punishedthat in the fourth section of' the statute it was also implied that there were some crimes to be punished capitally, and, upon considering the whole law, that the intention to preserve the punishment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>death, when the. governor shall approve of the sentence, in addition to imprisonment for one year, was so manifest that the court would assume such to be the effect of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">It could not be necessary in that case to decide whether there was any punishment provided in the act of 1860 for the offenses of treason and murder in the first degree, if committed after the passage of the act. Although the act of 1860 provided that persons under conviction or sentence should be punish\u00e9d as if convicted under that act, still Judge Denio held that there was not at that time any law which authorized or sustained the judgment, or would warrant its execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">We are left, then, to the simple question whether, when the statute contains no provision imposing the punishment of death for murder in the first degree, such punishment should be inflicted, merely because it might be inferred from the statute that the legislature supposed the punishment of death was retained, or that such punishment should be inflicted, because in another part of the statute provision was made as to the action of the governor before the sentence could be carried out.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">I cannot assent to the proposition that the court should condemn to death simply because they can guess that the legislature intended to preserve this punishment. Nor do I assent to the conclusion that it is very clear that any such intention existed. The alteration of the section which contained this punishment of death, the omission to substitute any other punishment, the studied repeal of the provisions relating to such executions, and particularly the repeal of the section which declared the mode in which such death should be effected, seem to me rather,to imply that it was not intended to have such punishments continued. It is a well settled principle in the construction of a penal statute, that it must be construed strictly <em>(Sprague </em>v. <em>Birdsall, 2 Cow. R., </em>419); and a penalty cannot be raised by implication, but must be expressly created and imposed. <em>(Jones </em>v. Estes, <em>2 Johns. R., </em>379.)</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">If so much strictness is required merely to impose a penalty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>for the violation of law, of how much more importance is it to require clear warrant for the penalty of death and full authority to take human life, not merely resting on inference and implication, but on the full and express provision of law therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">It has been suggested that the defect of our statutes might be remedied by invoking the doctrine that a repeal of a statute, without substituting any in its place, revived the rules of the common law. This may be so, and may relieve the difficulty which would exist as to the mode of execution; but a difficulty will at once arise from the fact that it is not a mere' repeal of a statute, but an amendment, in which the offense is regulated, and which purports elsewhere to provide a punishment, by directing that it should be punished \u201cas is herein provided.\u201d It can hardly be said that the statute on this subject is repealed, so far as to revive the common law offense of murder and the common law punishment, while that statute remains in force.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">I am aware that, in <em>The People </em>v. <em>Hartung </em>(23 <em>How. Pr. R., </em>314), a contrary opinion was expressed by Hog-EBOOM, J., as to the effect of the act of 1860 on this question ; but as the offense in that case was committed before the passage of the act, it can hardly be considered as controlling in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">The judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">Judgment affirmed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b472-9\"> Note. \u2014This judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeals, in October, 1863, but not on all the grounds stated in the above opinions. The leading opinion in the Court of Appeals holds that the court erred in naming the day for the execution of the prisoner, but that was not a sufficient reason for reversal; that the day should be left to be designated by the governor; that, though the statute, declaring that the punishment of death should be inflicted by hanging, is repealed, it does not abrogate the common law which prescribed the same mode of punishment. Baioom, J., said: \u201cThe proper sentence would have been, that the prisoner suffer death for the crime of murder in the first degree, in killing Samuel Hoffman, at the city of New York, on the 14th day of November, 1861, whereof he has been duly convicted, by being hung by the neck until he be dead, by the sheriff of the county in which he shall be imprisoned, at such time and place, after the expiration of one year from the date of his sentence, as such sheriff shall be commanded by a warrant issued by the governor, under</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
