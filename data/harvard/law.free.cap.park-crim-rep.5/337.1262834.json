Barker &amp; Son to the check was a forgery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b342-8\">It is an established rule that the evidence offered must correspond with the allegations in the indictment, supposing the allegations to be material and necessary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b342-9\">The indictment in this case alleged <em>the forgery of the check. </em>Ho evidence having been introduced to sustain such allegation, which <em>was material and necessary, </em>the court manifestly erred in refusing to charge as above requested. (1 <em>Greenleaf on Ev., </em>\u00a7 51; <em>Best's Principles of Ev., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 22-249.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b342-11\">2.

(2 <em>Archb. Crim. Pl., Waterman's Notes, 7th ed., </em>808.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b342-14\">3. The court also erred in refusing to charge as requested in the third proposition.

The forgery of such addition must be specially alleged and proved as laid. (<em>Whart. Am. Cr. L., ed. of </em>1846, 336.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-6\">4. The court erred in refusing to charge that the defendant could not be convicted under this indictment, if the firm of M. Barker &amp; Son had no account in the Bank of Jersey City, and the prisoner, knowing the fact, fraudulently obtained the treasury notes from Livermore, Clews &amp; Mason, in which case he would have been guilty of obtaining money by a false token* and not guilty of forgery. \u00bb</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-8\">5. The alleged forged certificate in no respect resembled a genuine certificate of the teller or cashier of the Bank of Jersey City. The instrument must appear, upon the face of it, to have been made to resemble a true instrument of the description named in the indictment. <em>(United States </em>v. Morrow, 4 <em>Wash. C. C. R., </em>738; 4 <em>Taunt., </em>300; <em>Russ. &amp; Ry., </em>212-219.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-9\">6; The conviction under this indictment could not be pleaded in bar to an indictment for forging the certificate.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b343-10\"><em>John H. Anthon, </em>for defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-11\">I. The name given to an instrument, by way of description, is not to be regarded when the instrument is set forth at length in the indictment. <em>(Whart. Cr. L., ed. of </em>1851, \u00a7\u00a7 350-1467.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-12\">II. The words \u201c certified by Sparks; Bank J; C.,\u201d having been set forth <em>in hcec verba </em>in the indictment, and having been alleged a forged instrument, the proof of its forgery sustains the verdict, and it is immaterial that the other portions of the instrument, or another instrument, was also set forth in the indictment, they being necessary, and only necessary, to explain the forged clause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-13\">A. bond is alleged in an indictment as \"forged. The proof shows the name of another obligor added. The rule here is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>that the forgery may be charged, and be supported by evidence of the alteration. <em>(State </em>v. <em>Gardiner, </em>1 <em>Iredell R, </em>27.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-5\">It is a variance to allege the forgery by a name other than its true name, when the statute affixes a penalty to forgery of the instrument alleged, different from the penalty affixed to the forgery of the true instrument. (2 <em>Archb. Cr. Ev., 7th ed., </em>807.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-6\">Otherwise, however, when the penalty is the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-7\">III. In the manner and form, as the instrument was uttered, so it was pleaded in the indictment. The negotiable market value of the instrument consisted in its being a <em>certified </em>check. The prosecutor was deceived by it as a certified check. The evidence showed that the instrument was not a certified check, but had been made to appear so by a forgery of the certificate' clause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-8\">IV. Considering the instrument as a whole, no proof having offered as to the goodness of any part, and one part having been proven forged, the whole becomes a forged instrument, and the count in the indictment for uttering it was proven and the verdict justly rendered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-9\">1. The particular part of the instrument forged need not be pointed out on the face of the indictment, and is rarely done so.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-10\">2. But few forged instruments are all forgeries. They may be forged by additions, by alterations, by erasures, by annexations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-11\">V. There being no exception to evidence, the only question, on appeal can be, is the indictment sufficient to sustain the verdict ? The verdict finds the certificate a forgery, and uttered by the prisoner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-12\">VI. The English decisions to the contrary <em>(Rex </em>v. <em>Howell, 6 Carr. &amp; Payne, </em>148; <em>Butterwich's Case, Roscoe's Cr. Ev., </em>465; 2 <em>Arch. Cr. Pr., </em>808, <em>notes) </em>are all based upon the English statute of 1 William IV, ch. 66, \u00a7 4; which statute provides in terms for the forgery of a draft with a penalty, and also in terms for the forgery of an acceptance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-13\">In <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Howell, </em>the court uses the following words: \u201c The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>statute has made a distinction between bill and acceptance, for it uses both terms. If proof of forging an acceptance will support a count for forging a bill, the word \u2018 acceptance \u2019 in the statute is wholly nugatory.\u201d .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-5\">The statute of the State makes no such distinction, but defines the crime by a word applicable to check, certificate, draft, acceptance, or any of them: \u201cEvery person who, with intent to injure or defraud, shall make, alter, forge, or counterfeit any instrument or writing, being, or purporting to be, the act of another, by which any pecuniary demand or obligation shall be, or shall purport to be created, increased, discharged, or diminished,\u201d etc. (3 <em>R. S., 5th ed., p. </em>951, \u00a7 33.)</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b345-6\"><em>By the Court, </em>Ingraham, P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AaT\">The first count of the indictment charged the prisoner with having falsely made, forged and counterfeited a certain instrument in writing, commonly called a bank check, &amp;c. The check was set out in the indictment in <em>hcec verba, </em>and upon the face of it were written the words and letters, \u201c Certified by Sparks, Bank J. 0.\u201d The second count charged the felonious and false uttering of the same check as a certain false, forged and counterfeited instrument and writing, commonly called a bank check, and also contained a copy of the check.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">Upon the trial the only writing shown to be forged was the writing across the face of the check. The proof showed there was no such clerk as Sparks in the bank on which the check was drawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">The counsel for the prisoner, among other requests, asked the court to instruct the jury that the indictment did not charge the forgery of the certificate, which was no part of the check, and not essential to its validity, and created no demand or obligation for the payment of the money, and the prisoner could not be convicted under the indictment which charged only the forgery of the check.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">\u2022 The prisoner was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-10\">Upon the argument, the counsel for the People conceded that the prisoner could not be convicted under the first count <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>of the indictment which charged the forgery. Of this I think there can be no doubt. It will not be pretended that the words written across the face of the check were any part of the check, in any way necessary to give it validity or to add to its negotiability. They might have been given in a different form, and on a separate piece of paper, and would have left the check in its original form, valid and effectual for all the purposes for which it was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">This writing can be considered as nothing more than a certificate that at its date the check would be paid by the bank on presentment.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">The forgery of an acceptance on a bill of exchange is not properly described in an indictment which charges the forgery of the bill only.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">The acceptance is no part of the bill of exchange. The bill is perfect without it. It can be protested, sued upon and collected, whether accepted in writing or not, and the forgery of the bill can be counted upon as an offense just as well, if not accepted, as if it had been previously accepted. This question has been the subject of direct adjudication in England, as applicable to a bill of exchange.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">In <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Howell </em>(25 <em>Com. Law R., </em>366; <em>and </em>6 <em>Car. &amp; </em>Payne, 148), it was held that a' count in an indictment, charging the uttering of a forged bill, was not supported by proof that the prisoner uttered the bill and that the acceptance was a forgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">In this case, the question was reserved for all the judges, who agreed that the conviction for uttering the instrument was wrong, and could not be sustained. The whole theory of the criminal law renders the enforcement of such a rule necessary. In no pleading are so much certainty and particularity required as in an indictment. \u201c That certainty and precision (said. Edmonds, P. J., in <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>The </em>People, 8 <em>Barb. R., </em>547) in an indictment is required, which will enable the defendant to judge whether the facts and circumstances stated constitute an indictable'offense; that he may know the nature of the offense against which he is to prepare his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>defense; that he may plead a conviction or acquittal in bar of another indictment, and that there may be no doubt as to the nature of the judgment to be given in case of conviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">It does not help the case to say that the indictment sets out the instrument in <em>hcec verba, </em>and therefore the prisoner was informed what the instrument was on which the prosecution rested. Suppose, in this case, the prisoner had uttered the check, not knowing of the forgery, or if the writing of the acceptance was a doubtful question, admitting of different opinions whether it was genuine or not, would a prisoner, under such an indictment, be led to prepare proof of the acceptance, or would he not rather confine his preparation to proof of the genuineness of the signature of the drawer? And when told on the trial the forgery is in the acceptance, he may well reply, no such charge is made against me, and I am not prepared to meet it.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">I can see no ground for any distinction between forging the instrument and uttering the instrument knowing it to be forged. In both cases the prisoner is entitled to be told what his offense is, in such a manner that he may be prepared to meet the charge, and so clearly that, if. once tried and disposed of, the decision may be pleaded in bar of any other indictment. That could not be the case under the present indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">It is suggested that the decisions in England are based upon the statute, which distinguishes between a draft and an acceptance. Our statute distinguishes quite as much. It does not\" specify an acceptance in any case, but after enumerating the terms of the offense, \u201cfalsely making, uttering, forging or counterfeiting,\u201d applies it to any instrument or writing purporting to be the act of another, by. which any pecuniary demand or obligation shall be or purport to be created, &amp;c. Here the check is the act of one party. The acceptance or certificate is the act of another party, each creating different obligations, and each valid in itself, and constituting a separate^ instrument. (3 <em>R. S., 5th ed., p. </em>951, \u00a7 33.)</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered in the Sessions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
