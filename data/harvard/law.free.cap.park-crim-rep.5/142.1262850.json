I know the prisoner; I became acquainted with him about a year ago, in the cars; he told me what his business was, an agency; I know the Kidder farm in Genesee county by reputation; I had negotiations with prisoner touching the purchase of a mortgage on that farm the fore part of last June; he called at my house at Batavia, and said he had a mortgage to sell; he had it with him (mortgage was shown to witness); .this is the one; he also had a clerk\u2019s search with him (it is here shown to witness) ; this is it; that which is below the signature of the clerk was not then upon it; this is the bond accompanying the mortgage; he said it was a good mortgage, upon a farm in Darien, of 186 acres, which was free from incumbrances, except this mortgage; that there were no other incumbrances upon it but this mortgage; that it was the best kind of mortgage ; a first class mortgage; that he came out there because persons in Buffalo did not like to buy mortgages on land in Genesee county; I told him I did not know enough about it to buy it; did not know enough about the premises; he asked what I would give for it if it was all as he said; I told him I would buy it at 20 per cent off; he dwelt upon the character of the mortgage considerably, and stated what I have already sworn, to, over and over, in different words; I told him I would not buy it without knowing more of the value of the land; that I must see the land, or send some one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>to see it first; nothing was consummated; the matter was left there, and there was no agreement for any future negotiation ; he showed me the bond and mortgage and search; I did not examine them particularly; he took them ay ay; I saw prisoner next about ten days after, at Batavia; he called at my house; I had discovered upon this search a prior mortgage by Kidder to Chatfield. and Tisdall, of $300 ; I came to Buffalo .between the first and second time I saw Sully, and saw Mr. Otto, who offered me the mortgage; I addressed him a note to send me the search; he did so a few days after; I asked Mr. Godfrey to go and appraise the farm; he came to my house, and, upon looking over the search there, we (Godfrey and witness) discovered this little mortgage of Kidder to Chatfield and Tisdall, given in 1825, and I then stopped Godfrey from going out to see the farm; the next day or so, Sully came out; I told him what I was going to do when I discovered this Kidder incumbrance; he asked where Godfrey lived; I told him, and he left, taking the papers with him; the next day Sully and Godfrey came to my house; they had been up to examine the land; Mr. Godfrey appraised the land so low I told Sully it was not sufficient; Sully took the papers and went away; while there he said the Kidder mortgage was paid; I told him, if so he could get it discharged; that Chat-field lived in Chicago; he said he would get a discharge; he showed me a bond of indemnity against that mortgage; it was sent out by Otto, and he mentioned it; prisoner said at this time that the Kidder mortgage was the only incumbrance on the land, and when it was discharged the land would be clear; I told him I should' be in Buffalo next day ; prisoner took the papers away with him; I came to Buffalo the next day or day after; prisoner called at my son\u2019s, Dr. Cary, and said he had come to make the security acceptable, by leaving part of the money; that Moulton was under the necessity of having $2,600 that day, which \"he wanted to pay on a contract for a farm, which, if he did not pay, he would lose some $1,200; I offered to give him $2,000 down, and a note for $1,000, payable when that amount should be paid upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>Cross mortgage, and $440 upon the discharge of the Kidder mortgage; he declined to take that; said Moulton wanted more money, and that he could do better; that it was a first class mortgage; I told him, very well, do so; upon reflection he said Moulton wanted the money so much, and that it would not be long before that amount would be got of Cross on his mortgage; I asked prisoner if it was all right; he said it was, and promised if it was not all right, he would make it right-; he then made the writings, that is, the notes, and copies of them for me to keep; I drew a check; the assignment he had already made; this is the check; I asked to whom it should be payable, and he said to himself; this is the assignment, dated June 20; it was delivered on that occasion with the bond and mortgage; I never saw Moulton to know him until after the transaction; the assignment was acknowledged, and had the clerk\u2019s certificate upon it; I noticed the assignment bore date prior; prisoner said he had the assignment all drawn; I next saw my check at the Bank of Genesee, Batavia ; I had money there, but not the amount of the check.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-5\"><em>Question by district attorney: </em>Did you rely upon the representations of the prisoner touching the Cross mortgage?

The counsel for the prisoner objected to the admission of the evidence as immaterial and irrelevant. The court overruled the objection, and the prisoner excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-6\">Moulton said he bought the farm for himself, and did not intend to sell it; that in the course of next week he would come and go with me to the clerk\u2019s office, at Buffalo, and get the clerk\u2019s certificate to the deed and mortgage, and we could go out to Batavia together and have them recorded; my son was on the farm, and Moulton said he wanted the deed to show to him, so that he would go off the farm; that he would bring it back, and we could go together and get the certificate and have it recorded; he said, you may take my deed and get it recorded; I said I was not able to go, and I was not; Sully was present; Moulton was to give me '$30 an acre. The balance above the mortgage was arranged there; Sully said he was afraid the cars had left him; Moulton said if they had he would take him to Buffalo in his wagon; it was about ten o\u2019clock when they left; the money paid was paid by Sully; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>Moulton gave me his note for $81.'50, and Sully indorsed it.

Moulton, and at the same time Moulton executed and delivered to Luce his bond and mortgage upon the farm, to secure the payment of $5,250, being nearly the whole of the purchase-money. The deed of that farm from Luce to Moulton was recorded on the second day of June. The mortgage from Moulton to Luce was recorded on the tenth day of June. On the second day of June, Moul ton executed to Cross a deed of the Kidder farm, and Cross at the same time executed his bond to Moulton and a mortgage on that farm to secure the payment of $4,300, and which last mentioned deed and mortgage were recorded on the second day of June. On the 23d day of June, Carey purchased the Cross bond and mortgage. The sale of them to him was negotiated by the prisoner. On the twenty-third day of June, at the city of Buffalo, prisoner delivered to Carey an assignment of them, and received from Carey his check, of $2,000 on the Bank of Genesee; and on the same day the prisoner drew the money from that bank at Batavia, in the county of Genesee, upon this check. The assignment of the bond and mortgage to Carey, was recorded on the 28th of June. The prisoner drew up all the said deeds, bonds and mortgages, and was present at the delivery, on the 1st of June, of the mortgage of Moulton to Luce, and knew of its existence. All these facts are not only established by the evidence, but are conceded by the counsel for the prisoner. The mort- - <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>gage from Moulton to Luce is, and ever has been, a prior lien upon the Kidder farm over the mortgage from Cross to Moulton. The prisoner cannot be convicted under the first count in the indictment, because the money .was not obtained upon the check within the jurisdiction of this court. The agreement to pay one thousand dollars when it was received from the Cross mortgage is not within the statute. The only offense . of which the prisoner, can be convicted is under the second count, of obtaining the signature of Trumbull Carey to the \u2022check for $2,000 upon the Bank of Genesee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-4\">Under the proofs which have been adduced before you, the material disputed questions of fact to be determined by you are:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-5\">1st. Did the prisoner, during the negotiation of the sale to Carey of the bond and mortgage made by Cross to Moulton, represent to Carey that that mortgage was the only mortgage, lien or incumbrance upon the Kidder farm, or that there was no other mortgage, lien or incumbrance thereon ? If you shall find that he did- so represent, I charge you that, under the circumstances of this case, such a representation is a pretense, within our statute. To the portion of the charge \u201cthat under the circumstances of this case, such a representation is a pretense within our statute,\u201d the counsel for the prisoner excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-6\">2d. Did Cary rely upon the representation ? It is not necessary that he should have relied upon it solely. But you must be satisfied that it was a moving cause, and without which he would not have made the purchase of the bond and mortgage and signed and delivered the check.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-7\">3d. Was the representation made with a knowledge that it was false, and with intent to defraud ? If you are satisfied that the representation was made with an intent to defraud, then it is well laid in the indictment to be to defraud Carey, for he was the only person who in law could be defrauded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-8\">The counsel for the prisoner thereupon made to the court the following requests to charge:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-9\">1st.

The prisoner\u2019s counsel requested the court to charge, that upon the proof in the case, they must be satisfied the pretenses were of such a character as would be credited and relied upon by persons of ordinary .caution. That element, together with the means of detection, &amp;c., was excluded from the consideration of the jury. The jury were virtually instructed, if a man lies to another and obtains property by such lie\u2014no matter how absurd it, the lie, may be\u2014he is guilty under our statute, provided ^ reliance is placed upon the lie; and further, the jury were virtually instructed that in determining the question of such reliance, they need not take into consideration the prudence and caution of the complainant, nor the means of detection of the lie. The question in this State is not open; if any question is settled, this one is.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-8\">In the cases of <em>Young </em>v. <em>Rex </em>(3 <em>T.

R., </em>152.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-9\">1st. The court charge, as a matter of law, that the pre- \u2022 tenses alleged in the case, if proved, are within the statute. It is correct for the court to pass upon this; for when the facts are proved, whether or not they amount to a pretense within the statute, is necessarily a question of law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-10\">2d. In this case, that the' actual state of the. title to the \u201cKidder Farm,\u201d and the incumbrances thereon, including the \u201c Luce Mortgage,\u201d at the time of the making the alleged false .pretenses, was as charged in the indictment, were not controverted on the trial. The only questions really <em>mooted </em>on the trial were, whether the prisoner made the representations charged, and whether Carey relied upon them. That the pretenses were <em>false </em>to prisoner\u2019s <em>knowledge </em>(if made), was not denied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-11\">3d. The ruling of the court, that the representations under the disputed facts of this cas\u00e9 were (if made) a pretense within the statute, does not necessarily bring up for decision the question in dispute between Senator Tract and Chancellor Walworth in <em>People </em>v. <em>Haynes. </em>Because, in this case, the repr\u00e9<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>sentations are a pretense even within the rule laid down by the Senator. We have here got an \u201c ingenious contrivance,\" an \u201cunusual artifice,\u201d against which common sagacity and ordinary caution is not sufficient to guard.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-5\">4th. But it is submitted, that all Senator Tract, in <em>People </em>v. Haynes, meant to decide (even if his opinion should.be held to be law), was, that to bring a pretense within the statute, all that is requisite is, that it should be reasonable and probable upon its face, so that a man of ordinary prudence, having confidence in the person making it, would be likely to believe and act upon it. Or, in other words, that the alleged pretense must not be so <em>absurd and improbable </em>upon the face of it that no rational man ought to be deceived thereby. If Senator Tract\u2019s opinion goes further than this, it is clearly overruled by the subsequent authorities above cited.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-6\">5th. The above disposes of the 1st, 2d and 3d requests to charge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-7\">6th. The court correctly refused to charge, as requested, in the 5th request of defendant\u2019s counsel. The <em>second </em>representation testified to by Carey is substantially like the first one, and in substance as set forth in the indictment. It was that the <em>\u201c </em>Kidder mortgage\u201d <em>was. paid, </em>and no incumbrance, and to the same effect is the testimony of Godfrey.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-8\">7th. The ruling on defendant\u2019s 7th request to charge was correct, as the grounds of the request are not in aceordanc\u00e9 with the facts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-9\">8th. The 8th request of defendant\u2019s counsel was properly refused. The prisoner was not on trial for obtaining the money, but for obtaining the <em>signature </em>to the check; and it is no answer to say he afterwards committed another offense in obtaining the money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-10\">9th. The 10th and 11th requests to charge have no foundation in law. It is no answer to a criminal fraud to say that the person defrauded by false statements may, upon some contingency, obtain satisfaction for the property of which he has been defrauded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-11\">10th. The ruling of the court upon the 14th request to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>charge was correct. If the negotiation was not wholly broken off after the first representation, then those representations were a part of the <em>res gestae, </em>and proper to be considered by the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b163-5\">11th. It is submitted there is nothing in the 15th request to charge. It is difficult to understand how the force of a representation is broken or destroyed, or made immaterial, because heard by a person other than the one defrauded.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b163-6\"><em>By the Court, </em>Masten, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A4q\">The prisoner was indicted, tried, and convicted, of obtaining the signature of one Trumbull Carey to a check for $2,000 upon the Bank of Grenesee.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">He now moves, under section 35 of the act relating to this court <em>(Laws </em>1857, <em>vol. </em>1, <em>page </em>754), for a new trial, upon the ground that error in law was committed by the court upon the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">The indictment contains two counts. \u2022 The pretenses are laid \u00a1substantially the same in both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">The first count alleges that the prisoner, by means of the false pretenses, obtained Carey\u2019s check, in writing, upon the Bank of Grenesee, for $2,000, and also certain other contracts in writing, setting-them out at large; also $2,000 in money, and $1,000 in bank bills, the valuable things and personal property of said Trumbull Carey, of the value, &amp;c. It does not, in terms or in substance, charge <em>the obtaining of the signature of Carey to the check.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">The second count charges that the prisoner, by means of the false pretenses, obtained <em>the signature </em>of Trumbull Carey to a written instrument commonly called a check, setting it out at large. This count, in brief, charges that the prisoner presented to Carey a mortgage made by one Cross and wife to one Moulton, upon certain lands in Grenesee county (which mortgage and lands are particularly described), and-induced Carey to purchase the mortgage, and to affix and write his name and signature to the check, by falsely, &amp;c., representing, with the intent to cheat and defraud Carey, that such mortgage \u201c <em>was the only mortgage, lien or incumbrance of any kind upon </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number><em>the \u00a1premises in said mortgage described; that there was no other mortgage, lien or incumbrance, upon the premises therein described; that it was a first and only mortgage, lien or incumbrance upon the premises therein described, and was a bona fide mortgage, and given for part of the purchase-money of said </em>premises.\u201d It negatives specifically all of the pretenses in the words in which they are laid, and avers that \u201c there was then and there another mortgage upon said premises to secure the payment of $5,250, dated the sixth day of May, 1859, executed and delivered by one William M. Moulton to one Truman Luce, and which said mortgage was then and there the first mortgage upon the aforesaid premises, and was the first and prior lien and incumbrance thereon. It then alleges that the prisoner knew of the existence, &amp;c., of the mortgage of Moulton to Luce, and that his pretenses were false.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The prisoner was acquitted under the first count, and convicted under the second count,</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">I will examine the exceptions in the order in which they occur. The district attorney inquired of Carey,- the dupe, whether he relied on the representations of the prisoner. This was objected to by the prisoner, on the ground that it called for the secret mental emotions of the witness. The court overruled the objection, and the prisoner excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">This was a material fact to be established by the public prosecutor, and certainly no one could speak to it better than Carey. The fact was sought after, and not the opinion of the witness. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Herrick, </em>13 <em>Wend. R., </em>87.)</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">The district attorney offered to prove that while at Luce\u2019s house, at the time of the conveyance of the farm to Moulton, and the execution of the mortgage for the purchase-money by Moulton to Luce, Moulton, in the presence of the prisoner, told Luce that he need not be in a hurry to get his mortgage recorded; that in the course of a week Moulton would call upon Luce, and they would go together to the clerk\u2019s office and have the deed and mortgage recorded. The evidence was objected to as immaterial and irrelevant This objection was properly overruled. It, in connection with the conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>and acts of the prisoner, had an important bearing upon the intent of the prisoner to cheat and defraud, at the time he made the representations to Carey alleged in the indictment. It tended to show not only an intent, but a conspiracy with Moulton to cheat1 any one they could.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">The next exception is to the charge \u201c that under the circumstances of this case such a representation is a pretense within our statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">This exception presents the question, whether it is an offense within our statute against false pretenses to effect a sale of a mortgage on real estate by falsely, willfully and designedly representing and pretending, with intent to cheat and defraud, that it is the first lien or mortgage upon the mortgaged premises, and thereby obtain money, &amp;c., from the purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">If this be not so, I have entirely failed to understand the statute. I am aware that in construing this statute there is a seeming conflict between some of the cases, at least in their <em>dicta. </em>This has chiefly arisen, I think, from not considering whether the case cited was upon an indictment under the statute, or upon one for a cheat at common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">A cheat or fraud, to be a criminal offense at the common law, must be such a fraud as affects the public, and against which common prudence' cannot guard, and must indicate a general intent to defraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">But the statutory offense of which the prisoner was convicted, is complete when one is induced to put his signature to a written instrument, or to part with his property, by a false pretense or representation as to an existing fact, willfully and designedly made for the purpose of obtaining such signature or property, with the intent to cheat or defraud him; and it is not necessary that the pretense or representation should be such that common, prudence or ordinary care could not have guarded against it, or that it should be accompanied by any \u201c artful contrivance,\u201d or that the mind of the dupe should be tempted to belief by \u201c an artfully contrived story.\u201d It is sufficient if it be such (and such it must be), that, if true, it would naturally, and, according to the motives which in the affairs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>of life influence the honest mind, directly lead to the result alleged. All men are not equally prudent or cautious, and the statute was passed for the protection of the weaker and more credulous and unsuspecting part of mankind. If, therefore, an assertion of the existence of such a fact be falsely, \u2018willfully and designedly made to induce another to part with his property with intent to cheat him, and the assertion accomplishes the object for which it was made, the offense under the statute is complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Two of the earliest cases reported in this State went upon this distinction. The one was an indictment for a cheat at common law; the other, an indictment under the statute. <em>(The People </em>v. Babcock, 7 <em>Johns. R., </em>201; <em>The People </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>12 <em>Johns. R., </em>292.)</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">In <em>McQueen </em>v. Wickham(10 <em>Adol. &amp; Ellis, </em>34; 37 <em>Eng. Com. \u25a0Law, </em>29), Lord Denman, in answer to the assertion that the 'device must be such as to impose upon a man of ordinary caution, said: \u201c I never could see why that should be. Suppose a m\u00a7n has just art enough to impose upon a very simple person and defraud him, how is it to be determined whether the degree of fraud is such as shall amount to a misdemeanor ? Who is to give the measure ? There are, indeed, cases where \u2022the pretense is so very foolish that it is difficult to say that an imposition is practiced; but still, who is to give the measure ?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">The plain answer is, that the jury are to give the measure. It is for them to say whether the prosecutor relied upon, was deceived by, and\u2019 parted with his property upon the strength of the pretenses used. Any other construction of the statute would defeat the very object of its enactment, by leaving the weak and confiding. at the mercy of the fraudulent and designing.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">In the language of Mr. Greaves, in a note to <em>Russ, on Cr. (vol. </em>2, <em>p. </em>289), \u201c as in robbery, it would be absurd to lay down any rul\u00e9 which defin\u00e9d the force necessary to constitute a robbery, with reference to the ordinary strength of mankind; so, in false pretenses, it would be equally absurd to establish a rule with reference to the ordinary capacity of mankind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>The character and nature of the pretenses, and how calculated they were to deceive the prosecutor, the prosecutor\u2019s habits and mental capacity are all proper to be considered by the jury in determining whether the prosecutor was deceived by them, and whether they were the operative cause of his parting with his property. An inexperienced youth or a feeble old man might be induced to part with his property by false pretenses, particularly if made by a person in whom he placed mistaken confidence, which would not engage the attention of a man of ordinary sagacity and prudence, and which a sharp and experienced man would see through at a glance. Which stands most in need of the protection of the law ? and is not the law made for the weak ? Take two men of \u201c common prudence and sagacity,\u201d and the one is duped by that which would have obtained no credit from the other, and they each wonder at the credulity of the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">It was contended, on the argument by the counsel for the prisoner, that the cases of <em>The People, </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(4 <em>Hill R., </em>9), and <em>The People </em>v. <em>Stetson </em>(4 <em>Barb. R., </em>151), fully sustain him in his position. Some of the expressions in the opinions delivered in those cases, detached from the case, might seem to do so. Those cases were correctly decided. The prosecutor in each of them was a party to a highly immoral and criminal act, and that is the ground upon which those cases stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">But I will pursue this discussion no farther, but content myself by declaring my entire concurrence in the construction given to the statute under consideration by Chancellor Walworth, in the able opinion delivered by him in <em>The People </em>v. <em>Haynes </em>(14 <em>Wend. R., </em>546).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">In order to hold the case at bar to be within the statute, it is not necessary to give to the statute the scope and effect to which I have just declared its true construction entitles it.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">We are of the opinion that the pretense laid in the second count of the indictment, and submitted^ to the jury, is within the statute, and that the exception is not well taken. The judge instructed the jury that the mortgage from Moulton to Luce was, and ever had been, a prior lien upon the Kidder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>farm over the mortgage from Gross to Moulton. He submitted to the jury to determine whether the prisoner, during the negotiation of the sale to Carey of the bond and mortgage made by Cross to Moulton, represented to Carey that that mortgage was the only mortgage, lien or incumbrance upon the Kidder farm, or that there was no other mortgage, lien or incumbrance thereon; whether Carey relied upon and was duped by the representation; whether the representation was made with a knowledge on the part of the prisoner that it was false and with intent to defraud; and instructed them, if they should find all these facts against the prisoner, that, under the circumstances of this case, such representation was a pretense within our statute. The only part of the charge excepted to was, \u201c that, under the circumstances of this case, such a representation is a pretense within our statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">We are also of the opinion that the exceptions to his refusals to charge as firstly and thirdly requested, are not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">We are also of the opinion that the \u00e9xception to the refusal to charge as secondly requested is not well taken. There was nothing in the case to call for it. Certainly Carey did not owe to the prisoner the duty to go to the clerk\u2019s office and examine the records. Nor did (to use what seems to be a favorite expression) <em>\u201c </em>common prudence\u201d suggest that he should go ; for the prisoner, by the search certified by the county clerk, had satisfied \u201c common prudence\u201d that nothing would be found there. There were no means at hand for detecting the false representation. But it seems to me to come with an ill grace from the prisoner, to say, you placed too much reliance upon my statements; if you had spent your time or money in investigating 'them, you might have discovered that they were false.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">The next exception is to the refusal to charge as fifthly requested. The 15th request, also, will be considered here.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">I think the jury would have been warranted in finding that the testimony was not in substance as it was assumed to be by the prisoner\u2019s counsel in his fifth request.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">Carey testified that he had had an interview with the pris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>Oner previous to the one pointed at by the 5th and 15th requests to charge. At the first interview, the prisoner offered to sell him the mortgage of Cross to Moulton, and told him it \u201c was a good mortgage upon a farm in Darien of one hundred and eighty-six acres, which was free from incumbrances, except this (the Cross) mortgage; that there were no other incumbrances upon it but this mortgage; that it was the best kind of mortgage, a first class mortgage.\u201d Carey did not examine the county clerk\u2019s certified search at that time, but before the next interview with the prisoner he did, and found the Kidder mortgage upon it, and called prisoner\u2019s attention to it. Prisoner said \u201c the Kidder mortgage was paid; he would get it discharged, and when it was discharged the land would be clear.\u201d It is sufficient if the pretense be proved in substance and in effect. The very words need not be used, and the pretense may be proved by the conduct and acts of the prisoner, in connection with his statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">The jury would have been warranted in finding that, oh the occasion alluded to, the representation of the prisoner, in substance and effect, was: there is no mortgage or incumbrance on the land other than the Cross mortgage; the Kidder mortgage, which appears upon the search, is no incumbrance in fact; it is paid, and when it is discharged the land will be also clear upon the record. So claim is anywhere made that the Kidder mortgage was not in fact paid. We think it would have been error to have charged as fifthly and fifteenthly requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">The exceptions to the refusals to charge as seventhly and eighthly requested, are not well taken. \u2022 The signature of Carey .to the check was obtained in the city of Buffalo. Our statute makes it an offense to obtain \u201c the signature of any person to any written instrument \u201d by false pretenses. The check was an instrument within the statute. <em>(People </em>v. Galloway, 17 <em>Wend. R., </em>540.) It is possible that the prisoner could have been indicted and tried in Genesee county, for obtaining the money by means of the check. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Herrick, </em>13 <em>Wend. R., </em>87.) But the statutory offense of obtaining the signature of Carey <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>to the cheek, was complete in Buffalo, and the prisoner could not, by persevering in his fraud to a fuller consummation of it, bar the offense committed by obtaining the signature. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Genung. </em>11 <em>Wend, R., </em>18 ; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilgus, </em>4 <em>Pick. R., </em>177.) There was no merger, for even if he could have been tried for obtaining the money upon the check, the offenses in the law are of the same degree. It is not material where the pretenses were made, the obtaining the signature or property by means of them, with intent to cheat or defraud, completes the crime, and determines the plape of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">The judge properly refused to charge as tenthly and eleventhly requested. For it is not essential, to this offense under the statute, that actual loss or injury should be sustained. (Pe<em>ople </em>v. Genung, <em>supra.) </em>The counsel says that the verdict of not guilty on the first count, and guilty on the second, is a <em>felo de se. </em>We are not able to see any difficulty or embarrassment in the verdict. The prisoner was put upon his trial for but one offense; and in such case, where there are several counts, it is competent for the jury to say under which count they convict, and to dispose of the other counts by acquitting upon them. The prisoner could not have been convicted under the first count, for obtaining the money through or by means of the check, for the money was obtained at Batavia, without the territorial jurisdiction of this court. He could not have been convicted under the first count, for obtaining the signature of Carey to the check, for he was not in that count charged with that offense. The charge was of obtaining Carey\u2019s written check upon the Bank-of Genesee for $2,000, the said check being the personal property and valuable thing of said Carey.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">It may be questionable whether the check was the personal property or valuable thing of Carey within the statute; but be that as it may, the prisoner could be convicted of But one offense, and so is the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">Proceedings affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
