The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>statute describes the offense of which the prisoner was convicted, in the following words: \u201c Whoever shall forge,\u201d &amp;c., \u201c any certificate or indorsement of the acknowledgment, by any person, of any deed or other instrument, which by law may be recorded, made, or purporting to have been made, by any officer duly authorized to make such certificate or indorsement, shall be guilty of,\u201d &amp;c. (3 <em>R. S., 5th </em>ed., 949.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b93-5\">The indictment describes the offense of which the prisoner was convicted, in the following words: \u201c That the defendant feloniously did forge, &amp;c., a certain instrument and writing, commonly called a certificate, the same being a certificate of the acknowledgment, by one Sarah J. Lyon, of a certain mortgage, the said mortgage being an instrument which, by law, might be recorded; which said false, forged and counterfeit certificate is in the words following,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b93-6\">The fault of the indictment in this particular is the omission of the statutory words, \u201c purporting to have been made by an \u2022officer duly authorized to make such certificate.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b93-7\">The omitted words are part of the statutory description of the offense, and their absence is fatal to the validity of the indictment. \u201cA verdict does nothing more than verify the fact charged in the indictment.\u201d <em>(State </em>v.

Without execution by delivery, the mortgage could no more have a legal existence (being a conveyance of real property), than could a deed under like circumstances; and any certificate of the character of the one in this case, indorsed upon an unexecuted mortgage, can have no lawful operation or legal effect to the end intended, and is, therefore, without that legal existence necessary to make it the subject of a forgery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-6\"><em>Third. </em>The indictment, while charging the certificate to be a forged certificate of acknowledgment, &amp;c., presents it as a true certificate of acknowledgment, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-7\">These are the words of the charging part of the indictment: \u201c That the defendant, with force and arms, feloniously did forge, &amp;c., a certain instrument in writing, commonly called a certificate; the same (not purporting to be, but) being a certificate of the acknowledgment, by one Sarah J. Lyon, of a certain mortgage, the said \u2022 mortgage being an instrument which, bylaw, might be recorded,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-8\">The charging allegation is, that the prisoner forged the \u201ccertificate ;\u201d but the \u201c descriptive averment \u201d \u2014 that part of the indictment which states the facts that constitute the character of the instrument, and which must control \u2014 presents it as the true certificate of the acknowledgment, by Sarah J. Lyon, of the execution of a certain mortgag\u00e9, &amp;c. There is in this, at least, an incongruity fatal to the indictment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-9\"><em>Fifth. </em>The indictment does not charge the defendant with the statutory offense of the forgery of a certificate, but with the forgery of \u201c a certain instrument and writing, commonly called a certificate, the same being a certificate of the acknowledgment,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b95-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>The case of <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Craven </em>(2 <em>East P. C., </em>601, 602), (with several analogous decisions, both in this country and England, confirmatory of the law pronounced in that case), shows, in another aspect, that the description of the instrument in this case does not fulfill the requirements of the statute. Craven was indicted under the English statute, which declares the stealing of any \u201cbank note\u201d to be a larceny, and the indictment charged that he stole- a certain \u201c note\", commonly called a bank note.\u201d The twelve judges on the case reserved held this to be an imperfect description, and said that the words, \u201ccommonly called a bank note,\u201d did not remedy the original insufficient description of the instrument.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b95-5\">So here the words, \u201c commonly called a certificate of acknowledgment,\u201d &amp;c., cannot remedy an original imperfect description. See same authorities as those to first point.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b95-6\"><em>Sixth. </em>The face of the certificate shows no venue or place of its execution, or in and for what county or city the commissioner was appointed, or had authority to take acknowledgments of the execution of deeds and mortgages; nor are these defects, or any of them, cured by any averments of such extrinsic facts as became necessary to be proved to supply the imperfections of the certificate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b95-7\">The statute provides that \u201c no commissioner of deeds shall take any acknowledgment of the execution of any conveyance out of the city or county in and for which he was appointed.\u201d (3 <em>R. S, 5th ed, </em>46.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b95-8\">\u201c An affidavit without a venue is a nullity, although sworn before a commissioner of deeds whose residence is mentioned in the jurat. It must indicate the county in which it was taken, or it will be void.\u201d <em>(Cook v. </em>Stoats, 18 <em>Barb.

Is not the one as important in the conveying of rights, as the other is in obtaining them ? Why should not the caution and certainty of both be equal ? Perjury could not be predicated of the one; why should forgery of the other?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-6\">It is confidently submitted, that this certificate would not be valid if true.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-7\">\u201c An instrument, to be the subject of an indictment for forgery, must be valid, if genuine, for the purpose for which it is made*\u201d <em>(People </em>v. Harrison, 8 <em>Barb. R., </em>568, <em>with authorities there cited.)</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-8\"><em>Seventh. </em>The indictment does not allege that the defendant forged the \u201c certificate\u201d with an intent to cheat and defraud.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-9\">The act upon which the intent to defraud is predicated, is the indorsing of the certificate upon the mortgage, after the forgery of it was complete. .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-10\">From a careful reading of the indictment, it is clear that the intent to defraud is not made to relate to the act of forging the certificate, but to the act of indorsing it upon the mortgage, after it was fabricated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-11\">The indictment treats the certificate as an independent and substantive instrument, entirely distinct from the mortgage, until connected with it by an averment that it was indorsed thereon; \u201c which certificate (then already forged) was indorsed upon the said mortgage, with intent,\u201d &amp;c. When or by whom the indorsement was made, is not pretended.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-12\"><em>Eighth, </em>The indictment charges that this forgery was committed after the defendant had been convicted and remitted of a previous felony. The verdict is: \u201cGuilty of forgery in the first degree.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-13\">This -verdict is not responsive to the charge in the indictment, which is forgery in the first degree as a second offense.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-14\">A verdict must respond to the charge supposed in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>indictment, or to one or more of the counts of the indictment, otherwise.it will be set aside.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b97-5\"><em>John H </em>Anthon, for the defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b97-7\">There is no bill of exceptions in this case, nor any complete record. All questions raised by the prisoner must therefore appear on the face of the indictment or the entry of judgment, which only are before the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b97-8\">I. The question therefore is, whether, upon any supposable proof, testimony or state of facts, the judgment pronounced could have been given upon the indictment returned; the presumption after verdict being that the testimony supported it, and proved everything that could be proved under the indictment. (1 <em>Greenl. Ev., </em>\u00a7 19; <em>Grah. Pr., art, </em>\u201c <em>Motion in </em>arr.;\u201d <em>Thompson </em>v. People, 3 <em>Park. Cr. R., 208; Waller </em>v. <em>State, </em>4 <em>Ark.

The omission of the words, \u201c purporting to have been made by an officer duly authorized to rpake such certificate,\u201d is wholly immaterial, and the mode of stating the forgery, aa a \u201ccertificate\u201d instead of \u201ca false certificate,\u201d or a \u201cpaper purporting to be a certificate,\" is correct. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rynders, </em>12 <em>Wend.

In all these cases, except the last, the indictments were identical in these respects with that under consideration, and the doctrine held is, that \u201c it is sufficient to allege that the defendant forged an instrument setting it out in <em>hcec verba, </em>with intent to defraud.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b97-10\">III. The same cases are conclusive upon the question raised by the fifth point for the defendant, \u201c a certain instrument and writing commonly called a certificate, the same being a certifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>cate, etc.,\u201d followed by the instrument in <em>hcec'verba, </em>is a good description.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-5\">In Craven\u2019s case, cited for the defense:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-6\"><em>a. </em>The note was not set out in Zicec <em>verba.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-7\"><em>b. . </em>The omission was of the word \u201cpromissory \u201d or \u201cbank,\u201d which were needed to show that the paper was the subject of larceny.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-8\"><em>c. </em>The words, \u201c the same being,\u201d were omitted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-9\">IY. Ho averment of the delivery of the mortgage was necessary, especially upon an indictment for the forgery and not the uttering. The delivery was merely evidence of fraudulent intent, and, as such, need not be alleged. It is sufficient if the court s\u00e9e that the instrument might be so used as to defraud. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Stearns, </em>21 <em>Wendt R., </em>409.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-10\">Y. In general, the rule is, that no more certainty is essential in an indictment, than will apprise' the defendant of the precise charge against him. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Powers, </em>3 <em>Seld.

R., </em>10 ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>3 <em>Denio R., </em>91; <em>Buller </em>v. <em>People, 4 Id., </em>68.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-11\">YI. If the certificate, in the form in which it appears in the indictment with the omission in the venue, would be void, then the conviction must be sustained because:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-12\">\u2022 <em>a. </em>The court must intend that the indictment and \"verdict were supported by appropriate proof (see cases under point I), and that the forgery charged consisted in the very act of making a certificate, originally complete, assume this appearance, that is, by a material erasure; and,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-13\"><em>b. </em>Such charge would be well stated by an indorsement, alleging the forgery of the entire instrument as it appeared after the erasure. <em>(Arch. Cr. Pl., </em>428; <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Teague, </em>2 <em>East R., </em>978, 979 ; <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Atkinson, </em>3 <em>Car. &amp; Payne, </em>699 ; <em>Whar. Cr.

Holmes, cited above; State </em>v. <em>Flye, </em>26 <em>Maine R., </em>312.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-14\">YII. If the omission in the venue of the certificate originally existed, it could have been supplied by parol proof that the acknowledgment was in fact taken in the place for which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>the commissioner was appointed, and the court must intend that it was so supplied, and that the forgery charged consisted of some other material erasure or alteration. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fredway, </em>3 <em>Barb. R., </em>470; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Gumaer, 2 Cow. R., </em>552.) In the last case the name of the State was omitted. <em>(R. </em>v. <em>Birkett, Buss, and Ry., </em>86.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-5\">Yin. If the certificate as it appears, in the indictment is a valid certificate, then the conviction must of course be sustained. \u00bb .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-6\">IX. The statute does not require any place of execution to be noted on the certificate. The only law on the subject prohibits a commissioner from actually taking an acknowledgment out of the place of his appointment. It is directory merely, and does not make the instrument void, and instruments not complying with directory statutes, are subjects of forgery. <em>(Lynch </em>v. <em>Livingston, </em>2 <em>Seld. R., </em>422 ; <em>Bishop Cr. Law, </em>\u00a7 443; <em>Barb. Cr. Law, </em>\u00a7 117; <em>Roscoe's Cr. Ev., </em>\u00a7 291; <em>R. </em>v. Lyon, <em>Russ, and Ryan, </em>255; 2 <em>Buss, on Cr., </em>350, <em>and cases cited; People </em>v. <em>Rathbone, </em>21 <em>Wend. R., </em>509.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-7\">X. The intent to defraud is well stated, and must, by any reasonable construction of the language, be referred to the forgery as well as to the contemporaneous and identical act of indorsing the same forged certificate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-8\">XI. On indictment for forgery in the first degree as a second offense, the jury can find the prisoner guilty of forgery in the first degree, and negative the previous conviction, and so they did in this case. The form of their verdict does not appear and is not called for, but the sentence is for forgery in the first degree. <em>(Palmer </em>v. <em>People, </em>5 <em>Hill R., </em>427.)</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b99-9\"><em>By the Court, </em>Sutherland, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqp\">There is no bill of exceptions in this case, nor any complete record.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">The only questions in this case relate to the sufficiency of the indictment, and to the form of the verdict and consequent judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-11\">The indictment, if it charges any crime, charges forgery in the first degree, after conviction of a previous felony. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>verdict and sentence were for forgery in the first degree, without noticing the alleged conviction of a previous felony. As we have nothing but the indictment and entry of judgment before us, we cannot say whether there was on the trial any proof of a previous conviction; but whether there was, or was not, the form of the verdict was well enough. Certainly the prisoner cannot complain that the jury did not take into consideration his previous conviction, if proved;</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">The only question in the case, then, is, whether the indictment charges the offense of forgery in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">The allegation in the indictment is, that the prisoner feloniously did forge, &amp;c., <em>\u201c </em>a certain instrument in writing, commonly called a certificate, the same being a certificate of the acknowledgment, by one Sarah J. Lyon, of a certain mortgage, the said mortgage being an instrument which, by law, might be recorded,\u201d setting forth the certificate in <em>hcee verba.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">The certificate, as thus set forth, purports t\u2019o have been made by Abram W. Kennedy, commissioner of deeds, but it has no venue, that is, the acknowledgment which it certifies does not by it purport to have been taken in any particular county or city of the State, and there is nothing on its face to show of what county or city Kennedy was a commissioner. The certificate commences,</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">\u201c <em>State of New York, </em>County, ss: \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">The name of the county being omitted, otherwise it is in the usual form.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">The statute (3 <em>B. S., 5th eel, </em>949), declares the forging, &amp;c., of \u201c any certificate or indorsement of the acknowledgment, by any person, of any deed or other instrument which, by law, may be recorded, <em>made, or purporting </em>to have been made, by any officer <em>duly authorized </em>to make such certificate or indorsement,\u201d forgery in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-11\">The indictment in this cas\u00e9 does not allege that the certificate was made, or (in words) that it purports to have been made by an officer authorized to take the acknowledgment or to make the certificate, but as the certificate is set forth in <em>hcec verba, </em>the indictment does, in effect, and sufficiently allege, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>that it purports, whatever the certificate as set forth in the indictment purports. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mynders, </em>12 <em>Wend. R., </em>427; <em>People </em>v. <em>Stearns, 21 Wend. R., </em>409.)</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">The question, then, is whether the certificate, as thus set forth, does purport to have been made <em>by an officer duly authorized to malee it.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">It purports to have been made by Abram W. Kennedy, as a commissioner of deeds, and a commissioner of deeds is an officer authorized to take and to certify the acknowledgment. of deeds, &amp;c.; but they are local officers, appointed for particular counties and cities, and the statute declares that a commissioner of deeds shall, not take such acknowledgments out of the city or county for which he was appointed. (3 <em>R. S., </em>46, \u00a7 4, <em>5th ed.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">The question is not whether the certificate, as set forth in the indictment, purports to have been made by a commissioner of deeds, but whether it purports to have been made by a commissioner of deeds authorized to make <em>it, </em>or to take the acknowledgment which <em>it </em>certifies. It certainly does not, for it does not purport to have been made, or that the acknowledgment was taken, in any particular county or city of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">The authority or jurisdiction of the officer depending on locality, it would seem to follow that the certificate, as set forth, cannot purport that Kennedy was authorized to make it, or take the acknowledgment in the absence of any venue, or of anything on its face to indicate in what county or city it was made, or the acknowledgment taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">It hap been held that an affidavit without a venue is a nullity. (C<em>ook </em>v. <em>Staats, 18 Barb. R., </em>407; <em>Lane &amp; Laing </em>v. <em>Morse &amp; Studley, </em>6 <em>How. Pr. R., </em>395.)</p>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">No crime, then, is charged in the indictment, for there is in it no allegation, formally or otherwise, as to one of the circumstances constituting the statutory definition of the crime, to wit, the authority of the officer. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Allen, 5 Denio R., </em>76.) We cannot suppose that any possible evidence on the trial could have remedied this defect in the indictment, for no pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>sible evidence could make the certificate, as set forth in the indictment, purport more or differently from what it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">We are bound to presume that the evidence verified the indictment, but we have no right to presume that it verified facts or circumstances entering into the definition of the crime not alleged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">My conclusion is, that the judgment of the General Sessions should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
