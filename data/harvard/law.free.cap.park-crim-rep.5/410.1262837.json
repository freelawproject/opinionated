New York General Term,</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AR5\">February, 1863.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b410-9\">Ingraham, <em>Gierke </em>and Barnard, Justices.</p>\n<parties data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"parties\" id=\"b410-10\">Albert Uhl, plaintiff in error, <em>v. </em>The People, defendants in error.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b410-12\">On a trial for murder, the court charged the jury that if they found that the prisoner was justified in defending himself, and carried that protection further than was necessary for his defense, then he was guilty of manslaughter in some one of the four degrees. This, being unexplained by any other part of the charge, was held to be erroneous, inasmuch as it denied to the prisoner the right the law gave him to slay Ms assailant, if he was attacked under such circumstances as furnished him reasonable ground for apprehending a design to take Ms life, or to do him some great personal injury.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-13\">The plaintiff in error was tried in the Hew York General Sessions in December, 1861, for the murder of one Lee, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>the 5th of August of that year. The prisoner was barkeeper for Louis Bleyart, at a liquor store kept by him. on the corner of West and Morris streets, in the city of ISTew York. The deceased, in company with several others, came to Bleyart\u2019s place, and had several glasses of liquor, when a difficulty arose in regard to paying for them. During the fracas the prisoner struck one of the party with a club; after this the deceased seized a large pewter pitcher, filled with water and ice, and was in the act of striking the prisoner with it, when the latter drew a pistol and shot the deceased, who soon after died.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-5\">It was proved on the trial that the pitcher was a deadly weapon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-6\">It was contended that the prisoner acted in self defense, and that the homicide of the deceased was justifiable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-7\">Among other things, the court below charged the jury that if they found that the prisoner was justified in defending himself, and carried that protection farther than was necessary for his defense, then he is guilty of manslaughter in some of the four degrees.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-8\">To this the prisoner\u2019s counsel excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-9\">The prisoner Was found guilty, and after judgment a writ of error was brought to remove the record to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b411-10\"><em>Henry L. </em>Clinton, for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b411-11\">The court below erred in charging, \u201cIf you (the jury) find that the prisoner was justified in defending himself, and carried that protection further than was necessary for his defense, then he is guilty of manslaughter in some of the four degrees.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b411-12\"><em>William </em>Kelly, a witness for the prosecution, testified that \u201c Lee (deceased) went over to the bar, and was in the act of taking the pitcher, <em>and hitting defendant, when defendant shot him\"</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b411-13\">Another <em>William Kelly, </em>also a witness for the prosecution, \u2022 testified that he was an eye witness to the homicide, and that \u201c to the best of my (his) opinion, he (deceased) 1 hove \u2019 the pitcher.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b412-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>It should be borne in mind that the principal ground of defense was, that the homicide was justifiable, inasmuch as the prisoner had reasonable ground to believe himself in danger of loss of life, or, in the language of the statute, \u201c of great personal injury.\u201d (3 <em>R. S., </em>939, \u00a73, <em>sub. </em>2, <em>5th ed.) </em>The prisoner was assailed by the deceased with a deadly weapon. Dr. Morton testified that the pitcher was a deadly weapon, and \u201cit would be likely to kill.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b412-5\">In <em>Shorter </em>v. <em>The People </em>(2 <em>Comst., </em>193), it was held by the Court of Appeals, that where one is assailed under such circumstances as to furnish him reasonable ground for apprehending a design to take away his life, or do him some great bodily harm, the law gives the party assailed the right, in his own defense, to slay his assailant, even though, in the language of Justice Bronson <em>(p. </em>197), \u201cit may afterwards turn out that the appearances were false, and there was, <em>in fact, </em>neither design to do him serious injury, nor danger that it would be done.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b412-6\">This doctrine was reaffirmed by the Court of Appeals, in the case of <em>The People </em>v. <em>Sullivan </em>(3 <em>Seld. R., </em>396). The court, per Johnson, J., say: \u201c It was contended on the argument that this charge required the jury to find whether imminent danger <em>actually </em>existed, and not merely whether Sullivan <em>had reasonable ground </em>to believe that it existed. If this construction of the charge was correct, the case of <em>Shorter </em>v. <em>The People </em>(2 <em>Comst. R., </em>197), <em>would show it to be erroneous ; </em>but we do not so understand the charge.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b412-7\">It will be perceived that the test is, whether the prisoner \u201c <em>had reasonable ground to believe </em>\u201d himself in danger of great bodily harm, or loss of life, and not whether such \u201c danger <em>actually </em>existed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b412-8\">The charge of the city judge, in the case at bar, was directly in violation of the two decisions of the Court of Appeals above cited. The city judge charged, that if the prisoner \u201c carried that protection (self defense) <em>farther than was necessary </em>for his defense, then he is (was) guilty of manslaughter,\u201d thus charging that unless the danger \u201c <em>actually </em>\u201d existed, the prisoner should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>be deprived of his defense, which, if sustained by the evidence (and that was a question of fact for the jury), would entitle him to an acquittal.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b413-5\"><em>A. Oakey Sail </em>(District Attorney), for defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b413-6\">The theory of the defense being that the homicide was committed in self defense, the charges of the judge conformed to the law relating to justifiable homicide, as established by the Court of Appeals. <em>(People </em>v. Shorter, 2 <em>N. Y. R. </em>[2 <em>Comst.], </em>193; <em>Whart. Cr. </em>L., \u00a7\u00a7 1020, 1021.)</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b413-7\"><em>By the Court, </em>Clerks, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3P\">The exceptions taken by the prisoner\u2019s counsel to .the evidence are untenable; but I think the exception to the judge\u2019s charge is well taken. The language of the charge is: \u201cIf you (the jury) find that the prisoner was justified in defending himself, and carried that protection further than was necessary for his defense, then he is guilty of manslaughter in some (meaning some one) of the four degrees.\u201d This is a positive and unqualified instruction to the jury on a relevant and important point. I do not find it limited, qualified or explained in any other part of the charge. It tells the jury, in substance, that they have to determine whether, at the time of the fatal blow, the prisoner carried the means of defending himself further than was necessary for his defense. But this is not the question for the jury, but whether the prisoner was assailed under such circumstances as to furnish him reasonable ground for apprehending a design to take away his life. <em>(See Shorter </em>v. <em>The People, 2 Comst. R., </em>193.) The question, I repeat, is, whether the prisoner had reasonable ground to believe himself in danger of great bodily harm or loss of life, and not whether such danger actually existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">Barnard, J., dissented.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">Judgment reversed, and new- trial ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
