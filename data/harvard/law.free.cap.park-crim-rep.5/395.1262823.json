Y. R., </em>405), that a charge precisely like the one excepted to in the case at bar, was erroneous, and granted a new trial on that ground.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b396-13\">In <em>Williams </em>v. <em>The </em>People, the court below charged the jury \u201c that if they found that the defendant stole from the person of Eliza Denike the sum of seven dollars, they might render a verdict of guilty under the indictment.\u201d <em>(p. </em>406.) The charge of the court below, in the case at bar, was in the very words of the charge in the case of <em>Williams </em>v. <em>The People, </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>only difference being that the sum specified in the one case was seven dollars, and the other'was eighteen dollars. This amount however, is immaterial, as long as the sum in neither case was over twenty-five dollars, that being the dividing line between petit and grand larceny. In <em>Williams' </em>case, the court held that the words, \u201c may punish as for grand larceny,\u201d did not mean \u201c <em>shall </em>punish as for grand larceny,\u201d but that it was discretionary with the court whether to punish as for a <em>grand </em>or <em>petit </em>larceny. Upon conviction for grand larceny, the sentence could not be for less than two years\u2019 imprisonment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-5\">The only statutory provisions relative to the punishment for grand larceny, whether from the person or otherwise, are the following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-6\">\u201c Every person who shall be convicted of the felonious taking and carrying away the personal property of another, of the value of more than twenty-five dollars, shall be adjudged guilty of grand larceny, and <em>shall </em>be imprisoned in a State prison for a term not exceeding five years.\u201d (3 <em>R. S., </em>958, \u00a7 65, <em>5th ed.)</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-7\">\u201c Whenever any person, under the age of twenty-one, and above the age of sixteen years, shall be convicted of an offense punishable with imprisonment in the State prison, in either of the judicial districts of the State, having a penitentiary within said judicial district, the court, before which such conviction shall be had, may, in its discretion, sentence the person so convicted to imprisonment in the penitentiary situated in that judicial district.\u201d <em>(Laws </em>1856, <em>p. </em>251, \u00a7 1.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-8\">It will be perceived that upon the general verdict of guilty, on the indictment in the case at bar, the court below was compelled to sentence the prisoner for not less than two nor more than five years\u2019 imprisonment. The law of 1856 did not lessen the <em>term, </em>but merely gave the court power, in its discretion, to select a different <em>place </em>of imprisonment when the convicts were between certain ages. The conviction, under the charge of the court for <em>grand </em>larceny from the person, instead of <em>petit </em>larceny from the person, was fatal to the legal right of the prisoner in this case, as in the case of <em>Williams </em>v. <em>The People </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number><em>'{supra). </em>From the fact that Ehodihan was sentenced to \u201cthe penitentiary of the city of New York for the term of two years,\u201d instead of the State prison, the presumption is, that the court below ascertained that he was between the ages of sixteen and twenty-one; but this consideration does not take away from the prisoner his legal right, specifically adjudicated in the case of <em>Williams </em>v. <em>The </em>People, to have a verdict of <em>petit </em>larceny from the person; because, upon the rendition of such a verdict the court might, in its discretion, award to him only the punishment prescribed by statute for one \u201cadjudged guilty of petit larceny,\u201d which is, that he \u201c shall be punished by imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding six months, or by a fine not exceeding one hundred dollars, or by both such fine and imprisonment. (3 <em>B. 8.. </em>971, \u00a7 1, <em>5th ed.)</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-5\">In <em>Williams </em>v. <em>The People </em>(24 <em>N. Y. R., </em>409), Denio, J., in delivering the unanimous opinion of the court, says: \u201cIf the amount' stolen had b\u00e9en truly stated in the verdict, the judgment might, notwithstanding the statute, have been that annexed by law to a simple petit larceny. As the judge who tried the issue was also to pronounce the sentence, it is altogether improbable that the error in form, which I suppose to have been committed, has at all prejudiced the defendant. But it is very plain to my mind that an accused person has <em>an absolute right </em>to have such instructions on matters of law-given to the jury as will shield him from a verdict for a different and. higher offense from that of which he is proved guilty.\u201d Upon this precise point the Court of Appeals unanimously granted a new trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-6\">\u2022 In the case at\" bar, Ehodihan was proved guilty of one offense, and the court, by charging the jury that they \u201cmight render a verdict of guilty under the indictment,\u201d charged them in substance that they might render \u201c a verdict for a different and higher offense from that of which he was proved guilty.\u201d This was clear and unmistakable error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b398-7\"><em>A. Oakey Hall </em>(District Attorney); for the People.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-8\">The record shows.that'the plaintiff in error was convicted, hot by a general verdict of guilty \u201cof the <em>felony </em>above <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>charged in the form aforesaid, as by the indictment aforesaid is above alleged against her \u201d (which was the record in the <em>Williams case), </em>but was \u201c in due form of law tried and convicted by a jury on an indictment for larceny from the person of one Sarah Sydney, the personal property of one John J. Sydney.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-5\">Therefore, the conviction of this plaintiff in error was one in accordance with the statute, and is distinguishable from the Williams precedent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-6\">1. The Court of Appeals, in the <em>Williams case (pp. </em>408, 409), emphasize the \u201c <em>general verdict </em>of guilty \u201d as the matter injuring the prisoner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-7\">And that court so disposed of the questions of unconstitutionality and petit larceny that they cannot be argued now.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-8\">2. In the error book before the court the evidence of the sums stolen, in connection with the verdict, shows conclusively that it was not a conviction for <em>grand </em>larceny, but for petit larceny from the person.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-9\"><em>a. </em>True, the record says simply \u201c larceny; \u201d but it adds, \u201c from the person.\u201d How, there can be <em>grand </em>larceny from the person <em>only </em>when it is stolen in the night time (\u00a7 65, <em>R. S., on Larceny). </em>And the indictment does not allege such a season for the larceny.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-10\">\u2022 Thus, a verdict' guilty of larceny from the person would point to the \u201c petit \u201d species of larceny from the person.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-11\">Unless the adjective grand is prefixed, the presumption is <em>(in favorem libertatis) </em>that the word larceny means \u201c petit.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-12\">3. The direction of the court in <em>Williams\u2019 case </em>was that they might render a <em>general </em>verdict of guilty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-13\"><em>a. </em>The Court of Appeals, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Guenther </em>(24 <em>N. Y. R., </em>100), have shown a liberal disposition in construing a verdict, when the record and the evidence together become explanatory of the verdict</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-14\"><em>b. </em>Although the bill of exceptions interpolates \u201c verdict of guilty on the whole indictment,\u201d nevertheless it cannot contradict the record, which states the verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-15\">4. The conviction should be affirmed, and, if the prisoner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>relies upon the entry of verdict as in bill of exceptions, and the court think it material, he should be put to allegation of diminution of record, and again bring the point before the court.</summary>\n<footnote data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b395-12\"> Note. \u2014 The 33d section of chap. 608 of 1860, under which this indictment was found, was applicable only to the city of New York; but, by the 2d section of chap. 374 of 1862, the same law is made applicable to the entire State.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b400-5\"><em>By the </em>court, Clerke, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_b\">I confess I am unable to distinguish this case from that of <em>The People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(24 <em>N. Y. R., </em>405). In that case, the counsel for the defendant asked the court to charge the jury that they could only find the defendant guilty of petit larceny; but the court refused, and the. counsel excepted. The court thereupon charged the jury that, if they found that the defendant stole from the person of Eliza Denike the sum of seven dollars, they might render a general .verdict of guilty under the indictment; to which the defendant\u2019s counsel excepted. In this case, in precisely the same words,.the counsel for the defendant asked the court to charge' the jury that they could only find the defendant guilty of petit larceny; the court refused, and the defendant\u2019s counsel excepted. The court then charged the jury that, if they found the defendant stole from the person of Sarah Sidney the sum of eighteen dollars, they might render' a verdict of guilty under the indictment; to which the counsel for the defendant excepted. The only difference between this part of the charge in this case and the corresponding part in the <em>Williams </em>case, is the omission of the word \u201cgeneral\u2019\u2019 before the word verdict in the former; which, of course, is an unessential difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">The counsel for the People, however, insists that, by the record, the conviction is essentially different in this case from that in the <em>Williams case. </em>In this case the record says that the defendant was, in due form of law, tried and convicted by a jury on an indictment for larceny from the person of one Sarah Sidney, &amp;c.; whereas, in the <em>Williams case, </em>\u201cthe defendant was found guilty of the felony above charged, in the form aforesaid, as by the indictment aforesaid is above alleged against Mm.\u201d The words are somewhat different; but I cannot find any essential difference in these records of conviction. In both cases, the indictments charge the defendants with crimes constituting grand larceny\u2014in the one case of stealing property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>exceeding the value of twenty-five dollars from the person of Sarah Sidney; in the other, of stealing property exceeding that amount from the person of Eliza Denyke. The convicion, then, as it appears on the record, is a conviction in both cases of grand larceny; which is not the crime of which either was actually guilty, although made liable by the act of 1860 to the punishment attached to grand larceny. Although liable to this punishment, still it is settled by the Court of Appeals that the court is not compelled to award it; but the judgment might, notwithstanding the statute, have been that annexed by law to -a simple petit larceny, if the court deemed such a mitigation of punishment advisable. As the conviction, however, is recorded in this case, the court had no discretion as to the period of the punishment. This conviction, under charge of the court, for grand larceny from the person, instead of petit larceny from the person, compromised the rights of the defendant, as the conviction of a general verdict of guilty compromised the right of Williams in the case to which I have adverted.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
