And if it is an offense which is created by statute, it has been held that the terms of the statute should be pursued in describing it; and for this reason, that by using other words than those which the legislature has used, it may happen that the offense will not be sufficiently described. This was held in <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Remnant </em>(5 <em>Term R., </em>169; 2 <em>Leach R., </em>583), and is regarded as authority here.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-9\">And so a commitment was held to be insufficient where it alleged that the prisoner had, \u201c with force and arms, made an assault on the prosecutor, with intent feloniously to steal and carry away from the person,\u201d &amp;c., because the description did not charge him with any offense within the statute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-10\">And so in this case. If the accused has committed any crime, it is probably that which is defined in chapter 508, section 33 of the act passed April 17, 1860: \u201cWhenever any larceny shall be committed in said city and county,, by stealing, taking and carrying away from the person of another, the offender maybe punished as for grand larceny,\u201d &amp;c. And the language of this section should have been used, that we could have arrived at a certainty as to whether this was or was not the crime committed, as the other section of the act refers to where the attempt is made to steal as a pickpocket, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-11\">The commitment should also show whether the accused is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>charged with a felony or a misdemeanor. If it be for a felony, it must contain the special nature of the felony. (2 <em>Wils. B., </em>158, 159 ; 2 <em>Hale B., </em>122.) The crime should be specifically set forth for another reason, that if the party is brought before the court upon a <em>habeas corpus, </em>and no specific crime is alleged, or is so loosely set forth that the court cannot judge whether there is any reasonable ground for imprisonment, the party will be discharged. (2 <em>Hawk. P. G., ch. </em>16, \u00a716; 1 <em>Ghit. Gr. L., </em>111.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b478-5\">It appears to me, that upon these proceedings, which are brought in compliance ,of article 2, page 883, 3 Revised Statutes, 5th edition, on <em>habeas corpus, </em>that I am bound, under this commitment, to discharge the prisoner from custody, though 1 am aware that it has been held in 5 <em>Cow. B., </em>39, and in <em>East B., </em>157, that if the commitment be defective, the Supreme Court will discharge the prisoner <em>pro forma, </em>and remand him upon a special rule; yet I am convinced that this is a mere matter of discretion, and the court will look into all the facts of -the case; and no person should be unlawfully deprived of liberty through the carelessness, ignorance or design of committing magistrates. For these reasons the prisoner must be discharged in this case, and an order entered accordingly.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b478-6\"><em>A.

The writ should be quashed for want of jurisdiction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b478-8\">' 1. The city judge at Chambers has no power to allow a writ of <em>habeas corpus.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b478-9\"><em>a. </em>It is true the law of his official creation confers upon him all the <em>judicial </em>powers vested by law in the recorder. <em>(Laws of </em>1850, <em>ch. </em>205; <em>and </em>1 <em>R. S., 5th ed., </em>397.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b478-10\"><em>b. </em>The' recorder exercised the duties of a <em>habeas corpus </em>commissioner, because, 1st (by 2 <em>R. S., original paging, </em>564, <em>and </em>\u00a7 37 <em>of the habeas corpus provisions), application </em>for the writ could be made to any officer authorized to perform the duties of a justice .of the Supreme Court at. Chambers; and 2d <em>(by </em>2 <em>R. S., original paging, </em>281, \u00a735 <em>of General Provisions concerning certain judicial officers), </em>every recorder of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>city was authorized, \u201c by virtue of his office, to be a Supreme Court commissioner; \u201d and 3d, a Supreme Court commissioner was given the duties of a \u2022 Supreme Court justice at Chambers. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 20.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b479-5\">After July, 1847, the office of Supreme Court commissioner was abolished by the Constitution, .art. 14, \u00a7 8.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b479-6\">The power, as a <em>habeas carpus </em>commissioner, of responding to the application for the writ, probably survived to the recorder. Or, in the language in <em>Renard </em>v. <em>Hargous </em>(2 <em>Kern. R., </em>263), \u201cthe power was <em>continued.'\" </em>But no analogy can connect the reasoning in the last named case, with an argument for the power claimed by the city judge, because, in the act reviewed by the court in <em>Renard </em>v. <em>Hargous, </em>the words, <em>\u201cperform the same duties,\" </em>are additional to these, viz., \u201c possess the same powers.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b479-7\">Moreover, in the statute affecting the case at bar, the noun \u201c powers \u201d is limited by the adjective <em>\u201cjudicial.\" (See this topic, examined in the report, \u201cIn re Powers of County </em>Judges3 <em>How. Pr. R., p. </em>32.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b479-8\">c. But the issuing of a writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>by an officer at Chambers is never a judicial act; and if it were sometimes one, nevertheless, the phrase <em>judicial powers, </em>in the act of 1850, does not include such issue by the city judge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b479-9\">1. The issue of a writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>by a judge at Chambers is not a judicial, but a ministerial <em>act. (Per </em>Kent, <em>Yates </em>v. <em>Lansing, </em>5 <em>Johns. R., </em>282.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b479-10\">\u201c The writ <em>cannot be denied </em>where the granting of it is made a matter of imperative duty by the statute.\u201d <em>(Hurd on Habeas Corpus, </em>225.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b479-11\">Kent, in his Commentaries, draws the same distinction between act ministerial, as of <em>Chambers, </em>and act judicial, as of <em>banco, </em>consequent upon the extension by the Revised Statutes of the penal provision from <em>Chambers' </em>refusal which previously exist\u00e9d, to a <em>court </em>refusal. (1 <em>Kent, </em>634; <em>and Hurd, p. </em>226.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b479-12\">2. The phrase \u201cjudicial powers,\u201d in the act of 1850, related to the powers of the recorder as judge of General or Special Sessions, and as a magistrate <em>quoad </em>justice of the peace.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number><em>Bouvier </em>defines \u201cjudicial power\u201d as \u201c authority vested in the <em>judges.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-5\">A judge is an officer of a court during court hours.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-6\">The <em>habeas corpus </em>statute uses both of these words, viz., judge and <em>officer.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-7\"><em>\u25a0 </em>When the recorder allows a writ, he allows it as an <em>officer, </em>and not as a judge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-8\">In the familiar case of <em>Barry </em>v. <em>Mercein </em>(8 <em>Paige, </em>55), the chancellor says: \u201c It is not material to inquire whether the chancellor, in allowing the writ of <em>habeas corpus, </em>acts <em>as a mere commissioner </em>under the statute, or as a court proceeding, etc., etc,\u201d thus illustrating the distinction between officer and judge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-9\">Section 102 of the <em>habeas corpus </em>provisions draws distinction between judge, commissioner, and officer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-10\">See, also, section 4 of article 4 of chapter 815, Laws of 1844, respecting bail on <em>habeas corpus </em>in Hew York city.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-11\">It may be argued that the fourth section of the act of 1850 negatives the idea that the powers of the city judge are limited merely to the duties of the recorder as <em>&amp; judge of </em>courts, because-that section provides office accommodations for his attendance at all reasonable hours for the transaction of <em>business, </em>except when engaged in holding court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-12\">That argument I answer thus: If the issuing of a writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>was the only possible business which the city judge could transact out of court, then the argument now met might, by implication, arise. But the city judge, as <em>judge, </em>must, concurrently with the recorder, have chambers at which to hear complaints as examining magistrate; to entertain applications for stays of proceedings on bills of exceptions; to settle bills of exceptions on hearing; to settle interrogatories, etc., etc., etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-13\">And it was for the purpose of transacting the above species of business that he required Chambers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-14\">II. If the city judge had jurisdiction under the writ, he erred in holding the commitment defective.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-15\">1. The commitment showed that an examination was pending on charge of statutory crime, entitled larceny from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>person, and \u201c stated with reasonable certainty.\u201d <em>(Bac. Abr., tit. Commitment M)</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-5\">2. The paper was what is best known in criminal law as a <em>remand, </em>as distinguished from a <em>mittimus. </em>(1 <em>Archb. Cr. Pl., </em>36\u201441, <em>Waterman's ed.)</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-6\">3.

One, whether the city judge has power to issue the writ of <em>habeas corpus, </em>and the other whether, if he has that power, he has made a correct decision in discharging the prisoner.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-12\">The power depends upon the construction to be given to the words \u201cjudicial powers,\u201d contained in the act of 1850, creating the office of city judge. The portion of the act which confers on the city judge his powers and defines his duties is as follows: \u201c All <em>judicial </em>powers vested by law in the recorder of the city of Hew York, are hereby conferred on such city judge, and said city judge shall, concurrently with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>said recorder, perform and discharge all judicial duties imposed on such recorder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">How, the only power which the recorder has to issue a <em>habeas corpus </em>is derived from the statute making him a Supreme Court commissioner. (2 <em>R. S., p. </em>281, \u00a7 35.) By 2 Revised Statutes <em>(p. </em>281, \u00a7 20), a Supreme Court commissioner had the duties of a justice of' the Supreme Court at Chambers, under certain limitations, which do not affect this question. By the <em>habeas corpus </em>provisions, application for the writ might be made to any officer authorized to perform the duties of a justice of the Supreme Court at Chambers. (2 <em>R. S., p. </em>564, \u00a7 37.) Shortly, thus: Any officer authorized to perform the duties of a justice of. the Supreme Court at Chambers might issue the writ; a Supreme Court commissioner was authorized to perform such duties; the recorder was a Supreme Court commissioner, and, by virtue of being such, might issue the writ. It follows that the power and authority of the recorder is precisely that of a Supreme Court judge at Chambers.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">It will now be considered whether there is any distinction between the term \u201c Chatnbers,\u201d and the term \u201c vacation.\u201d They are, in fact, convertible terms. Everything that can be done at Chambers can be done in vacation; and, on the other hand, everything that can be done in vacation can be done at Chambers. There can be no distinction made where the powers and duties are identically the same. The power of the recorder to issue a <em>habeas corpus </em>is, consequently, the same as that of a Supreme Court judge in vacation.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">In the year 1810, Chief Justice Kent, in the case of <em>Yates </em>v. <em>Lansing </em>(5 <em>Johns. R., </em>282), enunciated the doctrine that the allowance of the writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>in vacation is not a judicial act, but a ministerial one. If this doctrine is sound, it disposes of the case. Chief Justice Kent, at the time he enunciated the doctrine, had in view that one of the <em>habeas corpus </em>provisions which imposed a penalty for refusing to issue the writ; and he appears to base the doctrine on the principle that when the statute imposes the performance of an act in favor of a party upon a petition being presented drawn in conform<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>ity with specific directions contained in the statute itself, and prescribes a penalty in \u00abfavor of the party for a refusal to perform the act, then the act to be done is ministerial and not judicial. It is the very nature of a judicial power that those in whom it may be vested shall decide and act according to their.honest and fair judgment without-being liable to suitors or private parties for any error in their judgment; thus giving them free and uncontrolled exercise of judgment. If, consequently, in the exercise of a judicial power, they refuse to perform an act,.or commit any error in its performance, they are completely protected from being called to account by a suitor or private party. If the penalty given by the <em>habeas corpus </em>act was only to attach in cases where the writ was refused when it was legally applied for in the judgment of the officer to whom the application should be made, then the power .to issue the writ might be a judicial one; since then there \u2022would be no restriction on the exercise of the officer\u2019s judgment. But the provision would not then answer the end intended, as there could not, in any case, be a recovery of the penalty. The penalty, however, is imposed for refusing to grant the writ when legally applied for. If, then, the officer should make a mistake as to the writ being legally applied for, he would be liable to the penalty, even though the mistake were honestly made. The statute, in order to protect the officer, has clearly defined the prerequisites in order to obtain the writ. It prescribes \u2022 a petition, and defines with particularity its contents, and prescribes what persons are prohibited from prosecuting the writ, and then declares that -the writ shall be granted unless it appears from the petition or the documents accompanying it that the party applying is among those prohibited from prosecuting.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The provisions of the statute are so framed as to render it scarcely within the bounds of possibility that the officer could make any mistake as to whether the prerequisites had been complied with; and then to make him liable, in all cases, to the penalty for a refusal to issue the writ, unless he could, when sued, make it appear, to the satisfaction of the court before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>which, the case should be tried, that the writ had not been legally applied for. The provisions of the act thus deprive the officer of that free exercise of judgment which is an essential to a judicial power. The power in question must necessarily be ministerial. True, there is a species of judgment required in - seeing whether the petition contains the matters prescribed by the statute. But it is the same species of judgment which almost every ministerial power calls for. It is the same kind of judgment which the register of deeds is required to exercise in ascertaining whether an acknowledgment is in conformity with the statute. It will scarcely be contended that the duty imposed on the register, of seeing that every conveyance has been duly proved or acknowledged, vests in him a judicial power.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">But this species of judgment is not that free and untrammeled exercise of judgment which appertains and is essential to a judicial power. Nor does the fact that judges and courts are empowered to issue the writ necessarily make it a judicial power; for there can be no doubt that the performance of an act, clearly ministerial in itself, may be imposed on a judge. The fact that a judge is selected as the minister to perform a ministerial act cannot change the nature of the act: that will remain the same as if a coroner or constable had been selected. There is no reason for dissenting from the principle laid down by Chief Justice Kent.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Having thus come to the conclusion that the power of the recorder to issue a <em>habeas corpus </em>is ministerial, it follows that it does not pass to the city judge under the term \u201cjudicial .powers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">Upon the other question, the commitment is in the form sanctioned by authority, and is, on principle, amply sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">The discharge must be vacated, and the prisoner remanded on the temporary commitment.</p>\n<author id=\"Amt4\">Clerke, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AFT\">The act of 1850 <em>(Laws of </em>1850, <em>p. </em>388, \u00a7 3), creating the office of city judge in the city and county of New York, confers upon this officer all judicial powers vested by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>law in the recorder of the city of New York; \u201cand,\u201d it proceeds to say, \u201cthe said city judge shall, concurrently with said recorder, perform and discharge all <em>judicial </em>duties imposed upon said recorder.\u201d I will not now inquire whether this act confers upon the city judge any other judicial powers than those belonging to the Court of General and Special Sessions, such as \u25a0 the power to hold a Court of Common Pleas, &amp;c. But, of course, there can be no question that the city judge shares no other powers with the recorder than those which are, in the strictest sense of the term, judicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Is the power to issue a writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>to inquire into the cause of a person\u2019s commitment, detention or restraint of liberty, a judicial power? Undoubtedly, it is a power which is intimately connected with the administration of justice, and .so are all the various powers possessed and exercised by the numerous officers of every court of justice. The issuing of many writs and processes is vested in clerks and prothonotaries; and the power is purely ministerial. No power is judicial that does not imply discretion\u2014the right to grant or refuse, according to what the officer deems right or just, and in conformity to the laws of the land. But the writ of <em>habeas </em>corpus, whether applied for in or out of court, has now become a writ of right; and, \u201cif any court or officer, authorized to grant writs of <em>habeas </em>corpus, shall refuse to grant such writ, when legally applied for, every member of such court who shall have assented to such refusal, and every officer, shall severally forfeit to the party aggrieved one thousand dollars.\u201d (3 <em>R. S., 5th ed., p. </em>885, \u00a7 46.) As the law stood before the revision of 1830, when the application was made to the court, the members were not liable to this penalty: it attached only to those judges who refused to grant the writ in \u201c the vacation time.\u201d (1 <em>R. L., p. </em>355, \u00a7 4.) Consequently, in <em>Yates </em>v. <em>Lansing </em>(5 <em>Johns. R., </em>282), the court decided that, when the application was made to the court,_ they acted judicially, and were not liable to the penalty; but when it was made to a judge in vacation, or out of court, he acted ministerially, and was liable. Kent, Ch. J., says: \u201cThe penalty to which the chancellor and judges are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>liable, is mentioned in the 4th section of the act; and that is given against them by name, and only for. their refusal, in the vacation time, to allow a writ of <em>habeas corpus, </em>when duly applied for. The chancellor and judges may refuse such a writ, at their discretion, if applied for in term time, and the penalty will not attach. It is only when they refuse, in a <em>mere ministerial capacity, </em>to allow a writ, that they are made responsible. <em>The allowance of a writ in vacation is not d judicial act.\u201d </em>So that, if the penalty was not extended to the court by the revisers of 1830, still the act of the city judge in issuing a writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>would not be a judicial act: it would be purely ministerial. At no time since the act of 1813 could a judge out of court refuse the writ; and, therefore, in allowing it, he acted in a mere ministerial capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">The act of 1850, creating the office of city judge, having e conferred on him only the judicial powers vested in the recorder, he cannot exercise powers that are not judicial, and which are purely ministerial. In doing so, he attempts to stretch his authority beyond the limits which the statute prescribes.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">The proceedings before the city judge should be set aside, and the relator, Louisa Nash, should be remanded on the temporary commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">Discharge vacated, and prisoner remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
