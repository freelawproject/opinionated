The record is devoid of any evidence of willful or wanton negligence or recklessness on the part of the defendants which would warrant s\u00fach a claim <em>(see Tatzel v Kaplan, </em>292 AD2d 440; <em>Lee v Health Force, </em>268 AD2d 564; <em>Rey v Park View Nursing Home, </em>262 AD2d 624, 627).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">The Supreme Court properly denied that branch of the plaintiffs\u2019 motion which was to preclude the defendant Nyack Hospital (hereinafter the Hospital) from introducing any evidence at trial as to its affirmative defenses. The Hospital\u2019s affirmative defenses are statutory in nature and require no amplification in a further bill of particulars <em>(see Marsala v Weinraub, </em>208 AD2d 689, 690).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">We agree with the Supreme Court that there is no basis to disqualify the counsel for the defendants Neil Siegel, Rockland Podiatry, P.C., and Steven Adler. Consequently, the Supreme Court properly denied that branch of the plaintiffs\u2019 motion which sought that relief <em>(cf. Tekni-Plex, Inc. v Meyner &amp; Landis, </em>89 NY2d 123).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">The plaintiffs\u2019 remaining contentions are without merit. Florio, J.P., Feuerstein, Krausman and Crane, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
