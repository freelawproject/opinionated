The defendant asserts that the statute is unconstitutional because: (1) the statute is too vague; (2) the statute violates his constitutional right to due process by using a preponderance of the evidence standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-13\">We have thoroughly reviewed the record and considered the arguments presented. We conclude that the statute is constitutional and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b179-15\">The defendant fired a rifle on two occasions in 1994 at the home of a neighbor. On the first occasion, a bullet entered the third floor bedroom of one of the neighbor\u2019s three children. On the second occasion, defendant fired several times and as a result the neighbor\u2019s front door and windows were \u201cbullet-riddled.\u201d Fortunately, no one was injured. The defendant is white; the neighbor is an African-American. The police later searched the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>dant\u2019s home and found an \u201carsenal of weapons,\u201d including an antipersonnel bomb.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">The defendant was charged in an indictment with various crimes, including first-degree attempted murder. He pled guilty on July 24, 1995 to counts three and eighteen charging him with the second degree crime of possession of a firearm for an unlawful purpose in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-4(a) and to count twenty-two charging him with the third degree crime of unlawful possession of a prohibited weapon, the anti-personnel bomb, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-3(a). The defendant conditioned his plea upon the right to appeal his sentence. <em>See R. </em>3:9\u20143(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">The State moved to have the defendant sentenced to an extended term pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-3(e). That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-8\">The court shall, upon application of the prosecuting attorney, sentence a person who has been convicted of a crime, ... to an extended term if it finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, the grounds in subsection e____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-10\">e. The defendant in committing the crime acted, at least in part, with ill will, hatred or bias toward, and with a purpose to intimidate, an individual or group of individuals because of race, color, religion, sexual orientation or ethnicity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-11\"><em>[Ibid, but see </em>L.1995, c. 211, \u00a7 3, eff. Aug. 14, 1995 (amending the text of this statute).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-12\">The extended sentence for the defendant\u2019s second degree crimes is between ten and twenty years which is the ordinary range for a first degree crime. For his third degree crime, the extended sentence would be five to ten years which is the ordinary range for a second degree crime. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7(a)(3), (4); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6(a)(2), (3). In effect, hate crimes are sentenced one degree higher.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-13\">A police officer testified at the hearing on the State\u2019s motion that the defendant had told the police that he shot at the house because he knew that blacks were living there and he wanted to give them \u201ca message that they were in his neighborhood.\u201d The defendant, a pharmacist, testified at the hearing. He said that he shot at the front door because the \u201cglass and the purple door\u201d caught his eye and that at the time of the incident, he was under the influence of alcohol and drugs. He denied that he shot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>at the house because he wanted to keep blacks away from the area. He also denied that he was a racist or a member of any racist group. He said that he had black friends and had no bias against African-Americans. He testified that he lied to the police about his reasons for shooting, because the police officer threatened him and the defendant wanted to get the interrogation over with.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">A psychologist testifying for the defendant at the hearing said that the defendant suffered from an obsessive-compulsive disorder, a cyclothymic disorder (excessive mood swings), drug dependence, alcohol abuse, the impulse disorder of kleptomania, and premature ejaculation. The psychologist concluded that a person of defendant\u2019s personality type would say or do almost anything, including lie, to get out of a police interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">The judge found that the testimony of the police officer was \u201ccredible, believable.\u201d The judge said that the questioning of the defendant by the police \u201cwas not overbearing. It was not onerous or is not in any sense dictatorial.\u201d The judge said he was \u201csatisfied that the crime was motivated by racial bias\u201d and that the defendant\u2019s explanation for the shooting was bizarre. The judge concluded that the defendant had changed his story in order to avoid punishment for a bias crime. The judge found that \u201cthe standard of proof required by the statute [preponderance of the evidence] has been met. The defendant is subject to enhanced penalties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">The defendant was sentenced on count eighteen to an extended term of twelve years with a parole ineligibility of four years, the mandatory minimum parole ineligibility under the Graves Act. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:4S-6(c). He was sentenced on count three to a concurrent term of seven years imprisonment with a three year parole bar and on count twenty-two to a concurrent term of three years imprisonment. He was ordered to pay $1,980 restitution to the victim. On each of the three counts, a $100 Violent Crimes Compensation Board penalty and a $75 Safe Street Act penalty were imposed. The remaining counts were dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">The defendant contends that the statute is too vague. <em>See State v. Afanador, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>162, 170, 631 A.2d 946 (1993) (a criminal statute is unconstitutionally vague \u201cif persons of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application\u201d); <em>State v. Cameron, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>586, 593, 498 A.2d 1217 (1985) (a statute is facially invalid where it is \u201cimpermissibly vague in all its application, that is, there is no conduct that it proscribes with sufficient certainty\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">The defendant\u2019s contention is refuted by the decision of the New Jersey Supreme Court in <em>State v. Mortimer, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>517, 529, 641 A.2d 257, <em>cert. denied, </em>513 <em>U.S. </em>970, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>440, 130 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>351 (1994). In that case, the Court considered the constitutionality of a section of the Hate Crime Statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-4(d), which provided that \u201charassment,\u201d a petty disorderly persons offense, would be raised to a fourth degree offense if the defendant \u201cacted, at least in part, with ill will, hatred or bias toward, and with a purpose to intimidate, an individual or group of individuals because of race, color, religion, sexual orientation or ethnicity.\u201d The defendant in <em>Mortimer, supra, </em>challenged the statute on a number of constitutional grounds including vagueness. The Supreme Court said that if the statute were \u201cconstrued narrowly and applied to a proper predicate offense, subsection d withstands a Vagueness\u2019 challenge.\u201d 135 <em>N.J. </em>at 531, 641 A.2d 257. The Court cured the vagueness problem by excising the words \u201cat least in part, with ill will, hatred or bias toward.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 534, 641 A.2d 257.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">The section of the Hate Crime Statute at issue in the present case, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-3(e), has the same language as that construed in <em>Mortimer. </em>As was done in <em>Mortimer, </em>we will excise the words \u201cat least in part, with ill will, hatred or bias toward\u201d and thereby overcome the vagueness challenge. We note that the Legislature has already made this change to the text of the statute (the statute was amended by L.1995, c. 211, \u00a7 3, eff. Aug. 14, 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The Hate Crime Statute provides for an extended term based upon a finding of bias by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-3(e). The Due Process clause of the United States Constitution \u201cprotects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged.\u201d <em>In re Winship, </em>397 <em>U.S. </em>358, 364, 90 <em>S.Ct. 1068, </em>1073, 25 L.Ed.2d 368, 375 (1970); <em>accord State v. Anderson, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>191, 200-01, 603 A.2d 928 (1992). The defendant argues that using the preponderance of evidence standard to mandate an extended term sentence violates the constitutional requirement that the State must prove the elements of a crime by the reasonable doubt standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">The flaw in the defendant\u2019s argument is that the Legislature has not made racial bias an element of the crime. The Hate Crime Statute acts as a sentencing factor. The language in the statute is not included in the definition of any crime in the New Jersey Code of Criminal Justice. Instead, the statute is included in a section of the code entitled \u201cauthority of court in sentencing.\u201d As to sentencing factors which are not elements of a crime, the State\u2019s burden of proof is not subject to the reasonable doubt standard. <em>See McMillan v. Pennsylvania, </em>477 <em>U.S. </em>79, 91, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>2411, 2419, 91 L.Ed.2d 67, 79 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">A State has the power to define the elements of a crime. The State\u2019s definition of the elements of the crime is usually \u201cdispositive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 85, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2415, 91 L.Ed.2d at 75. The State\u2019s power to define the elements of a crime has constitutional limits. <em>Id. </em>at 91, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2419, 91 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 79; <em>Patterson v. New York, </em>432 <em>U.S. </em>197, 210, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>2319, 2327, 53 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>281, 292 (1977) (there are constitutional limits to the State\u2019s power to redefine the elements of a crime so as to eliminate the reasonable doubt standard); <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur, </em>421 <em>U.S. </em>684, 699, 95 <em>S.Ct. </em>1881, 1889-90, 44 L.Ed.2d 508, 519-20 (1975) (the State may not require a defendant charged with murder to bear the burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>proving the elements of manslaughter in order to reduce the crime to manslaughter; the State may not undermine due process by redefining elements that constitute different crimes and characterizing them as factors bearing solely on punishment).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">In <em>McMillan, supra, </em>the State statute provided for a mandatory minimum sentence of five years imprisonment if the sentencing judge found by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant \u201cvisibly possessed\u201d a firearm during the commission of certain enumerated felonies. The Supreme Court found the statute to be constitutional. The Court said that the constitutionality of a statute redefining a crime would \u201cdepend on differences of degree\u201d and that the statute in <em>McMillan </em>fell on the \u201cpermissible side of the constitutional line.\u201d 477 <em>U.S. </em>at 91, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2419, 91 L.Ed.2d at 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">The Court pointed out in <em>McMillan </em>that the statute did not create a presumption that the person was guilty of a crime and did not restructure existing crimes to evade the requirements of the Due Process clause. <em>Id. </em>at 87, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2416-17, 91 L.Ed.2d at 77. The Court said: \u201c[t]he statute gives no impression of having been tailored to permit the visible possession finding to be a tail which wags the dog of the substantive offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 88, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2417, 91 L.Ed.2d at 77. Instead, the State has taken a traditional sentencing factor, possession of a firearm, and \u201cdictated the precise weight to be given that factor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 89-90, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2418, 91 L.Ed.2d at 79. The Court also said that the defendants\u2019 claim that visible possession is \u201creally\u201d an element of the crime, \u201cwould have at least more superficial appeal if a finding of visible possession exposed them to greater or additional punishment....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 88, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2417, 91 L.Ed.2d at 77-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">The New Jersey Hate Crime Statute does not create a presumption of guilt nor does it restructure any crimes. The statute is not \u201ctailored to permit the [racial or other bias] finding to be a tail which wags the dog of the substantive offense.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 88, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2417, 91 L.Ed.2d at 77; <em>State v. Federico, </em>198 <em>N.J.Super. 120, </em>128-29, 486 A.2d 882 (App.Div.1984) (the elements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>distinguishing the degrees of the crime of kidnapping must be determined by the jury and not the judge to avoid undermining a defendant\u2019s constitutional due process rights), <em>aff'd, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>169, 510 A.2d 1147 (1986) (affirming on statutory construction grounds; the Court expressly did not determine whether the result is \u201ccompelled by either the United States or New Jersey Constitutions\u201d); <em>see also State v. Anderson, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>191, 603 A.2d 928 (1992) (provision in the Code of Criminal Justice that materiality in a prosecution for perjury is a matter of law for the judge to determine is a violation of the New Jersey Constitution because materiality is an element of the crime).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Further, in New Jersey \u201cmotive traditionally has been an important factor for judges to consider at sentencing.\u201d <em>Mortimer, supra, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>at 528, 641 A.2d 257. Here, as in <em>McMillan, </em>the State has taken a sentencing factor, the motive for the crime, and prescribed the weight to be given it. <em>See </em>477 <em>U.S. </em>at 89-90, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2418, 91 L.Ed.2d at 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">Numerous cases have held that sentencing factors do not have to be established beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See State v. Biegenwald, </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>13, 59, 524 A.2d 130 (1987) (ordinarily, the State\u2019s contentions at a sentencing proceeding need not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, even those that are statutorily prescribed); <em>State v. Smith, </em>279 <em>N.J.Super. </em>131, 139, 652 A.2d 241 (App.Div. 1995) (the State need not prove beyond a reasonable doubt grading provisions which do not constitute elements of the offense); <em>see also </em>Graves Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6(c) (upon a judge\u2019s finding by a preponderance of the evidence that a defendant used or possessed a gun while committing certain crimes, a sentence of three years without parole must be imposed); <em>State v. Des Marets, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>62, 455 A.2d 1074 (1983) (the Graves Act does not unconstitutionally infringe upon the judicial power to suspend sentences); <em>cf. Wisconsin v. Mitchell, 508 U.S. </em>476, 490, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>2194, 2202, 124 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>436, 448 (1993) (a penalty enhancement statute for race-based selection of a victim was not unconstitutional, overbroad or violative of free speech); <em>State v. Colella, </em>298 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number><em>N.J.Super. </em>668, 675-76, 690 A.2d 156 (App.Div.1997) (upholding an extended sentence imposed under the Hate Crime Statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">The New Jersey Hate Crime Statute does expose the defendant to \u201cgreater and additional punishment\u201d and therefore the defendant\u2019s claim has \u201csuperficial appeal.\u201d <em>See McMillan, supra, </em>477 <em>U.S. </em>at 88, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2417, 91 L.Ed.2d at 78. However, this one factor standing alone does not place the statute on the \u201cimpermissible side of the constitutional line.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 91, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2419, 91 L.Ed.2d at 79. Court decisions have consistently upheld the constitutionality of statutes containing sentencing factors which impose a greater or additional punishment. In <em>United States v. Rumney, </em>867 <em>F.2d </em>714, 717 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>491 <em>U.S. </em>908, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>3194, 105 L.Ed.2d 702 (1989), the court held that the heightened penalty provided by the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d) 18 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 924(e)(1), for persons who possess a firearm \u201cafter having been thrice convicted of burglary/robbery is a sentence enhancer [not] a substantive crime.\u201d Virtually all of the other federal courts of appeal have reached the same conclusion. <em>E.g., United States v. McGatha, </em>891 F.2d 1520, 1524 nn. 27, 29 (11th Cir.) (noting that all the federal circuit courts of appeal except the second and fifth circuit have held that the ACCA does not create a new offense but is merely a sentence enhancement provision), <em>cert. denied, </em>495 <em>U.S. </em>938, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>2188, 109 L.Ed.2d 516 (1990); <em>but see United States v. Davis, </em>801 <em>F.2d </em>754 (5th Cir.1986); <em>see also United States v. Palacios-Casguete, </em>55 F.3d 557 (11th Cir.1995) (agreeing with four and disagreeing with one federal circuit courts of appeal by holding that a criminal statute regarding deported aliens remaining unlawfully in the United States is - a sentence enhancing statute as opposed to a statute defining a separate crime).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">The merits of hate crime statutes have been widely recognized. Most of the states have enacted hate crime statutes which provide for enhanced sentences for bias crimes. <em>See </em>Craig P. Gaumer, <em>Punishment for Prejudice: A Commentary on the Constitutionality and Utility of State Statutory Responses to the Problem of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number><em>Hate Crimes, </em>39 <em>S.D.L.Rev. </em>1, 9 &amp; n. 39 (1994) (noting that as of 1994, twenty-nine states had enacted Hate Crime Statutes which were \u201cessentially\u201d sentence enhancement statutes).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">In <em>Mortimer, supra, </em>the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-6\">[tjhe Legislature can surely treat bias-motivated offenses with an enhanced level of severity, because bias crimes, by nature, have distinct harmful effects. As the Supreme Court has noted, \u201cbias-motivated crimes are more likely [than other crimes] to provoke retaliatory crimes, inflict distinct emotional harms on their victims, and incite community unrest.\u201d Therefore, a regulation providing harsher penalties for bias-motivated crimes is appropriate as a means of addressing the greater harm those crimes cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-7\">Thus, we hold that subsection d does not violate the First Amendment. The statute neither regulates protected expression <em>nor impermissibly punishes motive.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-8\">[ 135 <em>N.J. </em>at 529, 641 A.2d 257 (citation omitted) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">In providing for enhanced sentencing in crimes motivated by racial bias, the Legislature has not trespassed on the fundamental element of criminal intent. The requisite criminal intent for this defendant\u2019s crimes has been established by his plea of guilty, namely, (1) having a firearm in his possession \u201cwith a purpose\u201d to use it unlawfully against the person or property of another, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-4(a); and (2) \u201cknowingly\u201d having in his possession a destructive device. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-3. Motive is quite different from intent. \u201c... <em>[MJotive </em>is the inducement for doing an act; the <em>intent </em>is the resolve to commit an act.\u201d Stated differently, <em>motive </em>relates to the end; <em>intent </em>relates to the means. Bryan A. Garner <em>A Dictionary of Modem Legal Usage </em>458 (2d Ed.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-10\">In <em>Morss v. Forbes, </em>24 <em>N.J. </em>341, 359, 132 A.2d 1 (1957), the Court said that intent should not be \u201cconfused\u201d with motive and \u201cproof of motive is never essential to a conviction but may be evidential.\u201d In <em>Snakenberg v. Hartford Casualty Ins. Co., </em>299 <em>S.C. </em>164, <em>383 </em>S.E.2d 2, 7 &amp; n. 7 (Ct.App.1989), the court said: \u201cpurpose relates to the result desired by the actor; motive is his subjective reason for desiring the result.\u201d <em>See also </em>21 Am.Jur.2d <em>Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 173 (1981) (\u201cIn criminal law motive may be defined as that which leads or tempts the mind to indulge in a criminal act, or as the moving power which impels to action for a definite result. Motive is distinguishable from intent, which is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>purpose to use a particular means to effect a certain result. Motive is not an essential element of any crime, unless made so by statute.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">The parties have not cited and our legal research has not \u2022 uncovered any ease in which the motive for the crime when used solely as a sentencing enhancer or factor is transformed into an element of the crime which then must be established beyond a reasonable doubt. The modern trend in the law is in the opposite direction. Sentencing judges are being given more discretion to engage in factfinding regarding the circumstances of the crime. As stated in a law review article:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-7\">Under real-offense sentencing systems, [sentencing] judges are given spacious authority to determine an offender\u2019s \u201creal\u201d crimes____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-8\">The United States Constitution, as currently interpreted, imposes virtually no restrictions on the practices of real-offense sentencing. Any constitutional constraints that might be imagined by lawyers or academics would require the making of \u201cnew Law,\u201d and the present Supreme Court has given no signals of movement in that direction.

To do so is to deprive the defendant of two fundamental constitutional rights: the right to trial by jury<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the right to be convicted of a crime only upon proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Those guarantees are at the heart of our constitutional system of government. <em>See, e.g., State v. Medina, </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>43, 49-50, 685 A.2d 1242 (1996), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>-, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>1476, 137 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>688 (1997); <em>State v. Anderson, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>191, 199-201, 603 A.2d 928 (1992). The Legislature has incorporated those guarantees into the Code of Criminal Justice. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:1-13a.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">My dissent rests on this syllogism: (a) the Federal and State Constitutions require that the jury decide each element of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt; (b) \u201cpurpose to intimidate ... because of race, [or] color\u201d is an element of the crime when that purpose raises the sentence for the crime; therefore (c) the Constitution requires that the jury decide whether the defendant acted with the purpose to intimidate because of the victim\u2019s race or color. <em>Cf. Anderson, supra, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>at 206, 603 A.2d 928. The State\u2019s power to define the elements of a crime cannot extend, as the majority holds, to defining away the actor\u2019s culpable purpose as an element of the crime \u2014 a crime for which this defendant received a sentence beyond the ordinary term for a second degree offense. <em>Cf. Mullaney v. Wilbur, </em>421 <em>U.S. </em>684, 698-99, 95 <em>S.Ct. </em>1881, 1889-90, 44 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>508, 519-20 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">Applied as a sentencing enhancement provision, this statute falls on the impermissible side of the constitutional line, and violates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>both the United States and the New Jersey Constitutions. The substance of section e can be saved only by recognizing the forbidden, biased purpose as an element of the underlying offense and requiring that a jury find proof of that purpose beyond a reasonable doubt. Defendant does not separately raise the right to indictment by a grand jury with respect to each element of the offense charged. <em>See N.J. Const., </em>art. I, \u00b6 8. <em>See also State v. D\u2019Amato, </em>218 <em>N.J.Super. </em>595, 607, 528 A.2d 928 (App.Div.1987). Nevertheless, that right follows once we recognize the purpose as an element of the more culpable offense. The Indictment returned by the grand jury against this defendant did not allege the prohibited purpose set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-3e with respect to Count 18, the firearm charge for which defendant received an extended term.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s guilty plea did not provide a factual basis for the prohibited purpose, and he denied such purpose at the sentencing hearing. While defendant waived his right to jury trial on the underlying charge, he did not waive that right, or the right to proof beyond a reasonable doubt, with respect to the prohibited purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">By defining purpose as motive and not intent, the majority concludes that defendant\u2019s purpose is not an element of the crime. While motive need not be an element of an otherwise purposeful crime, it can be an element, for example as in the statute mandating a life sentence without parole for the murder of a member of law enforcement. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-3b(2). Because section e elevates the culpability of the crime based on defendant\u2019s purpose, that purpose \u2014 whether it be described as motive or intent \u2014 must be deemed an element of the more serious crime, and not just a sentencing factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">I agree that <em>State v. Mortimer, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>517, 529, 641 A.2d 257 (1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>513 <em>U.S. </em>970, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>440, 130 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>351 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>(1994),. resolves defendant\u2019s vagueness challenge to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-3e. <em>Mortimer, </em>however, does not address the constitutional infirmities of section e because the penalty enhancement provision of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-4d that was challenged in Mortimer<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> did not take the element of purpose from the jury, nor allow a defendant\u2019s purpose to be found on less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In <em>Wisconsin v. Mitchell, </em>508 <em>U.S. </em>476, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>2194, 124 L.Ed.2d 436 (1993), the Supreme Court held that sentence enhancement for a defendant who selected the victim because of race did not violate defendant\u2019s First Amendment right of expression. However, as Judge Stem recognizes in footnote 1 of his concurring opinion, the challenged Wisconsin statute required the jury to determine whether defendant acted on account of the victim\u2019s race.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">The majority concludes that the alleged purpose to intimidate because of race or color \u201cdefines motive, not intent,\u201d and therefore can be left to the judge to determine by a mere preponderance of the evidence. The Code itself suggests otherwise. \u201cPurpose\u201d in the criminal code is defined by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-2b(1):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-7\">A person acts purposely with respect to the nature of his conduct or a result thereof if it is his conscious object to engage in conduct of that nature or to cause such a result. A person acts purposely with respect to attendant circumstances if he is aware of the existence of such circumstances or he believes or hopes that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>exist. \u201cWith purpose,\u201d \u201cdesigned,\u201d \u201cwith design\u201d or equivalent terms have the same meaning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-6\">[emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">The prohibited purpose described by section e \u2014 to intimidate because of race, etc. \u2014 fits precisely within the category of a result that is the actor\u2019s \u201cconscious object ... to cause----\u201d Furthermore, the victim\u2019s status within a protected category \u2014 in this case, race or color \u2014 is indeed an \u201cattendant eircumstance[ ]\u201d that the defendant had to believe existed. There can hardly be a clearer example of acting with purpose than that spelled out by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-3e.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">Moreover, the Code defines an \u201celement of an offense\u201d to include conduct, or attendant circumstances, or a result of conduct, if it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-10\">(a) Is included in the description of the forbidden conduct in the definition of the offense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-12\">[or]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-13\">(b) Establishes the required kind of culpability\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-14\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2C:1-14h]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-15\">An actor\u2019s purpose to intimidate because of color or race must be construed as part of the definition of the offense, irrespective of where it appears in the Code. Moreover, 2C:44-3 shows us that acting with the proscribed purpose \u201cestablishes the required kind of culpability\u201d \u2014 culpability that requires punishment as if for a crime one degree higher.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-16\">Except for <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-3e, wherever the Code defines the seriousness of an offense (and thus the maximum sentence allowed) in terms of the actor\u2019s purpose, that purpose is treated as an element of the offense and can be found only by a jury, upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The net effect of section e, as recognized by the majority, is to elevate the substantive offense\u2014 in this case, unlawful possession of a firearm \u2014 from a second to a first degree crime. Where the grading of a Code offense depends upon the defendant\u2019s mental state, determining that purpose has always been the jury\u2019s province. The most obvious example is the homicide statute. It would be unthinkable to instruct the jury in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>homicide trial to decide only whether the defendant\u2019s act caused the victim\u2019s death, leaving it to the sentencing judge to decide, based upon a mere preponderance of the evidence, whether the defendant intended death or serious injury likely to lead to death; or whether defendant acted recklessly; and if so, whether with a wanton disregard for human life. It would be equally unthinkable in a trial for lewdness under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-4 for a sentencing judge and not a jury to decide whether the defendant acted \u201cfor the purpose of arousing or gratifying ... sexual desire ...,\u201d thereby raising the offense from a disorderly persons to a fourth degree crime. <em>See also N.J.S.A. </em>2C:13-5 (criminal coercion); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:17-1 (arson).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Section e is distinguishable from every other sentence enhancing provision of the Code in that it extends the term of the sentence based on the defendant\u2019s mental state at the time of the offense. Except for the extended term provision at issue here, the Code neither mandates nor allows an extended term based upon the defendant\u2019s state of mind. The Code provides extended terms solely based upon objective facts. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-3 a, b, c, d, f and g.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">The analogy to mandatory parole ineligibility terms for crimes committed with a firearm <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-3d, the Graves Act) is not compelling. Graves Act sentencing is not conditioned upon the defendant\u2019s mental state, and mental state has historically and constitutionally been an element of the substantive offense.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">Section e is also distinguishable from every other Code provision where the status of the victim determines the degree of the crime, and therefore the maximum length of the sentence. The jury in every such case, and not the judge, is required to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim held the protected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>status. <em>See, e.g., N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-3b(2) (murder of a police officer); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2 (sexual assault); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-1b (aggravated assault). Wherever a particular fact determines the degree of a Code offense, and therefore the maximum prison sentence, the jury determines that fact upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt. For example, theft can be anything from a second degree crime to a disorderly persons offense, depending upon the value the jury places on the stolen property. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">The issue before us in this case is not whether more severe punishment is appropriate for crimes committed to intimidate the victim because that person is a member of a protected group. The Legislature has said that it is. Nor is the issue whether the State could have proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt that this defendant acted with such purpose. Implicit or explicit speculation that a jury would have found the forbidden purpose does not justify leaving that issue to the judge or denying defendant the right to proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Where the State intends to seek a mandatory extended term sentence because the underlying crime is accompanied by the forbidden purpose set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-3e, then unless the defendant expressly waives a jury, only a jury can find the defendant guilty and then only upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Defendant\u2019s extended term sentence should be vacated and the matter remanded for resentencing to an ordinary second degree term as provided by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">I would reverse.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b191-10\"> Section 1 of this legislation added similar language to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-1e (assault), and \u00a7 2 added similar language to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33\u20144d (harassment).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b191-11\"> The bracketed portion was deleted, after the offense for which defendant was convicted, by L.1995, c. 211, \u00a7 3, in response to <em>R.A.V. v.
