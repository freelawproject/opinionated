Harleysville Ins. Cos., </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>397, 658 A.2d 1246 (1995) (Aubrey). Defendant appeals a judgment entered in the parties\u2019 consolidated actions arising from plaintiffs efforts to obtain UIM coverage as a family member under her father\u2019s automobile policy issued by defendant. Pursuant to her complaint seeking UIM coverage, plaintiff obtained a favorable arbitration award in response to which defendant filed a declaratory judgment action in light of <em>Aubrey. </em>As a result, the procedural history of these actions has been extensive and somewhat complex. Ultimately, the two actions were consolidated and, finally by judgment entered December 20, 1996, the trial judge confirmed the arbitra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>tor\u2019s award, rejected defendant\u2019s claim that UIM coverage was precluded under <em>Aubrey, </em>and awarded counsel fees to plaintiff pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:42-9(a)(6).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">The underlying facts relating to plaintiffs pursuit of UIM coverage under her father\u2019s policy are as follows. On May 21, 1989, plaintiff was a front seat passenger in an automobile owned and operated by Joseph Ma\u00f1ero. At the same time, Lucia Martinez was driving a vehicle travelling in the wrong direction on a one-way street which entered an intersection against a red light and struck Manero\u2019s vehicle on the passenger\u2019s side. As a result of the accident, plaintiff suffered injuries that required extended medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">On the day of the accident, plaintiff, then thirty-four, maintained her primary residence at her parents\u2019 home. She also rented an apartment which she used when she was required to work evening hours at her job. Defendant conducted an investigation on plaintiff\u2019s claim that she was a family member insured and has never disputed that her primary residence was at her parent\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">Prior to the accident, plaintiff\u2019s father, Cornelius Barnett, had purchased an insurance policy from defendant that covered \u201cresident relative(s)\u201d of his household and provided total UIM benefits of $100,000.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiff also had her own separate insurance policy with the St. Paul Insurance Company (St.Paul) that provided UIM benefits of $25,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>Plaintiff subsequently filed a liability action against Martinez and Ma\u00f1ero. On January 4, 1991, mandatory, non-binding arbitration was held in plaintiffs case against Martinez and Ma\u00f1ero. The arbitrator found that plaintiff was not liable, found that Martinez and Ma\u00f1ero were fully liable, awarded plaintiff damages totalling $275,000, and apportioned damages between Martinez and Ma\u00f1ero. Yet, Martinez and Ma\u00f1ero only had liability policies providing $15,000 in coverage each. Thereafter, on separate occasions between July and August 1991, plaintiff gave St. Paul and defendant notice of her intent to settle the underlying liability action for a total of $29,000. The settlement consisted of the maximum of Martinez\u2019s liability coverage and $14,000 of Manero\u2019s liability coverage. Defendant then conducted an investigation of Martinez\u2019s and Manero\u2019s assets, and on October 9, 1991, with notice of plaintiffs UIM claim under her father\u2019s policy, defendant authorized plaintiff to accept the settlement. Ultimately, defendant offered to settle her UIM claim for less than the available coverage under her father\u2019s policy. Plaintiff rejected that offer and, on September 1, 1993, <em>Sled </em>a complaint seeking the full amount she claimed she was entitled to under her father\u2019s policy. On plaintiffs order to show cause, the matter was referred to contractual arbitration under the pertinent provisions of the policy-</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Pursuant thereto, the award would become final unless it exceeded \u201cthe [statutory] financial responsibility limits\u201d and, if so, the right to trial \u201cmust be exercised within 30 days of the award.\u201d On September 20, 1995, the arbitrators awarded plaintiff $100,000 in damages. Within five days of the arbitrator\u2019s award, on September 25, 1995, defendant expressed its rejection of that award. It did so on the sole basis of <em>Aubrey, </em>and on October 31, 1995, filed its declaratory judgment action in reliance on <em>Aubrey. </em>As far as we can tell, defendant did not file a demand for a jury trial until July 1996 as part of its answer to plaintiffs counterclaim in the declaratory judgment action. The matters were consolidated and, finally, the trial judge rejected defendant\u2019s demand for trial <em>de novo </em>and rejected its claim that <em>Aubrey </em>precluded UIM <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>coverage under the father\u2019s policy, entering an order enforcing plaintiffs claim under defendant\u2019s UIM policy and granting plaintiff counsel fees. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">On appeal, defendant contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-6\">POINT I. THE TRIAL COURT INCORRECTLY INTERPRETED <em>AUBREY V. HARLEYSVILLE </em>AND ERRED IN DENYING THE DEFENDANT\u2019S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-7\">POINT II. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING THE DEFENDANT A JURY TRIAL ON THE ISSUE OF DAMAGES.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-8\">POINT III. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GRANTING THE PLAINTIFF AN ORDER PERMITTING ATTORNEYS FEES AND COSTS UNDER A CLAIM FOR UIM BENEFITS.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">We deal briefly with points II and III and then address the primary issue of coverage asserted in point I.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-10\">\n<em>I</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b604-11\"><em>As </em>to point III and the award of counsel fees, we agree that there exists no legal basis for counsel fees here. This was not an action on a liability or an indemnity policy within the meaning of <em>R. </em>4:42-9(a)(6). <em>E.g., New Jersey Mfrs. Ins. Co. v. Breen, </em>297 <em>N.J.Super. </em>503, 516-17, 688 A.2d 647 (App.Div.), <em>certif. granted, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>408, 694 A.2d 194 (1997) (\u201c[a]n action to collect under the underinsured motorist coverage of a New Jersey automobile policy is not within the category of suits in which <em>R. </em>4:42-9(a)(6) permits an attorney\u2019s fee to be awarded.\u201d); <em>Goodwin v. Rutgers Cas. Ins. Co., </em>223 <em>N.J.Super. </em>195, 199, 538 A.2d 425 (App.Div.1988); <em>Childs v. New Jersey Mfrs. Ins. Co., </em>199 <em>N.J.Super. </em>441, 451-52, 489 A.2d 1203 (App.Div.1985), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>506, 531 A.2d 723 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-12\">\n<em>II</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b604-13\">As to point II, we point out no more than that defendant\u2019s own binding arbitration provision required it to demand a jury trial on the arbitrator\u2019s award within 30 days of the decision. Of course, \u201cthe duty to arbitrate, and the scope of the arbitration, are dependent solely on the parties\u2019 agreement.\u201d <em>E.g., Cohen v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number><em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>231 <em>N.J.Super. </em>97, 100-01, 555 A.2d 21 (App. Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>87, 563 A.2d 846 (1989). Defendant asserts that its letter to plaintiff disclaiming acceptance of the award as to coverage in light of <em>Aubrey, </em>sent five days after the award, constitutes a demand for jury trial under the language of the policy. It does not. <em>Compare Verbiest v. New Jersey Full Ins. Underwriting Ass\u2019n, </em>256 <em>N.J.Super. </em>85, 89, 606 A.2d 420 (App.Div.1992) (\u201c[sjince the carrier notified the trial court and plaintiffs ... [within the time required under the policy] that it \u2018has <em>rejected the award </em>and <em>is demanding a trial, \u2019 </em>the arbitration award was a nullity.\u201d (emphasis added)). The objective of defendant, and more importantly the thrust of its notice to plaintiff, was as to the underlying coverage issue in light of <em>Aubrey. </em>It was not focused upon the amount of damages ascertained by the arbitration. More importantly, there was never a demand for jury trial within the 30 days required under the arbitration provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Moreover, we do not think the contractual arbitration provision permits a jury trial under the circumstances here. Pursuant thereto, a jury trial may be demanded if an arbitration award exceeds the \u201climits\u201d of the financial responsibility law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.1. It is undisputed here that the arbitrator\u2019s award exceeded the minimum liability limit but not the maximum UIM limit. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.1(a), (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">We addressed arbitration clauses in <em>D\u2019Antonio v. State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins. Co., </em>262 <em>N.J.Super. </em>247, 620 A.2d 1060 (App. Div.1993) and <em>Cohen v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>231 <em>N.J.Super. </em>97, 100, 555 A.2d 21 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>87, 563 A.2d 846 (1989). The particular language there provided that an arbitration award would not be binding if it exceeded \u201cthe <em>minimum </em>limit for <em>liability </em>specified by the financial responsibility law of New Jersey.\u201d (Emphasis added). The policies were clear that the pertinent limit by which the award was to be measured was the \u201cminimum liability\u201d limit set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.1(a). We, therefore, measured the arbitrators\u2019 awards in both cases against that statutory minimum. <em>See D\u2019Antonio v. State Farm Mutual </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number><em>Auto. Ins. Co., supra, 262 N.J.Super. </em>at 250, 620 A.2d 1060; <em>Cohen v. Allstate Ins. Co., supra, </em>231 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 100 n. 1, 555 A.2d 21. However, in the present matter the word \u201climits\u201d is not modified by \u201cminimum\u201d or \u201cliability.\u201d Moreover, it is plural, suggesting both the minimum liability limit set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.1(a) and the maximum UM and UIM limit set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.1(b). <em>See Taylor v. National Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, </em>289 <em>N.J.Super. </em>593, 601, 674 A.2d 634 (App. Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>376, 678 A.2d 716 (1996) (\u201c[w]e agree ... that as a matter of ordinary parlance the phrase \u2018statutory limits\u2019 ... can mean either the floor or the ceiling, <em>ie., </em>either the statutory minimum or the statutory maximum.\u201d). Unmodified, therefore, the word \u201climits\u201d is, at best, ambiguous. <em>Ibid. </em>Ambiguities in insurance contracts ordinarily are construed in favor of an insured and against the insurer. <em>See Voorhees v. Preferred Mut. Ins. Co., </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>165, 178, 607 A.2d 1255 (1992); <em>Sparks v. St. Paul Ins. Co., </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>325, 336, 495 A.2d 406 (1985); <em>Wickner v. American Reliance Ins. Co., </em>273 <em>N.J.Super. </em>560, 568, 642 A.2d 1046 (App.Div.1994), <em>aff'd, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>392, 661 A.2d 1256 (1995). We see no reason why we should not do so here. Since the arbitration award does not exceed the maximum UIM limit, that award is binding.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">\n<em>Ill</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Finally, we address the predominant issue of coverage, that is the application of <em>Aubrey. </em>Defendant contends that <em>Aubrey </em>holds that a UIM insured is limited to his or her own personal policy and that therefore plaintiff here can not look to UIM coverage under her father\u2019s policy. Under her father\u2019s policy, plaintiff is an insured as a \u201cfamily member,\u201d though she is not a named insured. Given the Supreme Court\u2019s clarification of <em>Aubrey </em>in <em>French v. New Jersey School Board Ass\u2019n., </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>478, 694 A.2d 1008 (1997), we are convinced <em>Aubrey </em>does not preclude UIM benefits under the father\u2019s policy because plaintiff is an insured as a \u201cfamily member.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>To begin -with, the discussion of UIM coverage as personal to the insured in <em>Aubrey, </em>and as relied upon by defendant here, was <em>dicta. </em>The issue that we decided in <em>Aubrey, </em>and which was directly before the Supreme Court, involved a contractual interpretation of a certain \u201cstep down\u201d provision in the \u201cnonpersonal\u201d \u201cother\u201d Harleysville policy. We concluded plaintiff Aubrey was insured thereunder; the Supreme Court disagreed. That was the critical issue as to Aubrey\u2019s entitlement to UIM under the Harleysville policy. Although, therefore, the vehicle she was operating was a covered vehicle under that policy, she was not an insured, either designated, or as an employee, or as an \u201cother insured.\u201d Under those circumstances, her presence in the covered vehicle was \u201cfortuitous,\u201d and her only recourse was to her own policy, there being no other policies available. <em>Taylor v. National Union Fire Ins. Co., supra, </em>289 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 599, 674 A.2d 634.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\"><em>Aubrey </em>has generated much debate regarding the Court\u2019s reference to an insured\u2019s \u201cpersonal\u201d UIM policy. We are convinced that debate has been put to rest by <em>French. </em>In upholding the right of an employee to UIM coverage as an \u201cother insured\u201d under the employer\u2019s policy, the Supreme Court in <em>French </em>said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq6\">we note the problem that <em>Aubrey </em>has apparently been interpreted by some courts as establishing the UIM policy purchased by the injured person as not only the policy of \u2018comparison\u2019 (for the purpose of gauging whether a UIM claim exists in the first place) but also as the only UIM policy that the injured person has resort to once that threshold test is met. That simply is too broad a reading.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-7\"><em>[French, supra, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>at 486, 694 A.2d 1008.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">The Court concluded that an insured, as the insured before it, was not limited to a single UIM policy, that is his or her own personal automobile policy. \u201cIn short, a policy \u2018held\u2019 by a claimant is not always a policy purchased by a claimant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 487-88, 694 A.2d 1008. Others may provide coverage for the claimant. Further, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-9\">For example, no public policy or statute should prevent a parent from providing UIM coverage for a residenUchild greater than the child might have on a personal auto so long as the risk is understood and accepted by the insurance company. After all, the parent is likely to bear the burden of any unreimbursed expenses and to empathize with the uncompensated suffering of a child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>... Like the head of a household, an employer will often wish to insure that the injuries of employees are fully compensated, if only to benefit from the employees\u2019 continued well-being. Conversely, an insurance company is not forbidden to limit UIM coverage for family members or employees who have other insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-4\"><em>[French, supra, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>at 492-93, 694 A.2d 1008.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Thus, the Court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-6\">the statute contemplates that the insured is free to pursue UIM benefits under other policies under which he or she may be insured \u2014 whether under his or her personal policy, as the occupant of an employer\u2019s vehicle, the permissive occupant of a motor vehicle owned by any other insured person, or as the resident in the household of a relative possessing his or her own UIM insurance. Each of those UIM policies is opened up to the insured once the threshold test is met.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-7\">[Id at 494, 694 A.2d 1008. (emphasis added) ]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-8\"><em>And see Cook-Sauvageau v. PMA Group, </em>295 <em>N.J.Super. </em>620, 625-27, 685 A.2d 978 (App.Div.1996), <em>certif. denied, </em>150 <em>N.J. </em>29, 695 A.2d 671 (1997). The underlined language in the above quote encompasses precisely the factual situation here.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">Nonetheless, because the UIM coverage here arises under the \u201cfamily member\u201d provisions of the father\u2019s policy, defendant contends Aubrey\u2019s apparent overruling of <em>Landi v. Gray, </em>228 <em>N.J.Super. </em>619, 550 A.2d 768 (App.Div.1988), is dispositive. But if that is what <em>Aubrey </em>did, its application would be prospective and, thus, not applicable here. <em>New Jersey Mfrs. Ins. Co. v. Breen, supra, </em>297 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 504, 688 A.2d 647.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-10\">More importantly, <em>French, </em>we think, clarified what the present view is as to <em>Landi, </em>and we are convinced it does not preclude plaintiffs resort to her father\u2019s policy as an insured family member. In <em>Landi, </em>the plaintiff borrowed her brother\u2019s automobile and permitted her friend to drive it while she was a passenger. <em>Landi v. Gray, supra, </em>228 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 620, 550 A.2d 768. Her friend subsequently drove the car off a road and into a tree, causing plaintiff serious injuries. The friend did not have automobile insurance, except for the liability coverage of $15,000/$30,000 provided under the plaintiffs brother\u2019s policy to which she was entitled as a permissive user. At the time of the accident, the plaintiff had her own insurance policy that provided UIM coverage of $15,000. The plaintiff\u2019s mother, with whom the plaintiff lived, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>had an insurance policy with Keystone Insurance Company (Keystone) that provided UIM coverage of $100,000, and provided coverage for the plaintiff as a family member. Plaintiff brought suit for UIM benefits under the Keystone policy. Keystone denied coverage based upon an exclusionary clause in its policy that stated \u201c \u2018underinsured motor vehicle\u2019 [does not] include[ ] any vehicle ... [o]wned by or furnished or available for the regular use of you or any family member.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 621, 550 A.2d 768.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Keystone argued that this exclusionary provision prohibited coverage for the plaintiff because the accident had occurred in a family member\u2019s vehicle. <em>Ibid. </em>Nevertheless, we held in <em>Landi </em>that such an exclusionary provision was violative of public policy. <em>Id. </em>at 622, 550 A.2d 768. Consequently, we thus held that the plaintiff there, as an other insured under her mother\u2019s policy, could look to the UIM provisions in that policy, even though, as compared to her own, the tortfeasor\u2019s policy did not meet the threshold injury. It was in this context that we said \u201c[a] motor vehicle may be underinsured when compared to the underinsured motorist coverage afforded under one policy, yet not be underinsured when compared to the underinsured motorist coverage of another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 624, 550 A.2d 768.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">In <em>Aubrey, </em>the Court said it \u201cdisagreed with that statement\u201d and in that context \u201cdisapproved of the holding in <em>Landi.\u201d Aubrey, supra, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>at 405, 658 A.2d 1246. But in setting forth that holding, <em>Landi </em>was described as though the plaintiff, no more than the plaintiff in <em>Aubrey </em>under the Court\u2019s interpretation of the Harleysville policy, was not an \u201cother insured\u201d under her mother\u2019s policy. The Court expressly focused upon the policy\u2019s exclusionary clause in <em>Landi. Ibid. And see French, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>at 490, 694 A.2d 1008 (\u201c[t]he policy, however, [in <em>Landi </em>] contained an exclusion that read in part: \u2018Neither \u2018uninsured motor vehicle\u2019 nor \u2018underinsured motor vehicle\u2019 includes any vehicle ... [o]wned by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>or furnished or available for the regular use of you or any family member.\u2019 \u201d). <em>Landi, supra, </em>228 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 621, 550 A.2d 768. In effect, the insurance company in <em>Landi </em>had said to the insured family member, \u201cdon\u2019t look to us for UIM benefits if it is another resident-member of your own family that owns the underinsured vehicle. You could have encouraged that family member to buy more insurance or perhaps have bought it yourself.\u201d <em>French, supra, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>at 490, 694 A.2d 1008. It was our holding in <em>Landi </em>that such an exclusionary clause was violative of public policy that the Supreme Court has now disagreed with.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">Evidently, the <em>Aubrey </em>Court, as did the <em>French </em>Court subsequently, 149 <em>N.J. </em>at 494, 694 A.2d 1008, viewed the plaintiff in <em>Landi, </em>simply not an \u201cother insured\u201d under her mother\u2019s policy because of the exclusionary provisions. The plain language of the mother\u2019s policy in <em>Landi </em>precluded UIM coverage available to the plaintiff. She thus \u201cheld\u201d no UIM coverage greater than the tortfeasor\u2019s and thus could not satisfy the statutory threshold for UIM coverage. <em>Aubrey, supra, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>at 404-05, 658 A.2d 1246; <em>French, supra, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>at 494, 694 A.2d 1008.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">In contrast, in <em>French, </em>the plaintiff was an insured under the \"employer\u2019s policy, and the UIM limits were satisfied. Thus, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-6\">In this case, the plain language of the policy and the undoubted common intent of the parties to the UIM contract is that the policy covers the bus driver as an employee of the school district. The language of the policy is unambiguous in this regard. The UIM endorsement covers anyone \u2018occupying a covered auto.\u2019 By whom is a policy of the fictitious being of a corporation \u2018held\u2019 if not by corporate employees? Diana French thus \u2018held\u2019 UIM coverage greater than the tortfeasor\u2019s liability coverage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-7\"><em>[French, supra, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>at 494, 694 A.2d 1008.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">Both <em>Aubrey </em>and <em>French, </em>then, did not disapprove <em>Landi </em>to the extent we held a person may look to other than his or her \u201cown\u201d policy for UIM coverage, assuming that person is an insured under that other policy and the statutory UIM limits are met. What the Court has disagreed with in <em>Landi </em>is our interpretation of the mother\u2019s policy as including plaintiff as an insured as a family member. This is just as it disagreed with our interpreta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>tion of the Harleysville policy in <em>Aubrey. </em>The distinction is not that a plaintiff can not look to more than one policy for UIM coverage, assuming the statutory limits are met. The critical distinction is that he or she may not do so if not an insured, either named, \u201cother,\u201d or otherwise, under the terms of the \u201cother\u201d policy. <em>See French, supra, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>at 494-95, 694 A.2d 1008.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">No issue has been raised here that either the statutory limits were not met or that plaintiff is not an insured under her father\u2019s policy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s disclaimer of coverage related solely to the <em>dicta </em>in <em>Aubrey </em>as to one\u2019s personal insurance. As to that the trial judge correctly concluded that <em>Aubrey </em>did not preclude UIM coverage where one is an insured under another\u2019s policy and the statutory limits are met.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">We thus affirm the order enforcing the arbitrator\u2019s award and reverse the award of counsel fees.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b602-8\"> The December 20, 1996 order awarded a specific amount of counsel fees. However, by order entered January 30, 1997, the amount of counsel fees awarded under the December 20, 1996 order was vacated, and a plenary hearing as to that amount was directed to be held. To our knowledge, no hearing has been held and no further order has been entered as to the amount of counsel fees. The December 20, 1996, order, therefore, is not, technically, a final judgment. To resolve all the issues before us without further delay or cost to the parties, we grant leave <em>nunc pro tunc </em>to appeal the December 20, 1996 judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b602-9\"> The parties do not dispute that \"family member\" coverage is provided under the father's policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b609-7\"> It is important to recognize that it is this exclusionary language in Keystone's policy that was at the heart of <em>Landi, </em>not, more generally, the family member provision that appears in many automobile policies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b611-8\"> In its May 22, 1997 reply letter brief, defendant asserted that plaintiff was not \u201ca licensed resident operator\u201d residing in her father\u2019s house, referring to the policy\u2019s declaration sheets, and was not a \"named insured.\u201d Defendant, however, has never asserted that plaintiff is not an insured under her father\u2019s policy as a \"family member.\u201d We think it too late for defendant to do so now. <em>Cf.
