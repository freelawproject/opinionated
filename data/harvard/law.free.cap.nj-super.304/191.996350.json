The Law Division judge, after a trial <em>de novo </em>on the record with additional testimony, adopted in full the findings which had been made by the departmental hearing officer. He also ruled, as the hearing officer had, that plaintiff should forfeit his pay for the period of an unauthorized absence. The trial judge determined, however, that the penalty of dismissal recommended by the hearing officer and effected by the Department was too harsh. He ordered, instead, a suspension for one year. Defendants\u2019 motion for reconsideration of that aspect of the penalty was denied and they appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The Borough of East Newark (Borough) has not adopted the Civil Service Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>11A:1-1 to:12-6. Consequently, discipline of police officers in that municipality is governed by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-147 to -151.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">On March 17, 1995, defendant Chief of Police Kenneth Lindsay (Chief) filed departmental disciplinary charges against plaintiff alleging eight violations of the Borough\u2019s ordinances stemming from an unauthorized absence from duty. The charges were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-8\">\u2022 willful disobedience of orders;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-9\">\u2022 absence without leave;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-10\">\u2022 incompetency;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-11\">\u2022 neglect of duty;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-12\">\u2022 conduct subversive of the good order and discipline of the Police Department;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-13\">\u2022 failure to promptly obey rules, regulations, instructions and orders;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-14\">\u2022 failure to devote time and energy to police business by putting private interests ahead of police duties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-15\">\u2022 failure to perform such tours of duty as may be prescribed by the Chief of Police.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-16\">The \u201crecommended penalty\u201d was dismissal from the Department and forfeiture of pay for the days of plaintiff\u2019s absence: March 10, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>11, 12, 15, 16, 17 and 18, 1995. The charges contained a notice of immediate suspension from duty without pay. Notice of a hearing date was also included, as required by statute. N.J.S.A. 40A:14-147.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">The evidence at the hearing was consistent with the charged specifications. Plaintiff had been a member of the Department since 1985. It was a small police force comprised of six officers: the chief, two captains, and three patrolmen including plaintiff. On January 16, 1995, plaintiff submitted a written request for seven vacation days: March 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17, and 18. The request was approved on January 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">The applicable collective negotiations agreement left the scheduling of vacations to the employer. Accordingly, plaintiffs request was on a standard form which contained the following language: \u201cI fully understand that all vacation requests are subject to approval and meets a proper scheduling of manpower, so the protection of our community remains our prime concern [sic].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">On January 18, plaintiff was injured while on duty and was out on medical leave for six weeks. Upon plaintiffs return on March 6, Chief Lindsay informed him that his vacation had been can-celled because of personnel considerations. Plaintiffs medical leave and the overlapping medical leave of another officer had required the remaining members of the department to schedule excessive overtime. In order to regularize the situation, both officers\u2019 previously approved vacations, as well as the Chiefs own planned vacation, were cancelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">Plaintiff had prepaid for a seven- or eight-day vacation in Canc\u00fan, Mexico. He objected to the cancellation and threatened both to file a grievance and to litigate the matter. Without rescinding the cancellation order, the Chief told plaintiff that he would discuss the issue and plaintiffs reaction with the Borough\u2019s Police Committee at its meeting on March 8, and would inform plaintiff of the Committee\u2019s action during his scheduled day shift on March 9. At the March 8 meeting, the Police Committee supported the Chiefs decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>Plaintiff did not report for duty on March 9 and made no effort to communicate with the Chief to learn of the Committee\u2019s decision. Chief Lindsay made a number of attempts to communicate with plaintiff, all of which were unavailing because plaintiff could not be found.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">At about 2:00 a.m. on March 9, plaintiff had called in to say that he was ill and would be unable to report for duty at 6:00 a.m., the time he was scheduled to begin his shift. When Chief Lindsay arrived at Department headquarters that morning, he was advised of plaintiffs call. He sent an officer to plaintiffs home twice within the ensuing four-hour period to advise plaintiff that the decision concerning cancellation of vacations remained unchanged. Plaintiff was not home, and no one answered telephone calls made to his home. The efforts of other officers to communicate with or locate plaintiff later that day and on subsequent days were also unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Plaintiff could not be reached because he was in his parents\u2019 home, a dwelling attached to his own by a common garage. At the departmental hearing, plaintiff testified that after calling in sick at about 2:00 a.m. on March 9, he went back to sleep and called his mother after he awoke at seven or eight o\u2019clock to tell her that he was ill. He went to his parents\u2019 home, ate breakfast and went back to sleep there. Plaintiffs mother left for work at 2:00 p.m., and his sister-in-law drove him to the family doctor late in the afternoon. Although no physician\u2019s statement was required to verify his illness, plaintiff acquired a note handwritten on a prescription form: \u201cThe ... patient was seen by me on 3/9/95 due to strep throat and was told to do bed rest for at least 10 days ... taking the medication prescribed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Plaintiff went on to testify that he did not \u201ccall work and book off sick for the 10 days pursuant to the doctor\u2019s note.\u201d He explained the circumstances surrounding his decision to leave on vacation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-7\">A. Because I had too much money on the trip, I decided just to go.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-8\">Q. You already had \u2014 you were already on vacation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>A. Yeah, I was on vacation; I\u2019m not going to call out sick.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-6\">Q. So you didn\u2019t need to call out sick, you were already on vacation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-7\">A. I was on vacation, I didn\u2019t need to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-8\">********</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-9\">Q. [A]t any time prior to you going on vacation did you return home other than to get luggage and leave?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-10\">A. I never returned home, but my father did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-11\">********</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-12\">[He] picked up my luggage, put it in the car, and picked me up in front of his house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-13\">Q. How did you get to the airport?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-14\">A. My father took me there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-15\">Q. And what day did you leave for your trip, when were your tickets for?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-16\">A. That was March 10, six in the morning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-17\">On cross-examination, plaintiff testified that he went on his trip to Canc\u00fan despite being ill because \u201c[i]t was paid in advance,\u201d and \u201cI ... rested down there.\u201d Further cross-examination produced the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-18\">Q. Where did you sleep on the night of March 9?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-19\">A. My parents\u2019 home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-20\">Q. How far is that from your home?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-21\">A. Directly behind me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-22\">Q. Why didn\u2019t you sleep at your own home?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-23\">A \u2019Cause I was sick, and I stayed there. I wanted to get as much rest as possible so I could be ready to go to vacation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-24\">Q. So you thought you\u2019d get more rest at your parents\u2019 home than at your own home?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-25\">A Yes. Plus my mother cooks for me there. I don\u2019t cook, so I always eat at my mother\u2019s house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-26\">Q. Why did you think you could get more rest at your mother\u2019s home than your own home?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-27\">A. I don\u2019t have to get up from bed constantly to get things.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-28\">Q. It wouldn\u2019t be that you wanted to avoid anybody that came to see you or talk to you at the time, was it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-29\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-30\">Q. Now, at any time on March 8[sie] did you call the chief and say, \u201cSo what happened at the police committee meeting?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-31\">A As far as everything\u2019s concerned, the chief was supposed to get back to me and there was no meet [sic]. * * * No, I did not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>Plaintiff returned from Canc\u00fan late at night on March 18. The charges filed by Chief Lindsay on March 17 contained the following specification:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-4\">On March 9,1995, the day before the first day of his anticipated vacation, Officer Cosme called in sick. He has failed to report to duty since that date. Despite numerous efforts by the Department to contact him, Officer Cosme\u2019s whereabouts remain unknown.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">The hearing officer made the following findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-6\">Chief Lindsay did in fact tell Officer Cosme that his vacation was cancelled. Chief Lindsay made every attempt through his Police Department Officers to contact Officer Cosme during the period of time from March 9th through 17th. Chief Lindsay did not, at any time, tell Officer Cosme that his vacation might be cancelled but did, however, indicate that he would seek to appeal his decision of cancelling Officer Cosme\u2019s vacation to the Borough Counsel's Police Committee which subsequently sustained Chief Lindsay\u2019s directive. The hearing officer further concludes that Chief Lindsay was truthful, honest and straightforward in his testimony. Captain Padavano, Sgt. Baggett and Officer Schimenti were also very candid, truthful and their testimony is considered to be credible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-7\">The testimony of Officer Schimenti is key in that he testified he was aware that there was a phone answering machine and realized it was not working or had been shut off, therefore he could not leave a message and went to the home of Officer Cosme and did not receive any response upon knocking upon the front door and ringing the bell.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-8\">Officer Cosme testified that he became ill on March 8th [sic], that he contacted Harrison Police Department at approximately 2:00 a.m. to relay a message to his Police Department at 6:00 a.m. he would not be in for his detail. He further testified that he went to his mother\u2019s home that morning, had his breakfast and stayed there until he went to the Doctor at 4:00 that afternoon. Officer Cosme presented a doctor\u2019s note which indicated that Officer was suffering from a condition known as \u201cstrep throat\u201d. The doctor\u2019s note clearly indicated that he should have bed rest for at least ten (10) days. Officer Cosme testified that at no time, from the moment he went to his mother\u2019s house until he left for his vacation, did he return to his home (which is adjacent to his mother\u2019s home, in a mother-daughter type of home).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-9\">Officer Cosme\u2019s father retrieved his belongings from Officer Cosme\u2019s home and then drove the Officer to the airport at approximately 4:00 a.m., the morning of the 10th of March, 1995. Cosme also testified that he went to Canc\u00fan, Mexico and participated in Spring break with a couple of buddies. He testified he was not sure whether his vacation was cancelled or not and that even though he was ill, he thought bed rest in Canc\u00fan, Mexico during Spring break was the same as bed rest at his mother\u2019s house and being cared for by her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-10\">Officer Cosme then testified that it was a \u201cgood time in Mexico.\u201d He testified he was shocked when he came back and received the notice for which this matter is being heard. It should be noted that Officer Cosme lives in the Borough of East <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>Newark and did not attempt to contact any person working in the Borough of East Newark Police Department to determine whether or not the question of his vacation had been settled. He further testified there wasn\u2019t any member of his family attempting to contact the Borough of East Newark Police Department, nor was there any testimony that Officer Cosme did anything other than what he says he did, which was to go to Canc\u00fan for his vacation. (Officer Cosme testified that he didn\u2019t believe it was wrong he should not participate in his vacation [sic] since he already had paid for it.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-6\">The hearing officer finds the testimony of Officer Cosme incredible. This police officer clearly decided that he was going on his vacation, would not be on duty the week of March 10-17th and that his paid for vacation was more important than the protection of the Borough of East Newark. This officer clearly decided that his personal interests far exceeded those of the duties and responsibilities of his job. After careful review and careful reading of the closing statements, this hearing officer finds, as fact, that Officer Cosme lied and was less than credible and that Chief Lindsay was truthful and credible. Officer Cosme purposely put himself in a position as to not being able to participate in his job as a police officer of the Borough of East Newark and put the Town\u2019s people at risk. Officer Cosme clearly chose himself over his duty, honor and responsibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-7\">Therefore, Officer Cosme\u2019s refusal to obey orders not only demonstrated a lack of concern for the citizens of East Newark, but also created a potential threat for the morale, efficiency and discipline of the East Newark Police force. Such conduct cannot be tolerated. <em>[City of Newark v. Massey, </em>93 <em>N.J.Super. </em>317, 323, 225 A.2d 723 (App.Div.1967) ]. Further, [he] plainly demonstrated a lack of the integrity and dependability required of a police officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-8\"><em>[Township of Moorestown v. Armstrong, </em>89 <em>N.J.Super. </em>560, 566, 215 A.2d 775 (App.Div.1965) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">Based upon the foregoing findings, the hearing officer sustained all eight charges against plaintiff and determined that the seriousness of the infractions warranted a dismissal from the police force, effective immediately. The hearing officer also recommended that plaintiff should be required to forfeit his pay for the period of his unauthorized absence, and should repay the Borough of East Newark that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-11\">Pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-150, which expressly authorizes \u201csupplement[ation of] the record with additional testimony subject to the rules of evidence!,]\u201d the trial court\u2019s <em>de novo </em>on the record review was augmented by additional testimony from plaintiff, as well as that of numerous police officer witnesses from East Newark and other communities attesting to his good character and trustworthiness as a police officer. Cross-examination re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>vealed that plaintiff had been the object of other prior disciplinary proceedings. With regard to the instant matter, the record of the trial court proceedings contains the following exchange on plaintiffs direct examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-4\">Q. Mr. Cosme, just in summing up, was it ever your impression that you were given a direct order definitively that you[r] vacation time was cancelled?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-5\">A. No, it was never given to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-6\">Q. Would you have gone on vacation if you were given a direct order?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-7\">A. If I was given a direct order I would of never of went on vacation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-8\">Q. Have you ever disobeyed a direct order before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-9\">A. No, I haven\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">Based upon the entire record the trial judge made findings which were set out in his letter opinion of March 25, 1996:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-11\">The court has reviewed the record and findings of the hearing officer, Robert Rosenberg. The court finds no reason to challenge his findings as to the facts he determined and as to the credibility of the witnesses, particularly the plaintiff, Juan Cosme. The record amply supports the finding that Patrolman Cosme knew his vacation was cancelled or at the very least knew his vacation was subject to being cancelled. He clearly put himself out of the Chiefs reach in the days and hours before taking off for Canc\u00fan. His conduct clearly merited disciplinary action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-12\">The supplementary testimony offered by the plaintiff at the hearing before this court consisted primarily of witnesses attesting to the character of Juan Cosme and his abilities as a police officer of some 10 years. In addition, there was testimony concerning \u201cbad blood\u201d or ill feelings between Officer Cosme and Chief Keating [sic] because of past problems, most particularly arising out of allegations that Officer Cosme had made concerning the Chiefs involvement in the dismissal of traffic tickets back in 1990.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-13\">While the court is sure that there is no love lost between Cosme and Chief Keating [sic], the court does not find that the Chief was retaliating against Cosme by cancelling his vacation. It may be, however, that the past differences between the two may have motivated the Chief to seek the ultimate penalty of dismissal against the plaintiff to which the hearing officer agreed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-14\">The trial judge then determined that \u201cthe penalty assessed was too harsh,\u201d and set out his reasons for that view:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-15\">The supplemental testimony offered was extensive and credible. Many witnesses testified as to plaintiff\u2019s abilities as a police officer and his contributions to the community in general. Police officers from other towns testified as to his abilities and spirit of cooperation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-16\">Plaintiff Cosme\u2019s record and past contributions to the department and the community do not appear to have been considered below. It is clear that this court, in conducting a <em>de novo </em>review, can review the penalty and impose a different one if warranted. As the Supreme Court of N.J. said in <em>In re </em>Phillips, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>117 <em>N.J. </em>567 at p. 581 [569 A.2d 807], \u201calthough we recognize that a tribunal may not consider an employee\u2019s past record to prove a present charge, <em>[Town </em>of.] <em>West New York v. Bock, </em>38 <em>N.J. </em>500, 523 [186 A.2d 97] (1962), that past record may be considered when determining the appropriate penalty for the current offense. <em>In re Wenderwicz, </em>195 <em>N.J.Super. </em>126, 131-32 [478 A.2d 428] (App.Div.1984).\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-6\">There is no doubt that plaintiff Cosme\u2019s offense was a serious one. Punishment is in order. The court does not believe that the punishment in this case should include the loss to plaintiff of the opportunity to continue his chosen career or the loss to the community of an otherwise well qualified police officer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">The trial judge ordered \u201ca penalty of suspension for one year and loss of pay for the period of his unauthorized absence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">It is beyond question that the trial court\u2019s authority in reviewing the matter <em>de novo </em>on the record was plenary. The statute, by empowering the trial court to \u201caffirm, reverse or modify\u201d the decision reached on the municipal level, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-150, not only contemplates independent findings of fact and conclusions, but also expressly addresses the scope of the court\u2019s authority where a dismissal has been ordered on the local level.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-10\">If the applicant shall have been removed from his office, employment or position the court may direct that he be restored to such office, employment or position and to all his rights pertaining thereto, and may make such other order or judgment as said court shall deem proper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-11\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-12\">The <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-150 trial court\u2019s power to modify the sanction has consistently been regarded as self-evident, <em>see, e.g., In re Disciplinary Procedures of Phillips, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>567, 578-81, 569 A.2d 807 (1990); <em>Grasso v. Borough Council of Glassboro, </em>205 <em>N.J.Super. </em>18, 25, 500 A.2d 10 (App.Div.1985), <em>certif. denied, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>453, 511 A.2d 639 (1986), with only one limitation thus far declared: that the penalty imposed on the municipal level may not be increased or enhanced on judicial review.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>In re Disciplinary </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number><em>Hearing of Bruni, </em>166 <em>N.J.Super. </em>284, 291, 399 A.2d 997 (App.Div. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">Notwithstanding the scope of its authority, the trial court is not a free agent in this regard, however. While the determination of the sanction to be applied where a dereliction of duty has been found is, to a great extent, a discretionary exercise, judicial discretion is not unguided or uncontrolled.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-5\">Judicial discretion, sound discretion guided by law so as to accomplish substantial justice and equity, is a magisterial, not a personal discretion. It is legal discretion, in which the judge must take account of the applicable law and be governed accordingly. If the judge misconceives or misapplies the law, his discretion lacks a foundation and becomes an arbitrary act. When that occurs, the reviewing court should adjudicate the matter in light of the applicable law to avoid a manifest denial of justice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-6\"><em>[In re Presentment of Bergen County Grand Jury, </em>193 <em>N.J.Super. </em>2, 9, 471 A.2d 1203 (App.Div.1984) (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">There are, to be sure, at least two distinct categories of judicial discretion. The first involves the latitude to reach a dispositional result based upon facts found from the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 9-12, 471 A.2d 1203. The second is associated with the court\u2019s authority to manage the conduct of cases and to make rulings, even those with substantive effect, that stem from procedural considerations or reflect the manner in which the parties have litigated the case. <em>See Smith v. Smith, </em>17 <em>N.J.Super. </em>128, 131-33, 85 A.2d 523 (App.Div.1951), <em>certif. denied, </em>9 <em>N.J. </em>178, 87 A.2d 387 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">With respect to the latter category, we are enjoined to accord substantial deference to such rulings of trial judges and not to \u201cinvalidate such determinations merely because from our examination of the record we believe that we would have decided differently.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 134, 85 A.2d 523. Even with regard to the former, just as we are obliged to consider \u201c[findings [of fact to be] binding on appeal when supported by adequate, substantial and credible evidence,\u201d <em>Rova Farms Resort, Inc. v. Investors Ins. Co., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474, 484, 323 A.2d 495 (1974), we are charged to accord substantial regard to the conclusions of trial judges and to discretionary determinations that flow from them. <em>Gillman v.

Mandates of deference do not apply when issues of law are involved, however. <em>In re J.W.D., </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>108, 117, 693 A.2d 92 (1997); <em>Manalapan Realty v. Township Comm., </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995) (\u201cA trial court\u2019s interpretation of the law and the legal consequences that flow from established facts are not entitled to any special deference.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Although the statute governing judicial review of disciplinary proceedings against police employees in non-civil-service municipalities, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-150, is couched in terms that confer decisional discretion upon the trial judge, that discretion, too, must be exercised in conformity with applicable rules of law grounded either on clear statutory declarations or upon the types of policy considerations that inform case law standards which are not based on explicit statutory criteria. The determination whether or not a trial judge has pronounced judgment agreeably with the applicable rule of law is, in this connection, as in all others, one to be made independently by an appellate court, unfettered by principles of decisional deference. <em>In re J.W.D., supra, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>at 117, 693 A.2d 92; <em>Manalapan Realty, supra, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>at 378, 658 A.2d 1230.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">We are called upon to determine not only whether the trial judge\u2019s discretion to modify the penalty imposed on the municipal level was a fair and equitable result that flowed logically from the record before him, but also whether, as a matter of law, the particular result reached was one that is or ought to be available in the circumstances. After examining all the available arguments and authority so ably provided by counsel for the parties and discovered independently, we conclude that in ordering a one-year suspension from plaintiffs employment, the trial judge applied a mistaken view of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>The broad question is whether, as a matter of law, there are any limitations on the discretion of the decision maker in a police disciplinary proceeding regarding the penalty to be imposed where a major breach of conduct has been established. The answer has been provided by the Legislature, the Supreme Court and the Merit System Board for proceedings arising under the Civil Service Act. With a single exception of no consequence here, the current statutory provision states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-5\">[A]n appointing authority may not impose a suspension or fine greater than six months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-6\">[N.J.S.A. 11A:2-20 (last sentence).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">In explicating a like provision of the predecessor statute the Supreme Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-8\">[T]he pertinent language can be given no other construction but its plain meaning that if suspension is the form of penalty determined as appropriate, the duration thereof cannot extend beyond 6 months____ [F]urther[,] ... the limitation is mandatory rather than directory, since it involves substantive rights of the employee and not merely procedural details.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFJ\">********</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-12\">We are ... unable to find any basis whatever to sustain the town\u2019s suggested interpretation that the limitation merely proscribes the Commission from increasing a suspension penalty of less than 6 months imposed at the local level to one longer than that period of time. It follows of course from the view we have expressed that the statutory limitation on the Commission\u2019s power necessarily limits the appointing authority in meting out suspension as a punishment to the same extent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-13\">There is in our mind a sound reason for the limitation. To us it represents a legislative policy decision that if an employee\u2019s offense, coupled with his admissible past record, is serious enough to dictate a suspension from duty for more than 6 months, it merits dismissal instead. Long periods of suspension require other regular or temporary employees to perform the duties of the suspended man while his position must be kept open for his return. Such a situation is obviously not in the public interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-14\"><em>[Town of West New York v. Bock, </em>38 <em>N.J. </em>500, 525-26, 186 A.2d 97 (1962).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-15\">The Merit System Board has codified the limitation and the underlying policy in pervasive language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-16\">No suspension or fine shall exceed six months____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-17\"><em>[N.J.A.C. </em>4A:2-2.4(a).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>No such direct and unambiguous statement of law exists in this regard with relation to proceedings in municipalities not regulated by the Civil Service Act. The Title 40A provisions governing police discipline contain no counterpart to the last sentence of N.J.S.A. 11A:2-20. Generally pertinent discussions can be found in various cases, but no court has yet addressed the question directly; and there is no statewide agency vested with the authority to promulgate regulations governing such proceedings. Yet, a Superior Court judge, sitting as a tribunal of review, cannot be seen to be a free agent in this or any other regard, unconf\u00edned by standards and limitations, for if such were the case the discretion reposed by law would \u201claek[ ] a foundation and become[ ] an arbitrary act.\u201d <em>In re Presentment of Bergen Cty. Grand Jury, supra, </em>193 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 9, 471 A.2d 1203.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Even within the context of non-civil-service municipalities, we are mindful of the general policy rationale articulated by the Supreme Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-6\">[I]f an <em>employee\u2019s </em>offense, coupled with his admissible past record, is serious enough to dictate a suspension from duty for more than 6 months, it merits dismissal instead. Long periods of suspension require other regular or temporary employees to perform the duties of the suspended man while his position must be kept open for his return. Such a situation is obviously not in the public interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-7\"><em>[Town of West New York v. Bock, supra, </em>38 <em>N.J. </em>at 526, 186 A.2d 97.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">We can see no basis for divining, in this connection, a different decisional standard for non-civil-service municipalities than applies to those which have elected to be governed by the Civil Service Act. <em>See In re Disciplinary Hearing of Bruni, supra, </em>166 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 289-91, 399 A.2d 997. The problems engendered by overly long suspensions are the same for every type of municipality. Those problems are especially grave in the smaller municipalities.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">Furthermore, we have, in the past, reflected on how disrespect for superiors, disregard of established performance standards, and perverse use of regular procedures subverts the good order and discipline that is essential to a properly run police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>department. Such acts constitute conduct so unbecoming a police officer as to warrant dismissal. <em>City of Newark v. Massey, </em>93 <em>N.J.Super. </em>317, 322-23, 225 A.2d 723 (App.Div.1967).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-4\">It must be recognized that a police officer is a special kind of public employee. His primary duty is to enforce and uphold the law. * * * He represents law and order to the citizenry and must present an image of personal integrity and dependability in order to have the respect of the public, particularly in a small community____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-5\"><em>[Township of Moorestown v. Armstrong, </em>89 <em>N.J.Super. </em>560, 566, 215 A.2d 775 (App.Div.1965), <em>certif. denied, </em>47 <em>N.J. </em>80, 219 A.2d 417 (1966).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">Having applied these perceptions in <em>City of Newark v. Massey </em>and in <em>Township of Moorestown v. Armstrong </em>to reverse a state administrative agency\u2019s reduction of penalty from dismissal to six months\u2019 suspension \u2014 a context in which the scope of our review is limited by separation of powers considerations \u2014 we are no less constrained to do so in a case such as the instant matter in which we are called upon to articulate and apply a decisional standard for judges to follow, especially in the face of the general policy rationale articulated by the Supreme Court in <em>Town of West New York v. Bock, supra, </em>38 <em>N.J. </em>at 526, 186 A.2d 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">Such a limitation upon the decision maker\u2019s discretion in selecting the appropriate sanction is especially fitting in a case such as this, where the findings of the trial judge, both in his own evaluation and in his adoption of the hearing officer\u2019s assessments, were not only that plaintiff demonstrated a lack of the personal integrity and regard for the community\u2019s welfare that is essential in a police officer, but also that he wholly lacked credibility as a witness. More specifically, with a sustainment of eight charges of basic misconduct that included willful disobedience of orders, neglect of duty, and placing personal interests ahead of police duties in the circumstances established, the infractions charged and established go to the heart of plaintiffs capacity to function appropriately as an officer in the East Newark Police Department. <em>See Henry v. Rahway State Prison, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>571, 580, 410 A.2d 686 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">All the findings are well supported by the record. <em>In re Disciplinary Procedures of Phillips, supra, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>at 579, 569 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>A.2d 807; <em>Rova Farms Resort, Inc. v. Investors Ins. Co., supra, </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>at 484, 323 A.2d 495. We conclude that the trial judge was well warranted in evaluating the circumstances here as amounting to a major breach of conduct and discipline calling for a punishment well in excess of a six-month suspension. We hold that that determination, as a matter of law, requires a sanction of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">The order of the trial court imposing a suspension of plaintiff for one year is reversed and is hereby modified to direct plaintiffs dismissal from the East Newark Police Department. In all other respects the trial court\u2019s order and the findings and conclusions upon which it is based are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b231-13\"> This limitation has a non-congruent counterpart in the Civil Service Act. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>11A:2-19 provides: \"The [Merit System B]oard may increase or decrease the penalty imposed by the appointing authority, but removal shall not be substituted for a lesser penalty.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
