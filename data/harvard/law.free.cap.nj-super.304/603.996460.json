At issue is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>whether an employee\u2019s acceptance of an early retirement incentive package bars him from obtaining unemployment benefits. Appellant was found to have resigned from his position voluntarily without good cause attributable to his employment. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-5(a). We find substantial credible evidence in the record supporting the Board\u2019s conclusion. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(1)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Appellant was employed by AT &amp; T for twelve years. While AT &amp; T was in the process of restructuring, appellant received a letter indicating that there were \u201cmany more people in [his division] than there [would] be following\u201d the reorganization. Appellant was advised that employees could choose to \u201cvolunteer to terminate\u201d their employment under the \u201cAT &amp; T Force Management Program.\u201d According to appellant, he elected to take that course, thus receiving severance pay of $24,594.51 and medical benefits for a period of six months. Prior to receiving the memorandum, appellant allegedly read an article in the Wall Street Journal which he relied upon as indicia that AT &amp; T was in dire financial straits. Appellant added that he did not enjoy a good working relationship with his immediate supervisors. He further noted that after his separation his responsibilities were not transferred to another employee. It is undisputed, however, that other than the general letter to which we have referred, which apparently was sent to all employees in the consumer products division, appellant was never told that his job was at risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">We dealt with this issue in <em>Trupo v. Board of Review, </em>268 <em>N.J.Super. </em>54, 632 A.2d 852 (App.Div.1993). There, we said in <em>dictum </em>that an employee who accepts a voluntary severance package because of a subjective fear of impending job termination was eligible for unemployment benefits if the employee\u2019s fear was based upon compelling \u201cdefinitive objective facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 61, 632 A.2d 852. Because Trupo presented no facts to buttress her belief that her job would actually be eliminated in the impending work reduction, <em>ibid., </em>we had no occasion to apply that principle or resolve the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>Against this backdrop, we cannot fairly say that either the Board of Review or the Appeal Tribunal erred in concluding that appellant failed to sustain his burden of proof. An employee\u2019s reason for leaving his employment \u201cmust meet the test of ordinary common sense and prudence.\u201d <em>Zielenski v. Board of Review, </em>85 <em>N.J.Super. </em>46, 52, 203 A.2d 635 (App.Div.1964). \u201cThe decision to leave employment must be compelled by real, substantial and reasonable circumstances ... attributable to the work.\u201d <em>Domenico v. Labor &amp; Indus. Dep\u2019t of Review, </em>192 <em>N.J.Super. </em>284, 288, 469 A.2d 961 (App.Div.1983). Perhaps, appellant\u2019s decision to voluntarily resign and accept the early retirement package was prudent in light of the employment market and other personal circumstances. But we cannot conclude on the record before us that appellant\u2019s expressed subjective fear was based upon definitive objective facts. Nor can we conclude that the Board\u2019s factual determination to that effect was so wide of the mark that a mistake must have been made. <em>See Stein &amp; Kurland, P.C. v. Board of Review, </em>181 <em>N.J.Super. </em>269, 273, 437 A.2d 332 (App.Div. 1981); <em>Ferry v. Board of Review, </em>131 <em>N.J.Super. </em>99, 99, 328 A.2d 639 (App.Div.1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Mere speculation about job stability is insufficient to establish good cause. Rather, the surrounding circumstances at the time of voluntarily resigning must demonstrate a lack of suitable continuing work either concurrently or at a discernible and proximate point in time, together with statements or actions of the employer showing a very strong likelihood of imminent layoff. The circumstances must be so compelling as to indicate a strong probability that fears about the employee\u2019s job security will in fact materialize, that serious impending threats to his job will be realized, and that the employee\u2019s belief that his job is imminently threatened is well founded. <em>Compare Spatola v. Board of Review, </em>72 <em>N.J.Super. </em>483, 178 A.2d 635 (App.Div.1962) <em>with Philadelphia Parking Auth. v. Unemployment Comp. Bd. of Review, </em>654 A.2d 280 (Pa.Commw.Ct.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>We thus hold that an employee\u2019s acceptance of a \u201cseverance package\u201d or \u201cearly retirement incentive package\u201d bars him from receiving unemployment benefits unless he shows he accepted the package because of a real, imminent, and substantial risk of losing his job. Our conclusion comports with that of other jurisdictions. <em>See York v. Review Bd. of Indiana Employment Sec. Div., </em>425 <em>N.E.2d </em>707 (Ind.Ct.App.1981); <em>McGraw v. Director of Postal Data Center, </em>319 So.2d 797 (La.Ct.App.1975); <em>Saint Joseph Health Center v. Missouri Labor and Indus. Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>768 S.W.2d 123 (Mo.Ct.App.1988); <em>Fisher v. Levine, </em>36 N.Y.S.2d 146, 365 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>828, 325 <em>N.E.2d </em>151 (1975); <em>Appleman, as Commissioner of Labor, </em>211 <em>A.D.2d </em>933, 621 N.Y.S.2d 232 (N.Y.App.Div.1995); <em>In re Fontaine, </em>657 N.Y.S.2d 216 (N.Y.App. Div.1997); <em>In re Raphael, </em>656 N.Y.S.2d 576 (N.Y.App.Div.1997); <em>In re Russo, </em>652 N.Y.S.2d 1021 (N.Y.App.Div.1997); <em>Employment Dep\u2019t v.

Bd. of Review, </em>673 A.2d 434 (Pa.Commw.Ct.1996); <em>Unangst v. Unemployment Comp. Bd. of Review, </em>690 A.2d 1305 (Pa.Commw. Ct.1997); <em>Robinson v. Department of Employment Sec. </em>827 P.2d 250 (Utah.Ct.App.1992); <em>Read v. Employment Sec. Dep\u2019t, </em>62 <em>Wash.App. </em>227, 813 P.2d 1262 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">For example, the New York Court of Appeals has held that an employee who voluntarily leaves his employment in exchange for enhanced retirement benefits has no right to receive unemployment compensation. In <em>Fisher v. Levine, </em>36 N.Y.2d 146, 365 N.Y.S.2d 828, 325 <em>N.E.2d </em>151, a federal postal worker retired early in response to his employer\u2019s request for a voluntary reduction in force. <em>Id. </em>365 N.Y.S.2d at 831, 325 N.E.2d at 152-53. In exchange, the plaintiff received a substantial increase in retirement annuities. <em>Ibid. </em>In upholding the denial of the employee\u2019s claim for benefits, the Court concluded that the plaintiff retired early for noncompelling reasons. <em>Ibid. </em>The Court added that the \u201c[plaintiffs] decision to retire early ... was not the consequence of a Hobson\u2019s choice between an annuity increase or no increase at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>all\u201d because had plaintiff stayed instead of retired, his annuity payments would have gradually increased commensurate with his length of service. <em>Id. </em>365 N.Y.S.2d at 835, 325 N.E.2d at 152-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">Pennsylvania courts too have refused to grant unemployment benefits to individuals who voluntarily resign without the presence of imminent threat of job loss. In <em>Staub v. Unemployment Comp. Bd. of Review, </em>673 A.2d 434, the claimant accepted an early retirement incentive bonus. His decision was based upon the fact that the employer was in the process of restructuring in an effort to reduce costs. The claimant believed that the company was in poor financial condition and was in fear of losing his job. <em>Id. </em>at 435. The Pennsylvania court held that an employer\u2019s offer of an incentive plan, coupled with the employee\u2019s subjective fear of a layoff did not rise to the level of good cause. <em>Id. </em>at 437. In reaching this conclusion, the court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-5\">[W]here at the time of retirement, suitable continuing work is available [and] the employer states that a layoff is possible but not likely, and no other factors are found by the Board that remove an employee\u2019s beliefs from the realm of speculation, a claim for unemployment benefits fails despite the offer to leave.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-6\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">We do not suggest that the facts in <em>Fisher </em>and <em>Staub </em>are identical to this case. However, the similarities are striking. Here, appellant was never definitively informed by his employer that either his department or position was about to be eliminated. AT &amp; T\u2019s memorandum simply informed employees in appellant\u2019s division that a restructuring was to take place, and positions could be lost. As in <em>Fisher </em>and <em>Staub, </em>continuing employment was available to appellant, and he has not demonstrated that he was among the employees who faced a real, imminent, and substantial risk of being discharged. Although this case involves an additional circumstance \u2014 newspaper speculation concerning the financial viability of the employer \u2014 we do not find this fact particularly compelling. We cannot fairly say under these circumstances that appellant has proved that his reason for terminating his employment constituted \u201cgood cause attributable to [his] work.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-5(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>We add that our decision is supported by important public policy considerations. We recognize that \u201ccorporate downsizing\u201d is a common phenomenon in today\u2019s business world, and that job insecurity is not at all irrational. But, unemployment compensation is a last resort mechanism designed to ease the plight of employees whose jobs are terminated or who are otherwise compelled by work conditions to leave. The mere threat or possibility of a layoff constitutes an insufficient basis to trigger the right to receive benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
