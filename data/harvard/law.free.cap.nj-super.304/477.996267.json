When the infant\u2019s mother, defendant\u2019s wife, left Ronald in defendant\u2019s care while she ran some errands, the child was in normal condition. Shortly after she returned home, defendant left. Mrs. Compton heard a noise from Ronald and attempted to pick him up. He was limp and \u201c[h]is eyes were in the back of his head.\u201d She called 911. A police officer who arrived with the ambulance noticed that \u201cthe child was making squealing noises and twitching his arms and his hands, and feet. I took his blood pressure and pulse, and I found them to be low.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>Ronald was taken to one hospital and, within hours, was transferred to another with a pediatric intensive care unit. After tests were conducted, the treating physician, Dr. Sinquee, diagnosed Shaken Baby Syndrome. Following four days of extensive treatment, brain death was established and life support was halted.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Dr. Sinquee, testifying at trial as an expert witness offered by the State, gave details of the brain injuries she diagnosed as Shaken Baby Syndrome which, in her opinion, had caused Ronald\u2019s death. A forensic pathologist employed by the State Medical Examiner\u2019s Office testified, also as an expert witness for the State, that he had performed an autopsy on the child and had concluded that the cause of death was \u201ctraumatic internal hemorrhages\u201d in the brain from an external force or forces. He disagreed that shaking had been the cause of those injuries, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Evidence was received over defendant\u2019s objection that, on three previous occasions, Ronald had sustained injuries when left in defendant\u2019s care. The trial court ruled that the evidence was probative and relevant with respect to the issue of whether the child\u2019s death had been accidental, and was, therefore, permissibly part of the State\u2019s effort to rebut defendant\u2019s claim of accident. There was also evidence from Mrs. Compton and two detectives, all of whom had participated in telephone conversations with defendant in which he admitted that he had squeezed and shaken Ronald on a number of occasions, including on the day in question. After defendant was in custody, he told his wife during a jail visit that, on the day at issue, he had thrown Ronald up in the air; that the infant went through his hands and he dropped the child. Defendant claimed that Ronald looked as if he had passed out, and that he shook the infant in an attempt to revive him.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">The trial court\u2019s ruling admitting the evidence of prior occurrences of harm to the child while in defendant\u2019s care was correct. It was relevant to a material issue, <em>i.e., </em>whether the child\u2019s death was accidental as claimed by defendant, and it met the other standards governing admissibility under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(b). <em>State v. Cofield, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>328, 337-39, 605 A.2d 230 (1992); <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number><em>Moorman, </em>286 <em>N.J.Super. </em>648, 660-63, 670 A.2d 81 (App.Div. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">The remaining issues before us bearing upon the conduct of the trial and rulings made therein were not raised during trial. They are, therefore, subject to <em>R. </em>2:10-2. We dispose of them without reference to plain error considerations, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">We regard the trial judge\u2019s limiting instruction in the general charge to the jury, relating to defendant\u2019s prior conduct with the infant victim, to have been adequate. Although it would have been better to have given that instruction when the evidence was first offered, as well as in the general charge, <em>State v. Johnson, </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>388, 394, 323 A.2d 450 (1974) (Pashman, J., concurring), the omission to do so was not prejudicial. <em>State v. Hummel, </em>132 <em>N.J.Super. </em>412, 424, 334 A.2d 52 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>67 <em>N.J. </em>102, 335 A.2d 54 (1975). Juries have a responsibility faithfully to follow the judge\u2019s instructions whenever given, and we presume that they discharge that duty. <em>State v. Manley, </em>54 <em>N.J. </em>259, 270, 255 A.2d 193 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">It is also clear that the trial court committed no error in admitting Dr. Sinquee\u2019s testimony on Shaken Baby Syndrome. Defendant argues that, with the factual testimony of Mrs. Compton and others concerning the events surrounding Ronald\u2019s death, and the expert testimony of the pathologist that the death was caused by \u201ctraumatic internal hemorrhages,\u201d additional expert testimony from Dr. Sinquee that Shaken Baby Syndrome was the cause of death, was surplusage and, because unnecessary, was unduly prejudicial. Defendant also contends that Dr. Sinquee was not qualified to offer an expert opinion on Shaken Baby Syndrome, and that no adequate foundation had been established for the reliability of her observations and conclusions. Defendant argues further that the general acceptance of Shaken Baby Syndrome within the scientific community, and its reliability as an explanation for the death of the victim, had not been established.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>With respect to the first of these related arguments, we note only that the State was in no way limited from offering evidence of alternative causes of death reflecting its investigations and meeting the explanations advanced by defendant for the injuries that caused the victim\u2019s death. <em>See State v. Moorman, supra, </em>286 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 660, 670 A.2d 81. We are aware of no rule that requires the State to choose a single theory upon which to build its case. <em>See, e.g., State v. Cooper, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>326, 341-42, 700 A.2d 306 (1997); <em>cf. State v. Martin, </em>119 <em>N.J. 2, </em>16-17, 573 A.2d 1359 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Secondly, Dr. Sinquee\u2019s credentials as a physician who was board certified in pediatrics and pediatric critical care, and who served as Director of the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit at United Hospital, along with the details provided, clearly qualified her as an expert in pediatric intensive care. Her training and experience clearly qualified her to testify concerning infants with traumatically induced brain injuries and the potential causes thereof, including Shaken Baby Syndrome. Furthermore, the nature of the injuries she diagnosed and treated, and the manner in which they are typically induced, bore directly upon the issues in the case and were beyond the ken of the average juror. Thus, two of the three standard requirements for admission of expert testimony were satisfied. <em>See Nesmith v. Walsh Trucking Co., </em>123 <em>N.J. </em>547, 548, 589 A.2d 596 (1991); <em>State v. Kelly, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>178, 208, 478 A.2d 364 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">The third criterion, \u201cthat the field testified to must be at a state of the art such that an expert\u2019s testimony could be sufficiently reliable,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>was also not addressed at trial for want of an objection from defendant on that ground. We are satisfied as a <em>post hoc </em>matter, however, that this standard, too, was met.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">There are three methods for establishing the general acceptance and reliability of a new field of research, including medical conditions and diagnoses, not previously judicially recognized. These approaches were definitively described in <em>State v. Kelly:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>(1) by expert testimony as to the general acceptance, among those in the profession, of the premises on which the proffered expert witness based his or her analysis; (2) by authoritative scientific and legal writings indicating that the scientific community accepts the premises underlying the proffered testimony; and (3) by judicial opinions that indicate the expert\u2019s premises have gained general acceptance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-6\"><em>[Id., </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>at 210, 478 A.2d 364.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-7\"><em>See also State v. J.Q., </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>554, 571-74, 617 A.2d 1196 (1993). All three means are available here to qualify Shaken Baby Syndrome as a fitting subject for expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">Dr. Sinquee\u2019s own testimony on the issue of general acceptance was sufficient under the first approach. Although not explored as a preliminary matter in her direct testimony, Dr. Sinquee testified on cross-examination that she was familiar with the literature on Shaken Baby Syndrome, and that it was generally accepted both as descriptive of a condition and as a diagnosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">It is clear, as well, that the condition has been adequately analyzed and recognized in medical research and literature. As Dr. Sinquee testified, Shaken Baby Syndrome was first identified and named by Dr. John Caffey in his seminal article, <em>The Whiplash Shaken Infant Syndrome: Manual Shaking by the Extremities With Whiplash-Induced Intracranial and Intraocular Bleedings, Linked With Residual Permanent Brain Damage and Mental Retardation, </em>54 <em>Pediatrics </em>396 (1974). It is a term used to connote conditions, such as those described in the title, which may typically result from vigorously shaking a young child. Since 1974, the syndrome (also referred to as \u201cwhiplash shaken infant syndrome\u201d or \u201cshaken infant syndrome\u201d) has been recognized authoritatively in medical journals, <em>see, e.g., </em>Derek A. Bruce and Robert A. Zimmerman, <em>Shaken Impact Syndrome, </em>18 <em>Pediatric Annals </em>482 (1989); Randell Alexander, et al., <em>Serial Abuse in Children Who Are Shaken, </em>144 <em>American Journal of Diseases of Children </em>58 (1990); Luke J. Haseler, et al., <em>Evidence From Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy For a Metabolic Cascade of Neuronal Damage in Shaken Baby Syndrome, </em>99 <em>Pediatrics </em>4 (1997); <em>see also </em>Millard Bass, et al., <em>Death-scene Investigation in Sudden Infant Death, </em>315 <em>New England Journal of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number><em>Medicine </em>100, 104, 105 (1986) (citing John Caffey, <em>On the Theory and Practice of Shaking Infants: Its Potential Residual Effects of Permanent Brain Damage and Mental Retardation, </em>124 <em>American Journal of Diseases of Children </em>161 (1972)), in related prints, <em>see, e.g., </em>Showers, <em>Shaken Baby Syndrome, The Problem and a Model for Prevention, </em>21 <em>Children Today </em>34 (1992), and in legal literature, <em>see, e.g., </em>Myma S. Raeder, <em>Navigating Between Scylla and Charybdis: Ohio\u2019s Efforts to Protect Children Without Eviscerating the Rights of Criminal Defendants </em>\u2014 Evidentia<em>ry Considerations and the Rebirth of Confrontation Clause Analysis in Child Abuse Cases, </em>25 <em>U. Tol. L.Rev. </em>43, 140 (1994). We conclude that \u201cthere is sufficient, authoritative legal and medical literature to substantiate the conclusion that [Shaken Baby Syndrome] has been widely accepted in the medical community.\u201d <em>State v. Moorman, supra, </em>286 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 659, 670 A.2d 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Finally, \u201cnumerous other jurisdictions have accepted [Shaken Baby Syndrome] as a reliable scientific premise.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Explicit judicial recognition has been accorded in at least two states. <em>See State v. McClary, </em>207 <em>Conn. </em>233, 541 A.2d 96, 101-03 (1988); <em>State v. Lopez, </em>306 <em>S.C. </em>362, 412 S.E.2d 390, 393 (1991); <em>see also In re Lou R., </em>131 <em>Misc.2d </em>138, 499 N.Y.S.2d 846, 848-50 (N.Y.Fam.Ct. 1986); <em>In re Renae Ebony W., </em>192 <em>W.Va. </em>421, 452 S.E.2d 737, 741 (1994). Many more courts, including our own Supreme Court in <em>State v. Galloway, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>631, 638, 628 A.2d 735 (1993), have recognized the condition implicitly, by acknowledging expert testimony describing the syndrome in connection with a particular case at bar, or treating it as an accepted medical condition without further comment. <em>See Dabbs v. </em>State, 518 <em>So.</em>2d 825, 826-27 (Ala.Crim.App.1987); <em>In re B.S., </em>697 So.2d 914, 916 (Fla.App.2 Dist.1997); <em>Jones v.

Kelly, supra, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>at 210, 478 A.2d 364. Thus, we conclude that the trial court committed no error in admitting Dr. Sinquee\u2019s testimony concerning the condition and its bearing upon this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">Defendant\u2019s argument that he was denied effective assistance of counsel, <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>668, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); <em>United States v. Cronic, </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>648, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>2039, 80 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>657 (1984); <em>State v. Fritz, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>42, 519 A.2d 336 (1987), is based primarily upon the failure of trial counsel to object or raise questions in respect of the foregoing issues, thereby relegating them to plain error grounds on appeal. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>have considered each such issue fully, however, without plain error constraints, and have determined the trial court to have been correct in every instance. It follows that no actual prejudice befell defendant as a result of trial counsel\u2019s \u201comissions.\u201d Therefore, the second requirement of the two-part test of <em>Strickland, supra, </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>at 687, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2064, 80 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>at 693, adopted in <em>Fritz, supra, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>at 58, 519 A.2d 336, \u201cthat the deficient performance prejudiced the defense,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 52, 519 A.2d 336, has not been met. To the extent there may be any <em>Strickland!Cron</em>ic/Fritz-type merit to defendant\u2019s additional contention that trial counsel was deficient in failing to call an expert witness to rebut Dr. Sinquee\u2019s testimony concerning Shaken Baby Syndrome, we leave that issue to fuller development in a proceeding for post-conviction relief. <em>See State v. Preciose, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>451, 460, 609 A.2d 1280 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Defendant argues that an inherent inconsistency between the jury\u2019s verdicts of not guilty with respect to reckless manslaughter and guilty with respect to aggravated manslaughter invalidated the verdict. That argument is entirely without merit. <em>R. </em>2:11\u20143(e)(2). The trial judge was correct to conclude that the jury verdict was entitled to deference because there had been sufficient evidence to prove each and every element of aggravated manslaughter beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Kluber, </em>130 <em>N.J.Super. </em>336, 341-42, 327 A.2d 232 (App.Div.1974), <em>certif. denied, </em>67 <em>N.J. </em>72, 335 A.2d 25 (1975). The trial court\u2019s reliance on <em>State v. Myers, </em>239 <em>N.J.Super. </em>158, 170-71, 570 A.2d 1260 (App. Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>323, 604 A.2d 598 (1990), in denying defendant\u2019s <em>R. </em>3:18-2 motion for a judgment of acquittal notwithstanding the verdict was, accordingly, likewise correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">None of the issues defendant raises respecting the sentence have merit, either. <em>R. </em>2:11\u20143(e)(2). The balancing of aggravating and mitigating factors was appropriate, <em>State v. Sainz, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>283, 288-91, 526 A.2d 1015 (1987); and the concurrent, presumptive sentences were well within the trial court\u2019s discretion to impose. <em>State v. Ghertler, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>383, 387-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>88, 555 A.2d 553 (1989); <em>State v. Roth, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>334, 359, 471 A.2d 370 (1984). <em>See also State v. Miller, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>112, 527 A.2d 1362 (1987); <em>State v. Still, </em>257 <em>N.J.Super. </em>255, 259, 608 A.2d 404 (App.Div.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
