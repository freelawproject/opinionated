Moore and Jeffrey T. Felton were jointly tried and convicted of first degree possession with intent to distribute more than five ounces of cocaine, contrary to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-5a(1), -5b(1) (count one), and possession of cocaine, contrary to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-10a(1) (count two). The trial judge merged count two into count one and sentenced both defendants to a term of fifteen years in the custody of the Commissioner of Corrections with a five year parole ineligibility term on the first count. Defendants\u2019 driver\u2019s licenses were suspended for eighteen months, and a $3,000 Drug Enforcement Demand Reduction penalty, a $75 Safe Neighborhood Service Fund assessment, a $50 Violent Crimes Compensation Board penalty, and a $50 forensic laboratory fee were imposed on each.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">In his appeal Moore argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-8\">POINT I <em>THE TRIAL COURT COMMITTED PLAIN ERROR IN ITS INSTRUCTIONS TO THE JURY, REQUIRING A REVERSAL OF DEFENDANT\u2019S CONVICTION </em>[Not Raised Below]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-9\">a. <em>The trial court committed, reversible error when it instructed the jury with respect to N.J.S.A. 2C:S5-5 that the \u201cState need not prove the Defendant\u2019s knowledge of the quantity of drugs ...\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-10\">b. <em>The trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on \u201cmere presence\u201d as an essential part of the definition of \u201cconstructive\" possession</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-11\">e. <em>The trial judge committed reversible error\u2022 in failing to instruct the jury sua sponte in accordance with State v.

However, we reverse Felton\u2019s conviction because of constitutional error directed to his assertion of the right to counsel and remand for a new trial as to Felton. The merged count shall, of course, be unmerged for such purposes. We affirm Moore\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-13\">Felton was a passenger in a car being driven by Moore. The car bore North Carolina \u201cdealer\u201d license plates when stopped on the New Jersey Turnpike. Moore consented to a search of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>car, and cocaine was discovered in the trunk between the spare tire and the tire\u2019s rim.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">The trial proofs included evidence, as detailed in the State\u2019s briefs, which were substantially identical, as follows:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7T\">Trooper Bell testified that he learned on the date of the arrest that neither Felton nor Moore owned the Honda. Bell also described how he, Detective John McNally and Detective Jeff McCarthy questioned Felton while at headquarters. Defendant told the officers that he graduated from North Carolina Central College and that he was employed at a Jiffy Lube as a mechanic. He explained that he and Moore were childhood friends. Felton stated Moore and his niece were driving to New York to visit somebody. He rode along with them and visited his girlfriend while in the city. Felton stated that Trooper Bell stopped them on their return <em>trip </em>to North Carolina. When asked about the cocaine, Felton asked for an attorney and the interrogation ceased. Next, Trooper Bell and the two detectives questioned Moore. Despite having told Trooper Bell at the scene of the stop that he had borrowed the Honda from his former employer, Cherry Used Cars, Moore informed the officers that he had purchased the Honda at an automobile auction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-7\">[Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">The State\u2019s proofs also included evidence regarding the search and expert testimony concerning the cocaine and its impact on defendants\u2019 intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">A <em>Miranda </em>hearing was held to determine the admissibility of statements made by the defendants after their arrest. The arresting officer, State Trooper David Bell, testified at the hearing, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-10\">Q Now, after they were given their warnings did, were they questioned?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-11\">A Yes, sir. They were.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-12\">Q And do you recall the questioning of Mr. Felton?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-13\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-14\">Q And you were present for that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-15\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-16\">Q What was it, an oral or written statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-17\">A It was an oral statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-18\">Q Do you recall the substance of that statement that he gave?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-19\">A I do recall it. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-20\">Q What did he say? What did Mr. Felton first say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>A He stated, aside from personal background, but pertaining to the case, he stated that he had come for a ride with his friend on a Monday morning, the day prior, to drop off his friend\u2019s niece, Charles Moore\u2019s niece.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-5\">Q Did he indicate the niece\u2019s name?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-6\">A I believe it was Tasha.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-7\">Q And did he indicate that he dropped her off in Manhattan at Ninety-Fifth Street?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-8\">A Yes. He did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-9\">Q And did he indicate where they were heading when they were stopped by you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQI\">A They were heading back toward North Carolina. Home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-10\">Q Did you ask Mr. Felton the name of Tasha\u2019s boyfriend?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-11\">A I believe that was Detective McCarthy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-12\">Q Did you hear Detective McCarthy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-13\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-14\">Q Did you hear what his answer was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-15\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-16\">Q What was it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-17\">A He stated he couldn\u2019t remember the name.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-18\">Q And did you ask him also if he knew about the cocaine in the vehicle?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-19\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-20\">Q And what did he say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-21\">A He stated that he knew nothing of it and X believe at that point he asked for an attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-22\">Q Did you \u2014 Did the questioning cease at that point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-23\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-24\">Over objection of both defendants the trial judge ruled that defendant\u2019s request for counsel was admissible. The judge apparently agreed with the State that the State was entitled to show \u201cwhy the questioning ceased.\u201d The judge ultimately ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-25\">There may be testimony, and certainly there was already testimony from the trooper, that he advised the Defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. The <em>Miranda </em>rights are you have the right to remain silent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-26\">You have the right to an attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-27\">You don\u2019t have to make any statements, or something similar to that, until you speak to an attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-28\">He said, \u201cI want an attorney.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-29\">He could have said I want to remain silent and he could have said a lot of things. All those things would be admissible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-30\">Therefore, the Court finds the statement where he chose to follow the <em>Miranda </em>warnings and stated \u201cI want an attorney\u201d is admissible in evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>Trooper Bell\u2019s testimony regarding Felton\u2019s interrogation was more abbreviated at trial. We quote the colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-6\">Q Who did you question first, Mr. Felton or Mr. Moore?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-7\">(No response.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-8\">Q Do you recall?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-9\">A I didn\u2019t question any of them at the, during the processing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-10\">Q I mean at some point at headquarters at the processing were either of them, did you talk to either of them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-12\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-13\">Q Did you talk to both of them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-14\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-15\">Q Where, where did you talk to Mr. Felton?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-16\">A In the Detective Bureau in the back of our barracks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-17\">Q Who was there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-18\">A It was myself, Detective John McNally and Detective Jeff McCarthy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-19\">Q And who did you interview first?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-20\">A We interviewed Mr. Felton first.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-21\">Q Now, did he indicate to you at headquarters why he had traveled to New York?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-22\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-23\">Q Why?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-24\">A He stated that he just took a ride with his friend to drop off his niece in New York.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-26\">Q How did the questioning of Mr. Felton end?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-27\">A When he was asked about the cocaine in the car he stated that he wanted to talk to an attorney first.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-29\">Q And at that point you stopped questioning him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-30\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-31\">Q And that\u2019s because that\u2019s your procedure in the barracks?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-32\">A That\u2019s his constitutional right. Yes. That\u2019s it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-33\">Both defendants objected to the testimony. They pointed out that at the pretrial hearing Trooper Bell had testified that Felton indicated he knew \u201cnothing about the drugs,\u201d while at trial the prosecutor almost immediately inquired about why the interview had ended, receiving the answer that Felton had asked for an attorney as soon as he was questioned about his knowledge of the cocaine. Hence, they claimed the trial testimony created a \u201cwhole different meaning\u201d and a \u201cfalse impression\u201d and was \u201ctotally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>inconsistent with the proffer.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendants also noted a Fifth Amendment violation of the \u201cprivilege to remain silent.\u201d Moore\u2019s counsel said there was no \u201cway of curing it\u201d and \u201c[d]idn\u2019t see how you can cure it with a curative charge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The defense moved for a mistrial contending that the jurors would have to believe that invocation of the right to counsel was inconsistent with defendants\u2019 lack of knowledge of the existence of the cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">The prosecutor noted his lack of objection to a limiting instruction as to the right of a defendant to invoke \u201chis right\u201d to request an attorney and that the \u201cofficer acted properly in stopping questioning at that point.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">The court then ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-8\">As the Court earlier indicated, the statement is admissible in evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-9\">The Court will give an instruction to the jury that they are not to conclude that, one, exercising a constitutional right to remain silent, that that is to be used against him or any adverse inference is to be drawn. That\u2019s number one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-10\">The Court finds that the moment the Defendant stated he wanted an attorney the trooper ceased any further interrogation and respected the Defendant\u2019s right to remain silent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-11\">The conclusion is that the State has proved beyond a reasonable doubt, which is the standard of proof, that when Defendant made that statement he was previously advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and he made the statement, and the statement is admissible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-12\">The Court will tell the jury the mere fact that he exercised his right to remain silent, an adverse inference is not to be drawn against him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-13\">The application for a mistrial is denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-14\">The Court finds that there has not been such prejudice shown against either Defendant of the testimony of the trooper that would warrant such a, an extreme finding, or a finding of impropriety or improper conduct or statements that are so contradictory that a mistrial should be granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-15\">However, no limiting instruction was immediately given. The next day after all evidence was presented, the judge indicated he would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>give the instruction, but Felton\u2019s counsel asked the judge not to \u201crepeat it now or highlight\u201d the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">In <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 <em>U.S. </em>610, 618, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>2240, 2245, 49 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d 91, 98 (1976), the United States Supreme Court held that the <em>Miranda </em>warning contained an implied promise that \u201csilence will carry no penalty\u201d and that <em>post-Miranda </em>silence could not be used \u201cto impeach an explanation subsequently offered [by the defendant] at trial.\u201d In <em>Wainwright v. Greenfield, </em>474 <em>U.S. </em>284, 295 n. 13, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>634, 640 n. 13, 88 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>623, 632 n. 13 (1986), the Supreme Court noted that <em>post-Miranda </em>silence (there used to counter an insanity defense) \u201cincludes the statement of a desire to remain silent, as well as of a desire to remain silent until an attorney has been consulted.\u201d Under <em>Greenfield, </em>\u201c[w]hat is impermissible is the evidentiary use of an individual\u2019s exercise of his constitutional rights after the State\u2019s assurance that the invocation of those rights will not be penalized.\u201d 474 <em>U.S. </em>at 295, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 640, 88 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d at 632; <em>see also State v. Lyle, </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>403, 375 A.2d 629 (1977); <em>State v. Deatore, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>100, 358 A.2d 163 (1976); <em>State v. Ripa, </em>45 <em>N.J. </em>199, 204, 212 A.2d 22 (1965) (pre-<em>Miranda); State v. Hyde, 292 N.J.Super. </em>159, 678 A.2d 717 (App.Div.1996); <em>compare State v. Carroll, </em>256 <em>N.J.Super. </em>575, 601-02, 607 A.2d 1003 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>18, 611 A.2d 656 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">The State was entitled to develop what Felton told the troopers in order to establish his relationship with Moore, to show he was not a \u201cmere passenger\u201d in the car and to develop an inference of his knowledge of its contents. The State contends that Trooper Bell\u2019s reference to defendant Felton\u2019s request for an attorney was relevant to why his questioning at headquarters ended so abruptly. Our view of the case might be different had the State developed before the jury the colloquy referred to at the pretrial hearing followed by an immediate and effective limiting instruction. However, even then the State had an obligation to \u201ccarefully frame[ ] questions\u201d to avoid \u201cany mention of the defendant\u2019s exercise of his constitutional rights to remain silent and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>consult counsel.\u201d <em>Greenfield, supra, </em>474 <em>U.S. </em>at 295, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 640, 88 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">As developed the trial testimony regarding his statement essentially referred to Felton\u2019s invocation of the right to counsel and had to be understood as inculpatory. The undue prejudice to Felton is clear because he was a passenger who had no involvement with the car before the trip to New York and his knowledge of the existence of cocaine in the trunk was the only real issue in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">We find no basis for reversing as to Moore. He testified and told the jury that he had placed the bid, or was with his brother-in-law who placed the successful bid, on the car at an auction from which it was purchased for the brother-in-law\u2019s used car dealership from which Moore borrowed it for the trip to New York. He thus responded to admitted testimony that at the scene of the stop he told Bell that \u201che had borrowed the car\u201d from the dealership where he worked and a subsequent statement at headquarters that he had purchased the car \u201cat an auction.\u201d He also described his trip with Felton while taking his niece to New York. They were stopped on the Turnpike while on their way back to North Carolina.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">Moore denied knowledge that there were drugs in the trunk. The woman with whom Moore left his niece in New York confirmed much of Moore\u2019s explanation of the timing of defendants\u2019 arrival at and departure from her New York apartment. There was a two-to-three hour difference between the time defendants were said to leave the apartment and the Turnpike stop, and defendant testified he got caught in traffic at the George Washington Bridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">We need not explore Moore\u2019s standing or ability to assert the breach of Felton\u2019s constitutional rights in furtherance of his claim that the admission of Felton\u2019s assertion of the right to counsel requires reversal of Moore\u2019s conviction. Here we find an insuffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>cient showing of prejudice to warrant reversal. <em>Cf. State v. Deatore, supra, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>at 106-07, 358 A.2d 163.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">There was no suggestion that Moore declined to talk with the police; in fact, Bell testified about Moore\u2019s post-arrest interview which following the giving of <em>Miranda </em>warnings and, unlike Felton, Moore testified before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">As the case must be retried as to Felton, we add the following: In <em>State v. Torres, </em>236 <em>N.J.Super. </em>6, 13, 563 A.2d 1141 (App.Div.1989), <em>certif. denied, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>153, 584 A.2d 222 (1990), we held \u201cthat in prosecutions under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-5 the jury must find that defendant manufactured, distributed, dispensed or possessed the relevant quantity or quality of C.D.S. by proof beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d but \u201cthat the quantity and quality are not elements of the offense and, therefore, the State need not prove and the jury need not find that the defendant knew the quantity or the quality of the controlled dangerous substances involved.\u201d We added, however, that \u201cthe State has the burden of proving that the defendant purposely or knowingly\u201d manufactured, distributed, dispensed or possessed the relevant quality or quantity. <em>Id. </em>at 13, 563 A.2d 1141. In other words, while the State has to prove how much the defendant possessed in order to satisfy the Code\u2019s grading provisions, and the jury has to so find beyond a reasonable doubt, the State does not have to prove that the defendant knew how much he possessed so long as it found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knowingly possessed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">Defendants are incorrect in their contention that <em>State v. Florez, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>570, 636 A.2d 1040 (1994), held that it was plain error not to charge the jury that it had to find that defendant knew the relevant weight. In <em>Florez, </em>there was no instruction to the jury concerning weight of the cocaine as an element. There, the State conceded that weight was a material element of the offense of possession with intent to distribute and that the failure to instruct the jury on the weight as an element \u201crequires reversal of the second degree conspiracy conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 595, 636 A.2d 1040. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>Reversing on other grounds, the Court added that \u201cwe conclude that when this case is retried, the trial court should instruct the jury on the weight of the cocaine as an element of the crime charged.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>at 595, 636 A.2d 1040.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Defendants seize on this language to argue their plain error claim. Here, as <em>Florez </em>directs, the jury was instructed as to the weight that had to be found to sustain the first degree conviction. The jury was expressly instructed that \u201c[i]t is the State\u2019s burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the quantity of cocaine involved\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that it must determine the relevant quantity necessary for grading purposes. In its verdict the jury found that both defendants possessed \u201cfive ounces or more.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">The jury was not instructed \u2014 and <em>Florez </em>does not require an instruction \u2014 that defendant had to know that weight. In fact, the only case cited in <em>Florez </em>on this issue, <em>State v. Roberson, </em>246 <em>N.J.Super. </em>597, 607, 588 A.2d 434 (App.Div.1991), cites <em>Torres </em>but vacated the second degree conviction because the jury did not determine whether defendant possessed the requisite 3.5 grams of pure free base.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>We find no need to discuss the other issues raised. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(2); <em>State v.
