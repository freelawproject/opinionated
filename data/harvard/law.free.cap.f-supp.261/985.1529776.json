The plaintiff seeks an order enjoining the defendant from prosecuting him under section 781-b<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the New York Penal Law, McKinney\u2019s Con-sol.Laws, c. 40, which the plaintiff contends is violative of the First Amendment as made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. The defendant has made a cross-motion to dismiss the amended complaint upon the grounds (1) that this court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction and (2) that the amended complaint fails to state a claim upon which this court can grant relief. For the reasons hereinafter stated, the plaintiff\u2019s motion is denied; the defendant\u2019s motion is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-12\">The New York statute under attack prohibits, among other things, and renders criminal the distribution of anonymous political literature \u201cin quantity.\u201d A first offense under the statute is punishable as a misdemeanor; subsequent offenses, however, constitute felonies. At the present time the plaintiff is not distributing anonymously any such political literature nor is he being prosecuted for any such distribution made by him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>prior to the institution of this action. He grounds his amended complaint and his motion for an injunction primarily upon what happened to him during the 1964 political campaign and his apprehension as to what may transpire during 1966 and subsequent political campaigns.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-5\">During the 1964 political campaign, the plaintiff distributed an anonymous leaflet<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> critical of a named candidate for reelection to the House of Representatives. He was charged with a violation of section 781-b of the New York Penal Law and found guilty after a trial (at which he presented no evidence) by the Criminal Court of the City of New York, County of Kings, despite his contention that section 781-b violates the Fourteenth Amendment. People v. Zwickler (Crim.Ct., N.Y. City, Kings Co., Feb. 10, 1965, unreported). The judgment of conviction was \u201cunanimously reversed on the facts.\u201d People v. Zwickler (Sup.Ct., App.T., Kings Co., April 23, 1965, unreported) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1059-6\">\u201cIn our opinion, the People failed to establish that defendant distributed anonymous literature \u2018in quantity\u2019 in</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1059-15\">violation of the provisions of Section 781(b) [sic] of the Penal Law. We do not reach the question of the constitutionality of the statute involved.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AF7\">The New York Court of Appeals affirmed without opinion the reversal of the judgment of conviction. People v. Zwickler, 16 N.Y.2d 1069, 266 N.Y.S.2d 140, 213 N.E.2d 467 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-16\">Prior to September 1, 1962, section 781-b applied only to the anonymous printing and reproduction (not the distribution) \u201cin quantity\u201d of political literature in connection with any election of public officers or of candidates for nomination for public office. It did not apply to such literature in connection with any election of party officials or candidates for nomination for a party position. It was not until September 1, 1962 that this section was expanded to apply to <em>distribution </em>of such literature \u201cin quantity.\u201d L.1962, c. 576, eff. September 1, 1962. Prior to this 1962 amendment, one Robert Clampitt distributed anonymous handbills in connection with a primary election for the selection of a district leader of the Democratic Party. He was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>running in that primary in opposition to the incumbent, who was seeking redesignation. Clampitt was charged with a violation of section 781-b. At the close of the People\u2019s case, Clampitt\u2019s motion to dismiss the information was granted and he was discharged. People v. Clampitt, 34 Misc.2d 766, 222 N.Y.S.2d 23 (Ct. Spec.Sess.N.Y.Co.1961). The court held that (1) section 781-b did not apply to anonymous literature in connection with an election of candidates for party office; (2) that it did not apply to the distribution of anonymous political literature and (3) that, even as to those instances to which it did apply, it was \u201cvoid for indefiniteness and uncertainty.\u201d \u201cJust what is meant by \u2018in quantity\u2019 is not defined. How much or how little is \u2018in quantity\u2019?\u201d \u201cThe public should not be compelled to indulge in guessing games where violations of criminal law are concerned.\u201d <em>Clampitt, </em>supra, 34 Misc.2d at 768, 222 N.Y.S.2d at 25-26. The \u201cin quantity\u201d aspect of the validity of the section was not passed upon by the New York Court of Appeals in <em>Zwickler, </em>supra. Nor did that court consider the constitutionality of section 781-b under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States or under Article 1, section 8 of the Constitution of the State of New York.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1060-6\">In his amended complaint, the plaintiff alleges his intention and desire to distribute in the future and \u201cin quantities of more than a thousand copies\u201d the anonymous leaflet he distributed in 1964 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cand similar anonymous leaflets, all prepared by and at the instance of a person other than the plaintiff\u201d; to do so \u201cat any time during the election campaign of 1966 and in subsequent election campaigns or in connection with any election of party officials, nomination for public office and party position that may occur subsequent to said election campaign of 1966.\u201d The plaintiff does not accuse Aaron E. Koota, the District Attorney of Kings County, New York, of bad faith. Rather, he praises him as a \u201cdiligent and conscientious public officer\u201d and presumes to read Mr. Koota\u2019s mind by alleging that Mr. Koota \u201cpursuant to his duties intends or will again prosecute the plaintiff for his [intended] acts of distribution\u201d of anonymous political literature. He regards this presumption as \u201cthe threat of prosecution\u201d which places him \u201cin fear of exercising his right to make distribution as aforesaid\u201d and which places him \u201cin danger of again being prosecuted therefor.\u201d Upon these assumptions he grounds his prayers for relief for (1) a declaration that section 781-b is unconstitutional as violative of the First and Fourteenth Amendments; (2) an injunction restraining the defendant from prosecuting him for his intended distributions of political literature and (3) an injunction pendente lite. From a reading of the amended complaint, it would appear that it has been drafted in the hope of bringing this case within Dombrow-ski v. Pfister, 380 U.S. 479, 85 S.Ct. 1116, 14 L.Ed.2d 22 (1965). And, as a matter of fact, the memorandum of law of plaintiff\u2019s counsel leans heavily upon that opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-10\">The threshold question is whether or not this court should temper the exercise of its equitable power to enjoin the defendant. As far back as Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908), the Supreme Court recognized the power of a federal court to enjoin a threatened prosecution by a state official under a state statute in a case reasonably free from doubt. \u201c[N]o injunction ought to be granted unless in a case reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>free from doubt. We think such rule is, and will be, followed by all the judges of the Federal courts.\u201d 209 U.S. at 166-167, 28 S.Ct. at 457. Since <em>Young, </em>supra, \u201cconsiderations of federalism have tempered the exercise of equitable power, for the Court has recognized that federal interference with a State\u2019s goodfaith administration of its criminal laws is peculiarly inconsistent with our federal framework.\u201d <em>Dombrowski, </em>supra, 380 U.S. at 484, 85 S.Ct. at 1119-1120. The complaint states a claim under the Civil Rights Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(4), since it alleges a deprivation of a right guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. It alleges a case or controversy which is within the adjudicatory power of this court. Douglas v. City of Jeannette, 319 U.S. 157, 162, 63 S.Ct. 877, 880, 87 L.Ed. 1324 (1943). This is not to say, however, that this court necessarily agrees with the plaintiff\u2019s contention that \u201cfreedom of expression\u201d includes freedom to express one\u2019s views by criticizing a named public officer or a named candidate for public office, under the cloak of anonymity. This question was not involved in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed. 2d 686 (1964). See Bertelsman, Libel and Public Men, 52 A.B.A.J. 657 (July 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-5\"> The fact that a case is within the adjudicatory power of this court does not necessarily require that its power be exercised. As a general rule and policy a district court, on its own motion, may, in its discretion, refuse to act. \u201cEspecially should it do so where its powers are invoked to interfere by injunction with threatened criminal prosecutions in a state court.\u201d <em>Douglas, </em>supra, 319 U.S. at 162, 63 S.Ct. at 880. In <em>Douglas, </em>the plaintiffs, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, brought suit in a district court to restrain threatened criminal prosecution in a state court for violation of a city ordinance which prohibited the solicitation of orders for merchandise without first procuring a city license, claiming that the city ordinance violated the Fourteenth Amendment. The trial court found that certain of the plaintiffs and other Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses had been prosecuted previously by the defendants for distributing literature without having first obtained a license and having paid a tax therefor; that the defendants had declared their intention further to enforce the ordinance against the plaintiffs. But the trial court made no finding of threatened irreparable injury to the plaintiffs. As to this, the Supreme Court said; \u201cwe cannot say that the declared intention to institute other prosecutions is sufficient to establish irreparable injury in the circumstances of this case.\u201d <em>Douglas, </em>supra, 319 U.S. at 164, 63 S.Ct. at 881. On the same day the Court rendered its opinion in Murdock v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 319 U.S. 105, 63 S.Ct. 870, 87 L.Ed. 1292, involving the same city ordinance under which Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses were prosecuted for distributing religious literature and soliciting the purchase of religious books and pamphlets. <em>Murdock </em>presented a single issue \u201c[T]he constitutionality of an ordinance which as construed and applied requires religious col-porteurs to pay a license tax as a condition to the pursuit of their activities.\u201d <em>Murdock, </em>supra, 319 U.S. at 110, 63 S.Ct. at 873. The convictions of the defendants in the state court were reversed on the ground that the ordinance imposed a tax upon the constitutional rights of the free exercise of religion, freedom of speech and freedom of the press. And because the Court held invalid in <em>Murdock </em>the same city ordinance under review in <em>Douglas, </em>it affirmed in <em>Douglas </em>the reversal by the Court of Appeals of the judgment for the plaintiff in the district court. Since an injunction looks to the future and \u201cin view of the decision rendered today in Murdock, et al. v. Pennsylvania, supra, we find no ground for supposing that the intervention of a federal court, in order to secure petitioners\u2019 constitutional rights, will be either necessary or appropriate.\u201d <em>Douglas, </em>supra, 319 U.S. at 165, 63 S.Ct. at 882. The Court said that \u201ccourts of equity do not ordinarily restrain criminal prosecutions. No person is immune from prosecution <em>in </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number><em>good faith </em>for his alleged criminal acts. Its imminence, even though alleged to be in violation of constitutional guarantees, is not a ground for equity relief since the lawfulness or constitutionality of the statute or ordinance on which the prosecution is based may be determined as readily in the criminal case as in a suit for an injunction. * * * Where the threatened prosecution is by state officers for alleged violation of a state law, the state courts are the final arbiters of its meaning and application, subject only to review by this Court on federal grounds appropriately asserted. Hence the arrest by the federal courts of the processes of the criminal law within the states, and the determination of questions of criminal liability under state law by a federal court of equity, are to be supported <em>only on a showing of danger of irreparable injury \u2018both great and immediate\u2019 \u201d Douglas, </em>supra, 319 U.S. at 163-164, 63 S.Ct. at 881. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-4\">It may be argued that the principle of abstention illustrated by <em>Douglas, </em>supra, is inapposite because, on the very day <em>Douglas </em>was decided, the Supreme Court had held the statute involved therein to be unconstitutional in <em>Murdoch, </em>supra. However, subsequent cases demonstrate that the doctrine of judicial abstention remains fully viable. In Harrison v. N. A. A. C. P., 360 U.S. 167, 79 S.Ct. 1025, 3 L.Ed.2d 1152 (1959), decided several years after <em>Douglas </em>and involving Fourteenth Amendment rights, a three-judge statutory court permanently enjoined the Attorney General of Virginia and other officials from enforcing certain statutes of the Commonwealth of Virginia which imposed conditions upon the right to make public solicitation of funds and to expend such funds for litigation involving racial segregation. N. A. A. C. P. v. Patty, 159 F.Supp. 503 (E.D.Va.1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-5\">The state statutes involved had not been authoritatively construed by the courts of Virginia. Nevertheless the three-judge court felt that it should not abstain; that it should pass upon the constitutionality of these statutes because it considered them free from ambiguity and that there was no reasonable interpretation which would render them constitutional. It held certain chapters of the law to be unconstitutional and permanently enjoined their enforcement. As to two chapters the court did not pass upon their constitutionality. Rather, it retained jurisdiction and allowed the complaining parties a reasonable time within which to obtain a state interpretation. On appeal, the Supreme Court vacated the judgment and remanded the case with instructions so. as to afford the Virginia courts a reasonable opportunity to construe the statutes, believing as it did, that they were fairly open to interpretation and that the state courts should have been afforded a reasonable opportunity to pass upon them. The Supreme Court did not agree that the statutes left no reasonable room for a construction by the Virginia courts which might avoid in whole or in part the nec\u00e9s-sity for federal constitutional adjudication or at least materially change the nature of the problem. It referred to the well-established principle of abstention:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1062-7\">\u201cThis now well-established procedure is aimed at the avoidance of unnecessary interference by the federal courts with proper and validly administered state concerns, a course so essential to the balanced working of our federal system. * * * In the service of this doctrine, which this Court has applied in many different contexts, no principle has found more consistent or clear expression than that the federal courts should not adjudicate the constitutionality of state enactments fairly open to interpretation until the state courts have been afforded a reasonable opportunity to pass upon them. * * * This principle does not, of course, involve the abdication of federal jurisdiction, but only the postponement of its exercise; it serves the policy of comity inherent in the doctrine of abstention; and it spares the federal courts of unnecessary constitutional adjudication.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1063-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>\u25a0\u00bb*\u2022\u00bb***</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1063-5\">We do not intimate the slightest view as to what effect any such determinations might have upon the validity of these statutes. All we hold is that these enactments should be exposed to state construction or limiting interpretation before the federal courts are asked to decide upon their constitutionality, so that federal judgment will be based on something that is a complete product of the State, the enactment as phrased by its legislature and as construed by its highest court. * * * And of course we shall not assume that the Virginia courts will not do their full duty in judging these statutes in light of state and federal constitutional requirements.\u201d 360 U.S. 176-178, 79 S.Ct. 1030-1031.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1063-6\">The abstention doctrine is not an automatic rule applied whenever a federal court is faced with a doubtful issue of state law. It involves a discretionary exercise of a court\u2019s equity powers. In Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U.S. 360, 84 S.Ct. 1316,12 L.Ed.2d 377 (1964), the Supreme Court reversed a three-judge United States District Court which abstained and refused to pass upon the constitutionality of a state statute. Whether the court should have abstained, said the Supreme Court, depended upon \u201cwhether there exist the \u2018special circumstances,\u2019 * * * prerequisite to its application * * It found that such \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d were not present and, therefore, that the three-judge court should not have abstained from passing upon the constitutional question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-10\">In Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U.S. 479, 85 S.Ct. 1116, the Supreme Court reversed a three-judge statutory court which had dismissed the complaint in an action under the Civil Rights Act to restrain the defendants from prosecuting the plaintiffs for alleged violations of the Louisiana Subversive Activities and Communist Control Law and Communist Propaganda Control Law. Here, the Supreme Court looked for special circumstances to justify the exercise of federal court jurisdiction rather than for special circumstances to justify a federal court in abstaining to exercise its jurisdiction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AA91\">\u201cAnd in a variety of other contexts the Court has found no special circumstances to warrant cutting short the normal adjudication of constitutional defenses in the course of a criminal prosecution.\u201d 380 U.S. at 485, 85 S.Ct. at 1120.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1063-12\">It found the presence of such special circumstances in <em>Dombrowski </em>and, therefore, reversed the judgment of the three-judge court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-13\">The complaint in <em>Dombrowski, </em>supported by affidavits and a written offer of proof, alleged that the threats to enforce the statutes were not made with any expectation of securing valid convictions but, rather, were part of a plan to employ arrests, seizures and threats of prosecution under color of the statutes to harass the appellants and discourage them and their supporters from asserting and attempting to vindicate the constitutional rights of the citizens of Louisiana. The Supreme Court noted probable jurisdiction in order to resolve a seeming conflict between the decision of the lower court in 227 F.Supp. 556 and the later decision of the Supreme Court in Baggett v. Bullitt, supra, \u201cand to settle important questions concerning federal injunctions against state criminal prosecutions threatening constitutionally protected expression.\u201d 386 U.S. at 483, 85 S.Ct. at 1119. There, the good faith of the enforcement officers was attacked. The appellants claimed that these officers invoked and threatened to continue to invoke criminal process without any hope of ultimate success, but only to discourage the civil rights activities of the appellants. Dombrowski and others were arrested by Louisiana state and local police and charged with violations of the two state statutes. Their offices were raided and their files and records seized. At gunpoint their homes and offices were raided and ransacked by police officers and trustees of the House of Detention, acting under the direct supervision of the staff director, and the counsel for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"992\">*992</page-number>State Un-American Activities Committee. The home and office of the director of the Southern Conference Educational Fund were also raided. Judge Wisdom\u2019s dissenting opinion in the court below observed that \u201cAmong the dangerous articles removed was Thoreau\u2019s Journal.\u201d Although the court granted a motion to suppress the seized evidence, Louisiana officials continued to threaten prosecution. The grand jury was summoned to hear evidence looking to indictments of the individuals appellants. Despite a temporary restraining order issued by Judge Wisdom, the district court dissolved that order and dismissed the complaint. Thereafter, the grand jury returned indictments under the two state statutes against the individual appellants. The appellees repeated announcements that the appellant organization was a subversive or Communist-front organization; that its members must register or be prosecuted \u2014 these announcements, together with the other events preceding them, frightened off potential members and contributors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-4\">Under the \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d present in <em>Dombrowski, </em>the Supreme Court held that this was not a case for the application of the doctrine of abstention:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1064-5\">\u201cWe hold the abstention doctrine is inappropriate for cases <em>such as the present one </em>where, unlike Douglas v. City of Jeannette, statutes are justifiably attacked on their face as abridging free expression, or as applied for the purpose of discouraging protected activities.\u201d 380 U.S. 489-490, 85 S.Ct. at 1122. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1064-6\">It found that \u201cthe allegations in this complaint depict the situation in which defense of the State\u2019s criminal prosecution will not assure adequate vindication of constitutional rights.\u201d \u201cHere, no readily apparent construction suggests itself as a vehicle for rehabilitating the statutes in a single prosecution * * 380 U.S. at 485, <em>491, </em>85 S.Ct. at 1120, 1123. But the Court did not repudiate the doctrine of abstention in all cases involving Fourteenth Amendment rights. Where cases do not involve \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d to justify the exercise, of a federal court\u2019s equitable powers, it quoted with approval from <em>Douglas, </em>supra:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1064-9\">\u201cIn such cases it does not appear that the plaintiffs \u2018have been threatened with any injury other than that incidental to every criminal proceeding brought lawfully and in good faith, or that a federal court of equity by withdrawing the determination of guilt from the state courts could rightly afford petitioners any protection which they could not secure by prompt trial and appeal pursued to this Court.\u2019 \u201d 380 U.S. at 485, 85 S.Ct. at 1120.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-fq\">The sound principle of abstention alluded to in <em>Douglas, </em>supra, is questioned by the plaintiff whenever there is a threat or assumed threat of state prosecution in violation of what the plaintiff terms the \u201cright of expression.\u201d The plaintiff assumes that the \u201cright of expression\u201d directed at named political personages embraces the right to express opinions as to such persons behind the mask of anonymity. He points to <em>Dombrowski, </em>supra, to support his contention that the defendant in the instant case should be enjoined by this court from prosecuting him in the future for distributing anonymous political literature.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-10\">This court does not find present here the \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d to justify the exercise of federal judicial equity power. There is no suggestion that the alleged threatened prosecution of the plaintiff in the instant case will be undertaken in bad faith or that the plaintiff\u2019s defense to any such prosecution will not assure him adequate vindication of his alleged constitutional rights. In fact, a lower New York state court has already held the statute in question to be unconstitutional for vagueness, People v. Clampitt, supra, and this plaintiff\u2019s conviction in 1964 was reversed in People v. Zwickler, supra, for failure, of proof that he had distributed anonymous political literature \u201cin quantity.\u201d This court has no reason to believe that a court, as enlightened and distinguished as the New York State Court of Appeals, will not <em>assure </em>this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number>plaintiff adequate vindication of his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-5\">There is available to the plaintiff a state remedy short of asserting defenses in a criminal prosecution. He may, if he desires, institute an action in the state court for a \"declaratory judgment. N.Y. CPLR \u00a7 3001. De Veau v. Braisted, 5 App.Div.2d 603, 174 N.Y.S.2d 596 (2d Dep\u2019t 1958), aff\u2019d, 5 N.Y.2d 236, 183 N.Y.S.2d 793, 157 N.E.2d 165 (1959), aff\u2019d, 363 U.S. 144, 80 S.Ct. 1146, 4 L.Ed. 2d 1109 (1960). Should \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d arise which would not justify further abstention, the parties, of course, may seek appropriate relief in the federal courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction is denied.

In substance, it would have cut off all aid to the United Arab Republic. Congressman Multer spoke at length against the amendment, and in his own words, urged its defeat \u2018as earnestly as I can\u2019. He stated that his position was based on \u2018humanitarian instinct\u2019. (Congressional Record 20792).</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-9\">In this respect, the following should be noted</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-10\">(a) Congressman Multer\u2019s stand permits the diversion of funds by Dictator Nasser to his armaments buildup.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-11\">(b) The United Arab Republic is also a recipient of aid from Communist Russia.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-12\">(c) Egypt is now employing the technical skills of scientists, formerly under the employ of the Nazis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-13\">(d) Congressman Multer debated against the amendment on the eve of the summit conference held in Cairo by 13 Arab States which are threat-x ening the peace of the Near East and the State of Israel in particular.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-17\">SOVIET ANTI-SEMITISM</p>\n<p id=\"A5n3\">The 1964 Foreign Aid bill was passed in the United States Senate with an amendment sponsored by Senator Abraham Ribicoff (D., Conn.) that strongly condemned the anti-Semitic practices of the Soviet Union. When this issue was brought to the House-Senate conferees, a much more general statement decrying all types of religious bigotry was adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-18\">Representative Multer praised this \u2018watered down\u2019 measure on the House floor, and stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-19\">\u2018While the Senate version did point the finger directly at Soviet Russia, the version as finally adopted, I think, is much the better one.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-20\">\u2018I believe, instead of pointing the finger at the culprit now before the bar of world public opinion where it is being so severely condemned, it is much better that this Congress go on record as it is doing now, against religious persecution wherever it may raise its ugly head.\u2019 (Congressional Record 22850).</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-21\">WHY MR.

KAUFMAN,</author>\n<p id=\"AhG\">Circuit</p>\n<p id=\"Ayqn\">Judge (concurring in opinion of Judge ZAVATT):</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-8\">In light of Judge Rosling\u2019s dissent, I feel that it is necessary for me to state briefly my understanding of the majority opinion so that its meaning is not lost. The majority lays down no broad rule of federal abstention in cases where freedom of expression is threatened, but rather follows those principles enunciated by the Supreme Court in the <em>Dombrowski </em>case. The Court there recognized that \u201cfederal interference with a State\u2019s good-faith administration of its criminal laws is peculiarly inconsistent with our federal framework. * * * [T]he mere possibility of erroneous initial application of constitutional standards will usually not amount to the irreparable injury necessary to justify a disruption of orderly state proceedings.\u201d The facts presented in the appeal before us offer a vivid contrast to those alleged in <em>Dombrowski. </em>The illegal raids and threats of prosecution made by Louisiana officials in <em>Dom-browski, </em>resembled only too closely those tactics employed by totalitarian regimes dedicated to suppressing freedom of expression. In light of the oppressive circumstances presented in that case, the Supreme Court could well infer that \u201cthe State\u2019s criminal prosecution will not assure adequate vindication of constitutional rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-11\">But, such inference cannot be reasonably drawn in the case now before us. Zwickler does not charge that New York state officials have harassed him, or even that he has been threatened with prosecution. Rather he fears that the District Attorney will again, in good faith, prosecute him \u2014 a fear that should be somewhat alleviated by the fact that Zwick-ler\u2019s conviction was unanimously reversed by the New York courts in 1965. And, there is no basis for inferring that New York\u2019s criminal processes, if invoked, will not assure Zwickler adequate vindication of his constitutional rights. Moreover, Zwickler\u2019s exercise of what he believes to be his rights, need not be \u201cchilled.\u201d He need not wait for state officials to act before he can challenge the constitutionality of \u00a7 781-b. Rather he may take the initiative and institute a declaratory judgment action in the New York courts; and, in addition he may seek expedition of his case if there is any threat of prosecution \u2014 though such a threat seems unreal in light of Zwickler\u2019s previous successful encounter with the statute. The-Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Baggett v. Bullitt did not, as Judge Rosling suggests, reject for all time resort to the state\u2019s declaratory judgment procedures. Rather, the Court found that \u201cIn <em>these circumstances </em>[presented in Baggett] it is difficult to see how an abstract construction of the challenged terms * * * in a declaratory judgment action could eliminate the vagueness of these terms. It is fictional to believe that anything less than <em>extensive adjudications, </em>under the impact of a variety of factual situations, could bring the oath within the bounds of permissible constitutional certainty.\u201d 377 U.S. 378, 84 S.Ct. 1326. (Emphasis added.) The facts presented in the case before us differ radically. I see no reason to believe that'\u201cextensive adjudications\u201d would be required were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>Zwickler to challenge \u00a7 781-b in a declaratory judgment act. And the State courts can adjudicate, as rapidly as the Federal courts, Zwickler\u2019s simple contention that the statute is unconstitutional because it is overbroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-4\">In light of all of these factors, the case now before us does not present those special circumstances found in <em>Dombrowski </em>and <em>Baggett, </em>Rather, the facts in this case clearly indicate that our discretion will be exercised in the wisest manner if, as is consistent with our federal framework, we permit the courts of the state to deal first with the question raised by Zwickler.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<p id=\"b1066-5\">DISSENTING OPINION</p>\n<author id=\"b1066-6\">ROSLING, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1066-7\">This dissent is only from so much of the majority\u2019s holding that the basic, but residual, question of constitutionality of Penal Law \u00a7 781-b should be passed back to the state courts for adjudication while we abstain. The question of constitutionality, however, is necessarily reached if the dissent correctly holds that we must not abstain. That the provision is unconstitutional for overbreadth the Attorney Genera] in his brief substantially acknowledges by citing the legislative history of the most recent (1962) amendment of the provision as basis for a judicial, possibly, a case by case, narrowing of the law to a constitutional dimension. What he proposes is that the courts by decisional law do what the New York State legislature did by amendment after the state Court of Appeals had stricken down in People v. Mishkin, 17 A.D.2d 243, 234 N.Y.S.2d 342 (1st Dept.1962), aff\u2019d 15 N.Y.2d 671, 255 N.Y.S.2d 881, 204 N.E.2d 209 (1964), the overbroad Section 330, subd. 2 of the General Business Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-8\">The statute construed in Mishkin contained a self-identification requirement which swept within its scope <em>all </em>publications without distinguishing between that which by reason of its content had forfeited the protection the First Amendment affords, and other matter not thus disentitled. The post-Mishkin amendment, still untested by the courts, expressly restricts its compelled self-identification to what, hopefully, has forfeited constitutional protection as hard core pornography. Mishkin in turn rests on Talley v. State of California, 362 U.S. 60, 80 S.Ct. 536, 4 L.Ed.2d 559, which held that a city ordinance (Los Angeles) barring distribution of any handbill in any place under any circumstances unless the provenance thereof was noted thereon was unconstitutional as abridging freedom of speech and press secured against such invasion by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. I do not find in the Talley holding any express or sharply implied qualification of the principle announced that would permit a judicial pruning of a statute thus overbroad in the First Amendment area, so that what remains may be rendered viable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-10\">New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964), admonishes those in the public eye that constitutional immunity extends to the writers of all that is written in criticism of their public action, even though falsely written, absent a showing of actual malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-11\">Mills v. State of Alabama, 384 U.S. 214, 86 S.Ct. 1434, 16 L.Ed.2d 484, denies to the state authority to censor by penalizing writings made so close to an election, that no time is available for answer. That the voters may be misled by such ex parte and unexposed slanders is at once apparent. But, according to Mills, the policing of the truth to insure that the voter makes a choice uninfluenced by belated falsehood or distortion is not a function of government. Nor does it become the function of government to do so upon a showing that public officials are aided by private persons, however honorable and honorably motivated. Cf. Bantam Books v. Sullivan, 372 U.S. 58, 83 S.Ct. 631, 9 L.Ed.2d 584 (1963). Nor should we by abstention fail to declare, if precedent has thus determined, unconstitutional a law so patently overbroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-12\">Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U.S. 360, 84 S.Ct. 1316, 1323, 12 L.Ed.2d 377 (1964), comments (p. 373) that \u201c[w]ell-intention<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>ed prosecutors and judicial safeguards do not neutralize the vice of a vague law.\u201d Justice White, writing for the court, rejected abstention as inappropriate, for \u201c[i]t is fictional to believe that anything less than extensive adjudications, under the impact of a variety of factual situations, would bring the oath [penalties for nonjuring teachers was involved] within the bounds of constitutional certainty. Abstention does pot require this.\u201d [Id. at p. 378, 84 S.Ct. at p. 1326]</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-5\">Rejected too, by Baggett was resort to a state tribunal for a declaratory judgment on the issue of constitutionality, a suggestion advanced by the majority here. The slow, particularistic process of litigation in state forums and its cost are noted further by Justice White as '\u201cinhibit [ing] the exercise of First Amendment freedoms.\u201d [id. at pp. 378, 379, 84 S.Ct. at p. 1326]</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-6\">Dombrowski v Pfister, 380 U.S. 479, 85 S.Ct. 1116, 14 L.Ed.2d 22 (1965), an action brought under the Civil Rights Act, Rev.Statute \u00a7 1979, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1958 ed.) is discussed at length and passim by the majority of this panel, and is read by them, although not expressly so stated in the opinion, as authorizing the retention of jurisdiction only upon a showing of a context of threats, violence and disorders which by harassment discourages those petitioning this court for relief, from attempting to vindicate their constitutional rights through proceedings in the state courts. Dombrowski strongly and expressly upheld the Baggett principles [id. 491, 85 S.Ct. 1123], yet Baggett involved <em>no </em>claims of acts of <em>violence </em>or of <em>indignities </em>visited upon the nonjuring teachers who pressed their suit in the federal forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-7\">The majority here, it would appear, have read into the principles for which Dombrowski stands, the accidental and adventitious environment of violence, and assigned to it a role integral to the ratio decidendi. Dombrowski, however, does not justify such gloss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-8\">Thus Dombrowski, at p. 486, 85 S.Ct. at p. 1121 \u201cwe have consistently allowed attacks on overly broad statutes with no requirement that the person making the attack demonstrate that his own conduct could not be regulated by a statute drawn with the requisite narrow specificity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-10\">And, quoting NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415 at p. 433, 83 S.Ct. 328, 9 L.Ed.2d 405, it approves the statement in that opinion which speaks of the \u201cdanger of tolerating, in the area of First Amendment freedoms, the .existence of a penal statute susceptible of sweeping and improper application.\u201d [id. 380 U.S. 487, 85 S.Ct. 1121]</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-11\">Dombrowski decries delay in \u201cvindication of freedom of expression await [ing] the outcome of protracted litigation\u201d, and even more forcefully rejects the contention \u201cthat the improbability of successful prosecution makes the case different. The chilling effect upon the exercise of First Amendment rights may derive from the fact of prosecution, unaffected by the prospect of its success or failure.\u201d [id. at p. 487, 85 S.Ct. at p. 1121]</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-12\">But, most significantly, Dombrowski distinguishes its own context from that of Douglas v. City of Jeannette, 319 U.S. 157, 63 S.Ct. 877, 87 L.Ed. 1324 (1944), in which there was no atmosphere of state violence or breakdown of the judicial process, the distinction being on grounds which make clear that although the presence of violence and other disruptive circumstances may dictate retention, their absence does not, conversely, dictate abstention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-13\">Dombrowski declares [380 U.S. pp. 489-490, 85 S.Ct. p. 1122]: \u201cWe hold the abstention doctrine is inappropriate for cases such as the present one where, unlike Douglas v. City of Jeannette, statutes are justifiably attacked <em>on their face </em>or as <em>applied </em>for the purpose of discouraging activities.\u201d [Emphasis supplied] Only the second of the alternatives cited contemplates violence as of material relevance. The first alternative, instanced by our proceeding, needs only a statute void on its face as the pivotal condition for retention of a First Amendment suit where chilling is a natural consequence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>of our abstention. See excerpt from Baggett, supra p. 994.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-4\">Finally, and in my view conclusive upon us as obliging us to retain, is the statement in Dombrowski which declares the sequence of the Federal and State procedures when the statute is thus over-broad on its face.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1068-5\">\u201cThe State must, if it is to invoke the statutes after injunctive relief has been sought, assume the burden of obtaining a permissible narrow construction in a noncriminal proceeding <em>before </em>it may seek modification of the injunction to permit future prosecutions. * * * Our view of the proper operation of the vagueness doctrine does not preclude district courts from modifying injunctions to permit prosecutions in light of subsequent state court interpretation clarifying the application of the statute to particular conduct.\u201d (380 U.S. at 491-492, 85 S.Ct. at 1123) [Emphasis supplied]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1068-6\">The Dombrowski principle is summed up in forthright language (p. 494, 85 S.Ct. p. 1125) taking note of life\u2019s realities and the fact that not all men are willing to accept martyrdom. It reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1068-7\">\u201cSo long as the statute remains available to the State the threat of prosecutions of protected expression is a real and substantial one. Even the prospect of ultimate failure of such prosecutions by no means dispels their chilling effect on protected expression.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1068-8\">Once the thesis is accepted that \u00a7 781-b is invalid, at least for overbreadth, in its indiscriminate application to both the constitutionally protected writing which, though anonymous, may be circulated withut penalty, and that which by reason of malicious falsehood must certify its origin or be in violation, the question arises as to the one who shall so assess the contents and at what stage this shall be done. For answer \u00a7 781-b must be read in association with Executive Law, McKinney\u2019s ConsoLLaws, c. 18, \u00a7 69. That provision at the same time authorizes as it obligates, the Attorney General to investigate crimes against the Elective franchise. The sifting process which he, through his deputies, engages in, to implement \u00a7 781-b in its judicially narrowed dimension, may with all good heart be intended only for the culpable. Its chill will, nevertheless, be felt in a prior restraint by those whose writings, though not self-identified, may be emitted freely, and should be, not only without penalty, but equally without fear of penalty. Chilling that freedom is impermissible censorship. See People v. Clampitt, 34 Misc.2d 766, 222 N.Y.S.2d 23; North End Democratic Club v. Attorney General, 31 Misc.2d 1000, 222 N.Y.S.2d 9; People v. Zwickler (Crim.Ct., N.Y.City, Kings Co., Feb. 10, 1965, unreported) \u201c[j]udgment of conviction unanimously reversed on the facts,\u201d (Sup.Ct., App.T., 2d Dept., April 23, 1965, unreported), aff\u2019d without opinion 16 N.Y.2d 1069, 266 N.Y.S.2d 140, 213 N.E.2d 467 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-10\">Justice Black in Talley at p. 539 of 80 S.Ct. cites as significant Hallam\u2019s Constitutional History of England and the Letters of Junius. The organ tones of Milton two centuries earlier in Areo-pagitica identify the wellsprings at which these authors surely drank.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-11\">\u201cFor who knows not,\u201d the mighty advocate asked, \u201cthat Truth is strong next to the Almighty?\u201d and gave his own answer. \u201cShe needs no policies, no stratagems, nor licensings to make her victorious; those are the shifts and the de-fences that error uses against her power.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-12\">I would grant the plaintiff\u2019s motion declaring \u00a7 781-b unconstitutional as in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States and enjoining its enforcement.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
