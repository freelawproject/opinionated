He was sentenced to 50 years\u2019 imprisonment. The issue on appeal is whether the trial court\u2019s comments to defense counsel and to a potential juror were so prejudicial that they denied defendant a fair trial. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p> <p id=\"b620-4\" pgmap=\"620\">Defendant complains of several remarks made toward defense counsel outside the jury\u2019s presence. When the defense counsel made a motion for a continuance prior to jury selection, the court stated:</p> <blockquote id=\"b620-5\" pgmap=\"620\">\u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible to explain to anybody why this case would have taken so long. But just listening to you snivel and cry and whine about a reason for a continuance is almost enough to make a grown man want to throw up.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b620-6\" pgmap=\"620\">During jury selection, the following discussion between the trial court and a prospective juror occurred:</p> <blockquote id=\"b620-7\" pgmap=\"620\">\u201c[JUROR]: I\u2019m biased toward the defendant, because I also think that the State\u2019s Attorney has the leverage in the case.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b620-8\" pgmap=\"620\">I also think it\u2019s very difficult for anyone poor to get a fair and impartial trial in America.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b620-9\" pgmap=\"620\">Having said that, I would probably weigh the facts.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b620-10\" pgmap=\"620\">^ ^ ^</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b620-11\" pgmap=\"620\">THE COURT: All I\u2019m asking you, can you wait, even with these readily accepted preconceived notions and understanding \u2014 friendship with the Public Defender\u2019s [sic], understanding that on alot of cases poor people \u2014 and I disagree with you, you know, starting with the O.J. case, that is an Assistant Public Defender defense. That is the age-old conspiracy. That is a million dollar lawyer who got luckier than any other lawyer in history.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b620-12\" pgmap=\"620\">After the potential juror was excused by the State, defense counsel moved for a mistrial. During the discussion on the motion, the following occurred:</p> <blockquote id=\"b620-13\" pgmap=\"620\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I think some cumulative comments by the Court regarding the O.J. Simpson case has [sic] left this jury polluted, Judge.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b620-14\" pgmap=\"620\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b620-15\" pgmap=\"620\">THE COURT: Well, sir, make your objections as to the time that you\u2019re troubled about them, and make them timely.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b620-16\" pgmap=\"620\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: How can I say that in front of the jurors?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b620-17\" pgmap=\"620\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b620-18\" pgmap=\"620\">I\u2019m making the objection now because now is the timely time to do it. I\u2019m not\u2014</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b620-19\" pgmap=\"620\">THE COURT: Well, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s timely because the jury isn\u2019t still here.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b621-2\" pgmap=\"621\">After denying the motion for a mistrial, defense counsel continued to argue his position. The court stated:</p> <blockquote id=\"b621-3\" pgmap=\"621\">\u201cI heard you the first time. I heard you the first time. Unless you want to spend the night with your client in custody, I would expect you to argue your motions and receive the ruling. Any back talk by you will not be tolerated by this Court. Any conversations about your inability transferred to the ability of this Court to be fair and impartial will not be allowed.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b621-4\" pgmap=\"621\">Okay. You have already made all the motions you\u2019re going to make as far as why this case should be continued. Your other dilatory practices at this time are considered just dilatory practices, and I will rule on any motion that you make at a timely time.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b621-5\" pgmap=\"621\">Prior to opening statements, defendant told the trial court that he was taking psychotropic drugs and had told his attorney about the medication. Because defense counsel did not request a fitness hearing, the State asked for an immediate hearing on defendant\u2019s fitness to stand trial. After the hearing, the following discussion occurred between the trial court and defense counsel:</p> <blockquote id=\"b621-6\" pgmap=\"621\">\u201cTHE COURT: First of all the Defendant said that he told you he was taking this medication and it affected his ability, and wanted you to file for a behavior clinic; is that true or false.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b621-7\" pgmap=\"621\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Are you ordering me?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b621-8\" pgmap=\"621\">THE COURT: I\u2019m not ordering you to do anything. I ask you to act like a lawyer in regards to this case. An allegation has been made that is quite frightening to this court in regards to your handling of the case. Now I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s been my opinion that you are willing to give up your license to help someone get a not guilty; that\u2019s clear to me that you\u2019re willing to do almost anything to prevail in a lawsuit, including call yourself incompetence [szc]. Now whether or not this is borne out by the facts only time will tell.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b621-9\" pgmap=\"621\">Later, in camera, the following occurred during a discussion on an evidentiary matter:</p> <blockquote id=\"b621-10\" pgmap=\"621\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: What the identification exception to the hearsay rule is, is when a person making the identification goes that\u2019s him. What they did here was \u2014 I think the record should reflect the Judge walked out of the chambers in the middle of my argument.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b621-11\" pgmap=\"621\">THE COURT: You saw me walk out of chambers?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b621-12\" pgmap=\"621\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I believe I was\u2014</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b621-13\" pgmap=\"621\">THE COURT: I was opening my door.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b621-14\" pgmap=\"621\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I apologize.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b621-15\" pgmap=\"621(22) 622(80)\">THE COURT: You better apologize. You\u2019re about ready to go in custody with your client! We\u2019re going to have several hearings in this case. Give me one more look like that, pal, and you will be in custody. Now I am tire [sic] of you acting like this poor hurt little child. Now you either strap it up and get on with this trial, and make your objections, and quit picking on everything I do as some personal animosity that you\u2019re showing for me. Because I have none for you. I have a lot of disappointment for you, but no animosity.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b622-3\" pgmap=\"622\">During cross-examination of a police officer, in front of the jury, the following occurred:</p> <blockquote id=\"b622-4\" pgmap=\"622\">\u201cTHE COURT: Again, it\u2019s not his report. If you would just ask these in regards to his partner\u2019s report. Just ask questions in regards to the facts solicited not the facts that you think. Ask questions in regards to the facts in this case.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b622-5\" pgmap=\"622\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I believe he adopted the report when he says he read the report, he signed the report.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b622-6\" pgmap=\"622\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t believe he adopted the report. I heard what he said, and I heard him tell you he didn\u2019t make out the report. You knew he didn\u2019t make out the report. What you figure is not important. It\u2019s what is important that this witness says [sic]. So ask him questions in regards to the questions that he already answered.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b622-7\" pgmap=\"622\">Defendant relies on People v. Heiman, 286 Ill. App. 3d 102, 675 N.E.2d 200 (1996), which involved the same judge as in this case. Nevertheless, the two cases are very different. Not only was Heiman a bench trial, not a jury trial, but the trial court harbored preconceived notions regarding the defendant and his witnesses, which led to its rejection of the defendant\u2019s self-defense theory even before the defendant presented all his evidence.</p> <p id=\"b622-8\" pgmap=\"622\">Defendant also cites People v. Eckert, 194 Ill. App. 3d 667, 674, 551 N.E.2d 820 (1990), where a new trial was ordered because the trial court repeatedly expressed hostility toward the defense counsel in front of the jury and did not allow the defense counsel the opportunity to effectively present his case. Eckert, 194 Ill. App. 3d at 673-74.</p> <p id=\"b622-9\" pgmap=\"622(125) 623(25)\"> A defendant is entitled to a trial that is free from a trial court\u2019s improper or prejudicial comments. People v. Garrett, 276 Ill. App. 3d 702, 711, 658 N.E.2d 1216 (1995). A fair trial contemplates that the jury will, alone, fulfill its duty of determining the facts, and it is not the province of the court, in a criminal case, to express by word or indicate by conduct, in the jury\u2019s hearing, any opinion on the facts. People v. Marino, 414 Ill. 445, 450, 111 N.E.2d 534 (1953). Jurors are ever watchful of the attitude of the trial court and its influence on them is necessarily and properly of great weight; thus, its slightest remark or intimation is received with deference and may be controlling. People v. Vargas, 174 Ill. 2d 355, 365, 673 N.E.2d 1037 (1996); Marino, 414 Ill. at 450-51; Eckert, 194 Ill. App. 3d at 673-74.</p> <p id=\"b623-3\" pgmap=\"623\"> Hostile conduct by the court toward the defense counsel is a factor that may influence a jury to the prejudice of the defendant. Marino, 414 Ill. at 451. Nevertheless, the reviewing court must consider the record as a whole when determining whether the trial court harbored a belittling and resentful attitude toward the defense attorney and conveyed that attitude to the jury. Marino, 414 Ill. at 451. In the final analysis, a trial court\u2019s improper comments are reversible error only if the defendant can establish that the comments were a material factor in his or her conviction or had a probable effect on the jury\u2019s verdict. Garrett, 276 Ill. App. 3d at 712.</p> <p id=\"b623-4\" pgmap=\"623\"> Considering the record as a whole, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s remarks in this case did not prejudice defendant. Most of the remarks were made outside the presence of the jury and, taken in context, did not show such animosity toward defense counsel that the trial court\u2019s attitude affected the jury. As indicated in the trial court\u2019s remarks during the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, the trial court admitted that it made some improper remarks toward defense counsel prior to the beginning of testimony, but changed its mind shortly thereafter. It appears from the record that the trial court changed its attitude toward defense counsel during the opening argument, when the court realized that the attorney was in fact prepared to try the case. There is nothing in the record to indicate that defendant was prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s remarks to the defense counsel either in front of or outside the presence of the jury.</p> <p id=\"b623-5\" pgmap=\"623\">Accordingly, we affirm the circuit court judgment.</p> <p id=\"b623-6\" pgmap=\"623\">Judgment affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b623-7\" pgmap=\"623\">McNAMARA, J., concurs.</p> </opinion> <opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\"> <author id=\"b623-8\" pgmap=\"623\">JUSTICE WOLFSON,</author> <p id=\"AZDp\" pgmap=\"623\">specially concurring:</p> <p id=\"b623-9\" pgmap=\"623\">I agree with the result reached, but I think more needs to be said about the trial judge\u2019s conduct.</p> <p id=\"b623-10\" pgmap=\"623\">The trial judge could have denied the defense a continuance without saying: \u201cBut just listening to you snivel and cry and whine about a reason for a continuance is almost enough to make a grown man want to throw up.\u201d The judge\u2019s language was unseemly and unprofessional. It has no place in a court of law, in or out of the jury\u2019s presence.</p> <p id=\"b623-11\" pgmap=\"623(23) 624(31)\">The jury could have been selected without the trial judge saying to a prospective juror: \u201cand I disagree with you, you know starting with the O.J. case, that is an Assistant Public Defender defense. That is the age-old conspiracy. That is a million dollar lawyer who got luckier than any other lawyer in history.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b624-4\" pgmap=\"624\">The reference to \u201can assistant public defender defense\u201d clearly was intended to deprecate the efforts of lawyers who devote their energies to the defense of indigent people who sometimes do not have much of a defense. That is what lawyers are supposed to do. They should not have to bear insults from those whom we vest with grave authority to conduct judicial proceedings in a fair and dignified manner.</p> <p id=\"b624-5\" pgmap=\"624\">Of course, there are times when trial judges rightly become impatient and irritable. But these are the times when they must justify the confidence placed in them by the public. These are times for restraint, not anger; civility, not bullying; patience, not outburst. These are times for some judges to remember they, too, once stood before judges and vigorously urged the causes of clients who, for the uninformed, did not deserve such effort and such passion.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
