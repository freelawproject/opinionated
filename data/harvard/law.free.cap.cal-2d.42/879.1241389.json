E. Spriggs, Inc. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., ante, </em>p. 785 [269 P.2d 876].</p>\n<p id=\"b903-10\">Doyle Wyatt, a farm laborer in the employ of Norman Potter, doing business as Potter Nursery, sustained a compensable injury as a result of the assertedly negligent operation of an automobile by a third party. Wyatt settled his claim for damages against the third party for $1,000. Of that amount, $215.93 was paid to the employer\u2019s insurer in satisfaction of a lien for previous compensation expenditures. Wyatt\u2019s attorney received $357.50 for attorney\u2019s fees. The Industrial Accident Commission deducted from the credit allowed the employer\u2019s insurer the amount paid by Wyatt as an attorney\u2019s fee, allowing only $426.57 plus a credit of $112.64 for prior disability payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-11\">For the reasons stated in the Spriggs case, that portion of the award crediting Industrial Indemnity Company with only $539.21 is annulled, with directions to the commission to increase the amount to $896.71; in all other respects, the award is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-12\">Shenk, J., Traynor, J., Schauer, J., Spence, J., and Bray, J. pro tem.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b903-13\"> Assigned by Chairman of Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b904-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>CARTER, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AfR\">I dissent for the same reasons stated by me in <em>R. E. Spriggs, Inc. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., ante, </em>p. 785 [269 P.2d 876], In addition, however, this case squarely presents the wholly unjust situation mentioned by me in my dissent in <em>Dodds </em>v. <em>Stellar, </em>30 Cal.2d 496 [183 P.2d 658]. I there said that as a result of denying the employee the right, to deduct counsel fees incurred in recovering from the tort feasor, the employee might well receive less than the workmen\u2019s compensation payable to him. That result is reached here despite the legislative amendments designed to alleviate the injustice. Here the compensation amounted to $896.71. The employee received $1,000 in settlement from the tort feasor. He had to pay his attorney $357.50 leaving a balance of $642.50, thus receiving less than the compensation to which he was entitled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
