Morse, </em>Esq.) recommendation that the plaintiffs motion to dismiss the defendants\u2019 counterclaim be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-3\">The plaintiff brought an action against the defendants, William G. Novick and Raleigh Clark, d/b/a Northeast Outfitters, to collect a debt allegedly owed. On April 2, 1979, the Register of Deeds, by order of the plaintiff, recorded a writ of summons and a petition to attach with notice against the defendants\u2019 property in the Cheshire County Registry of Deeds. The defendants\u2019 request to remove the documents was granted by the Superior Court <em>(Dunfey, </em>C.J.). Additionally, the court awarded costs to the defendants, and the award was affirmed by this court in <em>Jerry\u2019s Sport Center, Inc. v. Novick, </em>120 N.H. 371, 373, 415 A.2d 331, 332 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">The defendants counterclaimed in the action brought by the plaintiff, contending that the recording of the notice of lis pendens was actually an attachment, and because the attachment occurred prior to a hearing, it deprived them of due process rights under the fourteenth amendment to the United States Constitution and violated 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1976). The defendant Clark filed a motion for summary judgment. Subsequently, the plaintiff moved to dismiss the defendants\u2019 counterclaim. The trial court granted the motion for summary judgment, and this court declined to accept the plaintiff\u2019s appeal. After his motion to dismiss was denied, the plaintiff appealed again. We accepted the appeal, and we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Initially, the defendant argues that because we declined to hear the plaintiff\u2019s first appeal, the case is not open to further review. In the interests of justice, however, we have decided to hear the appeal and consider whether the trial court acted properly in granting summary judgment to the defendant and in denying the plaintiff\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">The plaintiff argues that because the filing of a lis pendens lacked the requisite \u201cstate action\u201d to permit relief for violation of the fourteenth amendment or 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1976), the trial court erred when it granted summary judgment to the defendant and denied plaintiff\u2019s motion to dismiss. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\"> The fourteenth amendment protects individuals only against actions by the State. U.S. Const. amend. 14; <em>see United States v. Price, </em>383 U.S. 787, 799-800 (1966). Similarly, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1976) proscribes only that conduct which is \u201cunder color of state law\u201d, which has been interpreted as requiring state action. <em>See Flagg Bros., Inc. v. Brooks, </em>436 U.S. 149, 156 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">The defendants allege that by using court forms and directing the Register of Deeds to record the forms, the plaintiff acted \u201cunder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>color of state law,\u201d and that the State\u2019s participation in the plaintiff\u2019s acts resulted in state action sufficient to justify recovery. The trial court, however, found that \u201cthe plaintiff\u2019s actions weren\u2019t sanctioned by \u2018Court approval or order\u2019 . . . .\u201d Additionally, the Register of Deeds did not act with any independence. The plaintiff sent \u201cinstructions\u201d and \u201cdirectives\u201d to her, causing her to record the forms.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\"> Absent a showing that the State\u2019s conduct amounted to joint participation with the plaintiff or that the private action and the State\u2019s conduct had a sufficiently close nexus, mere State participation will not constitute state action. <em>State v. Miller, </em>117 N.H. 67, 68, 369 A.2d 197, 198 (1977) (citing <em>Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., </em>419 U.S. 345, 351 (1974) and <em>Burton v. Wilmington Pkg. Auth., </em>365 U.S. 715, 725 (1961)). The mere use of State forms or directives to a county official is not sufficient to make the plaintiff\u2019s action that of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">The defendant argues that the United States Supreme Court has determined that action similar to that taken by the plaintiff is actionable under the fourteenth amendment and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1976). <em>See Fuentes v. Shevin, </em>407 U.S. 67, 96-97 (1972); <em>Sniadach v. Family Finance Corp., </em>395 U.S. 337, 341-42 (1969); <em>cf. Flagg Bros., Inc., v. Brooks, </em>436 U.S. at 164-65 (1978) (statute permitting \u201cself-help\u201d repossession not sufficient state involvement to be state action). These cases, however, are distinguishable from the instant case. In those cases, the State sanctioned the conduct by statute. In this case, the plaintiff\u2019s conduct was improper and not approved or sanctioned by the State by statute or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Because we find no state action, we will not consider the other issues presented in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b658-8\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
