We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-3\">In August 1979, David and Mary Dufresne, who own property abutting the plaintiffs\u2019 real estate in Rye, New Hampshire, sought a permit which would allow them to use their property as a bath shop and showroom for plumbing and heating supplies. Prior to that time, the previous owner of the property had operated an automobile repair garage on the property and had used the barn to store hay and board horses. Additionally, he had had an apartment on the property; but after it burned, it was never rebuilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">The building inspector denied the Dufresnes\u2019 request for a building permit, claiming that the property had not been used as a business for three years, and therefore, the non-conforming use had been abandoned. The Dufresnes appealed the building inspector\u2019s denial of a permit to the Town of Rye Zoning Board of Adjustment (board). On September 4, 1979, the board overturned the building inspector\u2019s decision and granted a variance to the Dufresnes. The board concluded that the previous owner\u2019s business had been operating at some time during the three years before the Dufresnes bought the property and, therefore, that the non-conforming use had not expired. Additionally, the board stated that the proposed use by the Dufresnes was at least as appropriate to the area as the previous non-conforming use had been.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Subsequently, the building inspector again denied a permit, and four days later, the plaintiffs requested that the board conduct a re-hearing. The board denied the plaintiffs\u2019 request, and simultaneously overturned the building inspector\u2019s second denial of a building permit. Finally, on November 6, 1979, the board granted a variance to the Dufresnes.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">The plaintiffs appealed the board\u2019s final decision to the superior court. After a hearing, the Master <em>{Frank B. Clancy, </em>Esq.) recommended that the board\u2019s decision be upheld. He concluded that the non-conforming use had not been abandoned and that the proposed use was not an expansion of the previous non-conforming use. The Trial Court <em>{Bean, </em>J.) approved the master\u2019s recommendation, and the plaintiffs appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">The plaintiffs argue that the trial court\u2019s decision that the non-conforming use had not been abandoned was clearly against the weight of the evidence. At trial, the plaintiffs produced evidence from several witnesses that there had been no business activity on the property for at least three years. The defendants, however, offered evidence that the automobile repair garage had continued to operate on a limited basis within the three-year period. While we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>might agree that the plaintiffs produced substantial evidence that the use had been abandoned, we will not overturn the trial court\u2019s conclusions of fact, because it could reasonably have concluded on the evidence before it that the use had not been abandoned. <em>See Zimmerman v. Suissevale, Inc., </em>121 N.H. 1051, 1054, 438 A.2d 290, 292 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">The trial court also concluded that the Dufresnes\u2019 proposed use was not an impermissible expansion of the existing non-conforming use. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\"> RSA 31:62 protects existing non-conforming uses unless the proposed use is an \u201calteration of a building for use for a <em>purpose </em>or in a manner <em>substantially different </em>from the use to which it was put before alteration.\u201d RSA 31:62. (Emphasis added.) <em>See Town of Hampton v. Brust, </em>122 N.H. 463, 468, 446 A.2d 458, 460 (1982). The proposed use in the instant case would change an automobile garage into a \u201cbath shop\u201d and plumbing supplies showroom. We conclude that the new use would represent a <em>\u201csubstantial change </em>in the <em>nature </em>and <em>purpose </em>of the original use.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 468, 446 A.2d at 460 (emphasis in original); <em>see New London v. Leskiewicz, </em>110 N.H. 462, 466, 272 A.2d 856, 860 (1970). The trial court\u2019s determination that the proposed use was as well suited or more appropriate to the area as the previous use had been is irrelevant. Because the proposed use is a significant change from the pre-existing non-conforming use, we must reject the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the Dufresnes\u2019 use was a permissible expansion of an existing non-conforming use.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">Even after determining that the proposed use was a permissible expansion of an existing non-conforming use, the trial court upheld the board\u2019s grant of a variance to the Dufresnes. Neither the board nor the trial court, however, examined any of the criteria necessary for the grant of a variance. <em>See Moore v. City of Rochester, </em>121 N.H. 100, 102, 427 A.2d 10, 11-12 (1981); <em>Ouimette v. City of Somersworth, </em>119 N.H. 292, 294-95, 402 A.2d 159, 161-62 (1979); RSA 31:72 III. For that reason, we remand for a hearing and determination of whether a variance should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">\n<em>Affirmed in part; reversed in part; remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b710-10\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
