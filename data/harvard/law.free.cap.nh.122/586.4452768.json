The town itself claimed ownership of the spring by virtue of a railroad corporation deed as well as by adverse public use for a period exceeding twenty years. It claimed ownership of the roadway by virtue of a 1939 highway layout. In his eight-page report, the Master <em>(Mayland H. Morse, Jr., </em>Esq.) ruled on the eighty requests before him and recommended that title be quieted in the town. The Superior Court <em>(Pappagianis, </em>J.) approved the report, and the defendant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-18\">The essence of the defendant\u2019s argument is that there was insufficient evidence upon which the master could conclude as he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>did. We will not disturb a trial court\u2019s ruling when it is supported by the evidence. <em>Jerry\u2019s Sport Center, Inc. v. Novick, </em>120 N.H. 371, 373, 415 A.2d 331, 332 (1980). Having reviewed the record, we cannot conclude that the master erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
