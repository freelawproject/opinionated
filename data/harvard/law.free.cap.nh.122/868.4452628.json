There having been no motion for a directed verdict or judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the sole issue is whether the Trial Court <em>(Flynn, </em>J.) properly denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to set aside the verdict as against the weight of the evidence and motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-4\">The evidence was conflicting, but the jury did have evidence before it from which it could conclude that the defendant was not following the plaintiffs\u2019 car too closely and that she was traveling at a very low and reasonable speed. Because there was evidence to support the trial judge\u2019s decision to deny the plaintiffs\u2019 motions, we will not overturn it. <em>Rogers v. Pub. Serv.
