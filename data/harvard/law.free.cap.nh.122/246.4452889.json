Bennett, from his unclassified State government position as director of the division of economic development. His appeal to this court was unsuccessful, and the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>Supreme Court refused to hear the case for want of a substantial federal question. <em>See Bennett v. Thomson, </em>116 N.H. 453, 363 A.2d 187 (1976), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>429 U.S. 1082 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-3\">On May 15, 1981, the plaintiff filed a petition for declaratory judgment in superior court seeking a ruling that the State be required to reimburse him for attorney\u2019s fees incurred in his unsuccessful attempt to avoid dismissal. Upon the recommendation of a Master <em>(Perkins, </em>J., Retired), the Superior Court <em>(Johnson, </em>J.) granted the State\u2019s motion to dismiss. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">The plaintiff did not request attorney\u2019s fees during any of the legal proceedings concerning his removal. It was not until March 1980, three years and one month after the United States Supreme Court dismissed his appeal, that the plaintiff\u2019s counsel wrote the attorney general requesting reimbursement. The plaintiff then waited until May 15, 1981, before filing his action in superior court. Thus, over four years elapsed between the time the United States Supreme Court dismissed his appeal and the time he filed his petition for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\"> This court recently held that, absent a statute or court rule governing the time in which attorney\u2019s fees must be requested, a request for attorney\u2019s fees is proper only if made within a reasonable time. <em>Royer v. Adams, </em>121 N.H. 1024, 1028, 437 A.2d 316, 319 (1981); <em>Silva v. Botsch, </em>121 N.H. 1041, 1044, 437 A.2d 313, 315 (1981). Three years and one month is clearly not a \u201creasonable\u201d time. In light of this decision, we need not reach the other issues raised by the briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b267-7\">Brock, J., did not sit.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
