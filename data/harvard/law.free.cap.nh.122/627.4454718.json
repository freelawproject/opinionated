They raise several issues: Whether they were entitled to receive a statement of reasons for their termination; whether they had a protected property interest in their employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>ment; whether they were entitled to personal notice that their terminations would be discussed at a certain meeting of the Bedford School Board; and whether they had a \u201cright to know\u201d under RSA ch. 91-A that teacher nominations would be discussed at that meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">The plaintiffs, probationary employees in the Bedford School District, were employed pursuant to individual written contracts for the school year 1980-81. At a regularly scheduled school board meeting on March 9, 1981, an item on the agenda indicated that teacher nominations for the upcoming year would be considered. The defendants claim that they sent a copy of this agenda to the plaintiffs\u2019 representative, the president of the Bedford Teachers Association, in accordance with the plaintiffs\u2019 collective bargaining agreement. The plaintiffs were never personally notified that teacher nominations would be discussed. At the March 9 meeting, the board elected various teachers to probationary positions and continued certain tenured teachers. The two plaintiffs were not among those to be offered new contracts. See RSA 189:14-a.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Over a month after the plaintiffs were notified of nonrenewal, counsel for their exclusive bargaining representative, the Bedford Teachers Association, NHEA/NEA, asked the school board for a statement of reasons why the plaintiffs had not been rehired. The board responded: \u201cIt is the practice of the school board not to give reasons for the nonrenewal of teachers.\u201d In August, the plaintiffs filed a petition for a temporary injunction and a temporary restraining order which essentially sought the plaintiffs\u2019 reinstatement. The Superior Court <em>(Wyman, </em>J.) denied temporary relief, and this interlocutory appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">The plaintiffs argue that they were entitled to a statement of reasons for nonrenewal. Tenured teachers \u2014 those who have been employed for three years or more \u2014 must be provided upon request with \u201creasons for failure to be renominated or reelected\u201d and are permitted a hearing before the board. RSA 189:14-a (Supp. 1981). As we explained in <em>Petition of Gorham School Board, </em>121 N.H. 878, 880-81, 436 A.2d 74, 76 (1981), probationary teachers are not extended this statutory protection. It could, however, be bargained for in a collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">RSA 189:13 provides that no teacher, whether probationary or tenured, may be <em>dismissed during </em>the contract period \u201cwithout having previously been notified of the cause of such dismissal\u201d and provided a full and fair hearing. It is clear from the statutory framework, however, that the plaintiffs were not being \u201cdismissed,\u201d <em>see </em>RSA 189:13, but were simply not being \u201crenominated\u201d or \u201cre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>elected.\u201d <em>See </em>RSA 189:14-a (Supp. 1981). Accordingly, the procedural protections set forth in RSA 189:13 did not attach.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-3\">Even though RSA ch. 189 may not grant them a right to a statement of reasons for termination, the plaintiffs argue that they are entitled to such a statement on due process grounds because their employment is a protected property interest. The United States Supreme Court in <em>Board of Regents v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564 (1972), addressed this argument stating that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-4\">\u201cTo have a property interest in a benefit, a person clearly must have more than an abstract need or desire for it. He must have more than a unilateral expectation of it ... . Property interests, of course, are not created by the Constitution. Rather, they are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law \u2014 rules or understandings that secure certain benefits and that support claims of entitlement to those benefits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 577.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">The Supreme Court in <em>Roth </em>concluded that the untenured, probationary teacher in that case was not entitled to a hearing because he had not proven that his employment rose to the level of a constitutionally protected property interest.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-7\">\u201cThus, the terms of the respondent\u2019s appointment secured absolutely no interest in re-employment for the next year. They supported absolutely no possible claim of entitlement to re-employment. Nor, significantly, was there any state statute or University rule or policy that secured his interest in re-employment or that created any legitimate claim to it. In these circumstances, the respondent surely had an abstract concern in being rehired, but he did not have a <em>property </em>interest sufficient to require the University authorities to give him a hearing when they declined to renew his contract of employment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 578 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-10\">In the context of public employment, we have repeatedly reaffirmed that, as a matter of State law, public employment without more, such as a commission of office, does not rise to the level of a protected property right. See <em>Appeal of Parker, </em>121 N.H. 986, 988, 437 A.2d 283, 284 (1981); <em>Colburn v. Personnel Commission, </em>118 N.H. 60, 64, 382 A.2d 907, 909 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-11\"> This is not to say that probationary employees will never be afforded a right or remedy for wrongful termination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>employment. Although a governmental unit has almost unfettered power to discharge a probationary employee, it may not do so arbitrarily, illegally, capriciously, or in bad faith. <em>Appeal of William H. Oudens, </em>122 N.H. 642, 642-43, 448 A.2d 1374, 1374 (1982); <em>Appeal of Hildegard Tamm, </em>122 N.H. 646, 647, 448 A.2d 1373, 1373 (1982); <em>Appeal of Czeslaw Pawlus, </em>121 N.H. 273, 274, 428 A.2d 487, 488 (1981); <em>Clark v. Manchester, </em>113 N.H. 270, 275, 305 A.2d 668, 672 (1973). In the instant case, however, the teachers were not discharged or \u201cdismissed,\u201d but were merely not hired for a future year; therefore, the above test is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">The plaintiffs next argue that they were entitled to individualized, personal notice of the agenda item relating to teacher nominations which was discussed at the March 9, 1981, school board meeting under RSA ch. 91-A, the \u201cright-to-know\u201d law. RSA 91-A:2 II (Supp. 1981), sets forth all notice requirements for meetings of public agencies as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-6\">\u201c[A] notice of <em>the time and, place of </em>each such meeting, including an executive session, shall be <em>posted in 2 appropriate places </em>or shall be <em>printed in a newspaper </em>of general circulation in the city or town at least 24 hours, excluding Sundays and legal holidays, prior to such meetings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">(Emphasis added.) The plaintiffs contend that in spite of these specific legislative mandates, the public notice required by RSA 91-A:2 II (Supp. 1981) is not sufficient and that they should have been provided with personal notice of the defendants\u2019 March 9, 1981, meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">RSA ch. 91-A does not require personal notice in this situation, nor have the defendants agreed to provide such notification pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement. <em>See Signorino v. Thomson, </em>No. 85-345 (D.N.H. June 13, 1980). In fact, because the Bedford Teachers Association (BTA) is the plaintiffs\u2019 exclusive representative, the defendants are prohibited from discussing the terms and conditions of the plaintiffs\u2019 employment with them directly. <em>See </em>RSA 273-A:5. Personal notice would be inappropriate. Personal notice is also precluded by the plaintiffs\u2019 collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">The defendants and the BTA negotiated a master agreement for the period July 1, 1980, through June 30, 1982, which covered the terms and conditions of the plaintiffs\u2019 employment. Both parties were bound by the agreement. As a result of the negotiations, they agreed that the plaintiffs would be given <em>prior notice </em>of the specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>matters to be discussed at the defendants\u2019 meetings. Section D. of article XIX of the master agreement provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-3\">\u201cPrior to each Board Meeting, an agenda will be sent to the President of the Bedford Teachers Association at an address which the Association places on file in the Superintendent\u2019s office.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">The defendants assert that they complied with this provision by sending a copy of the agenda for the March 9, 1981, meeting to the president of the plaintiffs\u2019 exclusive representative during the week of March 2, 1981. That agenda mentioned that teacher nominations for the 1981-82 school year would be discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\"> The defendants are bound to provide notice in accordance with the parties\u2019 collective bargaining agreement. Through the mechanism of collective bargaining, public employees have the opportunity to expand upon or otherwise make binding agreements concerning rights which they feel may be granted to them by other provisions of law. \u201cNon-tenured teachers who do not like the terms of New Hampshire\u2019s contracts can either bargain to change them or can seek employment in states where their terms are different.\u201d <em>Drown v. Portsmouth School District, </em>435 F.2d 1182, 1187 (1st Cir. 1970) (citation and footnote omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>402 U.S. 972 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Of course, if no notice at all had been given to the plaintiffs constructively, RSA 91-A:2 II (Supp. 1981), or to their bargaining representative, a different question would be presented. <em>See Stoneman v. Tamworth School Dist., </em>114 N.H. 371, 375, 320 A.2d 657, 660 (1974); Douglas, <em>The New Hampshire Right to Know </em>Law\u2014 <em>An Analysis, </em>16 N.H.B.J. 227, 234 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">We note that the trial judge erred when he concluded that actions brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 must be class actions. A section 1983 claim in State court is neither mutually exclusive from, nor co-extensive with, a class action. <em>See Royer v. Adams, </em>121 N.H. 1024, 437 A.2d 316 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">We have considered the plaintiffs\u2019 remaining arguments and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b652-9\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
