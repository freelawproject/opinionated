We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-18\">The plaintiff acted as a sales broker for a number of American manufacturers in the Middle East. Its president, Sayed Badr, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>asserted that by express oral agreement with Charles Wemyss, Senior Vice President of the defendant, the plaintiff was granted sole and exclusive rights for a minimum of five years to represent the defendant in the Middle East. After the plaintiff had acted as a broker for the defendant\u2019s \u201cCampbell Stationery Product Line\u201d for approximately two years,- the defendant terminated the brokerage arrangement. Consequently, the plaintiff brought this action against the defendant for breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-3\">Groveton Papers Co. asserted that the Statute of Frauds barred the plaintiffs action. The plaintiff responded that two letters written by one of the defendant\u2019s officers satisfied the requirements of RSA 506:2, which provides that no action may be brought on an agreement \u201cthat is not to be performed within one year from the time of making it, unless such promise or agreement, or some note or memorandum thereof, is in writing and signed by the party to be charged.. ..\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">The letters to the plaintiff from the defendant regarding the plaintiff\u2019s right to represent the defendant\u2019s \u201cCampbell Stationery Product Line\u201d are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-5\">\u201cNovember 12, 1975</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-6\">Dear Sir:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-7\">The following terms apply to the export of Campbell products through your organization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-9\">Price: 200 carton brackets will apply to all items purchased, Zone A.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-10\">Freight: FOB mill, truckload rate of freight allowed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-11\">Cash</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-12\">Transaction: Irrevocable letter of credit Payable in U.S. funds</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-13\">Limitations: Two truckloads per month (T/L = 40M or approximately 1000 cartons)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-15\">Commission: 5% on prices shown in Zone A price list</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-16\">Very truly yours,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-17\">David Livingstone</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-18\">Vice President \u2014 Sales\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-19\">\u201cMarch 11, 1977</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-20\">Dear Sir:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-21\">Please be advised that as of this date the offer to your <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>company of Campbell Stationery products for export sale as contained in our letter of 12 November 1975 is withdrawn.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-5\">Campbell Stationery will no longer accept orders for its products from Badr Export &amp; Import, Inc. for either export or domestic distribution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-6\">Very truly yours,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-7\">CAMPBELL STATIONERY</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-8\">David Livingstone Vice President \u2014 Sales\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">Pursuant to a motion for summary judgment filed by the defendant, the trial court determined that the above letters failed to meet the requirements of the Statute of Frauds, because they \u201cneither [included] nor [referred] to many essential elements of the alleged contract . . . including exclusivity and term of brokerage.\u201d In granting the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the trial judge concluded that to allow parol evidence for the purpose of establishing material elements of the contract would present the danger the statute was designed to prevent. We agree. The letters do not contain the essential terms of the contract. They do not indicate that the plaintiff was to be an exclusive broker for a five-year period. <em>See Maisch v. Cobb, </em>76 N.H. 62, 63, 79 A.2d 489, 498 (1911); <em>Chellis v. Grimes, </em>72 N.H. 337, 339, 56 A. 742, 743 (1903). To allow parol evidence to supply the essential terms of the contract would circumvent the purpose of the Statute of Frauds. <em>See </em>2 A. Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 27, at 782-84 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-10\">The plaintiff also argues that the less stringent \u201cstatute of frauds\u201d provision of the Uniform Commercial Code, RSA 382-A:2-201, or, in the alternative, the doctrine of equitable estoppel, should be applied in this case. We need not address these issues, as they are not properly before us. <em>See Progressive Survey, Inc. v. Pearson, </em>120 N.H. 58, 61, 410 A.2d 1123, 1125 (1980); <em>Sperl v. Sperl, </em>119 N.H. 818, 821, 408 A.2d 422, 424 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-11\"> On the record before us, we conclude that the trial court was correct in granting the motion for summary judgment because no disputed issues of material fact were presented to it. <em>See Armand Engineering Co., Inc. v. Adrien A. Labrie, Inc., </em>121 N.H. 107, 110, 427 A.2d 15, 16 (1981); RSA 491:8-a (Supp. 1979). Brokerage or agency agreements for indefinite, unspecified periods are terminable by either party at will, subject to the requirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>of good faith. <em>Crowe v. Trickey, </em>204 U.S. 228, 239 (1907); <em>Buttorff v. United Electronic Laboratories, Inc., </em>459 S.W.2d 581, 585-86 (Ky. App. 1970); 2 A. Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 446, at 552 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
