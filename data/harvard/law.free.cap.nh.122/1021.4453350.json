We hold that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-9\">The plaintiffs entered into a written rental agreement for the period from December 12, 1980, to May 30, 1981, with rent payable in advance. The agreement contained the following provision: \u201cThis agreement may be terminated by a 30-day notice to vacate.\u201d It was also stipulated that \u201c[o]ne month\u2019s rent held in reserve\u201d would act as a security deposit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-10\">The plaintiffs vacated the premises on May 30, 1981, without giving any notice. The defendant refused to return the one month\u2019s rent being held because of the failure to give a thirty-day notice, and the plaintiffs brought suit. Trial was held in the District Court <em>{Harry C. Lichman, </em>Special Justice), which found for the defendant. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-11\">A lease is a contract whose terms are to be interpreted according to the rules of contract. <em>Turcotte v. Griffin, </em>120 N.H. 292, 294, 415 A.2d 668, 669 (1980). Generally, interpretation of a written instrument is an issue of law for this court ultimately to decide. <em>Murphy v. Doll-Mar, Inc., </em>120 N.H. 610, 611, 419 A.2d 1106, 1108 (1980). Because the lease terminated by its own terms on May 30, 1981, the notice requirement which applied only to any earlier termination did not apply. There was no requirement that notice be given when the plaintiffs moved out when the tenancy terminated by its own terms. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Property \u00a7 1.6, comment g, illustration 4 at 40 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-12\">The verdict is set aside, and judgment is to be entered for the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-13\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
