The case was eventually scheduled for trial beginning on February 24, 1981. On February 18, 1981, the plaintiff moved to amend her original writ against the defendant to add a claim for enhanced damages because the defendant was operating his automobile while under the influence of intoxicating liquor at the time of the accident in question. The Court <em>(Dalianis, </em>J.) denied the plaintiffs motion to amend, and the plaintiff excepted. After a trial and a jury verdict awarding her damages, <em>Flynn, </em>J., presiding, the plaintiff appealed the court\u2019s pre-trial denial of her motions seeking punitive or exemplary damages to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-16\"> The general rule in New Hampshire is that the trial court has broad discretion in determining whether to grant or deny amendments to pleadings. <em>See Phinney v. Levine, </em>117 N.H. 968, 970, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>381 A.2d 735, 736 (1977); RSA 514:9. The trial court neither abused its discretion nor erred as a matter of law when it denied the plaintiffs motion to amend, because the plaintiff was not entitled either to double damages under RSA 265:89-a or to punitive or exemplary damages under the common law. <em>See Johnsen v. Fernald, </em>120 N.H. 440, 441, 416 A.2d 1367, 1368 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-3\">In <em>Johnsen v. Fernald, </em>we held that the use of the fact that the defendant\u2019s intoxication caused an accident, for the purpose of enhancing damages, is a matter of public policy for the legislature to determine. <em>Id. </em>at 441, 416 A.2d at 1368. Since <em>Johnsen, </em>the legislature has set forth the measure of damages in civil actions involving intoxicated drivers and the conditions for application of statutorily enhanced damages. RSA 265:89-a. This statute provides that double damages shall be imposed on intoxicated drivers whose conduct has caused injury to others, whose intoxication is a contributing factor, and who have been convicted of a second or subsequent offense of driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor within a seven-year period. On the facts of the case before us, RSA 265:89-a is clearly inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b634-5\">Douglas, J., concurs in the result only.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
