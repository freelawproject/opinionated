The appeal involves a dispute between two insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>carriers as to their liability under \u201cthe most recent injurious incident\u201d rule of RSA 281:38-a III (Supp. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">In his petition to the labor commissioner for workmen\u2019s compensation benefits, <em>see </em>RSA 281:37, Barry Morgrage made several allegations. First, he claimed that from March 1966 to December 1979, he had continuously been an employee of the Goffstown Police Department. Next, he alleged that he had sustained several injuries arising out of and in the course of his employment between 1966 and October 17, 1975. Finally, he claimed that he had been disabled from work on December 3, 1979. He failed, however, to cite any specific disabling incidents occurring in the course of his employment during the period from October 17, 1975, to December 3, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">After a hearing, the commissioner ruled that Morgrage\u2019s disability on December 3, 1979, was causally related to his employment with the Town of Goffstown. The commissioner concluded that Penn General Service Corp. (Penn General), the insurance carrier for the town\u2019s workmen\u2019s compensation claims after May 7, 1979, was responsible for the payment of disability benefits to Morgrage.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">Penn General duly appealed the labor commissioner\u2019s decision, claiming that the New Hampshire Insurance Company, the workmen\u2019s compensation insurer for the Town of Goffstown prior to May 7, 1979, was responsible for Morgrage\u2019s disability payments. The matter was submitted to the trial court on the pleadings, the deposition of the claimant, and the depositions of Doctors Merwyn Bagan and Thomas Shireffs, Jr.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">RSA 281:37 I provides that an appeal from the decision of the labor commissioner should be heard in \u201cfull trial\u201d before a justice of the superior court. In such a de novo review, the trial justice may substitute his judgment for that of the labor commissioner. <em>City of Rochester v. Smith, </em>119 N.H. 495, 496, 403 A.2d 421, 422 (1979). The claimant has the burden of proving by competent evidence both the existence of a compensable accidental injury and the extent of his disability. <em>Id,., </em>403 A.2d at 422. The claimant must therefore prove legal causation, that is, that his injury is work-connected, and medical causation, that is, that his disability was actually caused by the work-related event. <em>Id. </em>at 497, 403 A.2d at 423.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\"> Furthermore, when, as in this case, there are two or more successive insurance carriers, only one can be charged for the whole compensation which results from the compensable injury. <em>See Casey\u2019s Case, </em>348 Mass. 572, 574, 204 N.E.2d 710, 711 (1965). In the absence of a second independent intervening contributing cause of disability, the employer\u2019s insurance carrier on the risk at the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>of the original compensable injury is liable for the employee\u2019s continuing incapacity. <em>See Rock\u2019s Case, </em>323 Mass. 428, 429-30, 82 N.E.2d 616, 617 (1948); <em>Sosnowski v. Dandy Hamburger, </em>384 Mich. 221, 226-27, 180 N.W.2d 761, 763 (1970); <em>see also City of Portsmouth v. Meaney, </em>121 N.H. 13, 16, 426 A.2d 21, 23 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">The above so-called \u201cMassachusetts-Michigan rule\u201d became a statutory rule in New Hampshire effective July 1, 1979, as RSA 281:38-a III (Supp. 1981). The statutory rule, referred to as \u201cthe most recent injurious incident\u201d rule, provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-6\">\u201c[T]he employer in whose employment the employee sustained the most recent injurious incident and the insurance carrier, if any, on the risk when such injurious incident occurred, shall alone be liable for benefits allowable under this chapter, without right to contributions from any prior employer or insurance carrier.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">RSA 281:38-a III (Supp. 1981). In successive injury cases, the rule places full liability upon the carrier covering the risk at the time of the most recent injury bearing a causal relation to the disability. 4 A. Larson, The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 95.12, at 17-71 (1982); <em>see City of Portsmouth v. Meaney, </em>121 N.H. at 16, 426 A.2d at 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">The following legislative history of RSA 281:38-a III (Supp. 1981) is consonant with the above interpretation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-9\">\u201cThe purpose of this amendment is to provide that the insurance carrier or employer responsible at the time of the worker\u2019s most recent injurious incident is to be responsible for the entire amount of the claim. . . . This amendment proposes a plain and simple rule: Except in \u2018second injury\u2019 cases the employer and the insurance carrier (if any) on the risk at the time of the last injurious incident is responsible for paying the entire claim.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-10\"><em>Minutes of the Labor Human Resources and Rehabilitation Committee, HB 382 </em>(1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-11\">With respect to the cause and timing of Morgrage\u2019s injury, the trial court found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-12\">\u201cThe testimony of the claimant and the two physicians, both of whom treated the claimant, establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that his injury was causally connected to his employment. . . . Dr. Merwyn Bagan, a neurological surgeon who removed a herniated disc from the claimant\u2019s back in August 1980, stated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>the disc injury was probably related to two incidents occurring in 1975, both of which were employment-related. The first occurred in October of 1975. Morgrage, while performing his duties as a police officer, slipped and fell on wet leaves, wrenching his back in the process. The second occurred in December [1975], when Morgrage was punched by a prisoner. The punch caused him to fall back against a desk and then to the floor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-6\">Morgrage had experienced lower back pain, severe at times, before these incidents, but Dr. Bagan\u2019s opinion is that one of these falls probably caused the herniation. Dr. Thomas Shireffs, Jr., a specialist in orthopedics, stated that the claimant\u2019s back problems were probably caused by a 1970 auto accident in which Morgrage\u2019s police cruiser was involved or a 1972 fall on wet ice while he was checking the door to a pharmacy .... Before the end of 1975, the claimant had suffered or aggravated a back injury in the course of his employment, and one or more of the above-mentioned incidents is causally connected to his disability as of December 3, 1979. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">Based on the testimony referred to in these findings, the trial court ruled that the claimant had suffered a work-related injury at some time before 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">As for the claims of the New Hampshire Insurance Company, the court found and ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-9\">\u201cThe New Hampshire Insurance Company . . . contend[s] that a series of aggravations to the same condition caused the disability. In [its] view the long hours of sitting at a desk or in a cruiser and the wearing of [a] ten-pound gun belt gradually weakened Morgrage\u2019s back until on December 3, 1979, he became totally disabled....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-10\">For employment after the development of a condition to be the legal cause of disability resulting from the condition, \u2018[t]he subsequent employment must contribute something substantial to the ultimate disability.\u2019 (citation omitted). Employment \u2014 related activities that are no more stressful or strenuous than normal nonemployment activities do not make a substantial contribution to the claimant\u2019s ultimate disability. . . . [Morgrage\u2019s] performance of these functions after May 7, 1979, cannot be considered an intervening, contributing cause of his disability, which stems directly from the herniation of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>disc at an earlier time and which had as its immediate cause the most routine of activities \u2014 putting on one\u2019s pants. There was no \u2018injurious incident\u2019 after May 7, 1979, such as to justify imposing responsibility for benefits upon the subsequent insurer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">The trial court concluded that the New Hampshire Insurance Company was solely responsible for the payment of Morgrage\u2019s benefits. The court therefore reversed the decision of the labor commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">The findings and rulings of the trial court must be sustained unless they are lacking in evidential support or tainted by error of law. <em>Talbot v. Catelli Habitant, Inc., </em>122 N.H. 517, 519, 446 A.2d 858, 859 (1982); <em>see Rowe v. City of Portsmouth, </em>122 N.H. 146, 148, 441 A.2d 1181, 1183 (1982); <em>Taylor v. Davidson Rubber Co., </em>122 N.H. 428, 432, 445 A.2d 1119, 1121 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">We hold that there was ample expert testimony to warrant the trial court\u2019s finding that the legal and medical cause of Morgrage\u2019s disability was a herniated disc sustained before 1976 while he was employed by the police department of the Town of Goffstown, and while the New Hampshire Insurance Company insured its work-connected claims. For example, Dr. Bagan testified that \u201cit seems that [Morgrage] had had the same problem since 1975 to 1980, there is nothing new.\u201d In addition, the evidence did not compel a finding and ruling that the most recent injurious incident which was the legal and medical cause of Morgrage\u2019s disability was other than the herniated disc which occurred while the New Hampshire Insurance Company was the insurance carrier for the town.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">Because the evidence supported the trial court\u2019s findings, we affirm the court\u2019s order \u201cthat the New Hampshire Insurance Company is to pay to Barry Morgrage disability benefits for the period commencing December 3, 1979, and ending on the date, if any, that Barry Morgrage is no longer disabled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
