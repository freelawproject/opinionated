The sole issue on appeal is whether the trial judge abused his discretion in imposing that sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">The defendant asserts that the six-month sentence is disproportionate to the offense in violation of the New Hampshire Constitution and violates the defendant\u2019s rights under the eighth and fourteenth amendments to the Federal Constitution. The defendant complains that the trial court imposed a \u201csevere\u201d sentence for what it had determined to treat as \u201ca true first offense.\u201d He further contends that none of the reasons articulated by the court furnished a rational basis for the court\u2019s refusal to suspend the six-month term.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">The sentence imposed is clearly authorized by New Hampshire statute. The defendant was convicted of receiving stolen firearms, RSA 637:7, punishable as a class A felony, RSA 637:11 1(b). The punishment authorized for such an offense includes imprisonment for up to fifteen years, RSA 651:2 11(a). The defendant\u2019s six-month term, likely to be reduced to four months of actual confinement under RSA 651:18, amounts to one-thirtieth of the possible maximum term. The defendant asserts that because sentences of first offenders receiving stolen property are usually suspended, his sentence likewise should have been suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\"> To violate the New Hampshire Constitution, this court has suggested a sentence must be \u201cgrossly disproportionate to the crime.\u201d <em>State v. Wheeler, </em>120 N.H. 496, 499, 416 A.2d 1384, 1386 (1980). A jail term of one-thirtieth the maximum authorized sentence cannot, under any circumstances, be said to meet the \u201cgrossly disproportionate\u201d standard and thus be held violative of the New Hampshire Constitution. Nor can the present six-month jail term be said to be \u201cgrossly disproportionate,\u201d \u201cbarbarous,\u201d or \u201cshocking\u201d within the meaning of the eighth amendment. <em>See Ingraham v. Wright, </em>430 U.S. 651, 666-68 (1977); <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 102-03 (1976); <em>Weems v. United States, </em>217 U.S. 349, 368 (1910).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number> The trial judge stated for the record his reasons for imposing the sentence. <em>See </em>Douglas and Barnes, <em>The Unjust Sentence, </em>19 Judges\u2019 J. 16 (Fall, 1980). Those reasons were: the defendant\u2019s age, 35, and presumed maturity, which the trial judge found to be atypical of the ordinary first offender; the defendant\u2019s failure to tell the truth on the witness stand; and, the nature of the stolen property received by the defendant, <em>i.e., </em>firearms. Taking only the last of these, it is clear that society\u2019s legitimate concern with the public danger of thefts involving firearms increases the need for general deterrence of such offenses, and serves as an adequate justification for imposition of a more severe penalty. Thus, New Hampshire judges have generally dealt more severely with offenses involving firearms. See <em>State v. Leclair, </em>118 N.H. 214, 221, 385 A.2d 831, 835 (1978). We find no abuse of judicial discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-3\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
