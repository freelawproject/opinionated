Additionally, Mr. Bean\u2019s wife, Luvia, also brought an action against Miller for the loss of consortium caused by her husband\u2019s injury. The defendant Merchants, the workers\u2019 compensation carrier for Pride Bean\u2019s employer, paid benefits to Mr. Bean. Additionally, this court decided in <em>Merchants Mutual Insurance Company v. Bean and Miller, </em>119 N.H. 561, 565, 406 A.2d 457, 459 (1979), that Merchants was required to provide coverage for Miller up to the minimum limits of the Financial Responsibility Act, RSA 268:16 III (1977) (now codified at RSA 264:18 III). Therefore, Merchants is liable up to the limits of coverage in the insurance policy which the parties agree are $15,000 per bodily injury and a maximum of $30,000 per accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>In the action by Pride Bean against Jonathan Miller, Merchants paid $15,000 to Mr. Bean. Merchants, however, has a lien against the settlement pursuant to RSA 281:14 I (Supp. 1981) as a result of its payment of workmen\u2019s compensation benefits to Mr. Bean. There is no disagreement that Merchants is entitled to the $15,000 settlement. Mr. Bean, however, claims that his attorney\u2019s fees of $5,067.43, which the parties agree are reasonable, should reduce the amount of Merchant\u2019s lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Mrs. Bean\u2019s action for loss of consortium is still pending. She claims that Merchants is liable up to $15,000 for her action. Merchants, however, argues that because her injury is not a \u201cbodily injury,\u201d it is not liable. Merchants brought an action for declaratory judgment to resolve these issues, and the trial court transferred to this court the questions mentioned above.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">RSA 281:14 I (Supp. 1981) states that whenever an employee recovers damages from a third party, the employer\u2019s insurance carrier \u201cshall have a lien on the amount of damages recovered by the employee, <em>\u201cless the expenses and costs of action </em>to the extent of compensation . . . already paid . . . by . . . the employer\u2019s insurance carrier. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The plaintiff argues that the statute requires that Merchants\u2019 lien be reduced by the total amount of attorneys\u2019 fees incurred by him in the action against Miller. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">In this case Merchants was the insurance carrier for both the employer and Miller, the third party. The rationale that we believe underlies the statute requiring the payment of attorneys\u2019 fees by the insurance carrier, that the costs spent by an employee to recover damages from a third party ultimately inure to the benefit of the employer\u2019s insurance carrier, is not applicable to this case. If Merchants were required to bear the full cost of attorneys\u2019 fees, it would be paying for litigation against itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">On the other hand, we cannot agree with Merchants that the plaintiff should bear the full cost of the third-party lawsuit. The statute expresses an intent that the employer\u2019s insurance carrier pay at least a pro rata share of these expenses. RSA 281:14 IV. Because the statute states that \u201cthe superior court . . . shall order such division of expenses and costs of action, including attorneys\u2019 fees, between . . . the employer\u2019s insurance carrier, and employee as justice may require,\u201d we remand to the superior court for an apportionment of the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees between the plaintiff and Merchants.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">The second question raised in this appeal is whether Merchants is required to provide an additional per person coverage limit to Luvia <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>Bean in her loss of consortium action. We hold that it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-3\">RSA 507:8-a creates a separate cause of action for a spouse\u2019s loss of consortium. <em>LaBonte v. Nat\u2019l Gypsum Co., </em>110 N.H. 314, 318-19, 269 A.2d 634, 637-38 (1970); <em>see Reid v. Spadone Mach. Co., </em>119 N.H. 198, 199, 400 A.2d 54, 54-55 (1979); <em>O\u2019Keefe v. Associated Grocers, </em>117 N.H. 132, 133, 370 A.2d 261, 262 (1977); see <em>also Kingsbury v. Smith, 122 </em>N.H. 237, 243, 442 A.2d 1003, 1006 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\"> Merchants argues, however, that even if Mrs. Bean has a separate cause of action, she has not suffered \u201cbodily injury\u201d within the meaning of the insurance coverage. We agree. This court has not defined loss of consortium as \u201cbodily injury.\u201d <em>Lumberman\u2019s &amp;c. Co. v. Yeroyan, </em>90 N.H. 145, 146, 5 A.2d 726, 727 (1939); <em>see American Asbestos Textile Corp. v. American Mut. Liab. Ins. Co., </em>114 N.H. 806, 809-10, 330 A.2d 451, 454 (1974). Because Merchants\u2019 insurance policy provides coverage only for bodily injury, Mrs. Bean\u2019s loss of consortium action does not entitle her to an additional $15,000. Rather, Merchants\u2019 liability for both Mr. and Mrs. Bean\u2019s injuries was satisfied by its initial $15,000 payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">\n<em>Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b704-6\">Batchelder, J., did not sit; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
