An arbitrator awarded $20,000 to Pierrette Bisson for injuries suffered and $9,000 to her husband, Roger, for loss of consortium. Refusing to confirm the $9,000 award to Roger Bisson, the Master <em>(Robert T. Griffith, </em>J., Ret.) recommended, and the Trial Court <em>{Goode, </em>J.) approved, a ruling that \u201cthe policy limit for one bodily injury in the accident is $20,000, and the claim for the loss of consortium in this case arises from the bodily injury to Pierrette Bisson\u201d and thus \u201cthe policy limit has been exhausted by the payment to her.\u201d We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">In this case, the policy contained a limit of $20,000 for bodily injury to one person and a limit of $40,000 for bodily injury to two or more persons arising out of a single accident. The plaintiff contends that loss of consortium is a separate bodily injury, triggering the $40,000 limit. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-9\">A spouse has a separate cause of action for loss of consortium, RSA 507:8-a; <em>Bean v. Miller, </em>122 N.H. 681, 684, 448 A.2d 424, 426 (1982), but it is not a separate \u201cbodily injury,\u201d triggering the multiple injury limit. <em>See id. </em>at 684, 448 A.2d at 426. Although the language of the policy here contains a definition of \u201cbodily injury\u201d that includes \u201csickness or disease,\u201d we do not find loss of consortium to be included in these terms either. The master <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>correctly determined that $20,000 was the limit of the insurer\u2019s liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-3\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
