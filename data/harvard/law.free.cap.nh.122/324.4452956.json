The sum of $1,000 tendered by the defendant after a conversation with one of the partners was neither capricious nor patently unreasonable and arbitrary. Because no meaningful review of the Court\u2019s <em>{Lynch, </em>A.J.) findings may be had without a transcript of the testimony, the order of the court below giving the plaintiff judgment for $1,000 is summarily affirmed. <em>See </em>Sup. Ct. Rs. 13(3), 15(3). The award of interest and costs to the plaintiff is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-3\">\n<em>Affirmed, except as to interest and costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
