Ransom. The Trial Court <em>(Johnson, </em>J.) approved the Master\u2019s <em>(Roger G. Burlingame, </em>Esq.) recommendation that the plaintiff be required to provide coverage for bodily injury to the intervenor Scott Stowell, who was injured while mowing a lawn in the course of his employment by the defendant\u2019s son, Chris Ransom. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-11\">The principal issues on appeal are: (1) whether the lawn care enterprise of the defendant\u2019s minor son was excluded from coverage as a <em>business pursuit, </em>within the meaning of the policy and (2) whether the policy covered a negligence action against the defendant for the injuries caused by his son\u2019s activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-12\">During the summer of 1976, Chris Ransom, then fifteen years old, and Scott Stowell were engaged in a lawn care enterprise known as \u201cChris\u2019s Lawn Care Service.\u201d The diocese of Manchester had hired \u201cChris\u2019s Lawn Care Service\u201d to mow the lawn of its Claremont property. While using a riding power lawnmower, Scott was seriously injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-13\">Scott Stowell initially sought workmen\u2019s compensation benefits. After a hearing, the labor commissioner determined that Chris Ransom was an employer, subject to the workmen\u2019s compensation act. Because he did not have workmen\u2019s compensation coverage, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>compensation carrier for the diocese was ordered to pay benefits to Scott. The diocese appealed the labor commissioner\u2019s decision to the superior court, but the appeal was not pursued to its conclusion as the parties agreed upon a settlement. Scott Stowell and his father subsequently brought an action against the defendant, alleging that he negligently failed to control his son in the operation of a dangerous activity. The plaintiff then filed its petition for declaratory judgment and the Stowells intervened. The trial court determined that Chris Ransom\u2019s lawn care enterprise was not a \u201cbusiness pursuit\u201d which was excluded from coverage under the policy, and that the plaintiff was obligated to provide coverage. The plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">The record reveals that the defendant\u2019s son had been operating his lawn care enterprise for a number of years. During the summer of 1976, he devoted approximately twenty to twenty-five hours per week to the enterprise. He sought customers by advertising in the local newspaper. Under a loan agreement with his father, he was able to purchase several pieces of lawn maintenance equipment, at a total cost of approximately $1,500. He used the equipment exclusively in his enterprise and he rented storage space to store his equipment. During the summer of 1976, he employed his classmate, Scott Stowell, whom he paid from the proceeds of the enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">The relevant provisions of the homeowner\u2019s policy issued to the defendant read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-7\"><em>\u201cCoverage E </em>\u2014 Personal <em>liability: </em>This company agrees to pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay because of bodily injury to which the insurance applies, caused by an occurrence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-8\"><em>Exclusion l.d.: </em>Under Coverage E \u2014 Personal liability . . . policy does not apply to bodily injury . . . <em>arising out of business pursuits of any insured. . . </em>.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">(Emphasis added.) The term \u201cbusiness\u201d was defined in the policy as a \u201ctrade, profession or occupation.\u201d The \u201cinsured\u201d included the named insured, and his spouse and relatives, if members of the insured\u2019s household. The homeowner\u2019s policy also included coverage for all injuries arising out of the use of motorized maintenance equipment. This coverage applied while the equipment was being used on or away from the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-10\"> The term \u201cbusiness pursuit\u201d as used in the exclusionary clause is clear and unambiguous and must be given its natural and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>ordinary meaning. <em>Trombly v. Blue Cross/Blue Shield, </em>120 N.H. 764, 770, 423 A.2d 980, 984 (1980); <em>see Exeter Banking Co. v. N.H. Ins. Co., </em>121 N.H. 1083; 1086, 438 A.2d 310, 313 (1981). Because Chris\u2019s lawn care service was clearly a \u201ctrade, profession or occupation,\u201d the injury sustained by his employee, Scott Stowell, was excluded from coverage under the defendant\u2019s homeowner\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">The defendant argues that he expected his son\u2019s lawn-mowing activity to be covered under the policy provision which provides coverage for \u201cmotorized maintenance equipment . . . while the equipment is being used . .. away from the premises.\u201d When the policy is read in its entirety, however, <em>Exeter Banking Co. v. N.H. Ins. Co., </em>121 N.H. at 1086, 438 A.2d at 313, it is clear that the business pursuit exclusion applies to all personal liability actions, including injuries incident to the use of motorized maintenance equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">We have stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-7\">\u201cWhere the terms of the policy are clear and unambiguous, an insured may not reasonably expect coverage unless \u2018the parties\u2019 prior dealings would lead the insured to form a reasonable belief that the policy provided him the claimed coverage,\u2019 or unless the insured\u2019s \u2018reliance on the [insurer\u2019s] agent\u2019s assurances was reasonable\u2019 so as to estop the company from denying coverage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">(Citations omitted.) <em>Robbins Auto Parts, Inc. v. Granite State Ins. Co., </em>121 N.H. 760, 762-63, 435 A.2d 507, 509 (1981). The record before us does not support a finding that either the parties\u2019 prior dealings with each other, or the defendant\u2019s reasonable reliance on assurances of the insurer, created an expectation of coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">Because we have determined that Scott Stowell\u2019s injury arose \u201cout of the business pursuits of an insured,\u201d coverage is excluded, and we need not address the defendant\u2019s argument that coverage exists for the intervenor\u2019s action against the defendant based on his negligent failure to supervise his son.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-10\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b632-11\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
