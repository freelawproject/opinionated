The pertinent section of the statute defines a \u201craffle\u201d as \u201ca lottery in which each participant buys a ticket for an article or articles put up as a prize with the winner being determined by a random drawing.\u201d RSA 287-A: 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">The question before us is whether the legislature intended the phrase \u201carticle or articles\u201d to include real estate. We hold that it was not so intended and that a raffle of a condominium or other piece of real estate is not permitted by that statute and would, accordingly, be an unlawful lottery in violation of RSA 647:1.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">In the development of the law, real estate, by virtue of its unique character, has been accorded special status. Real estate, from and before the inception of the Statute of Frauds, has been conveyed, mortgaged, inherited, and contracted for with considerably more formality than the similar transfer of personalty or chattels. The phrase \u201carticle or articles\u201d does not encompass real estate in any form. The word \u201carticle\u201d has been construed to mean \u201csome material or tangible object\u201d in a case involving the seizure of pinball machines. <em>Gayer v. Whelan, </em>59 Cal. App. 2d 255, 262, 138 P.2d 763, 767 (1943). In a case interpreting an anti-monopoly statute, a New York court determined that \u201carticle of commerce\u201d referred to personalty and not to the sale of realty. <em>Nasman v. Bank of New York, </em>49 N.Y.S.2d 181, 183 (Sup. Ct. 1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-10\"> Our legislature has determined that \u201c[w]ords and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>phrases shall be construed according to the common and approved usage of the language; but technical words and phrases, and such others as may have acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning in law, shall be construed and understood according to such peculiar and appropriate meaning.\u201d RSA 21:2. Applying this rule of construction, we answer the transferred question in the negative. If the underlying statute, RSA ch. 287-A, is to be given a broader meaning, it is a matter for legislation rather than judicial decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-3\">\n<em>Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b347-4\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
