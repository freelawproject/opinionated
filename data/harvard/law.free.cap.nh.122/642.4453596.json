Because of budget cuts, he was assigned on July 16, 1981, to a lower classified position in the New Hampshire Water Supply and Pollution Control Commission. On August 12, 1981, one day before his six-months\u2019 probationary period was to end, he was terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-15\"> Although a probationary employee ordinarily has no recourse when he is discharged, because a governmental unit has almost unfettered power to discharge a probationary employee, <em>Clark v. Manchester, </em>113 N.H. 270, 274-75, 305 A.2d 668, 671 (1973), he may not be discharged arbitrarily, illegally, or in bad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>faith. <em>Appeal of Czeslaw Pawlus, </em>121 N.H. 273, 274, 428 A.2d 487, 488 (1981); <em>Clark v. Manchester, </em>113 N.H. at 275, 305 A.2d at 672. The personnel commission misreads <em>Pawlus </em>when it argues that <em>Pawlus </em>prevents the personnel commission from hearing appeals from probationary employees. Rather, the personnel commission is uniquely suited to hear these claims. <em>See Appeal of Hildegard Tamm, </em>122 N.H. 646, 647, 448 A.2d 1373, 1373 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">The personnel commission refused to consider this case because it erroneously believed that it had no jurisdiction. We remand this case for reconsideration. Of course, only if the employee can convince the commission that his termination was \u201carbitrary, illegal, capricious or made in bad faith\u201d under the <em>Pawlus </em>test could he prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">\n<em>Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b663-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
