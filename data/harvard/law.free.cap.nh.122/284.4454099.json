The structure, located adjacent to the Cheshire County Hospital, was designed as a clinic.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">The City of Keene assessed the property as a clinic, including in its fair market value the building\u2019s many specialized features. The plaintiff disputed this assessment and petitioned the superior court for abatement of real estate taxes for the years 1973 through 1979. The Superior Court (Pappagianis, J.), approving the Master\u2019s <em>(Mayland H. Morse, Jr., </em>Esq.) recommendation, entered a decree in the plaintiff\u2019s favor, abating its taxes, because the taxpayer had demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that its taxes were disproportionately higher than those of other property owners within the taxing district. <em>See Stevens v. Lebanon, </em>122 N.H. 29, 32, 440 A.2d 451, 453 (1982). The City of Keene appealed. Because we conclude that the master committed an error of law, <em>see New England Power Co. v. Littleton, </em>114 N.H. 594, 599, 326 A.2d 698, 701 (1974), we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">Under RSA 75:1 (Supp. 1981), all taxable property shall be appraised \u201cat its full and true value.\u201d <em>See Milford Props., Inc. v. Town of Milford, </em>119 N.H. 165, 168, 400 A.2d 41, 43 (1979). Property is to be valued at its \u201cbest and highest use.\u201d <em>See Blue Mountain Forest Ass\u2019n v. Town of Croydon, </em>119 N.H. 202, 203, 400 A.2d 55, 56 (1979); <em>New England Power Co. v. Littleton, </em>114 N.H. at 597-98, 326 A.2d at 700. The parties have agreed that the highest and best use of the property is as a clinic. As this case illustrates, however, the search for fair market value is not an easy one, and is akin to \u201ca snipe hunt carried on at midnight on a moonless landscape.\u201d <em>Fusegni v. Portsmouth Housing Auth., </em>114 N.H. 207, 211, 317 A.2d 580, 583 (1974) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">In this case, the parties agreed to compute fair market value as reproduction cost less depreciation, <em>see Stevens v. Lebanon, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>122 N.H. at 31-32, 440 A.2d at 453, a method of valuation which we have recognized as valid. <em>Paras v. Portsmouth, </em>115 N.H. 63, 67, 335 A.2d 304, 308 (1975). The parties, however, do not agree how reproduction cost should be computed. The plaintiff believes the \u201cspecial purpose items\u201d which make the building a clinic should be excluded from the reproduction cost figure, but the city asserts they should be included.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-3\">The master adopted the plaintiffs theory. He reasoned that because certain specialized features of the building were \u201cobsolete\u201d and \u201cnon-saleable,\u201d the property was not saleable as a clinic and therefore should have been assessed at a lower value. Nothing in our case law indicates that property should be assessed at a value lower than its highest and best use simply because its design and equipment are not the most modern available. Excluding the special features of the plaintiffs building would transform the property into something other than a clinic. The city\u2019s expert put it this way: \u201c[I]f these items . . . were not in this building, it would not be a clinic, so you would not be appraising a clinic, you\u2019d be appraising something else.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\"> When property is appraised, all factors relevant to its value should be considered, <em>Paras v. Portsmouth, </em>115 N.H. at 67-68, 335 A.2d at 308, including special architectural features and equipment. Although it may be difficult to estimate, the special features, and equipment have <em>some </em>market value. \u201c[T]o hold there is no market value . . . would mean that valuable property would entirely escape its just share of the burden of taxation.\u201d <em>Public Service Co. v. New Hampton, </em>101 N.H. 142, 146, 136 A.2d 591, 595 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">The master also refused to assess the plaintiff\u2019s building at its fair market value because he believed the building could not be resold as a clinic and therefore had no fair market value as such. He reached this conclusion because the doctors associated with the clinic when suit was brought represented \u201cabout 85% of the total medical practitioners in the area. . . .\u201d Although this fact may be true, it does not establish the absence of a market. We have examined the record and found nothing indicating that the building could not be sold as a clinic.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Because he found that the building could not be sold as a clinic, the master refused to assess it as a clinic in order to avoid taxing the personal value to the owner. We agree that worth to the owner alone is not the appropriate standard for taxation, <em>see Trustees &amp;c. Academy v. Exeter, </em>92 N.H. 473, 481, 33 A.2d 665, 670-71 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>(1943); however, \u201ctransmissible value\u201d can be taxed. <em>See Public Service Co. v. New Hampton, </em>101 N.H. at 147, 136 A.2d at 596. The record does not support the master\u2019s finding that the specialized features of the plaintiff\u2019s clinic have no transmissible value. The record indicates the opposite: twenty-nine of the clinic\u2019s thirty-two offices are filled; the building is in a prime location; and Stuart Blakeley, Administrator of the Keene Clinic, testified that the building has \u201cfunctioned well\u201d as a clinic, although certain features could have been \u201cdesigned more efficiently.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-3\">The plaintiff should be taxed on its property\u2019s fair market value, and fair market value encompasses \u201cuse of the property for the special purpose for which it has been constructed and is being employed. . . .\u201d <em>Amoskeag-Lawrence Mills v. State, </em>101 N.H. 392, 399, 144 A.2d 221, 226 (1958) (citation omitted) (definition of fair market value for eminent domain purposes was in harmony with definition for tax purposes). The master erred in granting an abatement to the plaintiff by excluding from taxation those features which make the clinic a clinic. Only personalty on the premises should be excluded from the real estate\u2019s fair market vlaue.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b307-5\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
