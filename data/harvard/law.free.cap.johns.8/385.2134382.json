Cooper </em>and <em>A. </em>Craig, (under whom the lessors of the plaintiff deduced title,) to the <em>people of the county of </em>Otsego, bearing date the 22d March, 1791, for the premises in question, and a deed from the <em>supervisors of the county </em>to the defendant, dated <em>r J J </em>6th October, 1809, which sale was under the act of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>21st <em>February, </em>1806, entitled, \u201c An act for raising money t0 build a court-house and gaol in the county of <em>Otsego </em>by which it was enacted, \u201c that the board of supervisors were <em>authorized to sell </em>the then court-house and gaol and <em>lot </em>on which they stood, (being the lot in question,) in such manner as they should think proper.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-7\">It was admitted that under the deed to the people of the county of <em>Otsego, </em>the supervisors had, in 1792, erected a court-house and gaol on the premises in question, and that they were used as such, until the sale by the supervisors to the defendant. A verdict was found for the plaintiff, subject to the opinion of the court, on a case containing the facts above stated.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Akm\"><em>Campbell, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8F\">1. The people of the county of <em>Otsego, </em>were not competent to take a grant of land. To every deed there must be parties, a grantee as well as a grantor, and the grantee must be capable of receiving the grant, otherwise the deed is void.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Persons capable of granting, or receiving a grant, are either <em>natural </em>persons, or <em>corporations. </em>The deed could not operate as a grant to the people of <em>Otsego, </em>in their natural capacities, for there were no persons <em>named; </em>and not being incorporated, they could not take as a corporation.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> It will hardly be pretended that the counties are corporations <em>; </em>and it was incumbent on the defendant, if rests on tbat ground, to show that they are corporate bodies.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b394-10\">By the act of the 8th <em>April, 1801, </em>(sess. 24. c. 180. s. 8.) the <em>supervisors </em>are enabled to take conveyances of land for the use of the counties. This shows that the legislature did not consider them as corporations.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b394-11\">2. The act of the legislature, passed'21st <em>February, </em>18\u00fc\u00e9, (sess. 29. c. 18. s. 5.) authorizing the board of supervisors to sell the court-house and gaol with the lot of land on which they stood, in such manner as they might think-proper, did not confer on the purchaser <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>a title, if there was none in the county or supervisors, . , , , , \u2022 i It was a private act, and could not authorize the supervisors to convey any other or greater interest than the county possessed. The rights of no persons can be affected by a private act, except the parties to such act.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The legislature, no doubt, were under a mistake, as to 07 7 the title of the county, when they passed the act.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b395-11\">Sedgwick, contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6g\">The defendant is a <em>bona jide </em>purchaser from' the supervisors who represent the county. The lessors are estopped, by their deed, .to say that the people of the county had no title.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AlW\">Again, a deed to the people of the county will pass the land to the supervisors, who represent the county, in the same manner as a deed to the administrators of <em>A. </em>without naming them, is good.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b395-15\">Again, the legislature have passed an act to enable the supervisors to sell the land, which gives them the capacity to take it. And it makes no difference, in this respect, whether the act was public or private. Cooper, and the other lessors claiming under him, cannot, now, object, for they must be presumed to have consented to the act of the legislature. If it was the intention of the lessors that the land should not pass, they ought to have avoided the grant, before the passing of the act of the legislature.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b395-17\">Henry, in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABex\">The grant was to the <em>people </em>of the County, in their collective capacity. It cannot be pretended that they have, collectively, a capacity to take land.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b395-18\">There can be no <em>estoppel </em>in this case, for both parties must be'bound by an estoppel, or neither. Then there is no mutuality; for the grantor would be estopped, and the incapacity of the grantee could never be \u00f3bjected, on the ground of an estoppel.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b395-19\">The act of the legislature authorizing the supervisors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>to take, cannot render valid a prior deed to the people of the county; but shows that they had no capacity to take a grant of land. The act authorizing the supervisors to sell, being a private act, can affect parties only. It is a mere\"naked authority to sell, without declaring the effect of the sale.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b394-8\"> 2 <em>Bl.

They were not a corporate bod}' known in law. It is a settled rule of the common law, that a community, not incorporated, cannot purchase and take in succession. <em>(Co. Litt. </em>3. a. 10 <em>Co. </em>26. b. <em>Com. Dig. </em>tit. <em>Capacity, B. </em>1.) The act of 1801, <em>(Laws, </em>vol. 1. p. 561.) declaring valid certain conveyances to the supervisors of a county, does not apply to this case, for this was not a conveyance to the supervisors. A grant, to be valid, must be to a corporation, or some person certain must be named, who can take, by \u2022force of the grant, and who can hold either ip. his own right, or as' trustee. <em>(Perkins, </em>s. 55. 2 <em>Johns. Cas. </em>324.)</p>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">Nor can the act of 1806, authorizing the supervisors to sell the premises, be construed to devest the lessors of the plaintiff of their right. It is not to be presumed that the legislature intended to authorize the supervisors, td convey any thing more than the right and title which they might have had in the lot. The act was, no doubt, passed tinder the impression that the supervisors had a legal conveyance for the <em>premises; </em>and from the principles contain-, ed in the case of <em>Jackson </em>v. Catlin, (2 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>248.) and which has since been affirmed in. the <em>court for the correction of errors, </em>conveyances by statute are not to be Construed to pass any other or different right than that which the party before possessed. To take away private property by public authority, even for public uses, without making a just compensation, is against the fundamental principles of free government,\u2022 and this limitation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>power is to be found, as an express provision, in the constitution of the <em>United States.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">For these reasons, judgment must be rendered for the plaintiff. .</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
