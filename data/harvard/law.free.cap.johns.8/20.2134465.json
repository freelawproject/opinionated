The person who deIjyered it, a partner of the attorney for the plaintiff, said 1 <em>f </em>r 7 that the plaintiff, he supposed, did not wish to distress 1 \u2019 . , , \u2019 the defendant, but wished a fevy to be made, so as to se- , . , . . <em>. . </em>_ cure the debt, and give no other execution the preference5 l^lat ^ die sheriff permitted the property to remain in t^e possession of the defendant, he would not consider t^ie sheriff responsible, in case it was squandered; that he need not take a receipt. Levy was made on the execution; . <em>r </em>and nothing more done, or any further instructions given, .. , , \u201e , . . - until after the return day of this execution, nor till after the receipt of another <em>fieri facias </em>against the said defendant, at the suit of <em>Calvin Barker, </em>issued out of the suPrelne court, for 279 dollars and 43 cents, and a levy was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>made under it on the same property. When I received f r <em>1 </em>, instructions to proceed on this execution, I advertised the property for sale by virtue of both executions, and have levied and made the sum of 263 dollars and 50 cents, which I have ready to deliver to <em>Ellis </em>Doty, the within-named plaintiff, to the amount of the execution, or to <em>Calvin Barker, </em>named in the other execution, as the court shall award and order, and the within-named <em>John Pierce </em>hath not any other or more goods and chattels, lands or tenements in my bailiwick, whereby I can cause to be levied and made, the residue of the debt and damages mentioned in the two executions, or either of them.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel called the partner of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, who delivered the execution to the sheriff, for the purpose of falsifying the return. He was objected to by the defendant, but the judge overruled the objection. He testified that he gave the execution to the deputy of the sheriff, and directed him to proceed thereon; but at the same time told him that he did not believe it would be the plaintiff\u2019s wish to distress Pierce, as he was the plaintiff\u2019s father-in-law; and that there was no occasion to get a receipt for the property, after he had levied on it, as <em>Pierce </em>would not squander or conceal it, and he need not remove the property. He did not tell the deputy sheriff to delay proceeding on the execution, until after the time it was made returnable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-7\">The deputy sheriff who made the return, after being released by the witness, testified to the truth of the return. Nothing was said to him, as to the time to which the delay of the execution was to extend; but he did not understand it was to be delayed, so as to suffer another execution to gain a preference.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-8\">It was further proved, that no money was actually paid to the defendant; but the property was bid off by the subsequent creditor, and was accepted by the defendant,, as a payment on the subsequent execution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AnX\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>The judge directed the jury to find a verdict for the plaintiff for the amount of his execution, with interest, on the ground that there had not been such a delay by the plaintiff, as to give a preference to the second execution ; and the jury found a verdict accordingly,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AqdE\">A motion was made to set aside the verdict, and for a new trial; 1. Because the judge admitted improper tes\u00bb timony; 2. Because he misdirected the jury.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b30-6\"><em>Foot, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b30-7\"><em>H. Bleeder, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMT\">He cited 1 <em>Wils. </em>44. <em>Peake\u2019s N. P. </em>65. 2 <em>Bos. </em>&amp; <em>Pull. </em>59. 2 Saund. 344. 2 Lord <em>Raym. 1075. Cro.

It was competent for the plaintiff to prove by the agent what those directions were, notwithstanding the return, for the recital on the subject in the return, was of extrinsic matter, not appertaining to a strict official return. The testimony given by <em>Houghton </em>does not, however, essentially vary from that stated by the defendant. The information given to the defendant upon delivery of the execution, was, that he need not remove the property to be levied on out of the possession of <em>Pierce, </em>nor need he take a receipt for it. This he said upon the supposition or belief, that the plaintiff did not wish to distress <em>Pierce. </em>There were no instructions to delay the proceedings after seizure, and the defendant only <em>inferred </em>a consent to the delay which took place. There was no agreement between the plaintiff and <em>Pierce, </em>that the execution should sleep in the sheriff\u2019s hands; and it does not appear, from the case, what time elapsed between the delivery of the first and second execution. The case, therefore,-\u2018does not come <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>within the rule of the common law recognised in <em>Whipple </em>v. <em>Foot. </em>(2 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>418.) If a long time had intervened between the one execution and the other, it would have been ground for the jury to have inferred the consent of the plaintiff to the delay, and might have established* the legal presumption of fraud. The direction to the jury was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">The return states that the defendant has 263 dollars and 50 cents, made by virtue of the sale under both executions, which he is ready to deliver to the party entitled. This was evidence sufficient of the receipt of the moneys and the arrangement between the sheriff and the purchaser shows that the former was willing to consider that arrangement as equivalent to the payment of the money. The return authorized the jury to infer the actual receipt of the money, and as the plaintiff in the first execution had not lost his preference, the motion on the part of the defendant to set aside the verdict is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-9\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
