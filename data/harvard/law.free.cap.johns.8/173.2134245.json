The bill of exchange was drawn by <em>C. F. T Biske, </em>on <em>J. A. </em>c&lt;? <em>D. H. Rucker, </em>Esqrs. of <em>London, </em>for 230/. sterling, at 60 days sight, in favour of <em>W. B. Magruder, </em>who endorsed it to the defendant, who endorsed it to the plaintiff. 1 The bill was dated the 23d <em>July, 1799; </em>and was noted <em>n </em>v on the face of it, for non-acceptance, on the 14th <em>Sepiera-' her </em>17QQ vcT, J. / yy\u00ab</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Az7\">It also appeared, by a copy of the protest for non-acceptance, taken from the books of the notary, in <em>July, </em>1804, by another notary, that the bill was regularly pro-<em>J J or </em>tested for non-acceptance, on the 14th <em>September, </em>1799, the notary who made the protest being since dead. It also appeared, by a copy of the protest for non-payment, that it had been regularly protested for non-payment on the 16th <em>November, </em>1799.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Abf\">It appeared further, from the record, that the declaraiion, first filed by the plaintiff, on the 6th <em>December, </em>1800, was upon the protest for non-payment of the 16th <em>November, </em>1799; and that on the prayer of the plaintiff, a commission to examine witnesses in <em>London </em>and <em>New-Orleans </em>was issued the 11th <em>May, </em>1802. On the 14th _ , . <em>May, 1803, </em>the plaintiff, it appeared, prayed leave to amend his declaration, by adding a count on the protest for <em>non-acceptance, </em>on the 14th <em>September, </em>1799; which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>amendment was allowed by the court. The amended declaration contained also the count on the protest for <em>non-payment.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A7F\">The record contained, also, a deposition taken the 3d March, 1.803, at Baltimore, which was read in evidence. It slated that the witness, in the absence of the plaintiff, received, in November, 1799, a letter directed to the plaintiff, from his correspondent in London, dated 1.3th <em>Sept. </em>1799, advising that the bill in question had been protested for non-acceptance, of which the witness gave due notice to the defendant, in February, 1800; that immediately on receipt of the news that the bills were protested for non-payment, and returned by the brig <em>John Brockwood, </em>from London, which was given by a letter from the plaintiff\u2019s correspondent, dated the 21st November, 1799, notice was given to The defendant. It appeared that the vessel, called the <em>John </em>Brockwood, by which the first of the set and protests were sent, had been lost and was believed to have foundered at sea, and the witness stated, that as soon as it was believed that she was lost, the plaintiff sent to <em>London </em>for the second of the set, which was received by the plaintiff, in September, 1800, enclosed in a letter, dated the 28th June, 1800; that on receipt of the second of the set, the witness, as agent of the plaintiff, in his absence, called on the defendant and demanded payment; but received no satisfactory answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-7\">The plaintiff also gave in evidence, the following letter from the plaintiff to the defendant:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-8\">\u201c New-York, <em>October </em>1, 1799.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-9\">\u201c Since I wrote you last, I have appointed Mr. <em>Ray </em>as my attorney.

The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-7\">A motion was made to set aside the verdict and for a new- <em>trial; </em>and the following points were raised by the counsel for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-8\">1.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJp\">delivered the opinion of the court. The judgment in <em>Maryland, </em>upon which this suit was brought, was rendered against the defendant, as an endorsor of a foreign bill of exchange, and he now contends that he was not chargeable, by reason of the want of due notice of the non-acceptance, and of the non-payment of the bill. Whether notice of the non-acceptance of the bill, without accompanying that notice with the protest for non-acceptance, was competent, under the law of merchants, to charge the party, is a point which we need not now dis.cuss, as the suit in <em>Maryland </em>was upon the <em>protest </em>for, non-payment, as well as for the non-acceptance; and the non-payment, if supported by the requisite notice and proof, was sufficient to sustain the action. It has been urged to the court that there was not due diligence in giving notice of non-payment, and that the question of diligence is open here for investigation, notwithstanding the trial and judgment in the other state. But we are by no means satisfied that such.an inquiry ought now to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>be pursued, after the question has been once fairly litigated and decided. The question of reasonable notice is a compound of law and fact, to be submitted to a jury. (6 <em>East, </em>3. and 14. <em>in notis. </em>1 <em>Sch. &amp; Lefroy, </em>461. 1 <em>Campb. </em>248.) The judgment in <em>Maryland </em>is presumptive evidence of a just demand ; and it was incumbent upon the defendant, if he would obstruct the execution of the judgment here, to show, by positive proof, that it was irregularly or unduly obtained. We do not know the whole amount of the evidence that may have been given upon the trial in <em>Maryland. </em>The record contains a deposition, but does not state whether any, or what additional proof was given. To try over again, as of course, every matter of fact which had been duly decided by a competent tribunal, would be disregarding the comity which we justly owe to the courts of other states, and would be carrying the doctrine of reexamination to an oppressive extent. It would be the same as granting a new trial in every case, and upon every question of fact. Suppose a recovery in another state, or in any foreign court, in an action for a <em>tort, </em>as for an assault and battery, false imprisonment, slander, &amp;c. and the defendant was duly summoned and appeared, and made his defence, and the trial was con^ ducted orderly a.nd impartially, according to the rules of a civilized jurisprudence, is every such case to be tried again here upon the merits ? I much doubt <em>whether the </em>rule can ever go this length. The general language of the books is, that the defendant must <em>impeach </em>the judgment, by showing, affirmatively, that it was unjust, by being irregularly or unfairly procured.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">In the case of <em>Hitchcock </em>&amp; <em>Fitch </em>v. <em>Aickin, </em>(l <em>Caines, </em>460.) this court Went no further than to decide the general principle, that a judgment of another state was not conclusive, but was to be placed upon the footing of a foreign judgment under the <em>English </em>law. '1 he question then is, how far, and to what extent, do the <em>English </em>courts permit <em>foreign </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>judgments to be opened, to let in a re-examination of . 1 . . the merits. The case of <em>Sinclair </em>v. <em>Fraser, </em>contains the rule of the <em>English </em>courts. It was decided by the house of lords, on the 4th of March, 1771, upon an appeal from the court of <em>sessions </em>in <em>Scotland. </em>(Cited by Mr. <em>Wedderburne, </em>the solicitor-general, in the case of the <em>Dutchess of </em>Kingston, 11 <em>State Tr. 222.) </em>A suit was brought upon a judgment in <em>Jamaica; </em>and the question was, what should be the effect of the judgment; and the court of <em>sessions </em>refused to give any effect to it, and held the party bound to prove the ground, the nature and the extent of his demand. But upon appeal to the house of lords, the judgment of the court of <em>sessions </em>was reversed, and the rule of law was stated in the judgment of reversal ; \u201c that the judgment of the court of <em>Jamaica </em>ought to be received, as evidence, <em>prima </em>facie, of the <em>debt; </em>and that it lies on the defendant to impeach the <em>justice </em>of it, or to show that it was <em>irregularly </em>and <em>unduly </em>obtained.\u201d This decision was cited in <em>Galbraith </em>v. Neville, (K. B. 29 <em>Geo. </em>III. <em>Doug. Rep. </em>3d edit. p. 5. note,) and Mr. Justice <em>Buller </em>said, that it had always been considered as establishing the true rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">In the present case, the defendant has certainly not succeeded in impeaching the judgment. He has, at most, only excited doubts, under the obscure, and, perhaps, very imperfect testimony before us, as to the fact of due diligence in giving notice of the protest for non-payment. And where the party has once litigated his case, before a competent jurisdiction, and when no fraud or unfairness is pretended, every doubt and eyery presumption arising on a matter <em>in pais </em>ought to be turned against him. We may, with propriety, adopt the observation of Lord Kenyon, in the case of <em>Galbraith </em>v. Neville, as stated in a note to <em>5 </em>East, 475. that \u201c without entering into the question how far a foreign judgment was impeachable, it was, at all events, clear, that it was <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the debt, and that no evidence had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>been adduced to impeach this.\u201d The motion on the part of the defendant, for a new trial, is therefore denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
