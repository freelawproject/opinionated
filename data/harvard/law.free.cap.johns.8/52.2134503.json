The judge rejected the evidence of the <em>test. ft. fa. </em>The defendant then offered to prove that the <em>test. fi. fa. </em>was in his hands, as sheriff of the county of <em>Ontario, </em>between the <em>teste </em>and return day thereof; and that by virtue thereof, he, as sheriff, took the whiskey in question, as the property of <em>Moses Johnson; </em>but this evidence was rejected; and the jury, under the direction of the judge, found a verdict for the plaintiff for 1,690 dollars and 91 cents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>A motion was made to set aside the verdict and for a new trial, for the misdirection of the judge.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b61-7\"><em>Rodman, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWx\">said, that the only question was, whether the <em>alias </em>test.fi. <em>fa. </em>ought not to have been received in evidence. He contended that it was not necessary to show that the execution had been returned. In <em>Rowland </em>v. <em>Veale,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the distinction was laid down between <em>mesne </em>process, and process of exeeution; and that it was not necessary to show a return of the latter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b61-8\">Though by the 7th section of the statute, (24 sess. c. 105.) the sheriff and his under officers are required to endorse on all writs of execution the day when they are received ; yet it was immaterial, in the present case, and not a sufficient reason for rejecting the evidence. The reason of the requisition, is to ascertain which of several executions has a preference, or first binds the property.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b61-10\">Sedgwick, contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Az0\">The reason for showing a return of final process seems equally strong as that for showing the return of <em>mesne </em>process. In <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Blewitt,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2020</em></footnotemark><em> Holt, </em>Ch. J. lays it down, as a general and <em>settled </em>rule, that where a principal officer justifies under a returnable writ, he must show that it was returned; and that a sheriff cannot justify under a <em>fieri facias </em>without showing a return. The same rule was laid down by the Ch. J. in <em>Middleton </em>v. <em>Price.</em><footnotemark><em>\u2021</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b61-14\">2. The direction of the statute is positive that the time of receiving the execution shall be endorsed by the sheriff; and the reason has been stated, that it might appear which of several executions had the preference. It was the duty of the sheriff to make this endorsement; and he cannot justify himself when he has omitted to perform his duty; nor can he take advantage of his own wrong. It did not appear but that this execution had been just issued from the clerk\u2019s office. To show that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>had acted upon it, there should have been an endorsement by the sheriff.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AhI\"> Cowp 18. 10 East, 82, 6 Co.90.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"A9S\"> <em>Salk. </em>409. 1 <em>Ld.

It was formerly understood otherwise, according to. the opinion of <em>Kingsmill, </em>J. in <em>21 Hen. </em>VII. 22. b. and of Lord <em>Holt </em>and the rest of the judges of the K. B. in <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Blewitt, 1 Salk. </em>409. But the recent decisions are founded on better reason and ought to govern. Nor did the want of an endorsement upon the execution, of the time of receiving it, render it inadmissible in evidence. The statute requiring the sheriff to endorse the time, was merely directory to the officer, for the sake of greater certainty ; and the omission' to do it will not preclude the sheriff from showing the time by parol proof. It may turn every presumption, arising from doubt as to the precise time, against him; but it will not absolutely shut out other proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">The verdict must be set aside, and a new trial awarded, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">New trial granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
