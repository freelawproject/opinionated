I give and bequeath unto the said James, and my beloved sisters, <em>Rachel </em>and <em>Mary, </em>two thirds of all the aforesaid described premises, bequeathed unto my wife <em>Charlotte, </em>to be enjoyed by them in equal parts, in case the said <em>Charlotte </em>should intermarry, or in case of her death, to have and to hold the same tq them and their heirs for ever.\u201d The testator died the 23d <em>October, </em>1808, leaving'no issue. <em>John White, </em>the lather of fhej.est.ator, and his heir, was one of the lessors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-8\">The testator was a clothier, and purchased the place in question, about twelve years ago, and erected a shop and mills, and carried on the business extensively, until his death. The business of a clothier in that part of the country, is \u00a1tarried on in the spring and autumn, and does not interfere with the keeping of a hoarding house, at the time visitors usually resort to the springs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-9\">Three or four years after he' made the purchase, the testator built additions to the house, and .enclosed a convenient yard with a piclcet fence; and kept a boarding house for the accommodation of persons visiting the springs; and, frequently, had sixty or eighty boarders at a time. There is a large court yard in front extending to the highway. He also built a large stable, repaired the barn for stabling horses, and for a coach house. There was a gate at the corner of the hojse, through which, was a passage to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>the stables, &amp;c. On the east ahd west side of the house . . there were several lots, occupied by the testator, in his life-time, as kitchen gardens, and enclosed with a picket fence. On the east side of the house lot is a way leadjng from the highway to the premises in question, principally occupied by <em>E. </em>White, jun.; the remaining part of the premises consisted of plough land, pasture, orchard and wood land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-7\">Some years before his death, the testator enclosed a few acres of the wood and pasture land, with a picket fence, and put in two young deer, where, he said, would be a pleasant walk for his boarders. He occasionally used the enclosed land as pasture. On the plough land he raised vegetables for the use of his family and boarders ; and the wood land furnished some fuel, though not enough for his use. All the different lots opened into that part of his premises on which the barn and stables stand. The lot on which the house stands is large, and the bouse has been long kept as aboardinghouse atthesprings. It may be used as such, without the premises in question; but with less convenience and advantage. The testator bad no other property than what he devised by his will.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b69-9\">Palmer, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUA\">The only question is, whether the words of the testator, in the devise to the wife, comprehend the premises in question.

Walton </em>and <em>'Henry, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ata_\">We contend that the\" words of the will, if used in a deed, would pass the premises question.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The meaning of the word appurtenances, depends on the subject. The boarding-house was the principal,or subject, and the premises the <em>accessory or incident.' </em>If the words would be sufficient in deeds and surrenders, they must be so in a devise, for courts are much more liberal in the construction of wills, to give effect to ..the intention- of the testator.- The heir at law takes only what is not devised from him.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> And when the intention . , is clear, the court will supply omissions, &gt;or correct mistakes.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> In <em>Clements </em>v. <em>Collins,</em><footnotemark><em>\u00a7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>where the testator devised <em>u </em>the house he lived in and garden, to'S.\u201d the stahies, coal pen, &amp;c. were held to pass, though used for. the purposes of the testator\u2019s trade, as well as for the convenience of his house. The court will take the word <em>appurtenances </em>in its popular and more extended sense, in order to give effect to the clear intent of the testator.<footnotemark>\u00b6</footnotemark> If outhouses and buildings are included' in the word appurtenances, the land on which they stand must also he included.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_Z\">In <em>Carden </em>v. Tuck,<footnotemark>\u2020\u2020</footnotemark> it was held that by the devise of a messuage, a garden, and the curtilege passed, though the word appurtenances was not used by the testator. In <em>Smithson </em>v. <em>Cage,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2021\u2021</em></footnotemark><em> </em>a messuage with the appurtetenances was surrendered, and it was held that the orchards, yards, curtilege and garden, passed with the house.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b70-10\">The word <em>premises </em>used in the last part of the will includes the house and lands, and shows that the testator, by the word appurtenances, intended to include the land occupied with the house. The testator clearly did not intend to leave any thing to his father j but made ample provision for his support during life. He had no chil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>dren, and the devise shows that his wife was a favourite object in the disposition of his estate. Two thirds of what was devised to the wife was for her life only, or during her widowhood; in case of her death or second marriage, it went to the testator\u2019s two sisters, for ever.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AYr\"> <em>Bowers </em>v. <em>Blackett, Cowp. 235.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"AHk\"> 2 Salk. 935.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"\u2021\">\n<p id=\"AS_\"> <em>Swinb. 353, 354. note.

He devises not only his dwelling-house, but \u201c all the appurtenances and privileges thereunto belonging,\u201d and designates the subject devised, as \u201c premises,\u201d and which he \u201c improved as a boarding house.\u201d It was the <em>boardinghouse establishment </em>that was intended to be devised, and every <em>privilege </em>appertaining to the use of it, and proper to render it convenient and attractive, as such an establishment, in such a place as <em>Ballston Springs. </em>The outhouses, the garden, the stables, the deer-park and the pasture, and the plough land, were all used by the testator as privileges appurtenant to his large boarding house, and conducive to its support and credit. They were all used by him towards that single object; and it is stated that he sometimes entertained from 60 to 80 persons. The case of <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Collins (2 Term Rep. </em>498.) shows that stables and a coal pen will pass, in a devise, by the words <em>house </em>and garden, they having been used for the convenience of the house. In <em>Nicholas </em>v. <em>Chamber</em>lain, <em>(Cro. Jac. </em>121.) a conduit and water pipes in adjoining land, were held to pass by the words house, <em>xvith the </em>appurtenances, because they were necessary and <em>quasi </em>appendant. The specific bequest of other parts of the estate of the testator to his brother, and the injunction that he should maintain his father, who now claims the premises, as one of the lessors, and the devise of part of the premises to his two sisters, after the death or remarriage of his wife, are corroborative of the intent that the premises should pass to the wife. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>Upon the whole, we think that the general words are suffi- . F , . cient to convey the premises; and judgment ought to be rendered for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">Judgment for the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
