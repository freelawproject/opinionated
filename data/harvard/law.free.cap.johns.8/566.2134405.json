He said it was, as he understood,, the practice of the house of lords, in <em>England, </em>to hear arguments <em>ex parte, </em>and not to give judgment, of course, by default; but there were other reasons why this court should not allow of such judgments ; for the constitution and rules of this court require the chancellor, in exrery case of appeal, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>the judges of the supreme court, in every case on writ of error, to assign the reasons of their judgment.- This court, then, cannot reverse the judgments or decrees of those courts, without hearing the reasons on which they were founded.- And it might have been, that in this case, had this court heard the chancellor\u2019s reasons, they would have affirmed the judgment',- even on the <em>ex parte </em>argument of the <em>appellant} </em>and he' insisted on the unreasonableness and injustice of the practice of giving judgment by default, as of course, in this court. It appeared, also, by one of the printed rules of the court, that where a defendant in error, of respondent, has not appeared by attorney br solicito!\", that all rules and notices must be served on him in person.-</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b576-5\"><em>RiggSj </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-v\">Said, that the decree of reversal, which had been taken by default, in this cause, had been entered up, and the <em>remittitur </em>taken out of the court, before the order Was entered to stay further proceedings; .and he submitted, whether this court, possessing only an <em>appellate </em>jurisdiction, could now have atiy further power over the cause, when the record had been sent back to the court of chancery. In the case of <em>Dean </em>v. Secord, in 1800, this court decided) that after a <em>remittitur </em>was taken out of court, it was too late to correct any error, even in its own judgment; as the cause was then out of the power .of the court.- He read an affidavit, stating that he served a copy of the petition of appeal on the <em>respondent's </em>solicitor and counsel, in <em>New-York, </em>to whom he gave notice of the exhibiting of the petition to this court; and was informed by the counsel,that he should not attend this cdurt during this session ;\u2022 but could not learn, from inquiry, that the <em>respondent </em>had-employed any one to appear for him in this court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b576-6\">He said, that according to the practice of the court, as he had understood it, from the decision in the case of <em>Nevin </em>v. Belknap, and other causes, a copy or notice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>the rule to answer the petition of appeal, or to join in error, need not be served. The rule of court which it# \u2022 # i\u00bbi had been cited, provided only for the case m which a service of a rule or order was requisite ; but in the present case, the service was not necessaryj and it was not the practice to employ an attorney or solicitor in this court.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b577-5\"><em>March </em>19.</p>\n<author id=\"ABHB\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"ANe\">Ordered, that th\u00e9 decree, in this cause, be set aside for irregularity.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
