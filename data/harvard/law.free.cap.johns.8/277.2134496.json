On the 9th of <em>January, </em>1808, the <em>Hero </em>was boarded by a <em>British </em>vessel of war, the commander of which obliged the master to exhibit the ship\u2019s papers, and endorsed her register, as follows : \u201c His <em>B. M. </em>sloop <em>Grasshopper, </em>9th of <em>January, </em>1808. Pursuant to his <em>Britannic </em>majesty\u2019s orders in council, you are hereby warned to discontinue your voyage to <em>the </em>port of <em>Leghorn, </em>upon pain of confiscation of ship and cargo, if found disobeying the above-mentioned order. And you are, pursuant to further orders from his said majesty, hereby informed, that if you are found proceeding, to any port or place of <em>France </em>or <em>Spain, Portugal, Holland, Denmark, Tuscany, Naples, Ragusa, </em>or the islands lately composing the republic of the <em>Seven Islands, </em>or any other country at war with his <em>Britannic </em>majesty, or from which, though not at war with his said majesty, the <em>British </em>flag is excluded, your ship and cargo will be confiscated as lawful prize to the captors, the above-mentioned ports being declared in a state of blockade.\u201d The commander of the <em>British </em>ship, at the same time, informed the master of the <em>Hero, </em>that in consequence of the orders in council, she would not be permitted to proceed to <em>Leghorn, </em>or any of the ports mentioned in the endorsement on the register, without first stopping at some <em>British </em>port, and that if she attempted to proceed to any of the said ports, both ship and cargo would be liable to be captured by any <em>British </em>vessel of war, and condemned as good prize. The master of the <em>Hero, </em>under these circumstances, deemed it his duty, and for the interest of all concerned, to touch at <em>Gibraltar, </em>that being the nearest <em>English </em>port, and accordingly arrived at <em>Gibraltar, </em>with the ship and cargo, en the 11th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>of January, 1808, where she was subjected, to quarantine, until the 24th of January. He found at <em>Gibraltar </em>20 or 30 sail of <em>American </em>vessels, bound up the <em>Medi</em>terranean., many of whom had stopped there, in consequence of having their registers endorsed, and being warned by <em>British </em>cruisers. That about the 12th of January, the master received intelligence of certain <em>decrees (Milan </em>and Aranjuez) of the <em>French </em>and <em>Spanish </em>governments, declaring that any neutral vessel which should suffer herself to be stopped or visited by an <em>English </em>ship or vessel, or should have submitted to put into an <em>English </em>port, or should pay any imposition to the <em>English </em>government or its officers, should thereby lose its national character, be no longer protected by her flag, and be considered as <em>British </em>property; and that if any such vessel, after having thus lost her national character, should enter the harbours of <em>France </em>or <em>Spain, </em>or their allies, or fall into the hands of the <em>French or Spanish, </em>she should be good and lawful prize. These decrees were published in the gazette at <em>Gibraltar. </em>The master believing that in consequence of these decrees, and the number of <em>French </em>and <em>Spanish </em>cruisers in the <em>Mediterranean, </em>the <em>Hero, </em>if she proceeded on her voyage, would certainly be captured and condemned, determined, after taking the best advice, to abandon the voyage to Leghorn, and return with the ship and cargo to <em>New-York. </em>He accordingly applied to the officers of the government at <em>Gibraltar, </em>for a clearance to the <em>United States, </em>which was refused ; and he was informed by <em>the </em>officers of the government, that no <em>American </em>vessel would be permitted to clear or depart from <em>Gibraltar </em>for any but a <em>British </em>port. Not being able, with the intercession of <em>the American </em>consul, to obtain a clearance for the <em>United </em>States, the master determined to take a clearance for Falmouth, in <em>England; </em>hoping, after he had obtained his clearance for <em>Falmouth, </em>in <em>England, </em>and departed from Gibraltar, he should not be intercepted by any <em>British </em>cruiser, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>be allowed to proceed to the <em>United. States. </em>In order, however, to ascertain whether he should be interrupted, if found proceeding to the <em>United </em>States, with the clearance for Falmouth, the master, on the 28th of <em>February, </em>1808, applied to the commander of a <em>British </em>man of war, the <em>Windsor </em>Castlelying in <em>Gibraltar, </em>and stated that he had obtained a clearance for <em>Falmouth, </em>and desired to know if he would be interrupted by <em>British </em>cruisers, if he attempted, after leaving Gibraltar, to proceed to the <em>United States. </em>He was informed by the <em>British </em>comriiander, that if he attempted to proceed from <em>Gibraltar, </em>for any but a <em>British </em>port, he would be liable to be captured by any <em>British </em>cruiser; and condemned. The master, under these circumstances, and with the advice of the <em>American </em>consul, set-sail on the 29th <em>February, </em>1808, from <em>Gibraltar, </em>under convoy of a <em>British </em>vessel of war, for <em>England. </em>During the voyage, the vessels under convoy were chased, on the 17th of <em>March, </em>by two <em>French </em>frigates, when the convoy made a signal for the vessels, under her charge, to'part, and make the best of their way to the port of destination. The <em>Hero </em>accordingly parted from the convoy, and arrived at <em>Falmouth, </em>in <em>England, </em>on the 23d of <em>March.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-7\"><em>' </em>The master further deposed, that it was solely the fear of capture and condemnation, in proceeding to the port of <em>Leghorn, </em>or to any other port' in the <em>Mediterranean, </em>which induced him to break up the voyage, and not attempt to proceed to any port in the <em>Mediterranean, </em>and that in every thing relative to the ship and cargo, and the intended voyage, he acted with the best advice, ancl solely for the interest of all concerned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-8\">On his .cross examination, the master stated that when, he was boarded by the <em>Grasshopper, </em>he was within the Straits, and about 60 or 70 leagues from <em>Leghorn, </em>and after his register was endorsed, he was verbally directed by the commander to touch at <em>Gibraltar </em>before he pursued his voyage; that at the time he ivas boarded, he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>been beating for several days against a Levanter, an easterly wind prevailing in that sea, which continued several days after his arrival at <em>Gibraltar; </em>and that had he been left to pursue his voyage, it would have taken 10 or 12 days to reach Leghorn, during which time he could not have failed to have fallen in with <em>French </em>and Spanish&gt; as well as <em>British </em>cruisers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-10\">It was admitted, that the plaintiff had made due proof of interest, and had duly abandoned. The <em>British </em>orders in council of the 11th of November, 1807, the <em>Milan </em>decree of the 25th of December, 1807, and the <em>Aranjuez </em>decree of the 3d of January, 1808, were read in evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-11\">The policies in the first two causes contained the following written clauses: \u201c Warranted <em>American </em>property; proof whereof, if required, to be made here only. In case of capture or detention, not to abandon in less than six months after advice thereof at this office, or until after condemnation. If turned away for attempting a blockaded port, the assured to be at liberty to proceed to a port not blockaded.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-12\">In the third cause, the policy contained the following written clause: \u201cWarranted <em>American </em>property; proof to be required here only. Also warranted not to abandon, if detained or captured, until after a detention of six months, unless previously condemned, nor if refused admittance, or turned away, but may proceed to another near open port.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-13\">A verdict was taken for the plaintiff for a total lose, with liberty to either party to turn the case into a special verdict. The other two causes being similar, it was agreed that they should abide the event of the first.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-14\">A motion was made to set aside the verdict, and for a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b289-15\"><em>Golden, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AR5\">Most of the points arising in this case, were decided in the case of <em>Craig </em>v. <em>The United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number><em>Insurance </em>Company.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> There are some facts, however, which distinguish the present from that case. The terms of the endorsement on the register of the Hero, are much stronger, and more comprehensive, than those used in the case of the <em>Amiable Matilda. </em>The going into <em>Gibraltar </em>was justifiable. This was not questioned in <em>Craig </em>v. <em>The United Insurance Company. </em>After the arrival of the <em>Hero </em>in that port, she was under continual restraint by the <em>British </em>government. She was refused a clearance to any but a <em>British </em>port, and, after obtaining a clearance, the master was informed that he would be captured and condemned, if he attempted to return to the <em>United States. </em>The ground of abandonment is a <em>restraint of </em>princes, not the fear of capture.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-9\">Again, there was a justifiable cause for abandoning the voyage, on the ground of the port of destination being shut. It is admitted that the plaintiffs have duly abandoned for a total loss; that is, for whatever was ajustiffiable cause.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b290-10\"><em>Hoffman </em>and <em>T. A. Emmet.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AuJ\">Every point that can arise in this cause has already been decided in the cases of <em>Craig </em>v. <em>The United Insurance </em>Company, and <em>Tenet v. The Phoenix Insurance Company.</em><footnotemark><em>\u2020</em></footnotemark><em> </em>There is no substantial difference between this case and that of <em>Craig </em>v. <em>The United Insurance Company.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-12\">The clause in the policy had reference to the turning away from a blockaded port, not to the new practice of turning away under orders of council. The clause provides, that in case the port of destination is blockaded, the insured may be at liberty to go to a port not blockaded. There is no evidence that <em>Leghorn </em>was, in fact, blockaded. If not, the master ought to have proceeded. If <em>Leghorn </em>was blockaded, then he ought to have gone to a port not blockaded. But the master elected to go into <em>Gibraltar. </em>He was not compelled to go in there; he had passed that port, and tie returned. The neutral is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>not bound to obey the orders of a belligerent, unless the belligerent has a right, by the law of nations, to order, There was no prohibition as to the ports in the <em>Ecclemastical States, </em>in <em>Italy ; </em>the <em>British </em>flag was not excluded from any places within the papal territories, The <em>Hero </em>might, then, have proceeded to <em>Civita Vecchia. </em>A head wind or <em>Levanter </em>was no excuse for not proceeding there, or to the nearest open port to <em>Leghorn. </em>She might have gone to <em>Messina; </em>the <em>French </em>have never occupied the island of <em>Sicily. </em>Why not go to <em>Malta P </em>If she had gone to Malta, she might have left it before hearing of the <em>French </em>and <em>Spanish </em>decrees. We say, then, on the, principle of the decision in the case of <em>Tenet </em>v. <em>The Ph\u0153nix Insurance Company, </em>the going into <em>Gibraltar was </em>a deviation. The vessel lay in that port a month, after the expiration of her <em>quarantine, </em>without any cause assigned for the delay.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-7\">If she rightfully went into <em>Gibraltar, </em>then the policy by the <em>United Insurance Company </em>was at an end; for the clause does not protect her in going to more than ope port not blockaded. If the words \u201c near open port,\u201d mean the nearest port geographically, and all the ports in the <em>MediterraneaJi, </em>except Gibraltar, Were shut, then that was the nearest open port, and the policy by the <em>Phoenix Insurance Company </em>ended there.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-8\">It is said that after the <em>Hero </em>arrived at <em>Gibraltar, </em>she was under restraint; but there was no restraint, except the refusal of a clearance to any other than a <em>British </em>port. A clearance is matter of form. It is the common practice to take a clearance for one port and go to another. After clearing for <em>England, </em>she might, when at sea, have gone where she pleased. Then why not go to <em>Leghorn </em>or the <em>United States P </em>The master states the <em>reason; </em>a <em>fear of capture </em>by the <em>English. </em>The case then comes precisely to that of <em>Craig </em>v. <em>The United Insurance Company.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>Again, we may say, if all the ports were shut, except Falmouth, or a port, in England, then <em>Falmouth </em>became the <em>nearest open </em>port, and the voyage ended there.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AE1\">Harison, in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAH\">We do not mean to controvert the case of <em>Craig </em>v. <em>The United Insurance </em>Company, but we contend that this case is distinguishable from it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-9\">The clauses in these policies were not inserted with a , view to the circumstances which actually took place. If, then, as has been said, they did not refer to the orders in council, the case must be decided as if no such clauses had been inserted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-10\">Admitting that the endorsement on the register, and all the acts of the <em>British </em>officers, were against the law of nations, and unauthorized, still the master is to be considered under the restraint and coercion of princes or powers. It is true, the master of the <em>Hero </em>was not bound to obey; but as he was unable to resist <em>British </em>capture, he was under coercion and restraint. Had he attempted to have gone to <em>C'voita </em>Vecchia, he would have been liable to seizure by the <em>British. </em>Under the new and unforeseen circumstances which took place, the going into <em>Gibraltar </em>was an act of necessity and prudence, and perfectly justifiable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-11\">The <em>Hero </em>could not go to <em>leghorn </em>without being seized. Had she attempted to sail from <em>Gibraltar </em>without a clearance, she would have been liable to seizure; and if, after her departure, with a clearance, she had steered a different course than that which was. in the rout to the port in her clearance, - she would have been seized. <em>Falmouth </em>was a port of necessity, not of choice. Being under convoy for that port, she was compelled to proceed to <em>Falmouth. </em>The voyage was not abandoned <em>quia timet </em>merely; but there was an actual interposition of power and force, which amounts to a restraint of princes, within the terms of the policy.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b290-7\"> 6 <em>Johns.

The United Insurance Company. </em>(6 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>226.) The voyage was voluntarily abandoned at Gibraltar, from fear of capture by <em>French </em>and <em>Spanish </em>cruisers, if the ship proceeded on her voyage to <em>Leghorn. </em>This is stated by the captain to have been the cause of breaking up the voyage ; and it is a clear and well settled principle in the law of insurance, that the fear of loss is not the loss itself, and is no justifiable cause for abandonment. Nor was the apprehension of seizure and confiscation at Leghorn, under the <em>Milan </em>decree, (if any such apprehension existed,) sufficient to create a loss of the voyage. There is no evidence in the case that <em>Leghorn </em>was blockaded, or that neutral trade with that port was interdicted ; and it was, at least, very doubtful, notwithstanding the decree, whether the ship in question could not have safely entered and discharged her cargo at <em>Leghorn. </em>She had not \u201c submitted to be searched,\u201d within any just and equitable construction of the <em>Milan </em>decree ; for the object in boarding her, by the <em>British </em>cruiser, appears in this case, as it did in the case of the <em>Amiable Matilda., (Craig </em>v. <em>The United Insurance </em>Company,) to have been only to warn the vessel not to enter any port in France, or of her allies. The <em>British </em>cruisers were directed by the orders in council of the 11th November, 1807, to give such warning. If the belligerent <em>right of search </em>had been exercised in this case, the fact would undoubtedly have appeared in a more explicit and decided manner. The warning or notice according to the endorsement on the register, is the only evidence we have of the object of the visit, and that object the <em>British </em>vessels of war were at that time bound to pursue, in all cases, though no search might have been intended or required. If being boarded and warned brought the ship within the <em>Milan </em>decree, it might with equal propriety have been deemed so, if the ship had only been hailed at a distance, and interrogated and warned not to proceed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>f\u00b0r the papers appears to have been only foithe purpose of making the endorsement, so as to leave fixed and conclusive proof of the fact of <em>notice. </em>No other motive appears, or is left to be inferred. The captain states no fact of any interrogation or inquiry in relation to <em>search, </em>nor what papers in particular were produced. The words of the <em>Milan </em>decree, in order to check its severity as much as possible, are to be taken in the strictest sense, as referring to an actual and perfect exercise of the right of search into the character and quality of the neutral vessel, and her cargo ; and we are to presume that all maritime tribunals would have given them that construction. The plaintiffs, then, had no right to break up the voyage, and throw the loss of it upon the insurers, if the peril of loss at <em>Leghorn </em>rested (as most clearly it did) in mere apprehension and uncertainty.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Nor can the vessel be considered as under the \u201c restraint of princes\u201d while at <em>Gibraltar. </em>She was at liberty to depart when she pleased. No clearance was requisite. The captain was only threatened with danger of capture from <em>British </em>cruisers, if he proceeded to an.y other than a <em>British </em>port. This was a mere threat, without any legal authority to support it. There was nothing to hinder the ship from returning to <em>America.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">There was no present or existing restraint. The captain ' was only menaced with danger <em>in transitu. </em>The voyage to <em>Leg horn </em>was, therefore, voluntarily abandoned at Gibraltar, and the voyage to <em>England </em>voluntarily undertaken, from mere prudential considerations, witZi which the insurer had no concern. When the voyage to <em>Leghorn </em>was broken up, without any justifiable cause of abandonment, the defendants were discharged, and the sailing to <em>England </em>was the commencement of a new voyage.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">The plaintiffs have not, therefore, shown a right tore-cover; and it has become unnecessary to decide another point raised upon the argument, which was, whether the return of the ship from the <em>Mediterranean </em>to <em>Gibraltar </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>was, or was not, a justifiable deviation under the circumstances in which the ship was placed. It was, at least, a very extraordinary cause of deviation, and it would be difficult to maintain that the cause assigned for it was sufficient. I am, therefore, of opinion, that the defendants are entitled to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">Kent, Ch. J. Thompson, J. Spencer, J. and Yates, J. were also of the same opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">Judgment for the defendants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
