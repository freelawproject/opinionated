The sheriff was then attending to a sick child; and it did not appear that he knew that <em>Weld </em>was in the house. When the execution was delivered, the sheriff asked whether the plaintiff\u2019s at\u00bb torney wished it to be served immediately, to which the person who delivered it, answered, that he did not know, but supposed it would make no difference, if it was not served immediately, or until the return day. <em>Weld </em>lived at a ho\u00fcse within the liberties, about 80 rods distant from the sheriff\u2019s house; and_in the morning of the 14th <em>July, </em>he went a few rods beyond the liberties, but returned ia a few minutes. He was seen within the liberties until the 20th July, when he was committed to close custody on the <em>ca. sa. </em>and he was afterwards discharged under the act for the relief of prisoners, &amp;c. by the court of <em>t </em>common pleas, in January, 1809.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AAG\">It appeared, also, that before' the delivery of the execution to the defendant, a writ had been taken out against him by the plaintiffs, for an escape on the execution, and a coroner requested to serve it the next morning; but that writ was afterwards quashed, and the present suit instituted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-6\">The jury, under the direction of the judge, found a verdict for the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b388-7\"><em>Platt, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AoRk\">The bond taken by the sheriff, for the liberties, was'not only for his security, during the debtor\u2019s confinement on <em>mesne </em>process, but until he should be discharged by due course of law. The delivery of the execution, afterwards1, did not discharge the bond. The statute (sess. 24. c. 91.) says, that \u201cit shall be the duty of the sheriffs to permit any prisoner who. shall be \"in their custody on civil process only, to go at large within the liberties,\u201d provided the prisoner shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>\u00a1live a security by bond. It makes no distinction between <em>J J </em>.... 1 , <em>mesne </em>and <em>final </em>process. The statute did not intend that the sheriff should be obliged to take a <em>new </em>bond, or new security, whenever a ca. <em>sa. </em>was delivered to him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b389-6\">The defendant was in custody, on the surrender by his bail. An actual arrest on the <em>ca. sa. </em>was not necessary; but the delivery of the <em>ca. sa. </em>to the sheriff was a constructive arrest.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> And from the circumstances stated in the case, an actual arrest is fairly to be presumed. The debtor was in the house of the sheriff, and within his view, at the time the execution was delivered to him; and it is right to presume that he did his duty by arresting him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b389-10\">The defendant, then, having a bond as security for the liberties, this case is precisely within that of <em>Tillman </em>v. Lansing.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b389-12\"><em>Gold, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AfF\">The decisions in <em>England, </em>as to constructive arrests, are applicable only where the debtor is in <em>arc-ta custodia; </em>not in a case like the present, where he is at large within the liberties granted by the statute. In <em>Atkinson </em>v. Jameson,<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> the defendant had been arrested and was discharged on the same day, by the sheriff, who did not know that a detainer had been lodged in his office, at the time, at the suit- of another plaintiff; and the sheriff arrested the defendant the next day, and it was held that the second arrest was an original taking, and not a retaking after an escape.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b389-13\">Again, the statute requires that the bond taken should be in double the sum for which the debtor is confined. Here the judgment was for 2,388 dollars and 6 cents, and the bond was for 4,000 dollars only. The present suit is for an escape from custody on a particular execution; and are the bail on <em>mesne </em>process to be held responsible for the increased risk of an escape on the execution ? It was enough, in this case, if the <em>ca. sa. </em>was returned with the prisoner in custody, at the return day thereof; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>**\" was immaterial where the plaintiff was\" before. An arrest is not to be presumed, 'and no arrest at the time of the alleged escape has been proved.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b390-5\">Platt, in reply,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQOx\">said the case of <em>Atkinson </em>v. <em>Jameson </em>was not applicable. There the writs were at the suit of different plaintiffs. The only point decided was, that the sheriff had no right of recaption after a voluntary escape. But in the present case, the execution is delivered' in the same suit between the same parties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-6\">There is no distinction between a person in <em>arcta cus</em>todia, and a person within the liberties <em>; </em>for the liberties are regarded as an extension of the walls of the prison. The debtor is still in prison,1 and the sheriff must be liable for his escape.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"Aj0a\"> <em>1 Salk. 273. </em>3 Com.

The mere delivery of the execu-. tion to the sheriff, was not, <em>ipso </em>facto, and, <em>eo </em>instanti, an arrest, so as to place the prisoner in custody under the execution, by judgment of law. The doctrine in <em>Frost\u2019s </em>case (5 <em>Co. </em>89.) does not apply, when the prisoner is not in close custody, but at large upon, the liberties of the gaol. These liberties are, in many instances, very spacious, and it might be hours before the sheriff could find\" the prisoner, so as to secure himself against the increased, responsibility which the escape of a prisoner in execution might create. The doctrine in <em>Frost\u2019s </em>case is founded on the fact, that it would be a useless and idle act t\u00ae arrest a person already in the close custody of the officer. But a prisoner on the limits is <em>not </em>in such custody, and the sheriff can, on a new arrest, essentially change his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>condition, by requiring new security, or by confining llim.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-3\">The only question of fact, is, whether there was an actual arrest, or any ' act amounting to one, between the time of the delivery of the execution in the evening, and the prisoner\u2019s escape the next morning. The case does not furnish any evidence of such an arrest. The presumption is rather the contrary, considering the situation of the sheriff\u2019s family at the time, and the conversation which passed between the sheriff and the agent who delivered the writ. There would be no use, then, in granting a new trial, in order to have a jury pass upon that fact ; and though the cause was placed upon a different ground at the trial, yet when, upon the view of the whole case, the verdict appears to be correct, the motion for a new ferial ought to be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
