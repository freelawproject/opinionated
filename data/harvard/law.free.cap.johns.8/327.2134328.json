Rep. </em>233.) and the double plea of <em>non assumpsit </em>and <em>plene administrav.it, </em>was not good, without the signature of counsel. Had the last plea been singly pleaded, it need not have been signed by counsel; but double pleas must be sq signed, according to the practice of the court of K. B., which is the practice of this court in those cases in which a different practice has not been established, (1 <em>Tidd, </em>621, 622. 2 <em>Bast, </em>225.) We grant the motion to set aside the default, and to let the defendants in to plead, upon payment of costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
