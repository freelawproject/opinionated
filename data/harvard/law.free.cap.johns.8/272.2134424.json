Where there is an absolute letting to hire, and the hirer pays the master and crew, and has the complete control of the vessel, he is considered as .owner, <em>pro hac </em>vice. In <em>M'Intyre </em>v. Brown,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> the court considered these circumstances as decisive o\u00ed the ownership for the voyage.. If the same person be both owner and master, he cannot commit <em>barratry. </em>If the owner assents to the act of the master, it is not <em>barratry;</em><footnotemark><em>\u2020</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and the shipper of the goods must resort to h<em>is </em>action against the master or ship-owner lor the fraud.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b282-17\">Wells, contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Av_H\">insisted, that the present case was distinguishable from those which had been cited, and that the general rule about <em>barratry </em>was not applicable. The plaintiff is an innocent shipper of goods, and cannot be considered as 'consenting to the act of the master, nor ought he to be affected by his acts, or the conduct of the owner <em>pro hac vice. </em>Suppose the owner of the goods should assent to the <em>barratry, </em>and the owner of the vessel does not consent; then the owner of the goods <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>might, <em>nevertheless, </em>recover for the barratry, if it is to be considered as an act done against the owner of the vessel only.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APZM\">The true principle is, that a party cannot recover on the ground of an act of <em>barratry, </em>to which he has consented; but if committed without his consent, he may recover. Millar,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> in his <em>Treatise on </em>Insurance, vindicates this distinction, though it must be admitted that the decisions in the <em>English </em>courts are against it. But in <em>Kendrick </em>v. <em>Delafield,</em><footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> the present <em>Chief fustice </em>seemed <em>to </em>think it a question still undecided and open, whether barratry, with the concurrence of the owners of the vessel, would exempt the insurer of goods belonging to an innocent shipper. Should the question not be authoritatively settled, it will not be difficult to show that the reason of the rule that the owner of the ship cannot recover for <em>barratry </em>to which he has consented, does not apply to an innocent shipper of goods.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-7\">Though an ownership <em>pro hac vice, </em>is, in many cases, deemed equivalent to an absolute ownership; yet this doctrine ought to be laid down with this limitation, that he is to be considered owner, as far as the persons dealing with him know the nature of the ownership. It ought not to apply to an innocent shipper of goods, who is wholly ignorant of the nature of the ownership, or whether it is absolute or temporary. The plaintiff never heard of the charter party until it was produced at the trial. The owner of a ship ought not to be permitted to hold himself out as owner, and afterwards, by transferring the ship to the master for the voyage, avoid all responsibility as owner, and leave the shipper of goods to look to the master who may never return, or be insolvent. In that way, the owner of the vessel may concert with the master, to defraud the owner of the goods, by letting the vessel to the master, with a view to his committing <em>barratry, </em>or running away with the goods. The owner of the goods cannot recover against the insurer; and if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>he sues the owner of the ship, he will answer that she was let to the master, who was owner <em>pro hac </em>vice, and is the only person responsible.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b282-9\"> 1 <em>Johns.

There was a complete letting of the entire vessel for the voyage. The master was to victual and man her at his own cost. He had the whole management and control, and according to the principle established, or admitted, in the cases of <em>Velleijo </em>v. Wheeler, <em>(Cowp. </em>142.) <em>M'Intyre </em>v. Bowne, (1 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>229.) and <em>James </em>v. Jones, (3 <em>Esp. N. P. </em>27.) the person having such an interest and authority in the ship, is regarded as the temporary owner. There is no doubt that the master\u2019s conduct was fraudulent and amounted to barratry, provided that <em>barratry </em>could be committed in the situation in which he stood. But it appears to be perfectly well settled, that if the master of the ship be at the same time the owner, he cannot commit barratry, because <em>barratry </em>can .only be committed by the master or mariners in relation to the owner of the ship. He may, as owner of the ship, make himself liable, by his fraudulent conduct, to the owner of the goods, but not as for <em>barratry. (Lewin </em>v. Suasso, <em>Marsh. </em>528. note. <em>Nutt </em>v. Bordieu, 1 <em>Term Rep. </em>323.) It has been suggested that the reason of the .rule is, that no man shall be allowed to derive a benefit from his own crime, which he would do were he to recover against the insurer for a loss occasioned' by his own act; and that to make the reason of the rule apply, the i\u00bfaster should have been owner of the goods\u00bb ' The answer' to this is, that a rule of commercial law when once settled, ought not to be disturbed, even though the reason of it may be justly questioned. Uniformity of decision is of more importance in such cases than accuracy of reasoning. That the insurer should be held responsible in any case to the owner, for the fraud <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>of the master, (who is the owner\u2019s agent,) has been - i , , , r , deemed a strange and unreasonable part ox the <em>English. </em>Taw of insurance; (1 <em>Term Rep. </em>330. 1 <em>Emerig. 370. </em>2 <em>Johns. Cas. </em>188.) and when we find such responsibility limited, as in this case, we ought not readily to extend it, merely for the sake of giving more consistency to the rule. As far as the authorities have carried the insurer\u2019s responsibility for barratry, so far we ought to go, but no further.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-13\">The motion, therefore, for a new trial ought to be granted, with costs, to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
