The defendant, Whiting, is charged in execution, for two of the instalments, but not for any costs, and <em>Powers </em>was charged in execution only for the costs of the suit against him. His discharge from these costs does not, and ought not, to affect the execution against <em>Whiting; </em>for the demands were distinct, and <em>Whiting </em>was never answerable for those costs. The rule that a release of one co-obligor from his debt, or a discharge of one co-obligor from execution, should enure-as a release or discharge of all, is founded upon the just principle, that the party should not receive more than one satisfaction for the same debt, but that principle is -inapplicable to this case. The discharge of <em>Powers </em>from his costs was no satisfaction of the debt for which <em>Whiting </em>was imprisoned; the motion is therefore denied-.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
