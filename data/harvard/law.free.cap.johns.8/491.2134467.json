The master of the <em>Ohio </em>then determined to seek another port, and on the 31st of <em>October </em>proceeded to Madeira, which was the nearest port, where he arrived on the 4th of November, and landed and sold th.e cargo. The vessel afterwards proceeded to the <em>isle of </em>May, and sailed from thence for <em>New-York,on </em>the 31st of <em>December, </em>1809.

The master went there to sell his cargo; and for the same reason, he might have gone to <em>Lisbon. </em>It was a voluntary deviation from the voyage zmentioned in the policy. Nothing but necessity, or an apprehension of danger, could excuse his departure from the usual and direct route to <em>Bonavista; </em>and as this part of the voyage xyas abandoned and never commenced, the plaintiff is entitled to a return of the one <em>per cent, </em>premium mentioned in the policy, and no more.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">Judgment accordingly. .</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
