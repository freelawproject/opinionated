(7 Johns. Rep. 99.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">The promise is to be taken to have been an express promise in writing, as the plaintiff in error has not called for any fact from the justice, to. rebut that presumption. This was said, in <em>Beecker v. </em>Beecker, to be the acknowledged rale. The promise was one which <em>Holly </em>ought, in duty, as trustee, to have performed; and it was founded on a valuable consideration. The judgment ought to be afSraied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
