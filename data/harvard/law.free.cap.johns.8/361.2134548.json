Does the recovery against the sheriff tor the e 8 cape~ ~1estroy the right of proceeding on the judgment against Mallory ~ There is no connection between the escape and the judgment; n~r can the judgment ~be affected by the escape. The case is analogous to a proceeding against two joint obligors, where one is taken in execution and escapes~ yet the plaintiff, notwithstanding his remedy against the sheriff~ may proceed to judgment against the other obilgor. (1 Roll. Abr. 196. Cro. Car. 75. Crop. Eliz. 478. 555. Moore, 459.) One judgment does not. exting~sh another judgment.

After the record of the judgnient against the sheriff was produced in evidence by the defendant, to prove the e~wape, he could not give eviden~e of any confessions or admissions of the plaintiff contrary</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-18\">to that fact. 4~ But granting the evidence offered to be admissible~ it could avail nothing; for an attorney ha~ no authority, without the consent o~ the plaintiff, to discharge a debtor frora custody.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> An attorney cannot enter a retraxit, without his client's consent, for it is against the duty of an attorney to re1ea~e or desn~oy the rights of his client.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> He may act for the benefit, but not to the prejudice of his client, without express authority; for he will be presu- nied to have power to do what is for his client's benefit, but not when he~ acts against the</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b371-25\">interest of his cIient~ SMnner</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1v\">and E. Willianw, contra. 1. The defendant does not claim under the sheriff, nor is he party to th~ judgment against him for the escape. He is not, there- fore, estopped by that judgment, from showing that there was a discharge from the Ca. sa. or from contradict- ~g the fact of an escape. If the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>cutio\u00bb, was legally discharged by the attorney, it cannot r . \u25a0; , , be denied that the execution was satisfied at law, though there might have been ho real satisfaction of the debt. Then, had the attorney for the plaintiff authority to discharge the defendant <em>Mallory </em>from that execution ? Since the decision in the case of <em>Noyes </em>v. <em>Denton and others,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>there can be no doubt of his <em>authority; </em>for if an attorney, without warrant, may confess a judgment to bind the defendant, surely an attorney on record, who has been regularly employed by the plaintiff in the suit, has power to release or discharge the defendant on the judgment. The sheriff is bound to obey the directions of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney. The discharge of the debtor, or the recovery for the escape, is equivalent to a satisfaction. For aught that appears, a real satisfaction may have been, made to the attorney, to induce him to discharge the prisoner. It is fair to presume that the attorney was satisfied, before he consented to the discharge. In judgment of law, if not in fact, there was a satisfaction of the judg-' menu The law presumes a satisfaction, if an execution is not returned. The execution issued in 1806, and n\u00a9 return was made until <em>180S.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ays\">Again, the <em>fieri facias </em>was satisfied by the liability of the sheriff, and the recovery against him for the previous escape on the <em>ca. sa. </em>issued on the same judgment, to the full amount. In <em>Rawson </em>v. <em>Turner,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2021</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it was held, that where the plaintiff\" bad elected to proceed against \u2019the sheriff for the escape, he should not hold the defendant in execution. The plaintiff had his election, either to proceed against the sheriff, or to issue a new execution, and having made that election, every other remedy is discharged. If the plaintiff could not take out a new <em>ca, sa. </em>and commit the defendant, after electing to sue the sheriff on the escape; for the same reason, he cannot take out a <em>fieri facias </em>against the property.of the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9lE\">, Again, a sheriff, on his mere liability to an action for an escape, may maintain an action against the defendant.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>For a stronger reason, he may, after a judgment and excution against him, bring his action, lr so, then the oefendant might be doubly liable, first to the sheriff, and also to the original plaintiff. Hence the propriety of the rule laid down in <em>Rawson </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>that the plaintiff shall be concluded by his election.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b373-9\"><em>Foot, </em>in reply,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASli\">said, that a <em>bonaJide </em>and innocent purchaser under a sheriff\u2019s sale, could not be prejudiced by the proceedings between the parties to the judgment. After the production of the record, to prove the escape, parol evidence was inadmissible to show that there was no escape. But admitting that the plaintiff\u2019s attorney did consent to the discharge; yet the 23d section of the-statute (sess. 24-. c. <em>28.) </em>declares, that if a person charged in execution, \u201c shall escape by any means or ways whatsoever,\u201d the plaintiff may retake him on a new <em>ca. sa. </em>or issue a <em>fieri facias. </em>But it is a sufficient answer to say$ that an attorney cannot discharge a defendant, without payment or satisfaction of the debt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b373-11\">The decision in <em>Rawson v. Turner </em>is not applicable tc the present case. The court said that the plaintiff should not sue the sheriff for the escape, and, at the same time, hold the defendant in prison, by a new executionj for the two remedies were incompatible with each other. A remedy against the property of the defendant, is not incompatible with a suit against the sheriff for the escape.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b371-29\"> 1 Roll.

The question on the regularity of the <em>fi.fa. </em>could not be raised in this case. Though the execution may have issued a year and a day after judgment, without revival by <em>set. fa. </em>it was only voidable at the instance of the party against whom it issued. (3 <em>Lev. </em>403. 3 <em>Caines, 271. </em>273.) It was good in point of form, and several reasons might possibly have been assigned, if the question had come up on motion to set it aside, why the execution was duly issued, even after the year and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>a day. It was not for the present defendant to question a purchaser s title under such an execution. It was a good authority for the sale. <em>(Shirley </em>v. Wright, 1 <em>Salk. </em>273.)</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">2. Nor is there any more weight in the objection that the plaintiff had concluded himself, by .electing to sue the sheriff for the escape, and to proceed to judgment against him. The <em>satisfaction </em>that is stated to have been obtained upon that judgment, whatever might have been its force, otherwise, is tp be put out of view in this case, for it appears to have been long after the sale and purchase by the lessor of the plaintiff. His title could not be affected by matter subsequent to the sale, and between, strangers with whom he had no privity. The statute gave the plaintiff in the first execution, a right to sue out any other execution after the escape; <em>(Laws, </em>vol. 1. p. 213.) and his instituting a suit for the escape, did not deprive him of that right, because the suit and judgment against the sheriff was no satisfaction, nor were the two remedies inconsistent with each other. He was at liberty to pursue both the remedies, concurrently, until he had obtained satisfaction upon one. In <em>Rawson </em>v. Turner, (4 Johns. <em>Rep. </em>469.) the election of one remedy was incompatible with the pursuit of the other, as the one remedy was upon the ground that the other had' ceased\". The party was not then concluded in this case, by any election, and the <em>ft.fa. </em>was duly sued-out, notwithstanding the judgment against the sheriff.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">3. The only remaining^ point is, whether- the proof offered by the defendant, that the first execution was satisfied by the discharge of the prisoner-, ought to have been received. -The offer was to show that the attorney for <em>Bedell </em>had permitted <em>Mallory </em>to be discharged from the <em>ca. sa. </em>The defendant was not concluded from this proof, by the circumstance of his having produced the judgment qgainst the sheriff for the escape. As he was a stranger'to that judgment, and without notice of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>a suit, he was not bound by it; but he produced1 the judgment for another purpose, which failed, and he then resorted to parol proof, to meet the like proof which the plaintiff had offered relative to the escape. The great and decisive objection to the evidence offered, is, that it Was of no avail. because the attorney to the plaintiff in the suit had no authority, from his general character, as attorney, to discharge the defendant from execution on <em>ca, sa. </em>until the money was paid. It was a disputed point as early as the case of <em>Payne </em>v. Chute, (1 <em>Roll. Rep. </em>365.) whether an attorney could acknowledge satisfaction without receiving the money. <em>Coke </em>and <em>Doddridge, </em>Justices-differed upon that point; and there is no case in which that authority has been adjudged to belong to him, and it is against the nature and limitation of his trust. An attorney\u2019s authority determines with the judgment, or at least with the issuing of the execution within the year. (2 <em>Inst. 378. </em>2 <em>Bos. &amp; </em>Pull. 357.) The most that the cases say, is, that he may receive the money recovered by <em>ca. sa. </em>and then acknowledge satisfaction. (2 Show. 138. 1 <em>Roll. Rep. </em>365.)</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">The Court are, therefore, of opinion, on all the points, that the plaintiff is entitled to judgment,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
