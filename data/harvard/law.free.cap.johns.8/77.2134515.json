To the declaration on the <em>scire facias, </em>the defendant pleaded, that the plaintiff ought to have execution for 50 dollars, part of the said debt, with the interest on the said sum of 50 dollars, from the 2ist of November, 1807, being the date of the bond and warrant of attorney; but that for the residue of the said debt, the plaintiff ought not to have his execution against the defendant, because the judgment was given by virtue of a certain bond, conditioned for the payment of 250 dollars, and a warrant of attorney accompanying the same; and that the said bond and warrant of attorney were executed by the defendant, pursuant to an agreement made between the plaintiff and defendant, the 27th of November, 1807, by which the plaintiff agreed to give to one <em>A. E., </em>a power to dispose of a certain piece of land in <em>Ireland, </em>and to advance 50 dollars towards his expenses to <em>Ireland; </em>and if the said <em>A. E. </em>should sell the land, the bond and warrant of attorney were to be security for the repayment of the 50 dollars advanced, and 200 dollars for the land on the return of <em>A. E-; </em>but if the land was not sold, the plaintiff was not to exact payment of the bond; that the plaintiff executed the power, and advanced the 50 dollars to <em>A.

It is a settled rule, that the defendant cannot plead any matter to a <em>sci- fa. </em>on a judgment which he might have pleaded to the original action, or which existed prior to the judgment. A judgment entered up upon a warrant of attorney is a judgment by confession, and the cases of <em>Bush, assignee of Jones, </em>v. <em>Gower, (Cases temp. Hardwicke, </em>220.) and of <em>Cooke </em>v. <em>Jones, (Cowp. 727.) </em>were cases of a <em>sci. fa. </em>upon a judgment entered by confession on a warrant of attorney.' The rule is the same whether the judgment was obtained by confession, or default, or upon plea. The remedy in these cases of judgment by confession is by application to the court upon motion, as was done in the case of <em>Jackson v. Mosely, </em>cited by Lord <em>Hardwiche, </em>and in the case from <em>Cowper.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
