Williams, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>a witness, testified that in a conversation between <em>Bradt, Lepper </em>and <em>Parsons, </em>relative to the lot, <em>Bradt </em>said that he would not be at any further cost or expense about the lot; and they finally agreed that <em>Bradt </em>and <em>Parsons </em>should release all their right to Lepper, so that he might ' take what steps he pleased to recover the land, and the conveyances were afterwards executed to Lepper.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-4\"><em>Lepper </em>and Parsons, being previously released by the plaintiff, were admitted as witnesses and testified, that <em>Bradt </em>and <em>Parsons </em>purchased the lot in question of <em>Lepper, </em>but it was agreed, that they were not to pay for it, unless they were successful in recovering it. After much trouble and expense in endeavouring to obtain the lot, before the <em>Onondaga </em>commissioners, <em>Lepper </em>requested <em>Parsons </em>to prosecute a suit at law for \u2022 the lot, and they called on <em>Bradt </em>the 5th <em>February, </em>1807, when <em>Williams, </em>the other witness, was present. <em>Bradt </em>refused to furnish any more money, or to be at any further trouble or expense about the land; and it was agreed, that <em>Parsons </em>and <em>Bradt </em>should release to Lepper, who might proceed to recover the land, in such manner as he chose; and the deed of release was accordingly executed. <em>Parsons </em>afterwards suggested, that in prosecuting a suit for the recovery of the land, it might be necessary to use the names of <em>Parsons </em>and <em>Bradt </em>as lessors, and they consented that <em>Lepper </em>might use their names, if his counsel should think it necessary; but <em>Bradt, </em>at the same time, refused to be at any further expense, or to have any concern with the suits, further than the use of his name. A few days afterwards, <em>Lepper </em>and <em>Parsons </em>went to the defendants, and requested them to bring suits to recover the lot in <em>question; </em>and after being informed by <em>Parsons, </em>that <em>Bradt </em>had consented that his name might be used, the defendants commenced the actions of ejectment, and made use of the name of Bradt? ns one of the lessors. It appeared that <em>Parsons </em>agreed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>with <em>Lepper </em>to carry on the suits, at his own expens\u00e9, in consideration, that in case of a recovery, he should have half of the lot.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-4\">It appeared also, that when <em>Parsons </em>and <em>Bradt </em>executed the release to <em>Lepper, </em>he gave them a writing, engaging to pay them 50 dollars, in case he recovered the <em>land; </em>and which was intended to recompense them, in part, for the expenses they had incurred in attempting to obtain the lot before the commissioners. This agreement which was held by <em>Parsons, </em>was given up to <em>Lep - per, </em>at the time of the agreement between them as to the suits and the division of the lot, in case it was recovered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-5\">. The judge charged the jury, that if they believed the plaintiff had authorized the defendants to make use of his name in the suits of ejectment, they ought to find a verdict for the defendants, and he expressed his opinion that the plaintiff had given such authority j but if they believed that the defendants were not authorized by the plaintiff to use his name, then the jury ought to find for the plaintiff, for the amount of the costs he had been obliged to pay. The jury found a verdict for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-6\">A motion was now made to set aside the verdict and for a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b308-7\"><em>N. </em>Williams, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUL\">The consent or authority given by the plaintiff to <em>Lepper </em>and <em>Parsons, </em>to use his name, was <em>special </em>and <em>limited, </em>that is, to use his name in such manner as not to subject him to the payment of any costs..

The defendants might use the name of the plaintiff; but if they did so, they were bound to protect him against the payment of costs. If made liable to refund to the plaintiff for the costs he has been obliged to pay, they cannot complain. It was their duty to have looked to the authority of the agents, and if they have been guilty of fraud or deception, the defendants ought to suffer, rather than the plaintiff, who is innocent. It never was the intention of the parties, that the plaintiff should be liable for any further costs. The plaintiff never gave the defendants any authority whatever. The relation of client and attorney did not exist between diem. The defendants had the deed of release before them, and must have known that the plaintiff had no interest in the suits.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b309-8\"><em>Gold, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AESq\">This is an action against the defendants, for using the name of the plaintiff without his consent; but it is proved, that he did consent that his name might <em>be </em>used, and that is sufficient to defeat the action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b309-9\">There was, in fact, a power from the plaintiff to <em>Lepper </em>and <em>Parsons </em>to use his name\"; and a contract on their part <em>to </em>indemnify him against any cost or expense. If the plaintiff has been damnified, he must resort to the contract of indemnity. It does not appear but that <em>Lepper </em>and <em>Parsons </em>are competent to indemnify him; and if they are not, he should have taken security. It is enough for the defendants, that the plaintiff consented that his name might be used as lessor. The question of damages or costs, lies altogether between the plaintiff and his agents.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b309-10\">Suppose <em>Lepper </em>and <em>Parsons </em>had been the attorneys, could they have been made liable in this action ?

It was a voluntary and gratuitous license on the part of the plaintiff, who might annex to it what condition he thought proper. It is admitted, that the defendants stand in the place of <em>Lepper </em>and <em>Parsons, </em>and could have no other or greater power than they possessed, If so, then, they could not use the name of the plaintiff, but on the condition annexed to the consent given by him to <em>Lepper </em>and <em>Par-, sons*</em></p>\n<author id=\"AMP\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"ARnc\">The leave given by the plaintiff to use his-name, as one of the lessors, was not only gratuitous, for he had no interest in the suit, but it was specific. It was granted upon the condition that he should not be \u201c at any further expense, or have any thing to do with the suits or lots.\u201d This was evidently the understanding of the parties, at the time that the plaintiff consented that <em>Lepper </em>might use his name. The plaintiff never meant to be liable, in any event, to any costs or expense that might thereafter be created, in relation to the lot, of to any suit concerning it, and so <em>Lepper </em>and <em>Parsons </em>must have, understood him. They were bound, in good faith, and under their circumscribed authority, to have disclosed to the defendants, when they employed them, the special terms upon which they were permitted to use the name of the plaintiff. They did not do it, and the plaintiff has been eventually subjected to great loss and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>damage. The single question is, whether he has his remedy, not only against <em>Lepper </em>and Parsons, who abused, by exceeding their power, but also against the defendants, who so used his name, under the directions of <em>Lepper </em>and <em>Parsons. </em>The defendants took the directions of their employers, at their peril. They used the name of the plaintiff, at the peril of being responsible to him, if they, by that means, subjected him to cost and expense. If <em>Lepper </em>and <em>Parsons </em>could not use his name, but under the condition annexed, no person employed by them could do it. The parties to this suit may be considered as equally innocent of any intentional injury, but the plaintiff has the legal right of action, as the defendants have used his name contrary to his instructions, so as te produce cost and expense to him. If his name could not be used, without putting him to cost and trouble, he meant that it should not be used at all, and so he told the persons who employed the defendants. He had a right to annex that condition to the license, even if it went it defeat it altogether. If <em>Parsons </em>and <em>Lepper </em>are insol vent and unable to satisfy these costs, the defendants ought rather to pay them than the plaintiff, for the defendants have trusted to the naked declarations of their clients, but the plaintiff bound them by a special authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">The verdict ought, therefore, to be set aside, and anew Srial awarded with costs, toabide the event of the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">New trial granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
