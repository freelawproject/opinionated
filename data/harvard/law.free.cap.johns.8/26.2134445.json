The cause was tried at the <em>Greene </em>circuit, the 6th December, 1809, before Mr. Justice <em>Van Ness.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-11\">The <em>venue </em>was laid in <em>Greene </em>county, and the declaration stated that the intestate, in his life-time, came into the supreme court, &amp;c. at New-York, &amp;c. \u201c by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>same of <em>Stephen Forman, </em>of Kortright, in said county, farmer, and became bail,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-5\">At the trial, the plaintiff offered in evidence the original bail-piece and record of the recognisance. The bail-piece was written, \u201c Delaware, ss. <em>Jatnes Daman </em>is delivered to hail, &amp;c. to <em>Stephen Forman, </em>of the town of <em>Kori~ </em>right, in said county, farmerand the acknowledgment was taken before a judge of the court of common pleas of <em>Delaware </em>county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-6\">The recognisance record, after setting forth the declaration in the original suit, in which the <em>venue </em>was laid in Albany, states that <em>Stephen Forman, </em>of the town of Kortright, and county of <em>Delaware, </em>farmer,\u201d &amp;c. came into court and became bail, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-7\">The admission of this evidence was objected to on the ground of a variance ; 1. Because the addition and title by which <em>Stephen Forman </em>became bail, as set forth in the declaration, differed from that stated in the recognisance record $ 2. Because the declaration stated that the recognisance was taken in this court, and the record produced states it to have been taken before a judge of the <em>Delaware </em>court of common pleas. Both the objections were overruled by the judge, and the evidence admitted. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-8\">A motion was made to set aside the verdict for the misdirection of the judge.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b35-9\"><em>Foot, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b35-10\"><em>Rowers </em>and <em>E.

The de- . claration states that the intestate came into the supreme court, by the name of <em>S. Forman, of Kortright, in said county, farmer, </em>and became special bail, &amp;c. The bail-piece produced states that the intestate became bail by the name and description of <em>S. Forman, of the town of Kortright, in said county, farmerand </em>the record of the recognisance of bail states that the intestate <em>S. Forman, of the town of Kortright, and county of Delaware, farmer, </em>became bail, &amp;c. The description in the bail-piece corresponds with that in the declaration, except that in the latter the words \u201c <em>the town ofare </em>omitted. The sense is not varied, and the description was not set out according to the <em>tenor, </em>or <em>in hate verba. </em>In <em>Cumming v. Sibly, </em>cited by <em>Buller, </em>J. in 1 <em>Term Rep. </em>239. the declaration stated the precept to be directed to the <em>mayor only, </em>and it was proved <em>to </em>be directed to the <em>mayor and burgesses </em>; and the court of C. B. held it sufficient, as the substance was preserved. The bail-piece was the warrant for the recognisance roll, and being attached to it, it formed part, of the record, and was evidence of the averment in ihc pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"AVu\">The second objection is without any weight, for in judgment of law, and according to the form of the record, the intestate came into court and entered bail; and if the evidence be wholly confined to the roll itself, the declaration is supported, for the roll does not pretend to. state the precise addition under which the intestate appeared. It designates the place of the intestate, but does not recite that under that exact description he appeared. The record does not contradict the description in the declaration, and that description might be rejected as surplusage. (2 <em>East, </em>4-52.)</p>\n<p id=\"AEO\">The motion on the part of the defendant is, therefore, denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
