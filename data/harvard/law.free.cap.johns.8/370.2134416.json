The instrument or deed offered in evidence by them, cannot be classed among any of the common law conveyances. There are no granting words in the instrument. It is nothing more than a <em>surrender </em>of the possession. <em>Surrender </em>is not a word of common law conveyance.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> It is not a bargain and sale. There must be a valuable consideration to give effect to a bargain and sale, under the statute of uses.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> It may be said, perhaps, that the <em>proviso </em>contains a sufficient consideration. But the proviso constitutes a separate and distinct <em>contract; </em>and if the surrender or conveyance was void, it could not be made good by a subsequent contract. A proviso cannot operate as a' consideration;<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> but, in fact, it contains no consideration to support a conveyance.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Aag\"><em>Van </em>Bur\u00e9n, contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AP5\">The only question is, whether the deed offered by the defendants is sufficient to prevent the plaintiff\u2019s recovery. Courts are disposed to enforce contracts fairly made, so as to prevent, rather than promote litigation. The defendants are not entitled to favour, when they seek to avoid a possession fairly obtained by their own deed, on a mere technical objection.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Alv\">1. There is no established <em>formula </em>of words, which -are essential to the transfer of property, or a valid conveyance. It is enough, if it appears on the face of the deed that it was the intention of the parties to transfer the property. Deeds are to be construed,, as much as possible, according to the intention of the parties,<footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark> without regard to the precise form of words. Thus t^ie Words \u201climit and appoint\u201d have been held sufficient t0 Pass a ^ee* l*1 the case of Jackson, <em>ex dem. Hudson and </em>Chapman, <em>v. Alexander and others,</em><footnotemark><em>\u00b6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>this court held that the words \u201c make over and grant,\u201d were operative to convey land. Yet those are not words of common law conveyance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>3. In the case of <em>Jackson, ex dcm. Hudson and Chapman, </em>v. <em>Alexander and others, </em>the subject of consideration in a deed was fully discussed; and it was there held that the words <em>value received </em>imported a sufficient consideration. A mere nominal consideration is sufficient to give validity to a deed. In <em>Stephens </em>v. Bateman,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> the court of chancery, in <em>England, </em>refused to set aside \u00e1 deed entered into for the sake of settling a controversy, merely because the consideration was insufficient. The Consideration need not be set forth in the <em>deed; </em>it may be averred and proved by parol, at the trial.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-4\">Again, here was a release or discontinuance of all claim, which is an adequate consideration. It was, in fact, a mutual release, which implies a sufficient consideration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-5\">In the construction of a deed, the whole instrument \u25a0is to be taken together. The <em>habendum </em>will serve to explain, enlarge or abridge the premises.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> In <em>Goodtitle </em>v. <em>Bailey,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2021</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Lord <em>Mansfield </em>declared, \u201c that the rules established for the construction of deeds were founded in law, reason, and common sense j that deeds shall operate according to the intention of the parties, if by law they may; and if they cannot operate in one form, they shall operate in that which, by law, will effectuate the intention.\u201d In that case, a release was construed to operate as a grant of the reversion, so as to give effect to the intention of the parties.<footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-6\">Again, if this was a deed of surrender, it required no consideration. It is good between the parties, though it may be void in regard to third persons.<footnotemark>\u00b6</footnotemark> It must operate, then, as a good surrender against the lessor, who is estopped, by the deed, to say it is not a surrender.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b380-7\"><em> 2 Black.

If that be of no force, the lessors of the plaintiff must recover. The deed does not contain, upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>the face of it, any evidence of a consideration, and none wag 0g-ered jn proof. But as it was executed upon the. condition of being accepted \u201c as a-full discharge of the claim on the grantor for lands,\u201d &amp;c. the discharge of the claim may, perhaps, be considered as the consideration. There is, however, an insurmountable difficulty in this view of the question. There was no evidence on the part of the defendants, that the grantees had discharged^ or offered a discharge of such claim. No valid discharge of a valid claim to lands can be made by paroly or by mere implication arising from the fact of the possession of the deed. The deed, therefore, is of no force, as a bar to the plaintiff\u2019s title, even if it should be admitted that the granting words were sufficient to convey a fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
