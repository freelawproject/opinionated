The plaintiff also gave in evidence a receT* endorsed on the bill of sale, dated the 1st <em>May, </em>signed by <em>John Barnard, Samuel Dill, Oliver Greenwood </em>and <em>August E. </em>Baker, by which they acknow- \" <em>J t J </em>ledge to have received from the plaintiff, among other . , , , . . , things, the cows and sheep above mentioned, which had been purchased, by the plaintiff at the sheriff\u2019s sale, which, with the increase, they promised to return and redeliver plaintiff, within one year from the date ; and they promised severally to be answerable each for one fourth of any of the cows, sheep, &amp;c. which might be lost, destroyed, or not redelivered, within the year, with the interest the value thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-33\">It was proved, that in the autumn of 1809, \u00a1the defendant, as <em>deputy sheriff, </em>went to the farm on which <em>Simpson </em>lived, and took the property in question by virtue of an execution delivered to him the 21st <em>September, </em>1809, on another judgment against <em>Simpson, </em>at the suit of another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>person, and sold them, at auction, to one White, for 64 dollars and 90 cents..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-2\">Simpson, who was a witness, testified, that on the day-after the sale of the property on the plaintiff\u2019s execution, he agreed with <em>Barnard, </em>the other person who gave the receipt to the plaintiff, to take back the property into his possession, on the same terms as were expressed in the. receipt, and the property was accordingly delivered to <em>Simpson.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-8\">The judgment in favour of the plaintiff was for a <em>bonk fide </em>debt, and the sale on the execution was <em>public, </em>and without fraud, or any express or implied understanding between the plaintiff and <em>Simpson, </em>that the plaintiff would bid off the property for <em>Simpson\u2019s </em>benefit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-9\">It was objected, that the plaintiff had not such a possession, actual or constructive, as would enable him to-maintain trespass ; but the objection was overruled, and the point reserved. The judge charged the jury to find for the plaintiff, unless they believed there was fraud in the sale to him under the execution; and that the plaintiff was entitled not only to the value of the property, but to a compensation for its detention, up to the ensuing term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-10\">The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-11\">A motion was made to set aside the verdict, and lot a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b441-12\">Lynch, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AVNi\">The plaintiff had not such a property or possession, as would enable him to maini tain trespass. To enable a person to bring trespass, he must, at the time when the act was done xvhich constitutes the trespass, either have the <em>actual </em>possession in him of the thing, or a <em>constructive </em>possession in respect to the right actually vested in him.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> In <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Macauley,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2020</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Lord <em>Kenyon </em>said, that the action of <em>trespass </em>was founded in <em>possessions </em>and that where <em>A. </em>had let a ready furnished house to <em>B. </em>he could not maintain <em>trespass </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>against the <em>sheriff, </em>for taking the furniture under an execution against B.; and in <em>Gordon </em>v. Harper,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> it was held, that the landlord could not, in such a case, maintain <em>trover. </em>By the terms of the receipt, <em>Barnard and others </em>were not bound to redeliver the property, but were responsible only for the value. They were at liberty to consider the delivery to them, as an absolute sale, and they might sell the property if they chose.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AD9\">Again, the property was not delivered by the defendant to the plaintiff. Where the sale of goods is unconditional, unless possession accompanies and follows the sale, it is void against creditors.\u2020 It is true, th<em>is</em>, <em>was a judicial </em>sale, but the principle is equally applicable to all sales ; otherwise, a judgment might be used for the purpose of defeating creditors.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b442-15\">\n<em>Gold, contra.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ah9\"><em>Trespass </em>lies by a person having the general property, where there is. a naked bailment for the gratuitous use of the bailee.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b442-16\">In <em>Kidd </em>v. <em>Rawlinson,</em><footnotemark><em>\u00a7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it was held that where the goods of <em>A. </em>taken in execution were put up to sale by the <em>sheriff', </em>and <em>B. </em>became the purchaser, and took a bill of sale, and permitted <em>A. </em>to continue in possession of the goods, the bill of sale was valid against a creditor or purchaser, who might afterwards get possession of the goods.

The case is within the decision of <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Macaulcy; </em>(4 <em>Term Pep. </em>489.) and that case was no more than a recognition of the settled principle, that a plaintiff cannot bring trespass for taking a chattel, unless he has the actual or constructive possession, at the time. He must have such a right as to be entitled to reduce the goods to actual possession when he pleases. A carrier is only a servant of the owner, and the possession of the servant is the possession of the owner. But here the plaintiff, by accepting of the agreement in writing from <em>Barnard </em>and others, let the chattels in question to them for a year, and it would have been trespass for him to have taken them out of their hands. It was a hiring for a valuable consideration, and not a <em>nude pact; </em>for <em>Barnard </em>and the other lessees were to return the animals with their increase. This promise to deliver the increase of the animals, was a consideration for the use; for, according to the general principle of law, such increase belongs to the person who, by hiring for a time, becomes temporary proprietor of the animal. <em>(Wood v. </em>Ash, <em>Owen, </em>138. See also <em>Pothier, Trait\u00e9 de Droit de </em>Propriet\u00e9, <em>No. </em>153, 154, 155.) The jury have decided that there was no actual fraud or collusion ; and the goods, after the sheriff\u2019s sale, were not left by the plaintiff, as creditor, with the debtor j but they were delivered to third persons, without any previous agreement with <em>Simpson; </em>and whether they should be left in the possession of <em>Simpson </em>depended upon his subsequent agreement with <em>Barnard </em>and others. From the testimony of <em>Simpson, </em>it appears, that this agreement with him was subsequent to the contract between the plaintiffs and <em>Barnard. </em>The case, therefore, does not touch the question, how far a creditor, after purchase at a sheriff\u2019s sale, can safely leave the goods in possession of the defendant. The case of <em>Kidd </em>v. <em>Rawl</em>inson, (2 <em>Bos. &amp; Pull. </em>59.) allows a third person, or stranger, who becomes the purchaser, to grant this indul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>gence, and whether the creditor may not also exercise the same humane indulgence, if it be done in good faith, is a question not now before us. . The verdict must be set aside, and as the point was reserved at\" the trial, upon a motion to the judge, against the right of recovery, p nonsuit must be entered,</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Judgment of nonsuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
