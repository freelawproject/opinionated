A person privileged is discharged on motion only, when arrested in <em>facie curia. </em>He must plead his privilege at a proper time and in a proper manner. If he puts in bail, it is a waiver of privilege. He cited 2 <em>Black.

He is to be proceeded against by bill. In this case the defendant put in bail, and then moved to be discharged, and the court below set aside the whole proceeding as irregular. In some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>cases the party privileged is discharged altogether from. arresti as being deemed irregular. <em>(Sir. </em>985.) In other cases, the party is relieved from the arrest on. filing common bail. This will depend upon the rules and practice of the court. There is nothing in this case that calls for our interference.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-3\">Motion denied.-</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
