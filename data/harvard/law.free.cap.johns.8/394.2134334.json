The lease was for sixty years. He said that as the creek had not been traversed, it was not Icnowii whether the 200 acres would overrun the creek or not; but it Was not to extend farther north than the south bounds bf <em>Stephens\u2019s </em>line, to make up the 200 acres. He was not certain that the lease included the banks of the creek farther than the extent of the 200 acres.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-4\">8. <em>Elijah </em>Phillips, also, testified, that he saw the <em>first </em>lease in the latter end of the year 1793, or the beginning of 1794: it was for 200 acres out of the south-east corner of the lot 98. together With the creek and its banks throughout the lot, for the use of the mills. He said he saw the lease but once, and is not certain whether it was a lease or a contract for a lease; and he did not remember the exact boundaries, but the 200 acres were not to extend farther north than the south side of <em>Stephens\u2019s </em>land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-9\">9. <em>James Geddes </em>testified, that if the 200 acres com tained in the first lease, were so located as to include all the land south of <em>Stephens\u2019s </em>land, excepting <em>Johnson\u2019s </em>and extending westerly, with a north line corresponding with <em>Stephens\u2019s </em>south line, so far as to include the quantity of 200 acres, it would encroach on the defendant\u2019s farm, about 8 chains and a half, or 24 acres, leaving the defendant\u2019s mills, and about 11 chains and a half north.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-10\">10. <em>Garrit Van Slyck </em>testified, that the defendant was in possession some distance south of the line of the 200 acres, located as aforesaid ; and was informed of <em>Wood\u2019s </em>claim to the water of the creek, when he took possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-11\">On the part of the defendants, <em>J.

Whether there was any agreement in writing to surrender, he could not recollect. It appeared that <em>Charles Mulhollen, </em>and those claiming under him, have had the entire and exclusive possession of all the land included in <em>Hamit-? ton\u2019s </em>deed to Mulhollen, of the 26th December, 1793. That neither <em>Aaron, </em>Wood, nor those claiming under him, have ever had possession of the lot, excepting the part which lies between <em>Stephens\u2019s </em>land and <em>yohnso.n\u2019s </em>land, and bounded westerly by the creek. <em>Mulhollen </em>lived on the land- until his death, about five years ago, and made valuable improvements. It appeared that there were above 20 houses and many mills, erected on the premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-6\">A verdict was taken for the plaintiff, subject to the opinion of the court, on a case containing the facts above stated.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b406-7\"><em>Gold, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0C\">1. By the lease of <em>HamiltQn, </em>of the'12th <em>December, </em>1793, a title to the 200 acres of land, \u25a0 and all the waters and banks of the creek, throughout lot No. 98. was vested in <em>Aaron Wood. </em>And it could not be affected by the deed to <em>Mulhollen, </em>of the 26th <em>December, </em>1793, there being then an outstanding and subsisting title in <em>Wood, </em>under the first lease.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-8\">2. There is no evidence that the first lease was surrendered, by any express or <em>\u2022written </em>contract for that purpose. By the 10th section of the statutfe for the prevention of frauds, a surrender of a lease or.interest in land must be in writing. (Sess. 10. c. 44.) On the contrary, the evidence of the giving up and destroying the lease, shows that there was not a surrender in writing. The word <em>surrender, ex m termini, </em>means a surrender in writing. If an express surrender is relied upon by .the defendant, he is bound to show it in writing. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>acceptance of a new lease does not necessarily imply a surrender of the old. In <em>Wilson </em>v. Sewall,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> the court say, that the acceptance of a bad lease, is not an, implied surrender of a good one.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b407-7\">In the case of <em>Roe </em>v. York,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> the subject, as to the surrender of leases, is fully discussed, arid all the authorities are cited. It is there held, that the mere cancelling or . . \u2019 , \u00b0 destroying a lease, is not a surrender of the term; and though a new lease was given, expressly in consideration of the surrender of the old, yet as the lessor had no power to give such a lease, the acceptance of the second lease was not deemed a surrender of the first, though the lessee knew of the defect of power.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b407-12\">In order that the acceptance of a new lease should produce a surrender of a former one, it should be for the same thing, or same premises.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b407-13\">Again, if <em>Hamilton's </em>deed to <em>Mulhollen </em>included the premises, then there was no reversion in Hamilton, on which the surrender could operate. A surrender is the yielding up of an estate for life, or for years, to him who has the immediate estate in reversion or remainder.<footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b407-16\">. Whether the delivering up, or cancelling a lease or deed, could extinguish the estate, appears to have been much discussed in <em>England,</em><footnotemark><em>\u00b6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>but it is now fully settled that it does not; and that, since the statute of frauds, <em>it </em>must be in writing.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b407-22\">#Again, if the premises had not been excepted in the deed to Mulhollen, and there had been a technical surrender of the lease to <em>Wood, Hamilton </em>would not have been <em>estopped, </em>as between him and Mulhollen, to aver the truth, that the title, being then in <em>Wood, </em>could not pass to <em>Mulhollen. </em>Where an estate passes by deed, an <em>estoppel </em>cannot arise on it. If <em>A.y </em>a tenant for the life of <em>B., </em>lease for years, and he purchases the reversion, and <em>B. </em>dies before the expiration of the lease, A. is not estopped, hut may confess and avoid.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b408-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number><em>Estoppels </em>on conveyances with warranty, were introduced to prevent a circuity of action.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The doctrine is, that the grantor shall not allege that. nothing passed by his deed, thereby making it a nullity; but he may allege that so great an estate did not pass. And if the. defect of title is- recited in the conveyance, there is no estoppel.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b408-9\"><em>3. Mulhollen </em>never claimed the waters of the creek, or pretended to dispose of them; and he is estopped by the deed'of <em>November </em>23, <em>1796, </em>to set up any mills, or tq assert any tide to the waters.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b408-10\">4. The deed of the 26th <em>December, 1793, </em>from <em>Hamilton </em>to <em>Mulhollen, </em>being a voluntary deed of gift, with a mere nominal consideration of five shillings, is void under the statute, as to the subsequent lease to Wood, which was given for a valiiable consideration. A voluntary conveyance is void against a subsequent purchaser, for a valuable consideration, though such subsequent purchaser had notice of the voluntary conveyance. Though the universality of this proposition was once questioned, in England, it is now settled, as being a necessary doctrine to guard against fraud.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> The words, \u201c purchasers for money or other good consideration,\u201d in the 3d section of our statute, (sess. 10. c. 44.) and \u201cfor good consideration, and <em>bond fide? </em>used in the 6th section, are the same words as are used in the statute of <em>27 Eliz. </em>c. 4.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOe1\">A consideration, to be valuable, within the statute, must be, in some degree, adequate. Five shillings, and other valuable considerations, have not been held to amount to a valuable consideration, within the <em>27 Eliz.</em><footnotemark><em>\u00a7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAV\">A consideration, which would raise a use to support a bargain and sale, is not sufficient to create a valuable consideration within that statute.<footnotemark>\u00b6</footnotemark> A lease on which rent is reserved, is considered as a revocation of a-voluntary conveyance.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b409-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>5. It may be objected that the lease to <em>Mood </em>not bein<em>g </em>registered or deposited, pursuant to the act.or <em>January, </em>1794, extended to <em>May, </em>1795, is void. But there was <em>notice </em>to <em>Ma'hollen </em>of .the lease, which is equivalent to a <em>registry </em>of it.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b409-10\"><em>Clark </em>and <em>Platt, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARq\">The lessors were bound to show a good title. The destruction of the old lease and its contents, ought to have been fully proved. The execution of the first pretended lease was not proved,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> a<em>nd </em>none or the witnesses speak or its contents with any certainty. The acceptance of a new lease by <em>Wood, </em>shows that he did not rely on the old lease, in order to cover the banks of the creek, and the mill-seats. The surrender, by <em>Aaron Wood, </em>of the original lease, in <em>January, </em>1794, enured to the benefit of <em>Mulhollen, </em>the reversioner. The evidence is sufficient to warrant the conclusion, that this surrender was by deed, or note in writing, according to the statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b409-13\">If it was not in writing, it was a surrender by act and operation of law. Surrenders in law, or surrenders by implication, remain as before the statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b409-14\">Surrenders are favoured in law.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> No particular words are necessary to constitute a surrender; it may be collected from the intention of the parties, appearing on the instrument executed by them.<footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark> It is a species of of the common law conveyance, and operates by <em>merger less </em>estate in the <em>greater.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b409-18\">Delivering up a lease, and taking a new lease in writing, is a valid <em>surrender; </em>the new lease being of equal notoriety with a formal surrender in Writing.<footnotemark>\u00b6</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b409-19\">If a lessee for years takes a lease of the same premises, without delivering up the old lease, it is a surrender by operation of law.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> <em>Fortior et equior est dispositio legis fiiifiYfi hfimi'niQ quam noniims.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b409-22\">A surrender operates without an express or even notice to the reversioner. His assent is implied. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>It is like scaling a bond to a person, in his absence, which makes a valid obligation immediately, Without notice^, and can be annulled only by an express refusal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b410-9\">In <em>Mellow </em>v. May,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> it was held, that if a lessee takes a new lease of the same land, it is a surrender of the first lease, although the second lease be void, from any defect in the making of it; for the acceptance of the new lease is a surrender of the old, which cannot be set up, although nothing was received for it. A contract for a new lease is good evidence to a jury, of a surrender.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b410-10\">\u2022 The cases cited by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, from <em>IMir*row, </em>Sir <em>William Jones, </em>and 6 <em>East, </em>all rest on the ground of <em>fraud: </em>there was- a <em>suppressio vert. </em>They are not applicable to the present case, where there is no pretence of fraud, but a fair disclosure of the previous conveyance to Mulhollen. The second lease is good and operative for all that part of the land, not previously sold to <em>Mulhollen. </em>No injury is done to the lessee, who is not obliged to pay rent, for the part in the possession of <em>Mulhollen,</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b410-11\">Again, here was no possession or rent paid for 16 years; and after so long and quiet possession by another, a surrender or regular re-entry will be presumed.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b410-12\">The cases cited by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel to show that <em>Hamilton </em>was not estopped from, denying the effect of his deed to <em>Mulhollen, </em>have no application to the present case; because the delivering up the old lease, and taking a new one, did not operate as an assignment to <em>Hamilton, </em>but as a surrender to <em>Mulhollen, </em>the <em>reversioner. </em>The <em>term </em>was <em>merged </em>or extinguished, not <em>assigned.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b410-13\">The deed of the 26th <em>December, </em>1793, from <em>Hamilton </em>to <em>Mulhollen, </em>was for a valuable consideration, the returning a deed of gift of other lands, and five shillings. It must be intended, that the deed of gift was duly assigned, when the exchange was made. If not, a court of chancery would compel <em>Mulhollen </em>to execute a conveyance, an the ground of a performance by <em>Hamilton; </em>and this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>court may presume that to be done which ought to have been done, and which the party might be compelled to do.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b411-4\">But admitting it was a mere <em>voluntary </em>conveyance, it cannot be impeached by a subsequent deed for a val\u00faable consideration ; unless the second purchaser is a <em>creditor, </em>who has been defrauded by such voluntary conveyance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b411-5\">Again, the leases to <em>Wood </em>were void, because not registered or deposited according to the act of 1795. (2 <em>Rev. </em>Laws, 262.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b411-7\"><em>Hamilton\u2019s </em>deed of the 23d November, 1796, was produced at the trial, on the part of the plaintiff; and there was no evidence of <em>Mulhollen\u2019s </em>assent to it. If he did assent, as it was for the same premises, it amounted to a confirmation, not a surrender, of the first deed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b411-8\">The claim or right to the <em>mill-stream </em>and its banks, for <em>the use of </em>mills, is a mere incorporeal hereditament,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and cannot be recovered in an action of ejectment. The right was contingent, and for a special purpose, and did not include a right to the soil. By a grant of a stream of water, the soil does not pass.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> If by any natural cause, the stream should be diverted or dried up, the bed of the stream and the banks would belong absolutely to the grantor, as if no such lease had ever been made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b411-9\">The <em>notices </em>given by <em>Butler </em>and <em>Philips </em>can have no effect; for they showed no title in themselves, or under <em>Wood. </em>They are to be regarded as mere <em>strangers </em>to the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b411-10\">If the evidence is fairly weighed, the balance will be found in favour of the supposition that the original lease did not include the stream throughout the whole lot j but only so far as the 200 acres extended.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b411-11\">Again, there is another and conclusive objection to the plaintiff\u2019s claim. <em>Aaron Wood </em>having <em>voluntarily de</em>s<em>trayed </em>the original lease, has thereby destroyed his title.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> He cannot be allowed to <em>give parol </em>evidence of its contents.

He shows no other title than what one or the other of these leases may give him.</p>\n<p id=\"ABqW\">1. As to the lease of 1793. This lease was voluntarily surrendered by <em>Wood to, the agent of </em>Hamilton, the lessor, and destroyed on the 29th of January, 1794, when he accepted of a new lease.. Admitting that this lease was not surrendered, in due form of law, according to the requisition of the statute of frauds, so as to devest <em>Wood </em>of his interest under it, yet the existence and contents <em>of </em>this lease were not proved-with sufficient certainty to justify the plaintiff\u2019s claim. As <em>Wood </em>voluntarily surrendered this deed to be destroyed, he ought not to avail himself of any obscurity or uncertainty? in respect to its contents. Every difficulty and presumption ought to be turned against him. He ought not to recover any <em>1 </em>and under that lease, but-what appears, with absolute precision and certainty, to have been covered by it. And what is the testimony on this point ? The proof of the execution of the lease-is very loose. <em>T. M. Wood </em>says, that he thinks that he subscribed it as a witness; and there is much less proof that his instrument was an actual lease or conveyance of the land. Philips, who saw it once, was not positive whether it was a lease, or only a contract for a lease; and Platt, who received it, when surrendered, is equally uncertain on this point. But the location and extent of the lands conveyed, is shrouded in absolute uncertainty. <em>T. M. Wood </em>says it was for 200 acres, in the south-east corner of the lot, but whether it was to include the whole creek, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>could not say, though that was his impression. The land, he says, had not then been surveyed. <em>L </em>Foster, who saw it in December, 1793, was not certain whether it secured the banks of the creek farther than the extent of the 200 acres; and he said it was not to extend further north than the south bounds of <em>Stephens's </em>land; but that as the creek had not then been traversed, it was not known whether the 200 acres would run over the creek, or not. <em>E. Philips </em>confirms the grant of the same bounds, though he adds that he did not remember the bounds exactly.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">To support a claim to the creek and lands of the defendant, after a lapse of 16 years, upon such proof of the contents of a lease, so long ago voluntarily destroyed, by the consent of the party himself, and when, perhaps, the evidence of a valid surrender in writing existed on the lease, would be to create an extravagant and dangerous precedent. It was incumbent on the plaintiff to have stated its bounds with precision, or to have shown the reduction of those vague bounds to certainty, by an actual location at the time. There would not have been any inducement to the surrender, and for such anxiety as <em>Wood </em>discovered for a new lease in January, 1794, if the- first lease covered the creek in question. The plaintiff ought now to be confined to such location of the 200 acres, in and adjoining the south-east quarter of the lot, as can be made consistently with the defendant\u2019s right; and there is land enough for such a location. It is not improbable that the quantity of acres may have depended on the contents of the land within certain definitive bounds, such, for instance, as south of <em>Stephens's </em>land, and east of the creek; and this supposition is the more plausible, because it appears that <em>Wood </em>never actually exerted any ownership or possession further west.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">The title, then, to the premises, as founded on the first lease, must fall to the ground, and this source of title-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>was properly abandoned upon the argument, by, one of counse| for the plaintiff.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A0Co\">2. The cause depends upon the operation and. extent of the deed to <em>Mulhollen, </em>of the 26th of <em>December, 1793} </em>for if that deed does not cover the premises, the second lease to <em>Wood </em>undoubtedly does. No well founded objection can be made to the validity of this deed, and thfe single inquiry is touching its extent. It conveys the whole lot with the exception of <em>Stephens's </em>200 acres, and \u201c 200 acres to <em>M. Wood, </em>and <em>Rosemark's </em>40 acres, both being taken off the south-east corner of said lot.\u201d This deed clearly conveys the; land in dispute, unless it be contracted by the exception. But <em>Stephens's </em>200 acres in the north-east corner, and the other 240 acres, can all be located, without any violent construction, so as not to touch the creeks, mills, or possessions of the defendant\u00bb In a case in which the location of the 200 acres is so extremely vague, this ought to be done, because the posT sessions taken at the time \u00e1re to be considered as a practical location, by the mutual consent of the parties. It is an old principle of law, that exceptions in a deed, and every uncertainty, are to be taken favourably for the grantee, <em>(Co. Litt. </em>183. a. 9 <em>East, </em>15. 3 <em>Johns. Rep. 387.) </em>NoW it appears that <em>Mulhollen </em>took possession, immediately, under his deed, and that exclusive possession has been had, and valuable improvements made, under that deed, on the lands in question, and that <em>Wood, </em>and'those under him, have never possessed westerly, of the creek, and of <em>Stephens's </em>200 acres. He ought, then, at this day, to be restrained from setting up any new location, not absolutely necessary to give him his quantity of land, and which invades the possession of the defendant. <em>Mulhollen\u2019s </em>deed shows that the title to such possession is out of the lessors of the plaintiff., Judgment ought, therefore, to be rendered for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"Aka\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"AXm\"> The reporter was absent, and did not hear the counsel in. reply.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
