Consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Goodridge </em>and with the analysis in our prior opinion, we now hold that, because the police department did not have knowledge of Dobson\u2019s violations until June 9, 1992, and the charges were brought against Dobson on September 1, 1992, no violation of MCL 38.514; MSA 5.3364 occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b238-14\"> <em>Goodridge v Ypsilanti Twp Bd, </em>451 Mich 446; 547 NW2d 668 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b238-15\"> <em>Command Officers Ass\u2019n of Michigan v Allen Park, </em>210 Mich App 485; 534 NW2d 258 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b239-5\"> Judge Michael J.
