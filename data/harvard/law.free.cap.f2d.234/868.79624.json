On the contrary, we find ourselves in agreement with the commissioner that the findings and conclusion of the tax court fairly and fully state the facts and as fairly and fully canvas and deal with the contentions of petitioners and state and apply to them the applicable law. Without, therefore, further stating our reasons for doing so, we find it sufficient to declare that, upon the considerations advanced and the reasons given in the Tax Court\u2019s opinion, its judgment was right and should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b920-22\">. 24 T.C. 429.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
