The taxpayers are <em>practicing </em>physicians. They kept no books and the government\u2019s case depended largely on the net worth method of establishing deficiencies. The taxpayers do not claim that under the circumstances this was an improper method. They do claim, and their case is very ably presented, that there was an insufficient sum fixed as their net worth at the beginning of the tax period in question. There are no new principles of law involved in the case. The questions turn on various matters of fact some of which were present-, ed by the testimony of the taxpayers themselves. A reading of the whole record leads us to believe that the trial judge was exceedingly generous :in his treatment of them. His conclusion \u201cthat their testimony was unreliable and unworthy of belief in many respects\u201d is abundantly established by a reading of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-24\">The decision of the Tax Court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
