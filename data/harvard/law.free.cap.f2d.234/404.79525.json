The issues were submitted to us upon the briefs filed by the respective parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-16\">On December 17, 1936, petitioner, appearing <em>pro se, </em>entered a plea of guilty in the Criminal Court of Lake County, Indiana, to a charge of kidnapping. The Court sentenced him to life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-17\">On June 22, 1943 petitioner filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana, a petition for a writ of <em>habeas corpus. </em>Petitioner averred that he had been deprived of due process in the State court because, in answer to his inquiry whether he was not entitled to the advice of counsel before entering a plea, the prosecuting attorney advised that such procedure would be useless, and the best thing for petitioner to do was to plead guilty; that petitioner was then a poor person and unable to employ counsel, and so informed the court; that he also informed the court that he was ignorant of the law and did not understand what elements were necessary to constitute the crime charged, and, therefore, did not know whether he was guilty or not guilty, but that the court insisted petitioner enter a plea, and he thereupon did enter a plea of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-18\">Respondent filed a motion to dismiss the petition but the District Court denied same, and ordered that a writ of <em>habeas corpus be </em>issued. Petitioner asserts that while said petition was pending, a governor\u2019s parole was granted to petitioner, and on December 24, 1944, he was released from the Indiana State Prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-19\">On January 22,1945 the District Court entered this order: \u201cIt having been brought to the attention of the Court that the petitioner is no longer in the custody of the respondent, it is Ordered that the writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>heretofore issued be, and it is hereby dismissed and held for naught.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-21\">Petitioner was out of prison for a period of about five years. However, on March 30, 1949 he was convicted in the Criminal Court of Lake County, Indiana, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>of the crime of robbery and was sentenced to a term of ten years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Petitioner asserts that in June of 1949 the Board of Trustees of the Prison ordered the 10-year sentence to be held in abeyance, and that petitioner be held on the commitment for kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">An Indiana statute then in force provided: \u201cAny prisoner who has been sentenced and committed to the Indiana State Prison, Indiana Women\u2019s Prison, or the Indiana Reformatory, and has been released upon parole therefrom and while at large upon such parole said prisoner shall commit another crime and upon conviction thereof shall be sentenced anew to one of the institutions named herein, said prisoner shall be subject to serve the second sentence after the first sentence is served or annulled and the second sentence is to commence from the termination of his or her liability upon the first or former sentence.\u201d Acts 1947, Ch. 61, \u00a7 1, being Burns\u2019 1942 Repl., 1953 Supp., \u00a7 9-2250. The Indiana courts have sustained the validity of this section. Dowd v. Bas-ham, 233 Ind. 207, 116 N.E.2d 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">On August 18, 1949 petitioner filed in the United States District Court a petition to reopen the <em>habeas corpus </em>proceeding and respondent filed a motion to dismiss. Petitioner was represented by counsel. The motion to dismiss was granted on January 28, 1950, Judge Swygert being of the opinion that the petition to reopen was premature, and that only when petitioner had served the minimum amount of time on his second sentence would he be entitled to question the legality of the original sentence and judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">Petitioner filed in this Court what was designated as a writ of certiorari. However, we considered the petition as a notice of appeal. It appearing that the time for appeal had expired prior to the filing of the petition in our Court, we entered an order on September 20, 1950 dismissing same for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">On December 3, 1955 petitioner filed in the United States District Court a second petition to reopen the <em>habeas corpus </em>proceeding. This motion was denied by Judge Parkinson on December 8,1955. Thereafter, petitioner claims to have been advised that his 10-year sentence would be \u201cfully clear\u201d on December 30, 1955.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-10\">On January 12,1956 petitioner filed his third petition to reopen the <em>habeas corpus </em>proceeding. On the same day Judge Parkinson denied the petition and refused to issue a certificate of probable cause. On February 1, 1956 petitioner filed with this Court his petition for a \u201cVerified Petition for an Appeal\u201d, and asked for a certificate of probable cause and for leave to proceed in <em>forma pau-peris. </em>On February 3, 1956 Judge Lind-ley of this Court issued a certificate of probable cause; granted the motion to proceed in <em>forma pauperis, </em>and ordered that a transcript of the record on appeal be prepared and certified to this Court. We further waived the printing of the transcript and of the appellant\u2019s brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-11\">The District Court was clearly correct in refusing to reopen a proceeding for <em>habeas corpus </em>several years after a final order had been entered therein dismissing the cause. Rule 60, Federal-Rules' of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. We are, of course, concerned that peti-&gt; tioner has never had a hearing upon the constitutional question of whether he was deprived of the right to counsel. However, we are powerless to order a hearing on that question in this cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-12\">Petitioner may again petition for a writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>providing he can show that he has exhausted his state remedies. The Supreme Court of Indiana must first be given an opportunity to pass upon questions attempted to be raised in the Federal Courts. Indiana law permits an appeal from a judgment of conviction after the original time for taking an appeal has elapsed. Petitioner may avail himself of the services of the Public Defender of Indiana.' We make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>these suggestions because petitioner is a <em>layman, </em>but without expressing any opinion upon the merits of the questions which petitioner raises.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">The order refusing to reopen the <em>ha-beas corpus </em>proceeding is</p>\n<p id=\"A2Y\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
