The court found that the apartment was a controlled housing accommodation within the meaning of section 202 of the Act, 50 U.S.C.A. Appendix, \u00a7 1892, that the maximum rent was $80 per month and the rent actually charged $100 per month and that the overcharge was willful. The court accordingly entered judgment in favor of the plaintiff for treble damages and a counsel fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">The defendant has appealed and urges that the court erred in holding that the apartment in question was a controlled housing accommodation within the meaning of the Act. She asserts that she comes within the following exception to section 202 granted by the Housing and Rent Act of 1949, 50 U.S.C.A. Appendix, \u00a7 1892(c):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-9\">\u201c(c) The term \u2018controlled housing accommodations\u2019 means housing accommodations in any defense-rental area, except that it does not include\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-10\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-11\">\u201c(3) any housing accommodations * * * which are housing accommodations created by a change <em>from </em>a nonhousing to a housing use on or after February 1, 1947 * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-13\">The defendant points out that she and her husband occupied the apartment as their own residence until October 6, 1949 when she rented it to the plaintiff and she contends that on that date it became a housing accommodation which was created by a change from a nonhousing to a housing use and it thus was excepted from control under the provisions of section 202(c) (3) which we have quoted. It may be conceded that the apartment in question first became a housing accommodation within the meaning of section 202(c)(3) on October 6, 1949. For section 202(b) defines \u201chousing accommodations\u201d as any building, structure or part thereof rented or offered for rent for living or dwelling purposes. But we cannot agree that the defendant\u2019s apartment became a housing accommodation by a change from a nonhousing to a housing use, the method which section 202(c) (3) requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-15\">On the contrary, in the absence of a definition of \u201cnonhousing use\u201d and \u201chousing use\u201d in the Act, and there is none, we must take these phrases to have their ordinary meaning. The legislative history fortifies us in this conclusion. The Senate Committee Report on the Housing and Rent Act of 1949 (Senate Report No. 127, 81st Cong., 1st Sess.) states (p. 13) \u201cParagraph (3) of section 202(c) would be amended to exclude from the definition of controlled housing accommodations any housing accommodations created by a change from a nonhousing to a housing use on or after February 1, 1947. This has been done by regulation under the present law.\u201d The regulation referred to was section 825.1(b) (2) (ii) of the Controlled Housing Rent Regulation (24 C.F.R., 1949 ed. \u00a7 825.1(b) (2) (ii)) which defined a conversion which created additional housing accommodation as \u201c(1) a change in a structure from a nonhousing to a housing use or (2) a structural change in a residential unit or units involving substantial alterations, or remodeling and resulting in the creation of additional housing accommodations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-16\">It is thus obvious that Congress intended that the phrase \u201cchange from a nonhousing to a housing use\u201d should mean, a change in the nature of the occupancy from business, industrial or some other non-dwelling use to use as a dwelling for human habitation. Such a change ordinarily involves a change in the structure itself, as the regulation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>stated. It is, therefore, impossible to hold that a change from the use of an apartment by the owners as their dwelling place to its use by a tenant as his dwelling place is a change from a non-housing to a housing use even though that change may for the first time have made the apartment a \u201chousing accommodation\u201d within the special definition of the Housing and Rent Act. For the use of an apartment as a dwelling by one who owns it is every bit as much a housing use as its use for that purpose by a tenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">We conclude that what section 202(c) (3) of the Housing and Rent Act contemplated was the creation of a new housing unit in a building theretofore devoted to commercial, manufacturing or other non-housing uses. It was to encourage such additions to the supply of needed housing that the exception was granted. No such result was to be gained by merely transferring an existing apartment from owner to tenant occupancy and neither the purpose nor the language of the statute applied to that situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">\u2022 The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
