The action was dismissed by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-16\">Upon careful examination of the record and briefs we conclude that the court was not in error in dismissing the complaint, for the reasons given in Judge Starr\u2019s thoroughly considered opinion, D.C., 133 F.Supp. 502, and in conformity with the principles announced by this court in the cases of Kenney v. Fox, 6 Cir., 232 F.2d 288.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-17\">The judgment of the district court is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
