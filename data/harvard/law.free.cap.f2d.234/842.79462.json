His findings upon which his denial of the motion was thus based were not clearly erroneous and we are content to affirm upon his opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-4\">The question is one of importance in the administration of criminal justice and we have been aided, as was the court below, by the able representation of the accused by the New York Legal Aid Society. We appreciate the careful and complete argument presented by Mr. Manning on behalf of the accused and express the thanks of the court to him and to the Society for this valuable assistance thus so generously rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
