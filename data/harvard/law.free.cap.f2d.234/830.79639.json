Judgment was for the defendant lessor and the plaintiff, lessee under a written lease who sought recovery for claimed overcharges, has brought this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-15\">It is conceded by both parties that the premises and the lease were at the time of the claimed overcharges subject to rent control under the provisions of Rent Regulation I of the Housing Rent Regulation covering the operations of the Office of Rent Stabilization.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Executive Order which brought the housing accommodations here involved under control, established November 1, 1951, as the maximum rent date and January 14, 1952, as the effective date of the control order. The accommodations consisted of a motel located in Alameda County, California. On the maximum rent date it was not rented as it was still under construction. On December 31, 1951, the appellees, as lessors, and the appellant, as lessee, executed a written lease for a term of three years commencing on January 1, 1952. The lease provided that for the first two months thereof, lessee should pay as rent the gross receipts from the operation of the motel less $500. From March 1, 1952 through September 30, 1952, the lessee was required to pay either the gross receipts less $500 or $2000, whichever amount was greater. From October 1, 1952, the rent was to be $3000 per month. During the first month of January, 1952, the gross receipts were less than $500, and so nothing was paid for the month of January. For the month of February, the gross receipts were slightly more than $500 and the rent paid for that month was $175. The lease was surrendered on October 1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>1952, but during the months of March, April and May, 1952, the appellant lessee paid the sum of $2000 as rent for the premises. In each of these months the sum thus paid was substantially more than would have been produced through the application of the formula provided for January and February, namely, gross receipts less $500.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">It is the appellant\u2019s claim that since the motel was not rented on the maximum rent date, the maximum rent under the regulation would be as defined in \u00a7 93 of Rent Regulation I which provided that \u201cFor housing accommodations not rented on the maximum rent date which are rented after the maximum rent date, the maximum rent shall be the first rent for such accommodations after the maximum rent date.\u201d Appellant says that the \u201cfirst rent\u201d within the meaning of this language was the rental provision contained in the lease for the months of January and February, 1952.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">The appellees, however, say that this quoted portion of \u00a7 93 can have no application here for the reason that the rent for January amounted to zero, and that the appellant\u2019s contention would lead to the absurd conclusion that the maximum rent was nothing. Appellees say that the regulation refers to \u201cfirst rent\u201d and not to the \u201cfirst rent paid\u201d. Therefore, they say, the trial court was correct in its conclusion that the maximum rent if any must be fixed pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7 166 or Rent Regulation I which provides that where the maximum rent or any \"other fact necessary to the determination thereof is in dispute or in doubt or not known, the Director of Rent Stabilization, or the Area Rent Director, may make an order fixing the maximum rent.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The appel-lees argue that this was a clear case where the maximum rent was in dispute, in doubt or not known.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-11\">The facts are that the director failed to establish a maximum rent for this establishment under \u00a7 166. As the rent control law terminated without any such fixing of a maximum rent, it is plain that if \u00a7 166 provides the only means for determining maximum rent in this case then there was no ceiling and there can be no recovery here since the trial court was without authority to supply a maximum rent. Appellant, however, contends that the proper interpretation of the words \u201cfirst rent\u201d in \u00a7 93, is in the case of a lease of this character, the first rental formula, i. e., gross receipts less $500.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-12\">The question is whether the actual amount paid in dollars must be the \u201cfirst rent\u201d, or whether the rate or formula <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>provided for this period may measure or define the \u201cfirst rent\". No decision upon this precise point appears to be available. That lack of authority may be due to the very unusual provisions of this lease. But a parallel situation would be presented by the much more common case of a percentage lease. A provision for payment of a percentage of gross receipts also sets up a formula, under which the dollars paid would vary from month to month. And in passing upon the question of what the rent under such a lease was upon a stated maximum rent date, the official interpretation of the regulation has been that this \u201crental provision in the lease\u201d established the maximum rent. In other words, in that comparable situation, the lease\u2019s formula for computing the rent is itself the maximum rent, not a sum in dollars. The interpretation of the regulation referred to appears in the margin.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It deals not only with percentage leases, but with other cases where the monthly rent is more or less dependent on a stated contingency. This official interpretation by the Office of Price Administration was adopted and confirmed successively by the Office of Housing Expediter, (12 F.R. 2986, 2987), and the Office of Rent Stabilization (16 F.R. 1631).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-12\">This court has noted that such administrative interpretations, unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulations, should be accepted by us. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>Skinner v. Johnson, 9 Cir., 224 F.2d 575, 576. And while the interpretation here referred to dealt not with the precise situation now before us, yet its construction of a comparable portion of the regulation as applied to an analogous set of facts, convinces us that to make the regulation consistent, we must consider that here the \u201cfirst rent\u201d, means the January and February formula stated in note 2, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"As0\">Since the appellees demanded and accepted payment of rent in excess of the maximum rent prescribed under the Act for the months of March, April and May, 1952, the appellant was entitled to recover a sum not less than the amount of the excess. Title 50 U.S.C.A. Appendix, \u00a7 1895.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The undisputed evidence discloses that by receiving $2000 for each of these three months, when the gross receipts for those months respectively were $944, $1262.50 and $2462, the overcharges for the same months were $1556, $1237.50 and $38, or an aggregate amount of $2831.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">Appellant asserts that this amount should be trebled. While the statute provides for treble damages, it also provides that the damages shall be the amount of the charge or \u25a0 overt charges \u201cif the defendant proves that the violation was neither willful nor the result of failure to take practicable prer cautions against the occurrence of the violation.\u201d We think that this proof was made and that treble damages are not here warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-9\">In December, 1951, when the lease was being drafted, appellees were advised by their attorneys, and correctly, that the. premises were not subject to. rent control. They were not under control at that time, and appellees did not learn that the controls applied until about the first of June, 1952, when they consulted the Area Rent office. Appellant argues that appellees should have known that the Parks Air Force Base in the vicinity of the motel was being reactivated in February, 1952, and should have made inquiry at that time. We think that appellees sufficiently sustained the burden of proving good faith and reasonable care.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b886-10\">The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded with directions to enter judgment for plaintiff for the sum of $2831.50, together with a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee and costs to be fixed and'determined by the court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b883-11\">.

A written lease of a hotel structure, in effect on the maximum rent date, provides for rent based on a percentage of the gross receipts from the operation of the hotel by the tenant.

This rental provision in the lease, if it was in effect on the maximum rent date, establishes the maximum rent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b885-9\">\u201c2.

This rental provision, in effect on the maximum rent date and covering the rental period which includes the maximum rent date, establishes the maximum rent for tho dwelling unit. L may continue after June 1, 1942, the effective date, to charge $25 for any month in which the rent is not paid on or before the 10th, but if payment is made on or before the 10th of the month, L may charge only $22.50. This would be true whether the particular dwelling unit is occupied on the effective date by the same tenant as on the maximum rent date or by some other tenant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b885-14\">\u201c3. Assume the maximum rent date is April 1, 1941 and the effective date of the Regulation is June 1, 1942.

Originally appellant appears to have presented an alternate theory to the effect that the \u201cfirst rent\u201d was the sum of $175 paid in the month of February. Accordingly he filed a supplemental complaint to the first complaint, (which was filed on August 5, 1952), setting forth the amounts of rent paid during the later months of July, August and September. During the trial, however, appellant appears to have abandoned this alternate theory for the only proof of gross receipts made were for the months of March, April and May, and following that appellant amended his complaint to conform to the evidence received, and in this complaint alleged excess payments only for the months of March, April and May. The record indicates that the gross receipts for the month of August were $2645; that for that month the payment made was $2145. This would be precisely in accord with the formula mentioned. It is assumed that payments for months following May did not exceed what the formula required.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b886-11\">. This lease was subject to control only through the narrow accident of its date. \u00a7 39(c) of Rent Regulation I provides that: \u201cThis regulation does apply to an underlying lease of any entire structure or premises which was entered into after the maximum rent date and prior to the effective date of the regulation while such lease remains in force with no power in the tenant to cancel or otherwise terminate the lease. ...\u201d By Executive Order dated January 12, 1952, 17 F.R. 403, the area in which these premises were located were brought under control, and the order fixed the maximum rent date as November 1, 1951, and the effective date as January 14, 1952. Had this lease been entered into on January 15, 1952, it would not have' been subject to the regulation. This odd situation helps to explain the general confusion relating to the applicability of rent controls which prevailed generally at the time here in question, of which we take judicial notice.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
