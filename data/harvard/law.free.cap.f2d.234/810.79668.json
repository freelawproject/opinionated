The Special Inquiry Officer held that appellant was statutorily ineligible for discretionary relief because of his conviction and confinement in the state penitentiary. Appellant\u2019s appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals was dismissed by the Board on November 19, 1954 and a warrant of deportation was issued on December 3, 1954 on the three grounds above stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">Appellant filed the present habeas corpus proceedings in the District Court, in which he claimed to be a citizen of the United States and that the order of deportation was arbitrary and capricious and therefore illegal. In the hearing in the District Court evidence was heard at length on the issue of citizenship, revolving around the factual question of whether appellant was born in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada or Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. The District Judge held on the conflicting evidence that appellant was born in Canada and was not a citizen of the United States. The finding is supported by the evidence, is not clearly erroneous, and must be accepted on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">The District Judge correctly declined to hear de novo the factual issues relating to the grounds of deportability, particularly the issue whether appellant\u2019s conviction for larceny was or was not within five years after entry into the United States. Kessler v. Strecker, 307 U.S. 22, 34-35, 59 S.Ct. 694, 83 L.Ed. 1082. No contention is here made that appellant did not have a fair administrative hearing. No challenge is made of the findings with respect to grounds 1 and 2. In our opinion, the finding of deportability on the third ground was supported by substantial evidence and there was no error on the part of the District Judge in dismissing the writ. United States ex rel. Tisi v. Tod, 264 U.S. 131, 44 S.Ct. 260, 68 L.Ed. 590; Zakonaite v. Wolf, 226 U.S. 272, 33 S.Ct. 31, 57 L.Ed. 218.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
