In 1946, and for some twenty years prior thereto, petitioner in Miami, Florida was engaged in business as a broker representing largely a northern clientele in the purchase and sale of busi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>ness and investment properties, including hotels and restaurants.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He frequently advanced his own funds in order to secure a particular sale, and would later be reimbursed by his client and also receive his commission on the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">A business associate, Louis Goldman, advised the petitioner of a Philadelphia client who was interested in purchasing Pappy\u2019s Inc., a Miami Beach restaurant, at a price of $150,000.00 for all of the corporate stock. To secure the sale, petitioner advanced $25,000.00 to Julius Kasdin, owner of all of the stock in Pappy\u2019s Inc. A few days later the client advised that he was no longer interested. Kasdin refused to return the $25,000.00 and, rather than forfeit that amount, the petitioner and Goldman consummated the deal with Kasdin, receiving credit for a $15,000.00 commission, and purchasing the stock for $135,000.-00, of which $45,000.00 was in cash, and $90,000.00 on time. Petitioner received two-thirds and Goldman one-third of the corporate stock which they then pledged to Kasdin as security for the unpaid $90,000.00 of the purchase price.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Petitioner did not intend to go into the restaurant business any further than was necessary to find a purchaser and thus to recoup his loss. He made various attempts in 1945 and 1946 to sell the stock, but without success. The corporation continued to lose money and it became necessary for petitioner to make personal advances totalling. $43,922.86, for which he took from the corporation interest-bearing notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">In the summer of 1946, the corporation ceased business and was liquidated, the assets being distributed pro-rata to the two stockholders who assumed the liabilities. The principal asset was a lease<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> on the premises occupied by the restaurant in the Vanderbilt Hotel, Miami, which however, was never carried as an asset on the books of the corporation. Financial statements prepared from the books as of the date of liquidation, which were recognized as factually true, disclose that petitioner had suffered a loss in liquidation as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"AQp\">Excess of liabilities assumed</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-8\">over assets received.....$ 5,633.25</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-9\">Capital Stock............ 91,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-10\">Loans payable to stockholders ............... 43,922.86</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-11\">Total ........... $140,556.11</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-12\">These were book entry losses, which did not take into account the value of the lease nor the cash loss already suffered. At the time of the liquidation on July 15, 1946, petitioner had advanced his two-thirds of the original $45,000.00 paid in cash for the stock and had advanced $43,922.86 from time to time, and he was still liable for his pro-rata share of the purchase notes due to Kasdin. On the books of the corporation, the $43,-922.86 was listed as a loan to the corporation. On his 1946 income tax return, petitioner claimed a deduction of $43,-922.86 as a \u201cLoss resulting from advances to Pappy\u2019s, Inc.\u201d and claimed also a long term capital loss on \u201cStoek-Pappy\u2019s Inc.\u201d in the amount of $30,520.-15. So far as the loss on the stock of Pappy\u2019s Inc. is concerned, there has been no amended return or effective petition for redetermination.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-15\">A few months after the liquidation, petitioner worked out an agreement for the leasing of the restaurant premises. By that agreement the existing lease was cancelled, a new 17-year lease was executed by the lessor, Vanderbilt Hotel Corporation, to The Cummings Corporation, a subsidiary of the Howard Johnson chain of restaurants, with a guaranteed minimum rental of $10,000.00 per year plus a percentage of the gross receipts. The rentals were to be paid to a trustee, who in turn was to make annual payments in the following order: (1) to Julius Kasdin in the amount of $8,-888.88, representing the installment obligation of petitioner and Goldman for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>original stock purchase; (2) to the Vanderbilt Hotel Corporation, as lessor, to the extent of $7,000; and (3) the balance of the payments, if any, to petitioner and Goldman. The trust agreement was to terminate at end of the first eight years of the concurrent lease or at such time as petitioner and Goldman had been paid $71,633.32. Petitioner and Goldman became guarantors for the difference between the guaranteed minimum rental of $10,000.00 and the required payments of $8,888.88 plus interest to Kasdin and $7,000.00 rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">Operations under that lease proved successful, the total rent paid each year from 1947 to 1951, inclusive, amounting to over $22,000.00, out of which was paid the agreed annual payments of $8,888.88 plus interest to Kasdin, the $7,000.00 basic rent, and a total over the period of $12,165.00 to petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">The Tax Court found that, at the time of liquidation of Pappy\u2019s Inc., the lease assigned to petitioners and Goldman had a fair market value of not less than $50,-000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-13\">While we are satisfied on the merits that, as to the $43,922.86, petitioner was not entitled to a deduction for a loss incurred in trade or business or in a transaction entered into for profit under \u00a7 23(e) (1) or (2), footnote 3, supra, we find it unnecessary to discuss such insistences because in his petition for redetermination in the Tax Court petitioner made no such contention but simply claimed a loss from business loans.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That remained petitioner\u2019s consistent position throughout until the Tax Court accurately stated the question in its opinion,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and rendered its decision against petitioner. Then, on motion for review by the full Tax Court, petitioner for the first time urged that he was entitled to a loss deduction under \u00a7 23(e). Exercising its irrevisable discretionary power,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the Tax Court denied his motion for review. These issues not having been timely raised in the Tax Court should not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>ordinarily be considered upon review by this Court.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\"> Under Section 23(k), we think that the Tax Court correctly held that petitioner\u2019s loss was due to the worthlessness of a non-business debt. \u201cThe term \u2018non-business debt\u2019 means a debt * * * other than a debt the loss from the worthlessness of which is incurred in the taxpayer\u2019s trade or business.\u201d \u00a7 23 (k) (4), Internal Revenue Code 1939. \u201cThe character of the debt * * * is to be determined * * * by the relation which the loss resulting from the debt\u2019s becoming worthless bears to the trade or business of the taxpayer. If that relation is a proximate one in the conduct of the trade or business in which the taxpayer is engaged at the time the debt becomes worthless, the debt is not a non-business debt for the purposes of this section.\u201d \u00a7 29.23 (k)-6 of Treasury Regulation III promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Whether a debt is one the loss from the worthlessness of which is incurred in a taxpayer\u2019s trade or business is a question of fact in each particular case.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">Assuming that the $25,000.00 advance by petitioner to secure the sale of Pappy\u2019s Inc. was incurred in his trade or business as a broker, the subsequent purchase of the stock of Pappy\u2019s Inc. clearly constituted an investment. The again subsequent loans to cover the operating deficits of' Pappy\u2019s Inc. were not proximately related to his brokerage business, but were at least two steps removed therefrom.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In many situations more favorable for the taxpayer, the courts have found lacking any proximate relation to the trade or business of the taxpayer.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-14\">The petitioner challenges the Tax Court\u2019s finding that, at the time of liquidation of Pappy\u2019s Inc., the lease had a fair market value of not less than $50,-000.00. He insists that it had no market value because for over a year and a half before liquidation he had made continuous efforts to sell the stock or to find someone to take over the restaurant and had found no prospective purchaser. In such a situation, fair market value may be ascertained by proof of subsequent events demonstrating the intrinsic worth of the lease.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> A qualified expert produced by the Commissioner testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1\">\u201cWell, on July 25, 1946, in my opinion this lease was worth $50,000. That is after considering all of the elements, every approach that you can apply. * * * Based on all of the contributing factors, including leases on Miami Beach in 1946, I say the fair value of the property is $50,000.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-16\">Under such opinion testimony amply supported by the factual evidence, we cannot say that the Tax Court\u2019s valuation of the leasehold is clearly erroneous. See Section 7482(a), Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7482 (a); Rule 52(a), Fed.Rules Civ.Proc., 28 U.S.C.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-17\">The decision of the Tax Court is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b202-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b199-11\">.

The sale was not completed, and Mr. Pokress and his associate were obliged on December 7, 1944, to make the purchase themselves. Due to facts beyond the stockholders\u2019 control, and starting as a temporary measure, the Corporation was forced to negotiate loans for purposes of operations. Expecting repayment with interest, and anticipating locating another customer to purchase the business, the stockholders made cash loans to the Corporation on the basis of interest bearing notes. The loans were made in the pursuance of ordinary business and in some cases, the monies loaned to the Corporation were borrowed from individuals and/or friends of the Petitioners, who in turn loaned same to Corporation. The Corporation was not a new Corporation at the time of Petitioners\u2019 acquisition, and had a considerable operation deficit. These facts would necessitate additional financing in the form of loans whether from a bank or from an individual, and should bo recognized, in the Petitioners\u2019 opinion, as a business loss.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-15\">\u201cPetitioners realized the financial difficulties of the Corporation after acquisition of the capital stock and endeavored to protect the original investment in every way possible.
