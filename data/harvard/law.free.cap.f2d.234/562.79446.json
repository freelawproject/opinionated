So pointing, he insists: that, under the principles of law controlling in Mississippi,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in the absence of fraud on the part of the defendant, which is not, indeed could not be, claimed here, a court of equity may not reform a written agreement on the ground of mistake except upon clear proof that there was a mistake and that it was mutual to both sides of the transaction; and that the judgment was right and must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-10\">These principles are not peculiar to Mississippi. Reformation is a remedy of purely equitable <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> cognizance, the right to which is accorded freely and not grudgingly, provided that, under the principles<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> governing its use, the facts support the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-11\">Upon these principles, as applied to the undisputed facts, it is elementary, we think, that plaintiff may not, as he attempts to do here, upon proof not of a mutual but at best for him of a unilateral mistake, hold fast to the fruits of the settlement agreement which are to his liking, while freeing himself from that portion of the agreement which is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-12\">The judgment was right. It is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b615-19\">. \u201cThe burden, of proof is upon a plaintiff seeking to reform an instrument on account of alleged mistake, and any alleg'ed mistake must have been a mutual mistake and not the result of inattention on the part of the person seeking reformation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2_\">\u201cThe court finds that as a matter of law the plaintiff has failed to sustain the allegations of his bill and that he is not entitled to the relief prayed for, or any relief under said bill.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b616-4\">.

Some of these principles, as they are set down in 45 American Jurisprudence, \u201cReformation of Instruments\u201d are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-8\">\u201cThe purpose of a suit for reformation is not to make a new agreement, but to establish and perpetuate the true existing one, to make the instrument express the true intent of the parties.\u201d Sec. 8, page 587.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-9\">\u201cMutual Mistake. It is elementary that courts of equity have jurisdiction to relieve parties against the consequences of mutual mistake of fact and to grant reformation in case of such a mistake. Indeed, when no question of fraud, bad faith, or inequitable conduct is involved and the right to reform an instrument is based solely on a mistake, it is necessary that the mistake be mutual, and that both parties understood the contract as the complaint or petition alleges it ought to have been, and as in fact it was except for the mistake; * * * \u201d Sec. 55, page 617.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-15\">\u201cA mutual mistake is one which is reciprocal and common to both parties, each alike laboring under the same misconception in respect to the terms of the written instrument.\u201d Sec. 56, page 618.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-16\">\u201cHe who seeks reformation of an instrument must make an equitable showing. If his case is weak in its equities, reformation will be denied. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-17\">\u201c * * * The parties seeking relief must offer to do whatever ought to be done toward the correction of a mistake.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-19\">* * * The court will not interpose in the absence of fraud, unless the party against whom the equity is asserted, as well as the party who asserts it, can be restored substantially to the same situation as before.\u201d Sec. 73, page 628.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-21\">\u201cRelief by reformation of a mortgage which described property other than that intended should be conditioned on restoration to the mortgagors of title to the property erroneously mortgaged.
