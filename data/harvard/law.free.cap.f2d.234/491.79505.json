On the face of the policy was typed in the words: \u201cWarranted Insured vessel engaged in day fishing only, out of Gloucester, Mass.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">The home port of the vessel was Gloucester, Mass. During the period in question the vessel was used in .whiting fishing, a type of fishing which is done in daylight hours. At about 3:00 a. m. on July 3, 1954, the Eleanor set out from a pier at. Gloucester to commence a fishing trip within the limits of the geographical coverage in the policy and, after fishing all morning, the vessel sank from undetermined causes early in the afternoon and was a total loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">Appellant\u2019s defense was that the policy had been forfeited by breach of the aforesaid warranty prior to the sinking of the vessel. This defense was based upon evidence that occasionally after fishing all day the vessel would not put back to Gloucester harbor, but would drop anchor within the shelter of a harbor, such as Provincetown or Rock-port, nearer to the area proposed to be fished the next day. The argument was that there had been a breach of warranty, forfeiting the policy, when the Eleanor stayed overnight at any harbor other than Gloucester. We agree with the district court that there was \u201cmuch convincing evidence\u201d that the warranty, properly interpreted, imposed no such requirement, and that the aforesaid fishing procedure \u201cconformed to the usage attached to the term \u2018day fishing\u2019 in the whiting industry in Gloucester.\u201d Finding that there was no breach of warranty, it is unnecessary to rely on Mass. G.L. (Ter.Ed.) c. 175, \u00a7 186<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a remedial statute which apparently would be applicable here. See Wilburn Boat Co. v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., 1955, 348 U.S. 310, 75 S. Ct. 368, 99 L.Ed. 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-11\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b544-9\">. \u201cNo oral or written misrepresentation or warranty made in the negotiation of a policy of insurance by the insured or in his behalf shall be deemed material or defeat or avoid' the policy or prevent its attaching unless such misrepresentation or warranty is made with actual intent to deceive, or unless the matter misrepresented or \u2022 made a warranty increased the risk \u00f3f loss.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
