U. S., 234 F.2d 835, the court has today affirmed the district court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s motion to vacate and set aside the judgment of conviction and the sentence imposed on him for having in his possession a specified quantity of the narcotic drug heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174, but there is no showing in the pleadings and other papers on file in that case that Ford\u2019s Buick automobile was involved in connection with his possession of said drug; nor is there any showing in his present petition that his automobile was so involved. However, since the hearing on appeal the court has received a telegram from the United States attorney stating in substance that no libel action had been instituted against the appellant\u2019s automobile, but that it was seized and sold at public auction in pursuance of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7325.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-14\">There is no showing in this court of facts indicating that the appellant\u2019s automobile was subject to forfeiture to the United States, Therefore, his present petition for the return of his automobile would seem to present only questions of fact and law for determination by the district court. His petition is accordingly referred to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, Western Division, for consideration and such action as that court deems proper.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
