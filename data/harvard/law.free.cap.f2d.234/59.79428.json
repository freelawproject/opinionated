Since the notice of appeal was not filed until October 3, 1955, it was too late to give us jurisdiction to review the order of January 17, 1955.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-23\">The September 12th order denied a motion for leave to withdraw a plea of guilty to second degree murder which had been entered April 28, 1952, in substitution for a plea of not guilty to first degree murder previously entered. The motion denied was filed under Rule 32 (d), Fed.Rules Crim.Proc., 18 U.S.C.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We are not able to hold on the record before us that the District Court abused its discretion in 1952 in permitting the change of plea, or, under the \u201cmanifest injustice\u201d standard of Rule 32(d), in denying the motion now under review to withdraw the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-24\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b111-9\">. Although the motion also asked that the plea of guilty be set aside and the judgment vacated, we do not consider it as a motion under 62 Stat. 967 (1948), as amended, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (1952).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
