S. Highway No. 71, approximately ten miles south of Bunkie in the Parish of St. Landry, Louisiana. The basic question presented, raised by motions for a directed verdict and alternatively for new trial below, is the sufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-23\">The testimony reveals that, at about 5 P.M. on the afternoon of January 15, 1954, appellant\u2019s driver, Joseph Jones, Jr., was driving its two-ton Chevrolet truck in a northerly direction on U. S. Highway No. 71 when he had a flat tire on his right front wheel which required a stop for inspection on the highway; that, after appraising his difficulty, Jones pulled appellant\u2019s truck, which was heavi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>Iy loaded with oil drilling equipment and had a weight of 28,000 pounds on its axle, partially off the paved portion of the 18 foot wide highway and parked, leaving a portion of the left rear of the truck protruding at disputed distances upon the pavement;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that, in any event, Jones did not entirely clear the paved highway with his heavily loaded vehicle, though he testified that to do so would have been impracticable because of the narrow road shoulder,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>which was then wet and soggy with rain and sloped to a large ditch full of water; that, upon parking and finding himself unable to change the tire without help, Jones set out three reflector-type warnings in the front, back, and on the side of the truck and then left the truck unattended while he went in to Bunkie, Louisiana, for help; that he did not return to the truck for about four hours, and during this time it became dark and the truck was unlighted, and there were no warning signals to reveal its protrusion except for the reflectors, which in the meantime and according to some of appellees\u2019 testimony had become covered with road slush and mud to such an extent as to render them insufficient and inadequate as warnings to approaching motorists of the truck\u2019s presence; that by this time the highway was also wet, muddy and slippery, the night was dark and misty, and an approaching motorist\u2019s vision of the protruding truck was also limited by the dark green color with which it was painted, and further handicapped by the oil, grease and mud with which it was at least partially covered.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">Jones returned to the truck about 8 or 8:30 P.M., along with a service station operator named Hall, and together they hoisted the front and rear of the truck upon two jacks, it being necessary for them to replace the flat, right front tire of the truck with one of the tires from the right, rear tandem wheel. While they were on the right side of the parked truck, attempting to switch the tires, they heard a terrific crash and almost immediately thereafter a 1951 Oldsmobile \u201998 Sedan, driven by the deceased, Edward Yarbrough, struck the rear of their parked truck, turning it over on its right side upon the shoulder of the road, after which the Oldsmobile turned almost completely around and came to a stop upon the highway, facing a direction almost opposite from its original northerly approach. Jones and Hall were alert enough to escape death from being pinned under the capsizing truck by wading through the ditch full of rain water which adjoined the shoulder of the highway, but Edward Yarbrough and a guest passenger named Black, sitting on the front seat of the Oldsmobile, were both killed. Earl Yarbrough, brother of the deceased, was a rear seat passenger, who, though seriously injured, lived and testified at the trial. The Oldsmobile was almost completely demolished, but no appreciable damage was sustained by appellant\u2019s truck from having been sideswiped by the Oldsmobile and tipped over.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-9\">The sole survivor and only eyewitness to this accident, Earl Yarbrough, conceded several times on cross-examination that his brother was driving at \u201can excessive rate of speed\u201d, though, when pressed, his specific estimate of \u201cexcessive\u201d was \u201cbetween 30 and 35 miles an hour, somewhere around that speed.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He further testified that they were driv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>ing along the right-hand lane of the highway immediately before the accident, when they noticed the headlights of an oncoming vehicle, maybe a quarter or a half a mile away, that the oncoming driver \u201cdimmed his lights and in turn my brother dimmed his\u201d, about which time \u201cthe first thing we saw there popped up in the road was this big truck \u25a0completely blocking our lane and Ed hit his brakes and the car swerved and that\u2019s all I remember.\u201d The testimony and inferences from the physical proof further establish that this oncoming vehicle was another truck proceeding south, that Edward Yarbrough swerved to the left and sideswiped this vehicle in an emergency effort to avoid colliding with appellant\u2019s parked truck, which maneuver apparently caused the Oldsmobile to bounce away and spin around so as to strike appellant\u2019s parked truck with its left front, capsizing the truck into the ditch.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-4\">In overruling appellant\u2019s pending motions for directed verdict and alternatively for a new trial, upon which it had reserved ruling until after submission and a jury verdict had been returned for appellees, the district court, in its officially unreported opinion, carefully summarized many of the evidentiary factors showing actionable negligence by appellant\u2019s driver, and the lack of any compelling inference of contributory negligence barring recovery under Louisiana law. Specifically, the court recounted that version of the testimony presumably accepted by the jury, showing negligence by appellant\u2019s driver in leaving the highway partially blocked to oncoming traffic, in failing to have his truck lights burning at the time of the accident,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and in using, instead of burning flares, the reflector-type warnings which the testimony showed were not readily visible because of the mud and slush thrown upon them by passing traffic. The court further rejected any conclusive inference of contributory negligence barring recovery from Earl Yarbrough\u2019s pure conclusion, contrary to his specific estimate, as to the Oldsmobile\u2019s \u201cexcessive\u201d speed, and from the other inferential proof of speed from distance traveled per hour since inception of the journey, as well as from the evidence of the extensive damage to the Oldsmobile and the force of the impact necessary to overturn appellant\u2019s truck.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Finally, the court determined that the proof did not show contributory negligence from Edward Yarbrough\u2019s failure to maintain a proper lookout, since the night was dark and misty, the truck was also dark and barely visible, and other \u201cunusual circumstances\u201d justified the jury\u2019s inference that the deceased had reacted normally in an emergency situation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b943-9\">In spite of the district court\u2019s obviously careful and painstaking analysis of the testimony and reasonable inferences therefrom, appellant insists that this was no \u201cexceptional circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>case\u201d justifying jury submission under Louisiana law, because Earl Yarbrough\u2019s own testimony conclusively establishes that the deceased was driving at an \u201cexcessive speed\u201d, which, under the circumstances prevailing, manifestly prevented his compliance with the Louisiana rule that a motorist must maintain a proper lookout and drive at such speed as to be able to stop within the range of his headlight vision. See e. g., Ledoux v. Beyt, La.App., 35 So.2d 472. Appellant further invokes Louisiana authority to the effect that, absent clear proof of exceptional circumstances or an emergency situation rendering an effective lookout and timely avoiding action impossible, there can be no recovery in such rear-end collision cases; especially where, as here, the proof is allegedly conclusive that the deceased Yarbrough did not maintain a proper lookout or reduce his speed, and was not. so blinded prior to the collision by any approaching headlights or the dimming operation as to justify his failure to avoid the collision \u2014 on which theory appellant vigorously insists that appellees were not entitled to any jury submission because of Edward Yarbrough\u2019s contributory negligence, in accordance with the Louisiana general rule heretofore applied by this Court. See Smith v. Fidelity Mutual Insurance Co., 5 Cir., 206 F.2d 549.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">Appellees rely mainly for affirmance upon their version of the proof accepted by the jury and summarized by the district court, viz.: negligence of the driver, Jones, in parking the truck without burning lights so as partially to obstruct the highway, and his failure to protect oncoming traffic by maintaining the reflectors in a visible condition^ As refuting appellant\u2019s charge of contributory negligence, they point to Earl Yar-brough\u2019s specific estimate that the deceased was driving well within the legal speed limit at the time of the accident, and the other testimony heretofore noted to the effect that, because of the necessity of the deceased dimming his lights and other exceptional circumstances limiting his visibility, he was guilty of no contributing fault requiring appellees\u2019 forfeiture of their right of recovery under Louisiana law.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-6\">In Atkins v. Halliburton Oil Well Cementing Co., 5 Cir., 196 F.2d 876, 878, the late Judge Russell, speaking for this Court in reversing a judgment granting a motion for judgment n. o. v. for plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence in a Louisiana rear-end collision case, very appropriately stated the qualification of the Louisiana general rule upon which appellant relies as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-7\">\u201cWhile it is true that under the Louisiana law the general rule is that drivers of automobiles must keep their vehicles under such control as to be able to bring them to a complete stop within range of their vision, and, at night, within the distance which their headlights project, and that a failure to do so is negligence, it is recognized that this is no hard and fast rule which will govern every case in which a motorist collides with a stationary object in the highway, but that each case must be determined upon the basis of its facts. Exceptions to the general rule have been frequently recognized and enforced both by the Courts of Louisiana and this Court. Under the peculiar facts of this case, to some of which we have adverted, we think that the general rule that a driver is charged with seeing what is within the range of his visibility and must so operate the car as to avoid an obstacle that is seen should-not be applied, and we conclude that the Court erred in granting the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b944-8\">In affirming a judgment entered upon a jury verdict for the plaintiff under somewhat analogous facts, this Court had previously stated that same Louisiana general rule and its qualification here applicable, as follows: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>other car or by dust, smoke, etc., that it is his duty to reduce the speed of his car to where he can bring it to a stop immediately if faced with an emergency and it is his duty to bring his car to a complete stop if necessary.\u2019 Harper v. Holmes, La.App., 189 So. 463, 465. The driver of an automobile on the public highways at night \u2018must keep his car under such control as to be able to bring it to a complete stop within the distance which his headlights project in front of him.\u2019 Goodwin v. Theroit, La.App., 165 So. 342, 344. The Louisiana courts have made it clear in many cases that the general rule is not a hard and fast one which will operate to preclude recovery in every case in which a motorist fails to stop and collides with an object on the highway. In each case the particular facts and circumstances must be considered and, \u2018in the final analysis, the facts of each case will determine the question of negligence.\u2019 Herring v. Holicer Gas Co., La.App., 22 So.2d 868, 871, and cases cited.\u201d New Amsterdam Casualty Co. v. Ledoux, 5 Cir., 159 F.2d 905, 907.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>\u201cReliance is placed upon the general rule prevailing in Louisiana that \u2018when the driver of an automobile is blinded by the lights of an-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b945-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>As this Court specifically noted in Car &amp; General Insurance Corp. v. Cheshire, 159 F.2d 985, 987, 988, this exception to the Louisiana rule is particularly applicable where, as here, there is some proof that the insufficiently lighted vehicle left negligently protruding into the right-of-way was deceptive in appearance to approaching motorists because of its color, condition and structure.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b945-8\">In the instant case, the testimony referable to the issues of negligence and contributory negligence was sharp\u2019y disputed in many material particulars, especially as to the distance which appellant\u2019s parked truck encroached upon the highway, whether or not Jones set out proper flares, whether he maintained the reflectors properly, whether they were placed a sufficient distance away to give timely warning, whether the truck lights were burning at the time of collision; and whether the deceased was maintaining a proper lookout, driving at a reasonable rate of speed, and reacted as a reasonably prudent driver would have under all the proven circumstances \u2014 all of which conflicting testimony presented the usual factual dispute appropriate for jury resolution. Great American Indemnity Co. v. Cormier, 5 Cir., 187 F.2d 107, 109.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-9\"> From our review of the testimony and the Louisiana authorities, and acknowledging our duty under the Federal rule to indulge all reasonable facts and inferences proved in support of the verdict,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> we therefore conclude that the district court correctly ruled the exceptional circumstances proven justified the submission and verdict, and did not require direction of a verdict for contributory negligence by the deceased as a matter of law. Hicks v. Tilquit, La.App., 82 So.2d 100; New Amsterdam Casualty Co. v. Ledoux, supra; cf. Smith v. Fidelity Mutual Ins. Co., 5 Cir., 206 F.2d 549.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-10\">The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b945-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b942-5\">. Appellees\u2019 witnesses testified that the left rear of the truck projected upon the pavement about <em>4 </em>feet, but appellant\u2019s witnesses stated that only the left rear wheels of the truck extended upon the pavement for a distance of about 1 foot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b942-6\">. The dirt shoulder of the road was approximately 9 feet wide, and the truck about 7 to 8 feet wide.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b942-7\">. 'When the court intervened to inquire of this witness whether he understood tliat \u201cexcessive\u201d meant \u201ctoo much\u201d, the witness further qualified his estimate in these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A89q\">\u201cUnder the circumstances, Your Honor, that truck was in the road and it was blocked and he was driving too fast. Had it not been blocked, then he wasn\u2019t driving at an excessive rate of speed. That is the way. I understand \u2018excessive.\u2019 * * * The road was blocked. It was a trap and if an accident did happen, ho was driving too fast.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b943-5\">. The driver, Jones, and another witness did testify that the front and rear truck lights were burning, but a number of motorists who passed before the collision testified to the contrary, thus presenting a factual conflict to be resolved by the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b943-6\">. In this connection, the court reasonably concluded that a permissible jury inference existed that the approximate 50 miles per hour average speed maintained by the Oldsmobile could have been accomplished by high speeds earlier in the journey, and did not establish conclusively that its speed was excessive at the time of the accident; and, further, that much of the Oldsmobile\u2019s damage resulted from its \u201csideswiping\u201d the southbound truck, rather than from striking appellant\u2019s parked truck, and that the truck\u2019s capsizing from the force of the impact did not necessarily indicate \u201cexcessive\u201d speed, since it was then resting only upon jacks and the soft mud shoulder of the road.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b943-11\">. Here, the court referred to the testimony of other motorists who passed the point of collision before the Yarbrough car, and their stated inability to see the reflector warnings or the truck. The court further noted that the necessity of dimming the Oldsmobile lights for the southbound truck threw them downward and underneath appellant\u2019s parked truck, justifying a reasonable jury inference that the truck was invisible until collision was imminent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b945-7\">. The Cheshire case, supra, also involved a Louisiana nighttime rear-end collision, in which the same dark green color and structure of the heavily loaded and insufficiently lighted tank-trailer left negligently blocking the highway was also apparently not readily visible to the three boys killed. Here, we think the jury was warranted in an inference that the protrusion of appellant\u2019s parked truck was imperceptible to the deceased Yarbrough, both because of its dark green color and condition, causing it to blend in with the night, and because its tandem-drive structure, 4 feet high from the ground, was not readily visible to the deceased with his headlights in the \u201cdimmed\u201d or deflected position.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b945-13\">.
