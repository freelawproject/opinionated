One of the points in the case was the legality of a strike by employees who sought recognition of a Union which had not filed the required affidavits. This point disappears in view of the Supreme Court decision in United Mine Workers of America v. Arkansas Oak Flooring Co., 1956, 351 U.S. 62, 76 S.Ct. 559.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-26\">During the course of the strike the company sent out a letter to its employees stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-27\">\u201c* * * we will welcome you back to your job providing you return by 6:50 A.M. on Thursday, September 17 th. After That Date You Will No Longer Be Considered An Employee. [Capitals in original.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-30\">This was followed up three days later by a notification to all who were still on strike that \u201cwe are sending you as an enclosure the customary termination notice. Your name has been removed from the payroll * * *.\u201d The sig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>nificance of such a letter has already been settled in this Court. National Labor Relations Board v. Beaver Meadow Creamery, Inc., 3 Cir., 1954, 215 F.2d 247. See also National Labor Relations Board v. United States Cold Storage Corp., 5 Cir., 1953, 203 F.2d 924, cer-tiorari denied Oct. 12, 1953, 346 U.S. 818, 74 S.Ct. 30, 98 L.Ed. 344.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">While the trial examiner recommended a back pay order from the time of the notification just quoted, the Board made back pay orders effective as of the date when the strike ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">There are no new legal points involved in the case. The Board was correct in its law and sustained in its facts by the record. The petition for enforcement will be granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
