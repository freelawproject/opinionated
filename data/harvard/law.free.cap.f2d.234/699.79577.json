It attacks, as without basis in the record, the findings and conclusions of the Tax Court: that taxpayers\u2019 evidence fails to overcome the presumption of correctness attached to the commissioner\u2019s determination, that the eor-poration was a fiction and puppet for tax purposes and that the so-called sale to a member of the family to establish market value was a pretense and a sham.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">We cannot agree. We are, on the contrary, of the clear opinion that, for the reasons stated in the opinion of the Tax Court, the decision was right and should be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b752-23\">. 24 T.C. 744.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
