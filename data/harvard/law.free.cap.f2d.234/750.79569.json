Steffan, deceased. The first of these patents is No. 2,538,925 issued to Joseph J. Steffan January 23, 1951, upon an application filed February 13, 1948. The second patent is No. 2,661,084 issued to plaintiffs December 1, 1953, after the death of Joseph J. Steffan, upon an application filed by him on August 8, 1949.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-23\">The defendants in their answer admitted the issuance of the patents in suit, but denied infringement and asserted that the patents were invalid for want of invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-24\">The parties stipulated that the plaintiffs\u2019 claim of infringement was based upon Claim 2 <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the first patent (No. 2,538,925) and upon Claim 4 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>ond patent (No. 2,661,084). They also stipulated that defendant Kewanee Manufacturing Company was, at the time this action was commenced, making and selling the metal door frames upon which the claims of infringement were based, and that defendants Len A. Maune Company and Priesmeyer were selling such frames. Jurisdiction was based on 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 281 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1338.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">The issues were tried to the District Court. That court determined that Claim 2 of the first patent in suit was not infringed, because slots for the insertion and concealment of the door hinges were made an element of the patented combination and the defendants\u2019 accused door frames did not have slots but had recesses which did not conceal the hinges of the door. The court also determined that Claim 4 of the second patent in suit was invalid for want of invention. A judgment of dismissal was therefore entered from which the plaintiffs have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">The plaintiffs assert that, in finding that Claim 2 of the first patent in suit was not infringed, the court improperly applied the doctrine of file wrapper estoppel and also the doctrine of equivalents, and that the finding was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">An examination of the File Wrapper and Contents relating to the first patent in suit clearly shows that Steffan had entered a very old and highly developed art. His application was filed in February, 1948. All of his three claims were rejected by the Examiner on August 13, 1948, as unpatentable over the prior art. The claims were amended February 12, 1949, and on August 20, 1949, a fourth claim was added. On December 23,1949, all four claims were rejected as unpatentable. On June 19, 1950, further amendments to the claims were made, accompanied by \u201cRemarks.\u201d Among the remarks, we quote the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b804-9\">\u201cBroad Idea Not Anticipated</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-13\">\u201cWhile the claims are limited to specific arrangements of details, none of the references actually discloses the outstanding values of applicant\u2019s fundamental concept, involving the broad idea of deliberately combining a <em>strong inner </em>jamb section with a <em>weak outer </em>jamb section, and attaching concealed hinge members directly to outer faces [of] , the <em>strong </em>inner jamb section, so that the heavy overhanging weight of the door will be supported entirely by the <em>strong </em>inner jamb section.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b804-14\">On September 20, 1950, the Examiner allowed Claims 2 and 3 of the application, and rejected Claims 1 and 4. In response to this action, Steffan can-celled Claim 1 and amended Claim 4. On October 12, 1950, the Examiner gave \u201cNotice of Allowance\u201d of three claims which became Claims 1, 2 and 3 of the first patent in suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-15\">The File Wrapper demonstrates that Steffan had great difficulty in securing the allowance of any claims. Throughout the pendency of his application in the Patent Office, he laid stress upon the means he had provided for attaching a door to the \u201cfirm inner jamb section\u201d (the vertical stud adjacent to the side section of his metal frame). He also laid stress upon the provision for slots in the side section of his metal frame for the inserting and concealing of the door hinges. Rather obviously, what he taught was that a light metal frame could be used as a door casing if the door was hinged to the firm inner frame side member or stud, and that hinges could be inserted through slots in the outer metal frame side member and screwed to the firm inner frame through holes provided for that purpose in the outer metal side member.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-16\">Whether the doctrine of file wrapper estoppel was technically applicable to Claim 2 or not, the statements in the File Wrapper and in the patent as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>the novelty and utility of the slots for bringing about the concealment of the door hinges and the fastening of them to the firm inner jamb side member place the plaintiffs in no position to contend that the provision for slots was a nonessential element in the patented combination, or that the hinge-receiving recess of the defendants\u2019 metal door frame which does not conceal the door hinges and is merely an obvious means of enabling the door to be hung upon the firm inner door frame side member is the equivalent of the hinge-receiving slot of Steffan.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\">In view of the crowded state of the prior art as it is disclosed in the record and the File Wrapper, the range of equivalents, if any, available to Steffan would, in our opinion, be so narrow as to be virtually nonexistent. See and compare, Moon-Hopkins Billing Mach. Co. v. Dalton Adding Mach. Co., 8 Cir., 236 F. 936, 938; Shakespeare Co. v. Perrine Manufacturing Co., 8 Cir., 91 F.2d 199, 203, and General Bronze Corporation v. Cupples Products Corporation, 8 Cir., 189 F.2d 154, 159.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">With respect to Claim 4 of the second patent in suit, that claim covers \u201cAn adjustable [door] casing, having simulated miter joints.\u201d Obviously, a metal door casing or door frame, in order to fit door openings and doors of varying sizes, would have to be adjustable. Either an inner door frame must be constructed to fit the outer door frame or casing or the casing must be adjustable so that it can be fitted to the door opening and the door. Adjustability of door frames was old in the art long prior to Steffan, and, in our opinion, involved mechanical skill rather than patentable invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">Steffan\u2019s method for providing simulated miter joints where the metal header met the metal side members of the frame was merely an old mechanical expedient well known to those skilled in the art, as the defendants\u2019 evidence clearly demonstrated.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">We are satisfied that there was nothing disclosed in Claim 4 of the second patent in suit which rose to the dignity of invention or above the level of the mechanical skill of those familiar with the prior art.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-10\">The findings and conclusions of the District Court which are challenged by the plaintiffs were not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-11\">The judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b803-11\">. \u201c2.
