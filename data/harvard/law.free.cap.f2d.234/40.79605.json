The defendants moved to dismiss on the ground that the suit was not brought in the name of the \u201cpersonal representative\u201d of the deceased, as required by \u00a7 16-1202, D.C.Code 1951. The motion was granted. The court also denied an application of the plaintiffs for additional time to qualify. The purport of this application apparently was that the court withhold actual dismissal of the complaint until a personal representative could be appointed and could seek to be substituted as plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Appellants, the surviving children, contend in the first place that as next of kin they are personal representatives within the meaning of the statute. This contention is contrary to the decision of this court in Harris v. Embrey, 70 App.D.C. 232, 105 F.2d 111. It is there held that a wrongful death action must fail if not brought by the \u201cpersonal representative,\u201d and that the deceased\u2019s mother, who was his next of kin but had not been appointed personal representative by the court, could not maintain the action. See, also, Thomas v. Doyle, 88 U.S.App.D.C. 95, 97-98, 187 F.2d 207, 209-210. Rule 17(a), Fed.Rules Civ. Proc. 28 U.S.C.A., is not to be construed as modifying or repealing specification in our statute of the party authorized to bring an action for wrongful death.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">As to the application for additional time, we find no basis in the present record for holding that the District Court abused its discretion in denying it.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b93-9\">On Petition for Rehearing</p>\n<p id=\"b93-10\">On petition for rehearing appellants for the first time ask this court to consider the complaint as not limited to one for wrongful death but as including a cause of action for \u201cnegligence, damages and malpractice.\u201d See, generally, Wills, \u201cWrongful Death and Personal Injuries \u2014 Joinder of Causes of Action and Counterclaim,\u201d 16 Ohio St.L.J. 501. Our judgment will be modified so as to affirm only the dismissal of the complaint insofar as it sets forth a claim for death by wrongful act under \u00a7 16-1201, D.C. Code 1951. The case will be remanded to the District Court for such further proceedings as may be found by that Court to be consistent with our judgment as thus modified. The petition for rehearing will be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-13\">It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
