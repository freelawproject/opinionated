He never has been and is not now a citizen of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-4\">On February 12, 1951, in the District Court for the Western District of Washington, appellant was convicted on a guilty plea of the crime of selling and giving away narcotic drugs in violation of 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2554(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A penitentiary sentence was suspended and appellant was placed on probation for three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">On February 27, 1951, the Immigration and Naturalization Service instituted proceedings at Seattle for deportation of appellant under the act referred to on the ground that after the effective date of the act appellant had been convicted of violation of 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2554(a), a \u201claw regulating traffic in narcotics.\u201d On October 26, 1951, appellant was ordered deported and subsequent appeal from such order was dismissed by the Board of Immigration Appeals. Thereafter an appeal to this court from the deportation order was dismissed for lack of prosecution. Appellant\u2019s petition for writ of habeas corpus, show cause, and declaratory judgment filed May 25, 1955, after hearing was denied by order of the district court and this appeal is from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">Appellant specifies error by the district court: (1) in finding that appellant now is an alien; (2) in determining that appellant, who came to the United States in the first instance as a national and did not \u201center\u201d as an alien, lawfully can be deported; and (3) in holding that a national of the United States can be divested of such status without a voluntary act of denationalization by such individual and solely from the fact that complete independence from the United States has been granted to persons residing in the territory in which the national was born.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-10\">In Cabebe v. Acheson, 1950, 183 F.2d 795, 802, this court held that \u201cthe United States government intended the status of Filipinos, regardless of domicile or place of residence at the date of Philippine independence, to be entirely separate from any phase of adherence to the United States. * * * We hold that Cabebe is * * * an alien.\u201d Under varying circumstances the same principle was reaffirmed in Mangaoang v. Boyd, 9 Cir., 1953, 205 F.2d 553 and again in Gonzales v. Barber, 9 Cir., 1953, 207 F.2d 398, affirmed on other grounds in 347 U.S. 637, 74 S.Ct. 822, 98 L.Ed. 1009.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In these decisions, to which we now adhere, this court has declined to follow the contentions of appellant in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-11\">The particular statute supporting the order here in question by its terms is applicable to \u201cany alien.\u201d It does not directly or impliedly make \u201centry\u201d a prerequisite to deportation as do the statutes involved in the Mangaoang and Gonzales cases. The rationale of the cited cases is contrary to petitioner\u2019s contention that the power to deport is based on the power to exclude and can only be applied to those who at the time of entry might lawfully have been excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-12\">The order of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b956-13\">. The Act of February 18, 1931, chapter 224, 46 Stat. 1171, as amended by Section 21, Chapter 439, Title II, Act of . June 28, 1940, 54 Stat. 673, former 8 U. . S.C. 156a* provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aki-dedup-1\">\u201cAny alien (except an addict who is not a dealer in, or peddler of, any of the narcotic drugs mentioned in this act) who, after the enactment, of this act, shall be convicted for violation of or conspiracy to violate any statute of the United States * * * taxing, prohibiting, or regulating the manufacture, production, compounding, transportation, sale, exchange, dispensing, giving away, importation, or exportation of opium, coca leaves, heroin, marihuana, * * * shall be taken into custody and deported * * \u2018</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b957-7\">. \u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person to sell, barter, exchange, or give away any of the drugs mentioned in section 2550 (a) except in pursuance of a written order of the person to whom such article is sold, bartered, exchanged, or given, on a form to be issued in blank for that purpose by the Secretary.\u201d 53 Stat. 272; 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2551(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b957-13\">. Gonzales, like Rabang, entered continental United States as a national and not as an alien. He was held to be an alien by reason of the Philippine Independence Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 456, but not subject to deportation under Section 19 of the Immigration Act of 1917 under which entry as an alien is a prerequisite to deportation. In affirming the judgment the Supreme Court did not discuss the question now presented.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\" orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"b956-31\"> Now Immigration and Nationality Act, \u00a7 241(a) (11), 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1251(a) (11).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
