That view was accepted by the examiner in sustaining the opposition but was rejected by the Assistant Commissioner. The instant appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">While the goods listed in appellee\u2019s application are ophthalmic lens blanks and eyeglass lenses, the specific goods to which the mark has been applied, as disclosed by the record, are trifocal lenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">The question to be decided here, as below, is whether the letters \u201cCV,\u201d as applied to such goods are descriptive within the meaning of Section 2(e) of the Lanham Act, Trade-Mark Act of 1946.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">In support of the contention that the letters \u201cCV\u201d are merely descriptive of the goods to which they are applied, appellant alleges those letters are generally recognized as an abbreviation of, and as synonymous with, the words \u201ccontinuous vision,\u201d which, in turn, are alleged to be merely descriptive of trifocal lenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">Although it has been held that a mark may be descriptive if it aptly describes the function or use of the goods to which it is applied, In re W. A. Sheaffer Pen Company, 158 F.2d 390, 34 C.C.P.A., Patents, 771, and Andrew J. McPartland, Inc., v. Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., Inc., 164 F.2d 603, 35 C.C.P.A., Patents, 802, we do not think that is the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">As noted by the examiner, there is of record advertising matter used by ap-pellee when it first introduced the words \u201ccontinuous vision,\u201d strongly suggesting a descriptive connotation as applied to trifocal lenses on the theory such lenses allegedly enable the eye to adjust to objects at various distances in such a way as to avoid noticeable interruption. It was his opinion that appellee, after using such advertising was not in a favorable position to urge that the words \u201ccontinuous vision\u201d are not descriptive.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-13\">On the other hand, appellee argues that the advertising matter in question, considered in its entirety, merely asserts that the words \u201ccontinuous vision\u201d are suggestive of the function of the lenses to which they are applied, and that the word \u201cdescriptive\u201d was not employed in its trademark sense in said advertising.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-14\">Viewing the evidence as a whole, it is by no means certain the words \u201ccontinuous vision\u201d are descriptive of the function of trifocal lenses as distinguished from being merely suggestive thereof. The record shows that trifocal lenses had been in use for more than fifty years before those words were applied to them. That would indicate the words were not necessary to describe such lenses, and apparently were not considered obvious or natural for that purpose. It is only when the function of trifocal lenses is explained, as is done in appellee\u2019s advertisements, that the applicability of the words \u201ccontinuous vision\u201d becomes clear. The situation is somewhat similar to that in W. G. Reardon Laboratories Inc., v. B. &amp; B. Exterminators, Inc., 4 Cir., 71 F.2d 515, 517, involving the words \u201cMouse Seed\u201d as a trademark for a mouse poison. The court (C.C.A. 4th 1934) found the words to be merely suggestive since \u201cMature thought would probably lead to but one conclusion \u2014 that a mouse poison was indicated \u2014 but it requires thought to reach this conclusion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-15\">It is of some significance that shortly after appellee began use of the words \u201ccontinuous vision,\u201d the appellant inquired of the appellee as to its intention of \u201cmaking the descriptive designation Continuous Vision Lenses a term acceptable by the other trifocal manufac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>turers.\u201d The latter r\u00e9plied that it had \u25a0decided the designation should be \u201capplied exclusively to the products of the Univis Lens Company\u201d and that \u201cwe are not in a position to allow Modern Optics, or anyone else, to use this name in connection with their product.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">The above suggests that, at least before the present controversy arose, both parties felt appellee had some proprietary right in the words \u201ccontinuous vision,\u201d and that such words were not available for unrestricted use by others without appellee\u2019s permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">However, although we have considered appellant\u2019s contentions as to the deseriptiveness of the words \u201ccontinuous vision,\u201d it is not necessary to determine whether those words are merely descriptive of trifocal lenses, since appellee is not seeking registration of those words, but a mark whose dominant feature is the letters \u201cCV.\u201d The letters \u201cCV\u201d are, of course, the initial letters of the words \u201ccontinuous vision,\u201d and it is possible for initial letters to become so associated with descriptive words as to become descriptive themselves. Martell &amp; Co. v. Societe Anonyme De La Benedictine, etc., 116 F.2d 516, 28 C.C.P.A., Patents, 851, and Breth v. Cutting Room Appliances Corp., 57 U.S.P.Q. 46. It does not follow, however, that all initials of combinations of descriptive words are ipso facto unregistrable. While each case must be decided on the basis of the particular facts involved, it would seem that, as a general rule, initials cannot be considered descriptive unless they have become so generally understood as representing descriptive words as to be accepted as substantially synonymous therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">There are of record a number of exhibits showing the use of the letters \u201cCV\u201d in apparent reference to trifocal lenses generally. In some of them the words \u201ccontinuous vision\u201d also- appear a number of times where the letters-are used merely to avoid to\u00f3 frequent, repetition, but in others, including' some orders , for lenses, -the letters \u201cCV\u201d provide the only indication of the meaning intended.-'</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">\u25a0 While the record shows, there are -individuals to whom the letters \u201cCV\u201d constitute a generic designation of trifocal lenses, we are of the opinion it has- not been established that such is the rule rather than the exception. We therefore agree with the Assistant Commissioner that \u201cThe record is unconvincing that \u2018CV\u2019 is a generally recognized term for multifocal lenses and lens blanks.\u201d Accordingly, the decision appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">JACKSON, Judge, retired, recalled to participate.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">O\u2019CONNELL, J., because of illness, did not participate in the hearing or decision of this case. \u2018 :</p>\n<p id=\"b558-11\">WORLEY, J., was present during paid; of the argument and by agreement of -counsel at the time of argument was-given permission to participate in the decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b557-10\">.
