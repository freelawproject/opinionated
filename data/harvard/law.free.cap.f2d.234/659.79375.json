The court over which the appellee judge presided and in which the assistant prosecuting attorney served officially and appellant\u2019s attorney appeared in his behalf had plain jurisdiction over the criminal prosecution of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-20\">No merit whatever is found in any of appellant\u2019s points, which have been heard and considered on oral arguments and Briefs of the attorneys and upon the record in the case. The applicable principles have been applied adversely to appellant\u2019s contentions in the recent decision of this court in the three cases decided in one opinion, Kenney v. Fox (Kenney v. Hatfield, Kenney v. Killian) 6 Cir., 232 F.2d 288.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-21\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court dismissing appellant\u2019s complaint is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
