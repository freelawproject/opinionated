France &amp; Canada S. S. Corp., 263 F. 545; Port of New York Stevedoring Corp. v. Castagna, 280 F. 618, and held, Guerrini v. United States, 1948, 167 F.2d 352, 355, 1948 AMC 724, the fealty of the lower Federal Courts to declare that in a common law action on a maritime claim, contributory negligence of the plaintiff was a complete bar; its hold was weakened by a series of parenthetical body blows,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and was lost altogether, without even being mentioned by name, for personal injuries <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>as it was for property losses.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1001-13\">This circumstance affected Court and counsel so much so that this mutual preoccupation with contributory negligence, as such, and its consequence, seemingly allowed the real problem to go unnoticed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-14\">The tug Lucinda Clark was on a marine railway in the shipyard undergoing contract repairs, including the removal and partial replacement of a bent engine exhaust pipe running up through the top decking of the wooden deckhouse. On evidence fully sufficient, Galena Oaks Corp. v. Scofield, 5 Cir., 218 F.2d 217; cf. C. J. Dick Towing Co. v. The Leo, 5 Cir., 202 F.2d 850, 1953 AMC 498; McAllister v.

The shipyard employees threw a small amount of water on the area where the pipe came through the tar roofing paper apparently, though negligently, considering that the fire was extinguished. This was about 1:00 (noon) Sunday. About 3:00 p. m., after all shipyard employees had left the vessel, the tug Master saw smoke again coming from the same area. He, as had the shipyard employees, poured a small amount of water around the pipe thinking, although negligently mistaken, that the fire was out.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">On leaving the tug an hour later, he instructed the Chief Engineer to be cautious about the possibility of fire, and around 5:00 p. m. the Chief Engineer, seeing smoke in the same area, repeated the negligent sequence of 1:00 p. m. and 3:00 p. m. by dousing a little water in this area under the mistaken, and negligent, belief that the fire was extinguished. Within an hour, all hands had gone ashore with no notice to the shipyard of either recurrence of the fire. Near 8:00 p. m. the shipyard\u2019s night watchman discovered the tug afire, but despite strenuous efforts by shipyard personnel and the local-fire department* the fire was out of control and extensive damage <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> was done.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-10\">By extensive oral record. statements at the conclusion of arguments, the Judge made it clear that he then considered both shipyard negligent and tug owner contributorily negligent,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and, apparently of the view that, following Louisiana law for a non-maritime tort, contributory negligence would bar recovery entirely, he announced his direction to enter judgment for the defendant shipyard. On plaintiff tug owner\u2019s motion for new trial, Hedger Transportation Corp. v. United Fruit Co., supra, and the interment of Belden v. Chase, supra, was pressed heavily to secure a judgment for half damages under the usual admiralty rule of mutual fault. Overruling this, the Court escaped the problem by then holding that the shipyard\u2019s negligence was a condition,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> not a cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>We agree with the tug owner that, the fire having been caused by the shipyard\u2019s negligence and its errors in failing properly to extinguish it being exactly of the same kind as the tug owner\u2019s, the finding of \u201ccondition\u201d is clearly erroneous and cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-4\">Though we join with the Second and Third Circuits in applying the maritime doctrine of divided damages, cf. Hartford Accidents &amp; Indemnity Co. v. Gulf Refining Co., 5 Cir., 230 F.2d 346, to maritime causes of action whether pending as Civil Actions or Admiralty libels and conclude that the non-maritime <em>location </em>of the damage, T. Smith &amp; Son, Inc., v. Taylor, 276 U.S. 179, 48 S.Ct. 228, 72 L.Ed. 520, 1928 AMC 447; State Industrial Commission of State of New York v. Nordenholt Corp., 259 U.S. 263, 42 S.

Ryan Stevedoring Co. v. Pan-Atlantic Steamship Corp., 350 U.S. 124, 76 S.Ct. 232, the maritime contract, Archawski v. Hanioti, 350 U.S. 532, 76 S.Ct. 617, for vessel repairs irrespective of the locale of performance, North Pacific Steamship Co. v. Hall Bros. M. R. &amp; S.

Rather it is, or is akin to, the one universally<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> applied for both torts and contracts, generally described as the doctrine of avoidable con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>sequences and under which a plaintiff, with an otherwise valid right of action, is denied recovery for so much of the losses as are shown to have resulted from failure on his part to use reasonable efforts to avoid or prevent them. The contrast is most vivid in contemplating a traditional common law situation. \u201cIf the plaintiff by negligent action or inaction <em>before </em>the defendant\u2019s wrongdoing has been completed has contributed to cause actual invasion of plaintiff\u2019s person or property, the plaintiff is wholly barred of any relief. The doctrine of avoidable consequences comes into play at a later stage. Where the defendant has already committed an actionable wrong, whether tort or breach of contract, then this doctrine limits the plaintiff\u2019s recovery by disallowing only those items of damages which could reasonably have been averted * * * contributory negligence is to be asserted as a complete defense, whereas the doctrine of avoidable consequences is not considered a defense at all, but merely a rule of damages by which certain particular items of loss may be excluded from consideration * * * \u201d [emphasis the author\u2019s], McCormick on Damages, West Publishing Company, 1935, Chapter 5, Avoidable Consequences, pages 127 et seq.; see also 61 Harvard Law Review (1947), 113, 131-134, Developments in Damages. Recognized universally,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> it is nonetheless understandable that variable conceptual explanations <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> are given ranging from contributory negligence, as such, lack of proximate cause and a so-called \u201cduty\u201d to mitigate. Admiralty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>courts are not free from this confusion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> But the result desired has a more adequate explanation for, \u201cIn such cases it is not true that the injured person has a duty to act nor that the conduct of the tortfeasor ceases to be a legal cause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>the ult\u00edmate harm; but recovery for such harm is denied because it is in part the result of the injured person\u2019s lack of care and public policy requires that persons should be discouraged from wasting their resources both physical or economic\u201d, Restatement of the Law of Torts, \u00a7 918, page 602.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">So far as the original fire is concerned, there was, of course, no basis for imposing any or all or part of its consequences on the tug owner. The shipyard, on the basic fact findings of the District Court freed by us, as clearly erroneous, of the conclusion of \u201ccondition\u201d, was and remains clearly liable for this and all damage proximately caused by this fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">The tug owner\u2019s action subsequent to that related not to liability but to a possible reduction in the award to the extent that its failure to take reasonable steps augmented the loss. This was, then, a question of diminution of damages, \u00e1 matter strictly speaking, reserved by stipulation to a later day and not then before the Court, and, in any event, not adequately assayed<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> in the light of these applicable principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-8\">The judgment of dismissal must,, therefore, be reversed and remanded with directions to enter interlocutory finding for the plaintiff tug owner, South-port Transit Company, and to take further, other and not inconsistent proceedings for the determination,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> allowance and award of damages and the entry of final judgment thereon. On the remand, however, the Court must regard carefully that the tug owner is the innocent party whose property was damaged, to some extent at least, by negligent performance of its contract by the shipyard. Under the teaching of the doctrine of avoidable consequence, a substantial burden is therefore heavy on the wrongdoer to establish that prudence called for action by the tug owner at one or more of these stages; and, that had it been taken, the resulting damage would have been substantially different. Nor will inability satisfactorily to differentiate between the consequences of the tortfeasor\u2019s conduct and the innocent injured party\u2019s inaction be measured or its significance determined by common law notions which might deny recovery altogether.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1007-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>This is a maritime cause of action for negligent performance of a maritime contract in which the rigors of contributory negligence as a bar are ameliorated, Pope &amp; Talbot, Inc., v. Hawn, supra, by the admiralty concept of divided damage, and if, on a full trial, the Court concludes that prudence called for action by the tug which was not taken, but that the damage flowing therefrom cannot be separated with some reasonable certainty, then all damages should be divided. For unlike many situations in which a tortfeasor\u2019s wrong has spent itself, and what occurs later is from simple nonaction by the property owner, the shipyard\u2019s negligence here, in a very real sense, was still at work \u2014 not alone in consequences, but, from the nature of fire, in new destruction as this concealed fire continued to spread. Moreover, to the negligence \u2014 i. e., wrongful performance of its contract by starting the fire-must be added the negligent efforts made by the shipyard in its duty to extinguish it \u2014 a duty which, by its nature, continued after the initial event. If the tug owner\u2019s action in twice attempting to extinguish the fire by these simple means and twice believing that the job was done, was imprudent, it varies none in quality or character from the similar and <em>post </em>event breaches by the shipyard. In such a situation to visit all of the consequences on the innocent property owner whose only \u201cduty\u201d to act came into being because of the contractor\u2019s initial and subsequent wrongs merely because he cannot adequately separate them would be harsh indeed and completely out of keeping with the fairer and more enlightened admiralty rule of divided damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-4\">Reversed and remanded with directions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">.

Pennsylvania Railroad Co., 2 Cir., 61 F.2d 707, 1932 AMC 799, and The Algonquin, 2 Cir., 70 F.2d 335, 1934 AMC 577, indicate a rule of proximate cause (foreseeableness) for the innocent cargo owner, contributory negligence as to the damaged ship owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">The following emphasize lack of proximate cause: The Roman Prince, D.C.S.D.N.Y., 275 F. 712, failure prevent inrush of water through inconsequential collision wound; The Kaiser Wilhelm Der Grosse, 2 Cir., 145 F. 623, negligent handling of deck load after negligent swells from passing steamer; The Transfer No. 8, D.C.S.D.N.Y., 88 F. 551, failure to beach damaged barge; The Asbury Park, 2 Cir., 147 F. 194, damage from sinking and cargo loss denied for failure to repair inconsequential hole from negligent swells and failure to operate pumps; Sinram v. Pennsylvania Railroad Co., supra, cargo loaded and barge sunk after failure to inspect slight collision damage, also considers contributory negligence; The J. G. Rose, 2 Cir., 9 F.2d 917, 1926 AMC 34, recovery for slight collision damage allowed, but sinking loss rejected altogether indicating disapproval of The Silvia, D.C.E.D.N.Y., 2 F.2d 99, 105, 1924 AMC 885, which divided damages because of inability satisfactorily to distinguish between causes; The Edward A. Uhrig, D. C.W.D.N.Y., 9 F.2d 185, 1925 AMC 1503, failure to repair slight collision damage; The Mars, supra, recovery limited to initial slight collision damago not subsequent sinking; Westchester Fire Insurance Co., of New York v. Pennsylvania Railroad Co., 2 Cir., 96 F.2d 133, 1938 AMC 732, cargo loss denied for subsequent sinking due to failure to pump out after collision damage; The Algonquin, supra; The Black Diamond No. 2, D.C.E.D.N.Y., 59 F.Supp. 699, 1945 AMC 31, recovery limited to initial slight collision damage and not subsequent sinking from failure to inspect and repair; and see, The Glendola, 2 Cir., 47 F.2d 206, 1931 AMC 302, certiorari denied Standard Oil Co. v. Glendola S.S. Corp., 283 U.S. 857, 51 S.Ct. 650, 75 L.Ed. 1463, indicates foreseeability, not wrongfulness, is the significant quality for acts after initial injury and allows full damages since such acts were foreseeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-10\">The following apparently treated as avoidable consequence or with no clear indication of the theory: The Mascot, 3 Cir., 282 F. 766; Scott v. Cornell Steamboat Co., D.C.S.D.N.Y., 59 F. 638; The Timor, D.C.S.D.N.Y., 61 F. 633; Eclipse Lighterage &amp; Transportation Co. v. Cornell Steamboat Co., 2 Cir., 242 F. 927, recovery limited to slight collision damage and not subsequent sinking from failure to pump; The Baltimore, 8 Wall. 377, 75 U.S. 377, 19 L.Ed. 463, Total loss for abandonment of schooner in shallow water disallowed; The Barryton, 2 Cir., 54 F.2d 282, 1931 AMC 1878; Pennsylvania Railroad Co. v. Washburn, D.C.S.D.N.Y., 50 F. 335, recovery limited to initial collision repairs where barge sunk when owner refused to pay overtime to pump out barge; The Redwood, 9 Cir., 81 F.2d 680, 1930 AMC 774, initial collision damage and not subsequent sinking allowed; Isthmian Steamship Co. v. Jarka Corp. of Baltimore, D.C.Md., 100 F.Supp. 856, 1951 AMC 1952, damage to vessel from vibration caused by propeller damago sustained in collision disallowed for failure to obtain repairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-11\">The following cases seem to treat it as one for normal divided damages: In re Pennsylvania Railroad Co., see above; Constantine &amp; Pickering Steamship Co. v. West India Steamship Co., D.C.S.D. N.Y., 199 F. 964, charterer\u2019s failure to provide safe berth but vessel crew required to minimize damage when vessel broke adrift; The Silvia, supra, failure to protect against swells of passing vessel; The East Indian, 2 Cir., 62 F.2d 242, 1933 AMC 56, failure fend off swinging vessel; The J. C. Hart, D.C.E.D.N.Y., 43 F.2d 566, 1930 AMC 1421; see also the Walter A. Luckenbaeh, discussed above; but in each the injured party\u2019s action was apparently principally related to preventing the initial occurrence (impact, collision, etc.), rather than care after the event.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1006-6\">. Obsessed, presumably, with tbe engaging prospect of pressing for and resisting the adoption within this Circuit of the Hedger rule, these skilled advocates, in their preoccupation, in their briefs in this Court and apparently in the Court below, treated it as a matter of liability with not even incidental, casual reference to the doctrine of avoidable consequences or citation of any of the material discussed by us in notes 7 to 10, inclusive, and the text related to them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1006-7\">. As this involves appraisal of the reasonableness of the tug owner\u2019s conduct and the extent of physical damage either done or avoidable at various stages, e. g., between 1:00 p.m. and 3:00 p.m., between 3:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m., after 5:00 p.m., etc., and not a mere itemization and mathematical accounting on the basis of precise directions as to responsibility ordinarily undertaken by Commissioner or Master, it is clear that Court and counsel, under the original stipulation intended that all such basic legal questions were to be determined by the Court. Neither the peculiar twist taken by this-case nor our remand is to reduce or restrict the issues for trial by the Court or expand those for determination by the Master, Fed.Rules Civ.Proc. rule 53 (b), 28 U.S.C.A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1006-10\">. See Prosser, supra, at page 287:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1006-11\">\u201c * * * In the \u2018avoidable consequence\u2019 cases, the initial damage can not logically be charged to the plaintiff\u2019s own negligence as a cause, while the later damages may be. If no such division can be made, the plaintiff\u2019s negligence will bar all recovery, notwithstanding that it is subsequent in point of time to that of the defendant.40\u201d Footnote 40 states: \u201c40. See the interesting ease of continuing negligence of both plaintiff and defendant, with progressive damage to the plaintiff\u2019s cattle, in Atchison, T. &amp; S. F.

Merchants\u2019 Live Stock Co., 8 Cir., 1923, 293 F. 987, where recovery was denied \u2018because it is impossible to determine the amount of damage respectively caused by the negligence of each.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
