Legislature, page 190-191, Sec. 6, sub. 5) reads: \u201cThe validity and negotiable character of an instrument are not affected by the fact that it (5.)

Carroll &amp; Iler, 63 Texas, 48, it is said: \u201cThe instrument in question is payable in current funds and, although there is some conflict of authority upon the question, it is believed to be the better doctrine that the paper so payable, although otherwise in form negotiable is not in law negotiable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b361-7\">An examination of authorities will show, however, that, the great weight of authority, including that of the United States Supreme Court, holds, that the language referred to does not destroy the negotiability of the instrument. Bull v. First National Bank of Kasson 123 U. S., 105-112; Rose\u2019s Notes on U. S. Reports, New Edition, Vol. 13, page 1115. The question then to be determined by this court is: Did the act of 1919, if fairly construed, obviate the effect of Judge Stayton\u2019s decision in the 63rd Texas? We respectfully suggest that it did.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b361-8\">Mr. Presiding Judge GERMAN</author>\n<p id=\"A0X\">delivered the opinion of the Commission of Appeals, Section A.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">The Honorable Court of Civil Appeals for the Sixth District, in certificate, has asked the Supreme Court to determine whether or not the following instrument is negotiable within the provisions of the present laws of this State:</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">\u2018 \u2018 The First State Bank,</p>\n<p id=\"b361-11\">Arnnona, Texas, January 6th, 1921.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-12\">\u201cThis certifies that H. S. Whiteman has deposited in this bank Five Thousand Three Hundred Fifty-nine and no/100 hundredth Dollars, $5359.00, in current funds, payable to the order of self on 8 months after date in current funds on the return of this certificate properly endorsed, with interest at the rate of five per cent per annum from January 6th, 1921, to September 15th, 1921,</p>\n<p id=\"b361-13\">L. B. Pool, Cashier.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-14\">\u201cCertificate of Deposit.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-15\">Guaranty Fund Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-16\">\u201cNo interest after maturity. This deposit is not subject to check.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-17\">That a certificate of deposit in usual form is in its nature negotiable seems now to be recognized by practically all courts and text writers. See Note in L. R. A. 1918C, page 691, 3 R. C. L. 574. The question involved here is whether the certificate referred to is in form negotiable, due to the fact that it is payable in \u201ccurrent funds.\u201d The recent decisions of courts of other states are in accord in holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>that if a certificate of deposit is otherwise in form negotiable the use of these words does not render it non-negotiable. Feder v. Elliott, (Iowa) 199 N. W., 288; Milliken v. Security Trust Co., 187 Ind., 307, 118 N. E., 568; National Surety Co. v. Allen, 243 Mass. 218, 137 N. E., 533; Bank v. Bank, 72 W. Va., 534, 80 Am. St., 401, 79 S. E., 662; Bank v. Dillenbeck, 111 Kans., 98, 205 Pac., 1022; Hatch v. Bank, 94 Me., 348, 47 Atl., 908; Kirkwood v. Bank, 40 Neb., 484, 24 L. R. A., 442, 42 Am. St., 683, 58 N. W., 1016; Bank v. Sugar Co., 147 N. Y. S. 498, 162 App. Div., 248.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">The Supreme Court of our State has heretofore given recognition to the contrary doctrine, and has held that the use of this term in a like instrument has the effect of making it non-negotiable. In the case of Texas L. &amp; C. Co. v. Carroll, 63 Texas, 48 involving a bill of exchange made payable in \u201ccurrent funds,\u201d the Court said</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">\u201cThe instrument in question is payable in 1 current funds\u2019 and although th:ere is some conflict of authority upon the question, it is believed to be the better doctrine that paper so payable, although otherwise in form negotiable, is not in law negotiable.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">\u201cWe may say in this case as was said by the Supreme Court of Indiana in Conwell v. Pumphrey, 9 Ind., 138: 1 The note before us was perfect as a money demand without the addition of the phrase \u201cpayable in current funds;\u201d and unless that phrase was intended to allow payment in funds other than money, it is not easy to see why it was used.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">This case has not been overruled, but was cited with approval in the ease of National Bank v. National Bank, 84 Texas, 40, involving a somewhat similar question. The present Supreme Court is not willing to depart from this holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">It is insisted by counsel that the adoption by the Legislature of the Uniform Negotiable Instruments Act (Chapter 123, Acts 1919) had the effect of making\u2019 the instrument in question negotiable. With this we cannot agree. The Act in question, among other things, provides that an instrument to be negotiable must have the following requirement:</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">\u201cIt must contain an unconditional promise or order to pay <em>a </em>certain sum of <em>money.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">It is further provided that the validity and negotiable character of the instrument are not affected by the fact that:</p>\n<p id=\"b362-11\">\u201cIt designates a particular kind of current <em>money </em>in which payment is to be made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-12\">As there is nothing in the law itself to indicate that the expression \u201ccurrent funds\u201d is to be regarded as having the same meaning as \u201ccurrent money\u201d, it is at once manifest that the question remains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>with the courts for solution. Prof. Brannan, in a very recent treatise on the Uniform Negotiable Instruments Law, says:</p>\n<p id=\"b363-3\">\u201cThe Negotiable Instruments Law leaves the question unsolved, for in section 6-5 it is simply provided that the validity and negotiable character of an instrument is not affected by the fact that it designates a particular kind of current money in which payment is to be made.\u2019 What is meant by \u2018current money'? or rather, what is meant by \u2018money\u2019? Does it include not only gold and silver coin, but also bank notes, treasury notes and gold and silver certificates?</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">All of them are current and are popularly spoken of as <em>money, </em>but they are not all legal tender.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">After reference to a certain proposed amendment he adds:</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">\u201cThe question still remains, what is meant by \u2018currency\u2019 or \u2018current funds\u2019, and here the courts will decide as they have.done in the past.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">The courts of some of the states, no doubt for the sake of uniformity in decision' have overruled prior decisions, and have given to the words \u201ccurrent funds\u201d the same meaning as \u201cmoney\u201d, regardless of the question as to whether or not certain commercial paper popularly referred to as money was legal tender. Our Supreme Court is not willing to read this meaning into the language of our statute, believing that the matter is more appropriately one for legislative action. As the Legislative is now in session the subject is respectfully called to their attention. In order to have uniformity of application of this part of the Negotiable Instruments Law, Prof. Brannan suggests that subdivision 5 of Section 6 be amended, so as to provide that the validity and negotiable character of an instrument is not affected by the fact that:</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">\u201c5Jt is payable in currency or current funds or designates a particular kind of current money in which payment is to be made. The words \u2018currency\u2019, \u2018current money\u2019, or \u2018current funds\u2019 shall mean such circulating media as are legal tender or are lawfully and actually circulating at par with legal tender at the time and place of payment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">As to the wisdom or policy of such a change in our law the Legislature is, of course, to be the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-11\">Following the opinion heretofore expressed in the case cited, we answer the question propounded by the Court of Civil Appeals by saying that the instrument referred to was not a negotiable instrument within the provisions of the law of this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-13\">The opinion of the Commission of Appeals answering the certified question is adopted and ordered certified to the Court of Civil Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-14\"><em>O. M. Cureton, </em>Chief Justice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
