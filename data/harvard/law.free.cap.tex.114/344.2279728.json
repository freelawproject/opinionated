Reeves, to require respondent the Honorable E. T. Roseborough, Clerk of the Court of Civil Appeals for the Sixth Supreme Judicial District of Texas, to forward to this Court relator\u2019s application for writ of error in the ease of John J. Reeves v. The State, (258 S. W., 577).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-13\">Relator alleges a full compliance with all requirements of law and the rules of procedure in preparing and filing with respondent Rose-borough, as clerk of said court, for transmission to this Court, his said application for writ of error, which was addressed to this Court, but that respondent Roseborough declines to file and forward same to this Court for its consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-14\">It appears from relator\u2019s written argument in support of his motion for leave to file his petition for mandamus that respondent, the Clerk of the Court of Civil Appeals declined to file the petition for writ of error upon the ground that mandate had issued undei Art. 6057, R. S., that being the concluding article of Chapter 2, Title 98, relating to removal from office of county and certain district officers. The Article reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b365-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>\u201cWhen so decided, unless the judgment be for some cause set aside or suspended, the mandate of the court shall issue within five days after the judgment of the court is rendered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">Relator complains that respondent Roseborongh has substituted his judgment for that of the Supreme Court as to whether this Court has jurisdiction over the case upon relator\u2019s application for writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">It is not at all necessary to discuss the question at length. A court of last resort is the exclusive judge of its own jurisdiction, and necessarily must be. It is generally held that the validity of an \u25a0appeal and the jurisdiction of the appellate court are to be determined by that Court. 3 C. J., p. 371, Sec. 128, and cases cited; Dillard v. Wilson, 137 S. W., 152. Respondent Roseborongh could not determine for this Court its jurisdiction over the case or the effect of- the issuance of mandate under Article 6057. However, in this case, upon leave being granted to relator to file his petition for a writ of mandamus, respondent Roseborongh filed and forwarded to this Court relator\u2019s petition for writ of error. While the petition for mandamus is to be dismissed, we have deemed it advisable to write this short opinion on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">The petition is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
