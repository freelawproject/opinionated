County Court severed the counts stemming from Pearson\u2019s death and, in July 1993, defendant was convicted of second degree murder and endangering the welfare of a child in connection with Adair\u2019s death. The conviction was subsequently affirmed by this Court <em>(People v Conway, </em>241 AD2d 752, <em>Iv denied </em>91 NY2d 871). In 1995, defendant was convicted of second degree murder in connection with Pearson\u2019s death and sentenced to a prison term of 25 years to life. Defendant now appeals from the 1995 conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">Initially, defendant contends that County Court\u2019s denial of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>his motion to dismiss the indictment based on the People\u2019s unreasonable delay in indicting him for Pearson\u2019s murder deprived him of due process. Although an \u201cunreasonable delay in prosecuting a defendant constitutes a denial of due process of law\u201d <em>(People v Staley, </em>41 NY2d 789, 791), the Court of Appeals has \u201csteadfastly refused to set forth a per se period beyond which a criminal prosecution may not be pursued\u201d <em>(People v Taranovich, </em>37 NY2d 442, 445). Where the delay is protracted, the prosecution has the burden to demonstrate good cause <em>(see, People v Singer, </em>44 NY2d 241, 254), but \u201c \u2018[d]elays due to difficulty in obtaining sufficient evidence to indict or even to arrest do not mandate dismissal of charges [on due process grounds]\u201d\u2019 <em>(People v Denis, </em>276 AD2d 237, 248, <em>Iv denied </em>96 NY2d 861, quoting <em>People v Staley, supra </em>at 792).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">Here, the eight-year delay was due to the original determination in 1984 that the cause of Pearson\u2019s death was an accidental fall down some stairs, which finding was based largely on defendant\u2019s own account of what had occurred. It was not until the 1992 death of Adair, when pathologist Barbara Wolf reviewed Pearson\u2019s autopsy and other medical records, that any evidence suggested that Pearson\u2019s death had not been accidental. Thereafter, the prosecution promptly submitted the new evidence to a grand jury. Given the People\u2019s good faith decision to defer the prosecution until it was justified by Wolfs investigation, any prejudice allegedly caused to defendant did not deprive him of due process of law <em>(see, People v Singer, supra </em>at 254; <em>People v Denis, supra </em>at 248). Moreover, despite defendant\u2019s allegation of prejudice arising from the inability of Investigator John Mills to recall certain events surrounding the subsequent investigation, the record contains no showing that Mills\u2019 testimony pertained to the medical cause of death, which was the decisive issue in this case <em>(see, People v Denis, supra </em>at 250). Thus, we are not persuaded that the preindictment delay here constituted a denial of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">We also find County Court\u2019s admission of Wolfs testimony with respect to three articles of medical literature during redirect examination to be proper and not to have deprived defendant of his right to a fair trial. While the scope of redirect examination lies within the sound discretion of the trial court, where \u201cthe opposing party \u2018opens the door\u2019 on cross-examination to matters not touched upon during the direct examination, a party has the right on redirect \u2018to explain, clarify and fully elicit [the] question only partially examined\u2019 on cross-examination\u201d <em>(People v Melendez, </em>55 NY2d 445, 451, quoting <em>People v Regina, </em>19 NY2d 65, 78). During cross-examination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>here, defense counsel challenged Wolfs opinion that Pearson\u2019s injuries could not have been sustained in a fall, questioning her specifically about her research with respect to injuries to the brain that occur on the opposite side of the head from where the blow was delivered. Thus, defense counsel opened the door to whether Wolf had \u201cdone exhaustive research in [this] area\u201d and Wolfs citation to the medical articles used in reaching her conclusion was properly admitted. Since Wolf described the articles in this context and they were neither read nor introduced into evidence, County Court did not err in permitting the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-3\">Defendant also contends that a missing evidence charge was erroneously denied him because autopsy and crime scene photographs were missing, as was an audio recording of statements allegedly made by him. When a defendant claims that the loss of evidence deprived him of a fair trial, the court must consider \u201cthe proof available at trial, the significance of the missing evidence and whether the loss was intentional or inadvertent\u201d <em>(People v Haupt, </em>71 NY2d 929, 931; <em>see, People v Joseph, </em>86 NY2d 565, 572). Here, the record does not indicate, nor does defendant contend, that the People intentionally or in bad faith lost or destroyed any evidence. In addition, defendant fails to demonstrate the significance of the missing evidence or that it would have been favorable to his defense. Moreover, as County Court noted, \u201cample reference has been made during the testimony and in the defendant\u2019s closing argument to the fact[s] * * * that the People, although they have the burden do not have any of [this evidence].\u201d Accordingly, the court did not err in refusing to give the jury a missing evidence charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Nor did County Court err in denying defendant\u2019s request for a missing witness charge with respect to Investigator Mike Geary, who photographed the general area around the stairway where Pearson allegedly fell. Defendant failed to show that any testimony to be elicited from Geary would be favorable to his case, the physical condition of the stairs and the surrounding area was not in dispute, and, considering the extensive testimony as to the physical condition of the area, Geary\u2019s testimony would have been cumulative <em>(see, People v Gonzalez, </em>68 NY2d 424, 427; <em>People v La Motte, </em>285 AD2d 814, 816).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The balance of defendant\u2019s contentions have been reviewed and also found to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Crew III, J.P., Peters, Spain and Mugglin, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
