While the Examiner of Interferences awarded priority to appellants, he was reversed by both the Board of Examiners in Chief and the Commissioner.

Young v.

In fact, they make no claim to the invention as a completed whole. The testimony of the superintendent of plaintiff\u2019s factory and the draftsman who made the drawings tends to sustain the contentions of plaintiif rather than those of defendant. * * * Upon the whole record, I am constrained to hold, that defendant has not sustained the burden of proof required to overcome the presumption of validity and priority of invention arising from the issuance of the patent to plaintiff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">From a careful review of the evidence, we are convinced that the decision of the Commissioner, sustained by the able opinion of Judge Sessions, is right.
