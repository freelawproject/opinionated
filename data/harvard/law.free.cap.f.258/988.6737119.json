We have held in many cases that an order dissolving an interference is a 'mere interlocutory order, from which no appeal lies to this court. Carlin v. Goldberg, 45 App. D. C. 540; Field v. Colman, 47 App. D. C. 189. This is based upon the ruling that, in interference, appeal will lie to this court only from a judgment of priority. In re Fullagar, 32 App. D. C. 222; Cosper v. Gold, 34 App. D. C. 194; In re Carvalho, 47 App. D. C. 584.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-17\">Not only was there no order of priority in this case, but such a finding would have been inconsistent with the order of dissolution. A motion to dissolve an interference fundamentally challenges the right of one of the parties to make the claims. An order sustaining the motion, therefore, is equivalent to a holding that no interference in fact exists. Before an interference can exist, or a judgment of priority, be rendered, not only must both parties have a right to make the claims of the issue, but the parties must have the right to claim, and in fact be claiming, the same tiling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-18\">It therefore follows that the order of the Commissioner in this, case was not even the equivalent of a judgment of priority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-19\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-20\">Dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
