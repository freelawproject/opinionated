From a decision of the Commissioner of Patents, denying registration, the applicant appeals.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AJH\">Affirmed.</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-14\">The opinion of the Commissioner of Patents, mentioned by the court,, is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-15\">. This is an appeal from the decision of the Examiner of Interferences, sustaining the opposition of the Alaska Packers\u2019 Association to the registration by Getz &amp; Co. of the word \u201cPremium\u201d for canned salmon. The opposition is based .on what opposer claims to be the prior use of the word \u201cPremier,\u201d registered December 4, 1894, No. 25,610, for the same goods.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-16\">Although these marks have been used side by side for many years, and there is no proof of any actual confusion, still I hold with the Examiner of Interferences that the words are too close together, having much the same sound and appearance, and a similar meaning. See the very recent decision of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia in Goodrich Drug Co. v. Cassada Mfg. Co., 237 O. G., 918, holding \u201cVelvelite\u201d too' close to \u201cVelvetina.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-17\">The goods being the same and the marks too nearly alike, it only remains to be decided who first adopted the mark. Opposer claims to have acquired its mark \u201cPremier\u201d from the Kodiak Packing Company, which it bought out in 1893, having at the same time consolidated four or five other salmon packing companies into opposer company, and with this business acquired its trademark (Exhibit No. 2), which included 244 Premier labels and 714 Premier boxes. Indeed, applicant does not contest these facts, or that opposer has used \u201cPremier\u201d on canned salmon since May, 1893.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-18\">Getz, president of the applicant company, was formerly one of the principal owners of the Kodiak Packing Company; but he says that the Kodiak Packing Company had no such mark as \u201cPremier\u201d (Getz record, page 273). In this he is probably mistaken, since the Kodiak Packing Company registered \u201cPremier\u201d in Great Britain, January 6, 1892. This, together with the \u201cPremier\u201d labels taken over from the Kodiak Packing Company by the op-poser company, fortified by the testimony of Eortman, president of'the op-poser company, makes it very probable that opposer company bought \u201cPremier\u201d from the Kodiak Packing Company in 1893.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-19\">There is no record evidence of the use of \u201cPremium\u201d by applicant prior to 1908. Applicant\u2019s records, however, were burned in the San Francisco fire of 1906; but there is no showing why some records between 1906 and 1908 have not been produced. Applicant\u2019s witnesses, Stimson, Phillips, and Getz, testify from memory that \u201cPremium\u201d was used by the applicant company as far <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>back as 1886 or 1887: but such testimony, without any record, of sales, after the lapse of 80 years, is liable to be wrong. There even may have been ephemeral use, but not enough to establish trade-mark rights. Furthermore, the Kodiak Company, with which Getz was connected, had used \u201cPremier,\u201d and they may have confused the two. An illustration of how they may have confused matters after so long an interval is shown in Getz\u2019s testimony. He seemed quite positive (applicant\u2019s record, page 273) that the Kodiak Packing Company had never used \u201cPremier\u201d back in 1893, when the record shows th\u00bft in all probability it had.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-4\">Furthermore, as brought out in the Examiner\u2019s decision, unlabeled salmon was not generally sold to Jobbers until 1898. The applicant company was a jobber, and probably got salmon already labeled from the packer. And, lastly, applicant in its application only alleges use back to 1896.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-5\">A careful review of all these circumstances leads to the conclusion that there is no error in the Examiner\u2019s decision giving opposer prior use, and, since the marks are too near together, the opposition is sustained, and the decision of the Examiner of Interferences is affirmed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b541-6\">E. T. Fenwick and F. F- Morrill, both of Washington, D. C., for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b541-7\">Alex S. Stewart, of Washington, D. C., Chas.

This was opposed by the appellee, who asserted that it was the prior user of the word \u201cPremier\u201d as a mark on the same kind of goods; that its mark was registered in the Patent Office in 1894; that the two words had much the same sound and appearance, and a similar meaning; and that the use of them by both parties upon the goods in question would be likely to produce confusion in trade. The opposition was sustained by the Examiner of Interferences, and his action affirmed on appeal by the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\"><bracketnum>[1,2]</bracketnum> We think the Patent Office was right, and we affirm the Commissioner\u2019s decision, for the reasons given in his opinion, as well as upon the authority of Thomas Manufacturing Co. v. \u00c6olian Co., 47 App. D. C. 376, 378, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
