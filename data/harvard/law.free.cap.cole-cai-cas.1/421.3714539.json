A plaintiff who has once tried his cause, after which the verdict is set aside and a new trial awarded, is bound to try again, and again, if necessary, and if he do not, the defendant may apply for a nonsuit. But as the <em>English </em>practice has misled, and our own has not been perfectly settled, the plaintiff ma}r stipulate and with\u00bb out costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
