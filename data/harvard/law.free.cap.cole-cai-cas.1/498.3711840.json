He contended, that by the rules of the common law, a plaintiff was obliged to declare within the year, and if he did not do so, he was <em>ipso facto </em>out of court. If some limitation of this sort was not in force, a cause might be hung up <em>ad infinitum. </em>In support of the application, he cited 112. and particularly the reasoning of <em>Buller, </em>J.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b508-8\"><em>Van Wyck, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQqI\">argued that the only mode of putting a plaintiff out of court, was, by a rule to declare, or be <em>nonprossed.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b508-9\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Aag\">There is no such rule of practice in this court as th\u00e1t insisted on by the defendant. It is in his power to <em>nonpros </em>the plaintiff if he pleases ; if he does not, the plaintiff may declare at any time. The decision, however, in this case, will not apply to a suit removed by <em>habeas corpus ; </em>for there, as the defendant cannot nonpros, he is not bound to plead.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
