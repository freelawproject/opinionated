The attorney for the plaintiff called on the defendant, a few days before <em>August </em>term, to inform him of the intended suit, when the defendant assured the attorney, that the matter would be accommodated, and, if not, that he would consent to proceedings being as of <em>August </em>term ; that a <em>copias </em>was afterwards sued out on the second of <em>August </em>last, returnable the sixth, but not served till after <em>August </em>term, at which time the defendant indorsed his appearance, and as the plaintiff\u2019s attorney verily believed, with intent that all proceedings should be deemed as of <em>August </em>term; that the declaration was titled as of <em>August </em>term, though the <em>copias </em>has not been yet filed; that since <em>August, </em>the plaintiff has become a bankrupt, and that the defendant had pleaded, giving a notice of setting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>off a note which fell due on the 8th of Septemberlaat, and was the very note for five shillings in the pound given by the plaintiff and his partner, in composition for their debts.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b336-6\"><em>Hoffman </em>insisted,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASH\">that the indorsement of the writ by the defendant, was tantamount to a written agreement, as it was evidence in writing of the agreement, which was further corroborated by the pleadings.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AgzA\">Spencer, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AbO\">delivered the judgment of the court. Tfie defendant resists the application, relying principally on this : That he holds to nearly the amount of the plaintiff\u2019s demand, a note against him due on the 8th of <em>September </em>last, which he intends to set-off\". The object of the plaintiff\u2019s motion,,is, if possible, to exclude this effect; on this ground, that his demand is assigned for the benefit of certain persons who have paid debts for him, incurred by indorsements to his compounding creditors. The defendant denies notice of such assignment; both parties admit the insolvency of the plaintiff*. The verbal agreement between the attorney for the plaintiff and the defendant, cannot be attended to ; a rule of this court forbids such agreement being alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">There has been loches on the part of the plaintiff, in not entering his suit as of <em>August </em>term, and to avoid that loches, the court is now applied to. In granting favours of this kind, the court ought to be careful not to do injustice, and it appears to them, that granting the rule as applied for, might have that effect; for, \u25a0 most certainly, the defendant\u2019s claim to offset, is better founded, than that of the assignees to recover. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>Let a rule be entered, that the plaintiff have leave to file his writ, and enter the defendant\u2019s appearance, as of the last term.</p>\n<author id=\"b337-3\">Thompson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AEj\">I am sorry to be under a necessity of differing from the court; but I think the indorsement of appearance is evidence of an agreement as strong as if it had been reduced to writing, and sufficiently indicatory of the intent of the parties, to avoid any of the consequences against which the rule in question was framed. How far the defendant may, by filing the copias, and entering an appearance of <em>August </em>term, be precluded from a set-off, or by the present rule entitled to it, is unnecessary to determine. My opinion is, that the plaintiff ought to have the effect of his motion.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b337-4\">Kent, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZU\">I concur in the opinion last given. I deem it a point of moral rectitude to enforce all agreements, when the evidence is such as is not contravened by any rule of law. But as the judgment of the court is, to deny the full extent of the plaintiff\u2019s application, he can take no more than has already been pronounced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
