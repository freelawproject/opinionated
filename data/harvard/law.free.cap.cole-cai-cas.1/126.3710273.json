Abr. </em>183. B. 2 <em>Hawk. Plea. Cr. </em>214. He further insisted, that there must be a demand made of the costs after the bill has been regularly taxed, and at the time of serving the rule to show cause, before the party can be considered as in contempt. He cited 1 <em>Barnes, </em>120. 1 <em>Lilly\u2019s Abr. </em>162. Besides, he insisted, that,' according to 1 <em>Salk eld, </em>83. no attachment, will ever lie for the costs of putting off a trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b136-9\"><em>C.

Had he done this, he would have been entitled to his attachment instantly, without a previous notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-3\">The notice in this case having been served on the counsel, and the taxation having been made the same day that notice was given, the taxation and all proceedings founded on it are irregular.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">As to the case mentioned from <em>Salkeld, </em>it is .anonymous and stands alone; we lay no weight upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Let the attachment be set aside with costs,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
