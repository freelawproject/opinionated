By some accident, the attorney, entrusted with the papers, did not arrive in <em>New- York </em>till after the fourth day, and on the sixth, the defendant entered a default against the plaintiff for - not assigning errors according to notice, after which, the plaintiff, on the last day of the term, obtained his rule to amend, no one appearing to oppose.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b485-2\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>\n<em>Woodworth,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAqu\">on these facts detailed by affidavit, moved to set aside the default and subsequent proceedings.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b485-5\"><em>Foote, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2O\">rfeiied on a stipulation entered into between the attornies in the cause, by which it was agreed, that the written evidence referred to in the return was the order or draft therein mentioned. This he contended was adequate to the amendment to be moved for, and superseded the necessity of application ; therefore, errors not being assigned at the time the order expired, the defendant was regular in his default.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b485-6\"><em>Woodworth, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AC8\">The stipulation reached only to the identity of the paper, the mere production of which was not evidence, and the object of the motion was to procure a return of it, to show it was no testimony, without being corroborated by witnesses. Besides, when a party does not appear to oppose, he waives all objections. <em>Ekhart </em>v. <em>Dearman, ante, </em>p. 422.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b485-8\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"A71\">The stipulation was defective, for the object of the plaintiff could not have been obtained by it; nor does it state to have been made with a view of superseding the necessity of an application to the court. But the order to stay proceedings, having in fact expired before the default for not assigning errors was entered, the defendant was regular ; though, as there has been some misapprehension, and a delay from accident, it must be set aside on payment of costs and assigning errors in twenty days.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
