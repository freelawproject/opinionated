In <em>Jackson, </em>on the demise of <em>Ludlow, </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>after issue joined, the defendant abandoned the possession, and the lessor of the plaintiff having entered, did not notice the cause for trial. The defendant then moved for judgment, as in case of nonsuit, but the court denied his motion, and gave leave to discontinue without payment of costs.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b201-7\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"A7n\">The opinion of the court is, that sufficient has been shown, to prevent the judgment of nonsuit. The defendant has, by his own act, deprived the plaintiffs of that remedy, which they might have had against his person ; his body is out of their reach, and <em>that </em>by his own act. It is not, therefore, necessary, that they should proceed and incur expenses for nothing, as there is not any property from whence they can be reimbursed.\u2014 The plaintiffs, therefore, are entitled to discontinue, and without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
