He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>also contended that the motion ought to be founded on the affidavit of the <em>party; </em>therefore, <em>that </em>by the son ought not to have been read.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b475-4\"><em>Simonds, </em>in reply,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Acg\">offered affidavits to support the character of the son, by showing the settlement he mentioned had actually taken place.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b475-5\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"ADH\">We will allow affidavits, or other documents, to be adduced to establish the general reputation of a person whose character has been impeached, but we cannot hear any thing supplementary read# to substantiate the ground of motion. Copies of all that is relied on for such a purpose, should . be served. In the present instance, the incapacity of the defendants is denied ; and when a third person makes an affidavit, a sufficient reason should be shown, why it was not by the defendant himself.\u2014 Besides, a commissioner ought to have gone to their house ; and was the affidavit of their son to be received, it would still be insufficient; for it should have set forth what settlement was made, as it might have been conditional. Take nothing by your mo- \u2022 tian, and pay the costs of resisting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
