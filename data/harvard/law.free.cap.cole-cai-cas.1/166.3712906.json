About a year afterwards the defendants, in the above suit, compromised with the plaintiffs, who cancelled the policy as to them; of this the defendants\u2019 attorney had no information, nor was there any rule to discontinue, or other rule entered, and the other sidts proceeded. The principal cause went on to trial, and the jury found a verdict for the defendant, which was acquiesced in. The defendants\u2019 attorney thereupon entered rules for judgment as in case of nonsuit in all the causes, pursuant to the consolidation rule, and the costs were taxed and judgment rolls ready to be signed. It was now submitted to the court on these facts, to decide whether the rules for judgment, and the judgment for costs as in case of nonsuit, were regular or not; or, whether they ought to be set aside. N. B. At the time of compromise nothing was said about costs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b177-8\"><em>Hoffman, </em>as <em>amicus curiis,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIB\">informed the bench, that in <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>Lockwell, </em>it had been decided, that if a party compromised without the knowledge of his attorney, and the plaintiff went on, each paid his own costs.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b177-9\"><em>Per </em>Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AQp\">In every suit each party is supposed to advance as his suit proceeds. If each has paid costs and then they compromise, the suit is settled; for the transaction imports no further proceeding is to be had; nothing more than a simple discontinuance to enter on record, and nothing being said about costs, each must pay his own. The parties ought to have informed their attornies there was a compromise.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
