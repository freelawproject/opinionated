The declaration stated the date to be the thirteenth. <em>Emott </em>on the first day of term, had obtained a rule to amend the declaration by striking out the word <em>\u201c </em>thirteenth,\u201d and inserting the word \u201c thirtieth.\u201d No person appearing to oppose, the motion was granted of course, and without imposing terms.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b221-10\">\n<em>Van Vechten</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APm\">now applied to vacate that rule, and that it be <em>ordered, </em>that the amendment be on the usual terms.
