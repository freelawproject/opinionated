The answer shows the defence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>that arises on the return, and \u00bfhis is an attempt to do it away.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b273-3\">Emott, in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aj2\">The application may be novel, but it is not unreasonable. Suppose the witness had been examined in court, and had testified to <em>a </em>certain fact, which, taken without any explanation, would have one effect, if explained, another, might not a question be asked to explain <em>? </em>especially when it comes out collaterally. Here the deviation was not the object of inquiry. The question was simply to and from what places were you bound ? There may be an 'apparent, though not a real deviation ; for there might be a custom to go that rout.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b273-4\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AzR\">Take your commission. The answer being directed to another point, may be explained by an interrogatory to the one which it discloses ; for it may assign very sufficient reasons for the <em>iter </em>adopted. The commission, however, must be at the peril of the party.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
