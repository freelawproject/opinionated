The cause is now ready to come before the r.eferees, and this application is to be considered in the same light with the first application to put off a trial on account of absence of a material witness. It comes within the settled practice. The power given by the act to the defendant to take out a commission is in his favour, and an omission to do it cannot alter the ordinary practice,</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Let the defendant have the effect of his motion to fhe extent of two months, unless the witness returns sooner.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
