Arden and Epiphalet W. Close v. Randal Rice, Consider White, and Henry Townsend.</em>\n</parties>\n<summary data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-7\">THIS cause had been noticed by the plaintiffs for &gt; argument, at the last term, on a general demurrer filed by the defendants to the declaration; the court had, on the statement of the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel that the demurrer was merely for delay, overruled it, and granted a rule for judgment; the counsel pledged himself to open.the rule any day on an affidavit of arood cause of demurrer, or of merits. On service of the rule for judgment, the defendants gave a <em>cognovit, </em>on which the plaintiff entered up his judgment in the last vacation.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b322-8\">\n<em>Foot</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZH\">moved to set aside the judgment, contending that it could not be entered but in term.</p>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-9\">Some little variance of opinion existing on the bench, .respecting the practice on this point, it stood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>over till the last day of term, when the court thus decided :</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b323-4\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"ARJ\">By the 8th rule of <em>April </em>1796, judgment, after a default entered, may be entered <em>at any time </em>after 4 days in term have intervened. The rule -of <em>July </em>term, 1796, ordering all rules for judgment to be entered in term, and not in vacation, was abolished in <em>April </em>term, 1799, and restored the first rule. There is no good reason why 4 days in term should be given in this case to the defendants, any more than on a warrant of attorney to confess judgment. The defendants take nothing by their motion.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b323-5\">Spencer, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3YA\">dissented, on the ground that the practice had been different.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
