He contended, that until the tenant had complied with all the requisites of the <em>consent </em>rule, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>could not be considered as being so in court as that he could be known as a party to the suit, and that, therefore, no rule could-be taken against him.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b132-5\">\n<em>Qilackenbas</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A0G\">said he had proceeded as had always been the practice, at least at <em>Albany </em>and in the north\u2019 ern part of the State.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b132-6\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AhR\">The entry of the default in this manner was certainly irregular. No rule could be; entered against the <em>casual ejector </em>in a cause entitled against the <em>tenant. </em>The signing the consent rule, delivering a new declaration, putting in common bail, and filing a plea, are all simultaneous acts ; should the tenant, therefore, neglect to file his plea instanter, he is to be considered as not appearing in the suit, and then default is to be entered against the <em>casual ejector. </em>But the default against the <em>casual ejector </em>is taken under the first rule at the return of the writ, and not in consequence of any new rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">Default set aside.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
