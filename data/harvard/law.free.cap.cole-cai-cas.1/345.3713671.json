To this the plaintiffs replied ; but in their replication began, &lt;{ And the said <em>President and Directors of the </em>Man- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number><em>\u201c hattan Company </em>say,\u201d 8cc. without mentioning by attorney, and so went on negativing the whole plea, without having their replication signed by counsel, concluding to the country,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and adding the <em>similiter </em>on which they went to trial and took an inquest.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b356-6\">Woods,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A7i\">on an affidavit stating these facts, moved to set the inquest aside, for irregularity.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b356-7\"><em>Bogert, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ame\">The replication is in the usual form. It is a mere negation of the plea, without alleging any new fact, and therefore not a special pleading.

If it was, there is the name of counsel indorsed. Besides, had it been so, it ought not have been retained. Let the defendant take nothing by his motion, and pay the costs of resisting the application.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
