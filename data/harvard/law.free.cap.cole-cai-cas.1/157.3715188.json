Watson.</parties>\n<summary data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-5\">HOPKINS, for the defendant, moved for judgment as in case of nonsuit, for not going to trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b167-6\">Woods, contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAv5\">The cause was called on, but as there were other causes on the day calendar, one of which actually occupied the court the whole day, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney not being quite ready, thought he should be entitled to bring it on the next day, the day . calendar not being gone through; but found he was put down to the bottom of the calendar for the circuit. This, therefore, is a plain mistake of the rules of practice, which ought not to injure the plaintiff.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b167-7\">\n<em>Hopkins.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AxW\">The plaintiff clearly was not ready; therefore equally in fault, whether the rule was as he imagined, or not.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b167-8\">Radcliff, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYe\">Acting under that belief, he did not prepare himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\"><em>Hopkins </em>hoped the plaintiff would be ordered to stipulate and pay costs.</p>\n<author id=\"b167-10\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Aq-U\">The excuse is certainly not sufficient to exonerate from costs. If admitted in one case, it niust be in all; and however the good faith of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s conduct, and our belief of it, may deny the judgment moved for, to refuse costs would do away the effect of the rule. The plaintiff must stipulate.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
