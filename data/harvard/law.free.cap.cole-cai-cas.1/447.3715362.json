It is not alleged that the man who remained with the jury spoke adversely of the plaintiff, or used any means to lessen the amount of damages.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b457-6\"><em>Bogert, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ad6P\">On an inquisition the law is as jealous of the conduct of jurors as on a trial, 4 D. &amp; <em>E. </em>473.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The oath of the constable is the same, and shows the same conduct is required in one case as the other.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"Alc8\"><em> Stainton </em>v. Bedle.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b457-8\">Kent, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aia\">No one ought to mix with, a jury whilst deliberating. They should, to preserve the purity of justice, be kept by themselves, and on this point there is no difference between an inquiry before the sheriff, and a trial. The inquisition must, therefore, be set aside, each party paying his own costs. We order it thus, because neither party is to blame <em>i </em>and, were we to direct them to abide the event of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>suit, it would, in fact, as there has been a default, be saying the defendant is to pay them. This case, therefore, is to be distinguished from that of granting a new trial after verdict, for the misbehaviour of the jury. There, each of the litigants has a chance in his favour, and ordering the costs, on such occasion, to abide the event of the suit, does not, necessarily, impose them on either. Here the event is known.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
