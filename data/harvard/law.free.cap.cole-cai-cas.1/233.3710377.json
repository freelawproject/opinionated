In consequence of this arrangement, <em>Robert Lyle </em>embarked on board a vessel of <em>Clason's, </em>called the Hare, destined to Hamburgh, with a cargo of sugar and coffee. In an account made out by <em>Robert Lyle </em>against <em>Clason, </em>he charges his salary for six months, at 42/. <em>Ss. 4d. </em>ending in <em>March, </em>1794.

(mentioning the contract and circumstances, and letters detailed in the beginning of the case) that the net profits on the sales made by <em>Gardner </em>under the contract, were <em>\u00a34,800 </em>11 8 sterling; that the fifth, to which the deponent was entitled, in pursuance of the engagements mack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>with him, was \u00a3960 2 4, of which, by an original account of <em>Delard, Swan Co. </em>produced to the referees, it xvas proved Delard, <em>Swan </em>ts1 Cb. had paid their one-third, according to the agreement with <em>Gardner ;

that the deposition of <em>Gardner </em>(before shortly stated) was shown to the referees, and <em>Gardner </em>himself personally examined: that he <em>then </em>testified <em>he </em>was, <em>previously to his departure from America, </em>with the said cargo, per the ship called the <em>Joseph, made acquainted xvith the existence of the said contract, </em>by the defendant, <em>and with the terms or price therein stipulated;

that his motives for inquiring from <em>Delard </em>is\u2019 <em>Co. </em>respecting the reliance to be placed on punctual payment, and also for alleging this to be done at the desire of the defendant, was to hold out the idea of future shipments, and <em>so </em>insure the payment of what had been delivered, but not settled for; that it was made to appear without any denial, that the defendant had only received his two-thirds of the profit on the contract aforesaid; that the report had, notwithstanding, been made in favour of the defendant, under an idea that <em>Gardner </em>had no authority to bind <em>Clason </em>to the payment of any thing to the deponent; and that <em>Clason </em>had altered the deposition of <em>Gardner, </em>after it was made, and before presented to the referees, without communicating the alteration to them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b253-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>On the 6th of <em>October, </em>1802, <em>Clason </em>made an affidavit to vacate the report in favour of the <em>Lyles, </em>in which he set forth the instituting the two suits ;

that the matters contained in the affidavit, went to the merits of the case, respecting which, on account of sickness in the deponent\u2019s family, and absence from <em>New-York, </em>the deponent could not make any explanations to his counsel; that he acquiesced in the report against himself, from a conviction nothing could be obtained from <em>Lyle, </em>and, therefore, no report could operate more favourably to the interest of the defendant ; that the known inability of <em>Lyle </em>to pay* was one reason why the referees were less particular in examining the deponent\u2019s claims against him, than they otherwise would have been, deeming it unimportant ; that the two reports were made, and intended by the referees <em>as set-offs the one against the otherf </em>and to this end, they instructed counsel to prepare them accordingly ; that, among other charges against <em>Lyle, </em>the deponent gave in evidence, an account rendered by <em>Lyle, </em>in which he acknowledged having in his hands a balance of 244,246 livres in assignats,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>amounting, at the then rate of exchange, to 4,477 dollars, and that assignats were then never kept on hand, but always converted into property, to avoid depreciation; that since the account so rendered, the de| anent never had any further money or mercantile transactions with the <em>Lyles, </em>and that <em>Lyle n\u00fa</em>ther accounted for, nor made any set-off against the said assignats, but the same were totally unaccounted for; that the deponent, as soon as the sickness of his family permitted, consulted respecting measures to be taken about opposing the motion, to set aside the report in his favour, but there was not time enough left in the term to do it; that but for the application of <em>Lyle </em>to set aside the report in favour of the defendant, he should never have applied to set aside that in favour of <em>Lyle, </em>for the insolvency of <em>Lyle </em>made it of no consequence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-5\">The notice of motion with which this affidavit was accompanied, was repeated on the 7th of January\u25a0\u00ab 1803.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-6\">To oppose this, <em>Robert Lyle </em>made, on the 14th of <em>January, </em>1803, an affidavit, stating, that he, and his brother <em>John, </em>the other defendant, acted, in the )rear 1795, as agents for Clason, in which capacity they had received various large sums of money, the whole of which had been faithfully accounted for; that the suit against <em>Clason </em>was for money due individually to the defendant, on another concern, and for damages for libellous letters and slanders published against him by <em>Clason ; </em>that he and his brother were arrested, as before mentioned, and the two causes referred; that in the suit against the deponent and his brother, (the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>declaration on which was for goods sold with the \u00b0 usual money counts only) <em>Clason </em>produced an account with charges, against the deponent and his brother, for breach of orders and neglect of duty, to a very .large amount; that on asking for some evidence, by which it might appear, those charges were included in the submission, the agreement of the 10th <em>March, </em>1802, was produced; that the same was intended merely to extend the powers of the referees to claims of the nature of those mentioned in, and warranted by, the declarations to which the deponent had confined himself; that his, and his brother\u2019s faithful agency, and due accounting for all sums of money, were fully proved ; that in the cross:suit against the deponent and his brother, the referees made their report on a conviction nothing was due to <em>Clason, </em>and not from, any regard to the deponent\u2019s insolvency or circumstances, as he was, by the referees themselves, personally informed; that the deponent proved, to the satisfaction of the referees, that the value of the \" assignats mentioned in <em>Clason\u2019s </em>affidavit, was, <em>at the time specified, </em>only /278 2 9, and <em>not </em>84,477 ; that they were <em>not </em>then usually converted into property, but held by many persons in hopes of their rising, and that the said assignats <em>were not only not made use of by the deponent, or kept in his hands, </em>but had, from the time of their first reception, been paid over by him to the correspondents of Clason, Lubbert, Freres &amp; Elis, of Bordeaux, BY WHOM THEY WERE CONVERTED INTO SPECIE, FOR THE USE OF ClASON, AND ACCOUNTED for with Gardner, when acting as Clason\u2019s agent ; that, so far from the acquiescence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number><em>Clason </em>in the report against him, for the reasons he had assigned, -he had, after it was made, purchased protested bills, on which the deponent\u2019s name was as an indorsor, and had commenced suits against the deponent upon them, in order, as he believed, to create a set-off against the verdict the deponent might ultimately obtain.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b256-6\">After some struggle by <em>Hamilton, </em>on the part of <em>Lyle, </em>to discriminate the two suits, the court was pleased to order the arguments to set aside the several reports to come on together.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b256-7\"><em>Hamilton, </em>for <em>Lyle,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AH0\">after stating the circumstances, and commenting on them, and the affidavits of <em>Clason </em>and <em>Gardner, </em>observed, that it was very singular <em>Gardner, </em>without any knowledge of the contract of <em>Delard, Swan &amp; Co. </em>with the <em>French </em>republic, or of <em>Lyle\u2019s </em>intent, should deliver exactly under that contract, and write a letter acknowledging the very interest <em>Lyle </em>claimed under it, and that <em>Clason </em>should pay him what he was thus entitled to. <em>Gardner, </em>without knowing the contract, goes further; he asks <em>Delard Co. </em>if the <em>French </em>government will be punctual in paying, and <em>this,, </em>he adds, <em>Clason </em>desired him to inquire about. <em>Clason </em>too, ratifies the engagement of <em>Delard Co. </em>and <em>Gardner, </em>with Lyle, by adjusting the account with <em>Delard </em>&amp;? <em>Co. </em>and receiving under that account the two-thirds, by the very express terms of it, charged with the payment of the two-thirds of <em>Lyle\u2019s </em>fifth. To argue on the assertions of <em>Gardner, </em>would be really superfluous. The referees must have thought <em>Gardner </em>had no right to bind <em>Clason. </em>This idea is clearly repugnant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>vo every principle of law. He that entrusts another with general powers, must abide the result of his agent\u2019s conduct. Therefore, though the report in favour of <em>Lyle, </em>may and ought to stand, that in favour of <em>Clcison </em>ought to be set aside.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b257-3\"><em>Hopkins </em>and <em>Troup, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AW-N\">In making the reports in these causes, the referees were actuated bv a wish to make the parties even, and leave them just as they were found. For this purpose, the report in our cause, was intended as a set-off to the other, and to effect this object, counsel were desired to frame the reports in such a manner as might best obtain the desired end. The various facts appear in the affidavits before the court; but it is material to state, that The party who first made the application to disturb these reports, has not presented any original agreement, on which his suit is founded. <em>Delard, Sxvan </em>6? <em>Co. </em>made a contract with the <em>French </em>government, for a certain quantity of pot and pearl-ashes : as these articles enter into the composition of gunpowder, it was necessary to have a neutral name in the business. It is difficult to say, what ought to be the true relative compensation for the protection a neutral character v-md afford ; but it is to be observed, that <em>Delard </em>Es? <em>Co. </em>were the real contractors; <em>Lyle </em>a mere <em>nominis umbra: </em>for this, however, he says he is to have one full fifih, one-third of it to be paid by <em>De \u25a0lard, Sxvan </em>\u00a3s? <em>Co. </em>the other two-thirds b) <em>Clason.\u2014 </em>These terms, it is alleged, were stipulated by a formal contr yet this contract, which <em>Lyle </em>must have had, is never produced; on the contrary, inste ad of relying upon he rests on a letter received, from <em>Gardner. Li </em>addition to the inference to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>drawn from this fact, it appears, that at the very time when this pretended contract was made, <em>Lyle </em>was in <em>Europe, </em>under an annual allowance from <em>Clason, </em>and actually his salaried agent, receiving wages for every service performed. A doubt has been entertained, how far the court can, under the existing circumstances, with propriety set aside the report in favour of <em>Clason: </em>but, surely, whenever they clearly perceive that the referees have proceeded on a mistake, either of law or fact, this tribunal will always interfere. If the court will set aside an award, they will, on the same principles, vacate a report; and, whatever argument will induce them to do it in one of the now causes, will have equal force in the other ; for if the referees have been mistaken in their endeavours to create mutual set-offs, both reports will be set aside ; or, on the other hand, if they have acted properly, both will be confirmed; for the court will not, unnecessarily, do away what the referees have done. In making their detertnination, they considered that the power to sell, and the power to give away profits, were two things : to this latter, it cannot be contended, that the authority of an agent or a factor can extend. There is no question about an agent\u2019s right over the property passed to him, but he cannot enter into collateral engagements : he. may sell and warrant a title ; but not give away the property. If he may, in 'any degree, do this, he may go on indefinitely, and make away with the whole. He may go on making contracts ruinous to his employer, and contrary to the purposes of his delegation. Under a power to sell, if he should be allowed even to exchange, can he be authorised to pay a difference ? The boundary of his power to bind, must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>be connected with that of his authority to sell; it must be confined to that, and will not warrant him to give away profits ; t\u00f3 pay another sum of money on another account than that of the sale. The point turns on whether <em>Gardner </em>had a competent authority to bind <em>Clason, </em>to pay two-thirds of a fifth of the profits. It was derived from the letter of instructions. That letter delegates only a general power. From the exercise of such a power, the claim cannot be supposed. That a factor may sell by a broker, and give a commission, if customary, is not contested; but it is contested, that a factor or agent, having only a. general authority to sell, can give away a substantive part of the merchandize when it was sold ; that he can do so, there is not a <em>dictum </em>in the books. It would be, in fact, to enable him to dispose of a portion of the property he is entrusted to vend. It would give rise to the most serious consequences; a frau - dulent\"collusion would completely destroy the interests of the principal, by enabling to constitute a sale regular in its form,, the precise mode of which, could not be easily foreseen. The intention of <em>Clason\u2019s </em>agent must be taken into \"consideration, and the motives on which he proceeded, permitted to explain how he meant to bind his principal. <em>Gardner </em>never knew what the gratification to be paid <em>Lyle </em>actually Was. The inducement he had to consent to any, was, that he deemed the amount immaterial; for as <em>Lyle </em>was in the service of <em>Clason, </em>at a fixed salary, <em>Gard ner </em>naturally concluded all <em>Lyle\u2019s </em>labour would accrue to <em>Clason. </em>On the principles of natural justice, the demand cannot be substantiated. He lends his name to <em>Delard, </em>it being necessary to make use of <em>n </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>neuter. The <em>douceur </em>must certainly be according to the situation of the party. The letter to <em>Clason, </em>containing the terms of the contract, does not state the sum to be- paid. It is obvious, therefore, that this was never intended; It was considered as too trifling to specify.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b260-6\"><em>Gardner </em>knew,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APL\">when he left <em>America, </em>that <em>Lyle </em>was a salaried agent. This is not a case of good faith between an agent, and a person totally a stranger, and, therefore, the principal called on to pay ; but we are called upon, on the strength of a little memorandum touched into the foot of an account. It is not to be forgotten that the referees were merchants, and well knew the course of trade and business, when the transactions took place, as well as the rights of an agent at a fixed annual allowance. The claim too, goes by the express name of a gratification; and who ever heard of a partnership share (which this in fact is)- ever being known by the appellation of a gratifica- \u25a0 tian <em>t </em>When was 600/. sterling ever considered as a gratification for a person at a salary of 150/. per annum, <em>New; York </em>currency ? The referees might, therefore, have justly ejected the claim. No inference can be drawn from <em>Gardner's </em>letter, speaking of a contract: he might have sailed on another. But it was not the mere matter of the contract that was referred ; subsequent matters were added, not included in the two causes this was by agreement of the parties, and how can the court say the full claim on the contract has hot been allowed, when it might have been counterbalanced by damages and misconduct in the matter of the <em>Hare ? </em>This, therefore, being an application to the equitable jurisdiction of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>\u00a1court, they will so mould and blend the two causes as will best answer the ends of justice; and, if in the suit by <em>Lylet </em>the report be set aside, the court will do it on terms, and vacate the report hi that against him.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b261-7\">\n<em>Clason</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3A\">declares be never heard what <em>Lyle's </em>compensation was, till after the suit was brought. But can the court say, this particular claim ought not to be disallowed ? After the rules to refer, other matters were added and blended ; all contracts, \u201c <em>express or </em>impliedwere submitted. It cannot be said, there were not other claims to extinguish this demand of two-thirds of the fifth. It might have been admitted, and liquidated by a counter claim. Referees and arbitrators may so consider the subject matter before them, as will best answer the ends of justice : they may take into view matters both of law and of fact; perform the offices of judges and jurors, and are entitled to found their decision either on law, or principles of general equity. The whole of this was delegated to them, and they have determined, on a view of all matters in controversy blended together in one mass, all the objects in these two causes, even in that against both the Lyles, as consolidated before them , Whether they have been perfectly accurate in thus beholding them, is immaterial, if they did so consider them, have acted under that idea, and have attained the real ends of justice, though, perhaps, by extraordinary means. It was evidently the wish of the parties to set all controversies between them fully at rest, and this has been accomplished. The court, therefore, will never say, that one report shall be confirmed, arid the other set aside. The consideration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>of the report in the suit <em>by </em>Clason5 might have influenced in the making up <em>that, </em>in the action against him. That it did so, is evident, because the reports were intended as mutual set-offs. Whether this could be supported on strict legal reasoning, had been doubted: but the spirit of the case in 8 <em>D. </em>&amp; <em>E. </em>might, perhaps, fully warrant the conduct of the referees. It may be a question, also, how far <em>Gardner </em>could give such an interest, as might, perhaps, create a partnership between <em>Lyle </em>and <em>Clason.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b262-5\"><em>Harison </em>and <em>Hamilton, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aqc\">If, in cases of full and fair investigation before juries, this court will interpose, when a verdict has been rendered on an evident mistake of the law, they certainly will do so in the case of a report made by referees, however appointed. That this reasoning applies to the suit of <em>Lyle </em>v. <em>Clason </em>is manifest, and it will, therefore, be sent for further examination. With respect to the\" contract made between <em>Lyle, </em>and Gardner, the agent of <em>Clason, </em>it is for the court to determine whether it be obligatory or not. The affidavits on the part qf <em>Clason, </em>do not state that he was ignorant of the contract with the <em>French </em>government, but of the claim of <em>Lyle. </em>It appears from <em>Lyle's </em>deposition, and is not controverted, that in <em>March, </em>1794, letters were written by <em>Lyle </em>and <em>Swan, </em>informing <em>Clason </em>of the contract; of <em>Lyle's </em>right, and that he <em>(Clason) </em>might share, if he thought proper. The letters were produced, and that they were received, <em>Clason's </em>conscience would not let him negative. There was a stipulation to compensate, with a share of . the actual profits, for the use of the neutral name of <em>Lyle ; </em>when these profits were ascertained, the right of <em>Lyle </em>at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>iached. There is, to be sure, no express recognition by <em>Clason </em>of the contract, but in the <em>September </em>following the date of <em>Lyle\u2019s </em>letter, <em>Gardner </em>arrives in <em>France </em>with exactly such a cargo as the contract demanded. Are there not circumstances enough, to think he went there for the purpose of acting under it ? But even allowing there are not, does not the letter of instructions substitute <em>Gardner </em>as owner of the property he carried, and invest him with all <em>Clason\u2019s </em>power over it ? He is to exercise his judgment; do his best; sell for <em>French </em>brandy; sell to the <em>French </em>government, &amp;c. he had, therefore, a right to make any contract under the words of the letter. He arrives in <em>France </em>with a power to dispose; he finds Delardpos- . sessed of a contract, in the name <em>o\u00ed Lyle, </em>under which, the power to dispose may be exercised with great advantage. He does exercise it, receives the emolument, settles with <em>Delard </em>&amp;? <em>Co. </em>but refuses to do so with us. The inquiry then is, had <em>Gardner </em>a power, and has he exercised it ? That he had and has, no doubt can be entertained ; and as little, that it was under our contract; for the affidavit subsequently made by <em>Gardner, </em>does not deny, but admits the fact. He says, however, that he knew not what the gratification was: this is extraordinary: he seems to have forgotten his own letter after \u00e1 very few months; and though that does not specify the exact sum, the two-thirds for which he mentions <em>Clason </em>is to settle, it affords an internal evidence that he did know it, much stronger than his own assertion to the contrary. <em>Gardner\u2019s </em>letter of the 7th <em>December, </em>1794, particularizes two-thirds, and gives an account of the sales. Allowing, however, <em>Gardner </em>not to be apprised of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>exact sum,-as <em>Lyle\u2019s </em>right was ascertained and perfected under the contract to which <em>Gardner </em>consented, acceding to the payment of two-thirds by Clason, it follows <em>Clason </em>must be bound. The rule is, that he who places confidence, shall suffer by the abuse of that confidence; <em>Clason, </em>therefore, and not <em>Lyle, </em>is to be the loser by <em>Gardner\u2019s </em>actions. It is extraordinary that <em>Clason </em>should have remained ignorant of the amount of <em>Lyle\u2019s </em>claim, four years after <em>Gardner\u2019s </em>return and rendering an account of his transactions. If <em>Gardner </em>then, having an authority to bind <em>Clason, </em>did so, and <em>Clason </em>has received the benefit of that trans- \u2022 action, <em>Lyle\u2019s </em>right is perfect. The assertion of his being a salaried agent, does not affect the claim. His time of service expired in <em>September. </em>Beyond that, <em>Clason </em>himself, allows no salary, and <em>Gardner\u2019s </em>letter i s dated in <em>December. Gardner </em>himself acknowledges <em>Lyle\u2019s </em>right, by telling <em>Delard </em>to pay one-third ofit. Had it been otherwise, <em>Gardner </em>would have said, you are not to pay the third of the fifth to <em>Lyle, </em>but to Clason, for whos\u00e9 benefit <em>Lyle </em>is acting. There is a further proof in the letter to <em>Lyle. Gardner </em>there says, \u201c <em>Mr. Clason is to settle with you </em>for.two- , \u201c thirds.\u201d Here then is a clear established right in <em>Lyle </em>to receive from <em>Clason, </em>two-thirds of the fifth of the whole profits. If so, the arbitrators have been guilty of a mistake, in point of law, in considering <em>Gardner </em>unauthorised to bind <em>Clason, </em>and this the court will assuredly set right. There is also another \u25a0 ground on which they have clearly erred; for if they have blended the reports in the two causes, or made one enter into the composition of the other, they arc manifestly wrong. There is no evidence of any thing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>against <em>Lyle\u2019s </em>right, but the demands in the cause against him and his brother. Though both causes were referred, the referees have not any right to blend matter extraneous to the respective suit. <em>Robert Lyle\u2019s </em>action is for his own separate account. That of <em>Clason </em>against <em>Robert </em>and <em>John Ijyle, </em>is against the partnership, and the one cannot be set off against the other, being in different rights. This is very wide from the case of a surviving partner, where the rights and duties centre in one person. The agreement does not alter this, for it was merely to allow of such matters as were admissible against the same parties, though not specifically proceeded for; to settle all disputes for which actions might be instituted against the respective defendants; to allow of damages arising from breach of contracts, express or implied, by the <em>Ijyles, </em>to be settled under the reference of the suit against them, in which counts were used not applicable to actions of damages, but never to permit one suit to be set off against the other, or make <em>Robert Lyle </em>give up the benefit of his claim against Clason. They did not even take it into consideration, as they considered it not due; the report, therefore, in favour of <em>Robert </em>and <em>John Lyle, </em>may well be suffered to remain, and that in favour of <em>Clason </em>be set aside; for the amount of the profits claimed from him not being taken into consideration in the accounts by the referees, now remain unsettled. If, therefore, without including this demand, <em>Clason </em>has not any demand against <em>Robert </em>and <em>John Lyle, </em>the report does not prevent <em>Robert </em>from having a demand against <em>Clason. </em>Besides, it is evident the contract must have been known to <em>Clason </em>and <em>Gardner, </em>by the latter\u2019s express<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>ing an intention of returning with the residue. The mentioning it in the letter of instructions, was to avoid the risk of capture and condemnation; fates that were sure to attend a cargo of a contraband nature, going under an avowed contract with the <em>French </em>government. The receipt by <em>Clason, </em>of the proceeds of the cargo, is a ratification of every contract under which it was made, and no disavowal of <em>Gardner's </em>authority can be permitted. <em>Clason </em>enjoys the benefit, and if any charges do accompany the agreement, it is to be taken <em>cum onere. </em>' The allowance of the account by <em>Delard, Swan, </em>&amp;? <em>Co. </em>is conclusive on the terms.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b266-6\">Lewis, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALl\">delivered the judgment of the court. These actions were referred under rules of court to three referees, who have reported in each against the respective plaintiffs, declaring nothing due on either side. Motions are now made to set aside the several awards.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">In the first cause, in which <em>Lyle </em>is plaintiff, the application is founded on a presumption that the referees have been mistaken in point of law. That they have either rejected a contract entered into by the defendant\u2019s ship-master and consignee, as not obligatory on his principal, or have set off the balances found for the plaintiffs, in the respective causes against each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">To this the defendant answers, that he was not bound by the engagement of his ship-master, who was also his consignee, and that if the referees have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>made such off-set, they were justified on principles of \u2019aw, and by an agreement entered into between the iespective attornies.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">As far as the facts can be collected from affidavits and documents furnished the court, they are these : That the <em>Lyles </em>being engaged in business in France, were charged with some commercial concerns of <em>Cla</em>son, on which he claims a balance of account, and on which they deny any thing to be due. That <em>Robert Lyle, </em>while in France, was employed by the house of <em>Delard, Swan </em>Ss? <em>Co. </em>there established in business to negotiate a contract, for the supply of certain quantities of pot and pearl-ashes to the <em>French </em>government, which he effected, and for which they were to allow him one-fifth of the profits. That the com-pony, as well as <em>Robert </em>Lyle, wrote to Mr. <em>Clason </em>in March, 1794, acquainting him with their contract, and proposing to him to make shipments thereon. That in <em>September, </em>a vessel called the Joseph, belonging to the plaintiff, arrived in <em>France </em>loaded with ashes, consigned to <em>Gideon Gardner, </em>the master, who had general instructions to sell to the government, or to individuals, at his election. That <em>Gardner, </em>after making inquiries as to the government\u2019s punctuality, agrees with <em>Delard, Swan </em>&amp;? <em>Co. </em>to turn in his cargo under their contract, which is accordingly done, and neats a profit of \u00a36,800 11 8 sterling; whereof <em>Clason </em>received two-thirds in consideration of his having made the advances, and the house of <em>Delard, Swan </em>&amp;? <em>Co. </em>one-third. On the adjustment of this account, it appears that the company and <em>Clason </em>were to account to <em>Robert Lyle </em>for his one-fifth, according <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>to the proportions of profits by them respectively received.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">Captain <em>Gardner\u2019s </em>powers being discretionary, he was perfectly justifiable in making the disposition he did of the cargo entrusted to him, and even if he was not, it does not appear that Mr. <em>Clason </em>ever denied that transaction his sanction, but that on the contrary, he has received by remittances to <em>Bird, Savage Bird, </em>of <em>London, </em>the proceeds of the cargo, including his proportion of the profits. Under these circumstances, there can be no doubt that Captain <em>Gardner, </em>having turned in his cargo under the contract, bound Mr. <em>Clason </em>to the fulfilment of the terms of that eon-tract; and the latter, having received the full two-thirds of the profits of the adventure, under the stipulation made by his agent, that he should account to <em>Lyle </em>for two-thirds of his <em>douceur, </em>or whatever else it may be called, (for names will not alter the essential quality of the thing) he is bound to perform such stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">If, therefore, the referees have not admitted this claim, they have erred as to the law, and the award ought to be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"AmI\">If, on the contrary, they have admitted it, then they must have allowed a balance found due to <em>Clason </em>in the other suit, as a set-off against it. This also is incorrect; for the suits are not between the same parties, and the partnership funds should have been first appropriated to the discharge of the partnership debts. The agreement between the attornies, does mot authorise such set-off. Its only object, is the ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>mission of certain demands which would not fall within any of the counts in the respective declarations, In order to avoid further litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">The award, therefore, in each suit, ought, in my opinion, to be set aside. The one against Clason, for the reasons above mentioned, and the one in which he is plaintiff, because there is a probability that the referees found a balance there due to him, which he would otherwise lose the benefit of. The judgment of the court is, that both awards be set aside,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
