Those interested in a point, contribute their <em>quotas </em>towards the defence. No more is done here. But why not take the jury from <em>Queen\u2019s </em>or any other county on <em>Long-Island ?</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b467-7\">ICe nt, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQ8\">This is a cause in which the right of fishery will come in question. Where the counties are so small as these mentioned, an impartial trial cannot be had, on a claim of a general nature. <em>New-York </em>is as near as any other, and where a right of fishery, or any similar claim is to be litigated, it is, in my <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>opinion, sufficient to take the matter from a <em>Long-Island </em>j ury. The expense is at the door of the party who applies, and the contribution to support the suit, shows strongly the disposition Of the county.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
