The suit below was <em>trespass de bonis asportatis </em>against a justice of the peace, a constable, and a plaintiff, in a suit before the justice under the 10/. act, for taking the goods of the defendant, in an execution on a judgment rendered by the justice. The defendants all joined in a plea of not guilty.\u2014 The evidence adduced was, that the justice lived in a tavern where he officiated as the tavernkeeper, made out the bills, and received payment for them, hut that the justice did his business.in a small out-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>room, and the licence for the house was taken out in the name of the justice\u2019s son. This, however, it appeared from the Justice\u2019s own declarations, was done to av0^ t^e operation of the 20th section of the act.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> \u2014On this, the defendant below demurred to the evidence.

If so, as they all joined in the same plea, they are all equally responsible.
