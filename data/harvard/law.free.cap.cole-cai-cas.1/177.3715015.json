This was mentioned to the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney, who would not say whether he would consent to the amendments or not. The papers from whence they were to be drawn, and the case perfected, were in the hands of the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney, in <em>Netv-York ; </em>so, that the case could not be completed in <em>Albany. </em>No application was made to a judge to correct the amendments. Nor had cases been delivered.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b188-5\"><em>Hopkins </em>now moved,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AD-\">to set aside the \u2019original order to stay proceedings, that a case might be made, and for leave to enter up judgment.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ATrb\"><em>Hiker </em>resisted the application,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Acy\">because the case was imperfect, and the papers from whence only it could be completed, were in the hands of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b188-7\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AAA\">We must deny the motion ; because, in the first place, there were cross verdicts to nearly the same amounts. Secondly, the cases were never perfected, and it did not appear to be exclusively the fault of either. Thirdly, the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney not having denied the omission of certain material facts, the court Would presume they had appear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>ed on the trial, and ought to be a part of the case.\u2014\u00bb \u2019 \u00b0 r Let the case be perfected within thirty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\"><em>Hopkins </em>prayed costs, insisting he had been regular.</p>\n<author id=\"b189-7\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AR4\">We consider, that the plaintiffs were irregular, in not answering when applied to, whether they would receive amendments or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">N. B. It was said, by the court, that where a defendant, after verdict, makes a case, and notices for argument, if he does not appear at the time when called, judgment shall go: but when the plaintiff notices a case, made on the part of the defendant, and the plaintiff is not ready, it shall go down.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
