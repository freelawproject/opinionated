This is fatal to their motian. Besides, it is sufficient if one of the attornies appearing on the writ, continue to indorse and sign1 the proceedings. It must be presumed, the defendants were not misled, but knew they were the parties meant by the original suit. As to the second objection, there is no force in it. The settled practice is to allow of notice of inquiry being given at any time after default, and it is enough if the interlocutory judgment be entered at any day before execution of the writ of inquiry.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"AS4\">Livingston, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXVa\">I concur in the decision of the court on the question in this case. But I do not say, if two persons be attornies on the writ, one may go on with the proceedings in his name singly. Were one to die, then the right to carry on the suit would survive. On the points now before us, I consider the appointment of Mr. <em>Woodworth </em>to the place of Attorney-General, osa species of civil death. Therefore, on the present occasion I agree with the opinions of my brethren. The defendants can take nothing by their motion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
