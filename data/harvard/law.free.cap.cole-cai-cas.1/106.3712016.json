He cited 2 <em>Burr, </em>962. 1 <em>Wils. </em>147.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b117-6\"><em>Evertson </em>insisted,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9U\">that nothing could be considered as the commencement of a suit, but the filing of the bill: and that if the plaintiff shows a cause of action before exhibiting the bill, it is sufficient. He relied upon <em>Cowp. </em>454. 7 <em>Durn. </em>&amp; <em>East, </em>4.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b117-7\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"A5t\">If an arrest be made before the debt is due, the defendant should apply in the first instance to the court, or to a judge at his chambers, and not put in bail and plead. Here the defendant having omitted to make such application, and having filed bail and pleaded in chief, is too late.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
