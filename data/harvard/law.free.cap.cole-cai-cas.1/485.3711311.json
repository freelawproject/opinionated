The defendant not having: nominated any new attorney, the plaintiff gave notice of trial in the manner above mentioned, and, at the last <em>Albany </em>circuit, took an inquest by default, upon which judgment had been entered and execution sued out.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b496-6\">Williams,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqHy\">on the above facts, now moved to set them aside, contending that the notice to appoint a new attorney, ought to have been by a rule of court ordering it to be done.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b496-7\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Afq2\">In the case of <em>Bennet </em>ads. <em>Vielie, July </em>term, 1802, it was decided, that the party must be warned or he is not bound to take notice of the proceedings, and in <em>Harvey </em>ads. <em>Hildrith, January </em>term, 1803, we ruled that the defendant must have personal notice, or such as the court would deem tantamount. Our statute, like that of <em>Hen. </em>IV. requires a warning, and the personal service here, was a sufficient one, without any rule of court. The defendant was grossly in default, as nine months elapsed before the plaintiff went on. We think 30 days a sufficient and reasonable notice in these cases. You can, therefore, take nothing by your motion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
