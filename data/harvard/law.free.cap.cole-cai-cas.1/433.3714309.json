The order to stay proceedings was applied for, and evinces, that the joinder was a mere matter of precaution, not a reliance on, or affirmance of the correctness of the proceedings. The amendment, therefore, must be allowed, on payment of the costs of the assignment of errors, and those of resisting this application.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
