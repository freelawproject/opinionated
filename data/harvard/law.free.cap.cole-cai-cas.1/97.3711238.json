Plea in abatement, a former suit by plaintiff <em>v. </em>defendants, to which they had put in a plea in abatement that <em>Francis Childs </em>was a partner and not named, which suit was pending at the commencement of the present suit, and is so still; replication <em>nul tiel record, </em>and issue.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b107-7\"><em>Harison </em>for the plaintiff</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AeE\">stated the facts : that on the 13th of December, 1799, a discontinuance was entered in the first cause after receiving the plea in abatement therein ; that the present suit was commenced before <em>October </em>term, and the declaration was filed <em>December </em>28th ; that the plea in abatement was received <em>December </em>31st; that a <em>nil capiat per breve </em>in the former was filed <em>January </em>13th, 1800: replication now at issue was filed <em>January </em>16th,</p>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b108-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>The principal question he stated to be, whether the discontinuance of a former suit must be entered <em>before </em>new suit commenced, or may be entered any time before replication of <em>nul tiel record </em>filed ? He contended that the discontinuance being matter of right, may be entered at any time before replication. To this point he cited 1 <em>Cromp. </em>188. Barnes, 257. 1 <em>Leon. </em>105. <em>Impey's B. R. </em>169. 1 <em>Sellon, </em>304.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b108-5\"><em>Burr </em>for the defendants</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Az7\">insisted that a plaintiff cannot <em>after plea </em>discontinue without leave.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b108-6\"><em>Harison </em>declared the proposition erroneous,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASe\">for no leave is necessary in any case where there is ho room for the court to impose terms or conditions on the defendant, And such is the case here.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b108-7\"><em>April </em>term, 1800. Lewis and Kent, J. considered the <em>nil capiat per breve </em>when entered, to have had <em>relation </em>back to 13th of <em>Decemb\u00e9r, </em>when the discon-, tinuance was entered, and therefore was done before plea pleaded, and so within the cases in 1 <em>Ld. Raymond, </em>274. and 2 <em>id. </em>1014. The other judges thought this not material, if the same was entered before replication, relying upon the case cited from <em>Barnes. </em>All agreed that discontinuance might be entered any time before plea pleaded in the second suit, and without leave or costs. <em>Barnes, </em>257. <em>Sellon, </em>304. <em>Impey's B.
