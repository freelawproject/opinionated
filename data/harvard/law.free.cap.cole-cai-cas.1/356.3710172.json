He in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>sisted also, that as notice of trial for the last circuit . . was accepted, the defendant had waived his right to the former costs. If the court should be against him on these points he hoped they would grant an attachment against Phelps, whose contempt in disobeying the subpoena, was the cause of not proceeding to trial.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b367-7\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Aeg\">The absence of the plaintiff\u2019s witness is sufficient to induce us to refuse the application for a nonsuit, and even to excuse him from stipulating ; but as he is in contempt for not paying the costs formerly ordered, let him pay those of the last circuit within twenty days after due demand; in default thereof, the defendant to be at liberty to enter up judgment as in case of nonsuit. As to those costs, which on the former occasion were allowed, we do not take them into consideration, the defendant having it in his power to enforce them by attachment; and with respect to the attachment prayed for by the plaintiff, it is not usual to grant one in the first instance, unless some wilful disobedience to the authority of the court is made to appear; the plaintiff, therefore, can have only a rule to show cause.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
