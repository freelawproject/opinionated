J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYS\">The rule to plead was irregularly entered; because, until the writ be returned, bail filed, or an appearance entered, there is no basis for a proceeding, and the court has no cognizance of the cause, so as to authorise pleadings. With respect to their being no merits, we never regard that, when the application is for irregularity.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
