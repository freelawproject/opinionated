In <em>February, </em>1803, the declarations were filed, to which payment was pleaded, with notices subjoined of giving the discharge, &amp;c. in evidence ; but as, on procuring a copy of the proceedings under the insolvent law, the discharge itself could not be found, the attorney of the defendant wrote to him in the <em>August </em>following, communicating this circumstance, and requesting him to make inquiry after it. On the cause being noticed for trial on the 12th of <em>December </em>in that year, the defendant\u2019s attorney again wrote to him, repeating the contents of his former letter; and urging him to attend personally, that measures might be taken to procure the discharge, or substantiate by paroi evidence its former existence and loss. The first of these letters did not reach the defendant till the middle of <em>September, </em>the. latter not till the 29th of <em>November, </em>then next. To each of these the defendant replied, stating that in consequence of a fractured leg, he was utterly unable to travel, and desiring the trial to be postponed till the <em>February </em>following, as, by that time, he hoped to be able to procure the discharge, which had been given to Mr. <em>Du Boys, </em>the then sheriff of <em>Dutchess, </em>to warrant his release from confinement. The first of these answers never came to hand, and the latter which was received bore date on the 18th of <em>December; </em>but though the discharge itself was not found, the attorney employed for the insolvent, who was also assignee of his estate, swore that the discharge had been . obtained on a due and full adherence to the requisites of the act, and that he was then petitioning congress for the lands to which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>the defendant was entitled, as an officer in the revoe lutionary army, in consequence of their having passed by the assignment of the insolvent\u2019s estate. None of these circumstances, however, appeared when the inquests were taken ; for the counsel of the defendant, when the causes were called on, refused to answer the court whether there was any defence, thinking that he was not bound to do so, and in consequence of this silence the inquests were taken. *</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b465-6\"><em>Per </em>Curiam,</author>\n<p id=\"Aeq\">delivered by Spencer, J. The inquest is regular. Counsel, if present, ought to answer whether he believes there is a defence. The time at which a trial shall come on, is not the privilege of a defendant, but is adopted from a regard to the seniority of issues. Infinite delay would take place in cases where no dispute exists, if the counsel were to be mute when required to state whether there be a defence. It appears, however, that the defendant has been discharged under an insolvent act, and by accident has not been able to produce his discharge to his attorney. But though the court will not decide in this way, whether paroi evidence might or might not be given of its loss and contents, yet they will regard the peculiar situation of parties. In this case the defendant lives remote, and was from that circumstance, and infirmity, prevented from attending to these suits at an earlier period. The moral obligation, under which the defendant is supposed to labour of paying his debts, is not to operate with the court, unless a new liability has been incurred. From the misconception of counsel, the remote distance of the defendant, his infirmities, and his having a m\u00e9rito<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>rious defence, the court grant the application upon payment of costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
