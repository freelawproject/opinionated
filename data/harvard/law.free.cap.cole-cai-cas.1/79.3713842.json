The merits of any judgments rendered in another state cannot, under the act of Congress, be examined here, <em>JVul tiel record </em>is the only plea that is admissible. And as to the notice of the intended application for a commission, it ought not to operate to procure the defendant a delay, for it was his neglect that lie had not applied last term.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b89-7\"><em>Burr, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A12\">Whether any testimony involving merits can be admitted under any plea, or whether the plea of <em>nil debet </em>is proper in this action, are points not to be tried in this way. The application for a commission is in time, according to Rule IX. of <em>April, </em>1796.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b90-5\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Ael\">Issue not having been joined till after the election was made in vacation, the defendant is in time <em>by </em>the Rule of <em>April, </em>1796. On the other point, we are of opinion that the propriety of the plea is not examinable, upon this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Let the verdict be set aside, and a commission issue : the costs to abide the event of the suit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
