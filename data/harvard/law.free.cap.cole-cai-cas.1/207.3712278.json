That nothing would b\u00e9 lost by the plaintiff, as a trial might be had at the circ\u00fait in <em>September. </em>That the question would then fairly come up, whether the deponent or <em>Winter </em>was really entitled.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b219-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>\n<em>Woods.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ACLq\">Perhaps the affidavit does not go quite far enough in stating that expressly, but surely it may well be gathered from the whole.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ATI\"><em>Mmott, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"As7\">The deponent does not swear to any title; he only says he has a claim: he does not swear that he is the landlord ; not even that there is a privity between him and the tenant. If then there, is no title, if he is not landlord, and if there is no privity, how can he be made a defendant ? If a man may thus come in and vacate a judgment, without any complaint from the tenant, there is not one which may not be set aside* There is nothing stated which shows that notice of the ejectment ought to have-been given to the deponent. The tenant is not obliged to hunt out all persons who have claims ; he can only be expected to communicate to his privies.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b219-2\">Rad cliff, J.</author>\n<p id=\"And\">There does not appear to be any relation between <em>Masterton </em>and the tenant.</p>\n<author id=\"b219-5\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Aib\">The party can take nothing by his motion*</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
