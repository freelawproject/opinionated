That the person mentioned in the affidavits on behalf of the defendant as being a clerk, agent, or partner, was neither the one nor the other; that neither the defendant nor any of the clerks knew of any person being retained as an attorney for the defendant, though in the regis-</p>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAZB\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>ier of the deponent, was entered a receipt of a service of notice of bail. That the defendant was in execution, and an insolvent. From these circumstances, and because the defendant had not sworn to merits, it was contended that the default and proceedings ought to stand.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b353-3\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Adg\">There is strong reason to believe that notice of retainer was duly served, and though no merits are sworn to, we cannot depart from our rules. Let the default, judgment, and all subsequent proceedings be set aside with costs ; but on condition that the defendant does not bring any action for false imprisonment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
