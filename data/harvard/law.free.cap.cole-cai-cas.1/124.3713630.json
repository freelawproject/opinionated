Lit. </em>139 <em>b. </em>At common law, on every continuance or day given at or before judgment, the plaintiff or demandant might have been nonsuited, and before the stat. of 2 <em>Henry </em>IV. after verdict, if the court gave a day to be advised, at that day the plaintiff was demandable, and therefore might have been nonsuited, if he did not then appear ; but that is remedied by our statute. After award to answer, however, or demurrer in law joined, the plaintiff, for not appearing, shall still be nonsuited, for he is not helped by the statute. As to the mis-entry of the name, it is to be considered as the clerk\u2019s misprision and may be amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-3\">Judgment of nonsuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
