If a defendant will put i\u00f1 a frivolous demurrer, and then applies to the <em>grace </em>of the court, he shall have none. He has acted unmeritoriously, and shall be held to <em>summum jus.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b90-11\">The defendant must take nothing by his motion,,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
