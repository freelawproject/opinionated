The defendant has neither appeared in person, nor by attorney, nor entered bail; therefore all the proceedings must be set aside. And the court, considering it as improper practice in any attorney to attempt to appear <em>as agent, but not as </em>attorney, add, that <em>S. </em>himself pay the costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
