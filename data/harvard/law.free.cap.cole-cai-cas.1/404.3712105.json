By the words of our statute<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> it is made so. It allows the bringing into court the principal, interest and costs, in bar of the suit; and though the terms of the law are, that it be \u201c pending the action,\u201d which may be now deemed to be at an end, yet in <em>Rich. K. B. </em>211. and 1 <em>Sell. </em>359, 60. it will be seen, that courts of common law will extend the equity of a statute in cases like this, and that by virtue of their general controuling power over their own judgments:</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b414-8\"><em>Emott, </em>contra*</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aanj\">read counter-affidavits, setting forth that the bond and warrant, on which the execution was issued, were given to secure a debt, larger than the Condition, for the surplus of which a promissory-note was made by the defendant, payable at 30 days, under an agreement that if it was not duly honoured, th\u00e9 amount might be levied by execution, on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>Warrant of attorney; that the plaintiffs had also other demands against the defendant, for <em>bona fide debts, </em>on notes of hands, to the amount of which the sheriff had been directed to levy, but that the whole did not exceed the penalty of the bond, the condition of which, together with interest and costs, had not been fully satisfied, as on calculation, two dollars appear to be still due.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b415-6\"><em>Eveftson </em>in reply was stopped by the court.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b414-4\"> 1 <em>Rev.

It would be attended with the most mischievous consequences, to allow collecting more than is due on the condition. It would be trying the equity of the case in this way. It is against the very form of the contract, and liable to great abuse. It would be a deception on the world, for the condition which is to discharge the judgment is on record. If, therefore, it was to reach to other demands, it would be impossible to know wliat would satisfy the debt. As to the two dollars, <em>de minimis non curat lex. </em>Take the effect of your.motion, with the costs of this application and those of that to the judge, for the order to stay proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">An objection was taken to the notice of rm&gt; tian, for being simply, \u201c <em>Nicholas Evertson.fi </em>without the addition of \u201c attorney for the defendant,\u201d but the court paid no attention to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">.
