You have invited the inquiry, by stating him to be a man of character and reputation. Every witness at a trial is equally unprepared ; we do not, therefore, see why we may not question his credibility as much as if he was before a jury. Read the affidavits.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"ABh\">Spencer, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9qM\">I dissent entirely from this determination. I think it may lead to very oppressive and serious consequences. A man\u2019s character is to be sifted, not from what he appears and says himself, but from what others relate of him. He may not even be present, when the information he gives is made use of, and must, therefore, be surprised by such an inquiry. I cannot agree to trying a man\u2019s reputation in this manner.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
