The utmost, therefore,- the court will do, is to vacate the proceedings from the default.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b156-11\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"ApO\">As the default is not accounted for by the affidavit, it is unimpeaehed,- and therefore must stand : but as the subsequent proceedings are irregular, they must be set aside, with the usual liberty, however, for the plaintiffs to perfect their judgment this term, if they can.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
