The affidavit, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number><em>PFoodworth </em>said, in addition to its being supported by the deposition of another person, carried internal evidence of its truth. It was not natural to suppose that a man should pay, after an arrest, so large a sum, on account of the debt, under no kind of agreement, but leave himself open to an execution for the residue, the very next moment. He therefore hoped the court would set aside the whole proceedings, as being in violation of every principle of good faith.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b225-3\"><em>Fan Antwerp, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AVt\">read a long affidavit by the plaintiff, denying the receipt of the money on any condition, and swearing to the justness of his execution: But the denial rested on his own testimony alone.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b225-4\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"ArE\">This is an application to set aside-the judgment, and all subsequent proceedings. The affidavits are very lengthy, and so far as they relate to merits, we put them totally out of view, for on that point they cannot be received, the plaintiff having been perfectly regular, according to the rules of this court. But the motion is made on the further ground of surprise. To this effect the defendant has sworn, and his testimony is corroborated by that of another witness to the same effect. On the other hand may be opposed the positive denial of the plaintiff. If the weight of testimony be to decide, it will be found with the defendant. There has at least been a misunderstanding in this business. The defendant thought he paid his money that the suit might not go en, and therefore did not make any defence. It is evident some great mistake has been made ; the plaintiff, however is perfectly regular, and as each side may have thought himself right, the judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>an&lt;^ proceedings must be set aside on payment of costs, pleading issuably, and taking notice of trial for the next circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
