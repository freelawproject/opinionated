This last set forth, that he was counsel for the <em>Humane Society of New-York, </em>and, in that capacity, obliged to visit the gaol on <em>Monday </em>in every week ; that this cause being noticed for trial on a Monday, he came into court instantly after discharging his duty to the society, when he found an inquest had been taken in the suit; that he, on the same day, wrote to the attorney of the plaintiff, offering to pay all the costs of the inquest, and to engage to try the cause in the <em>then </em>sittings, if the plaintiff would abandon his inquest, which he re-fused to do.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b194-5\"><em>Hoffman </em>also observed,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Agp_\">the calendar had been gone through more than once, and that the plaintiff needed not to have lost the sittings but for his own obstinacy.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b194-6\">\n<em>Woods</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AP1h\">relied on the counter affidavit of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, which stated, that the cause was duly set down in its order, on the day-docket; that it was regularly called and tried ; that when called on,-- '--, esquire, was in court, and in the hearing of the deponent, said he was of counsel for the defendants, but as he did not see his clients, nor any of their witnesses, he would not appear; that on this the defendants were called, and an inquest taken.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b194-10\"><em>Woods </em>remarked,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AVY\">that, if after these facts the inquest should be set aside, there would be no end to these applications.
