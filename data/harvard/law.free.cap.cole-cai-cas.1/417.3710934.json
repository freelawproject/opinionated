There are no words in the return to intend by. We might as well intend an issue joined, or a <em>venire </em>when nothing is stated. The justice must state, as the writ requires him, all his proceedings <em>f </em>the whole history of the suit. When a proceeding so essential is omitted, we cannot consider it as done.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
