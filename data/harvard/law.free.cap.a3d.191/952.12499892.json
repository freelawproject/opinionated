The Secretary affirmed the Bureau of Hearings and Appeals' (BHA) order adopting the Administrative Law Judge's (ALJ) recommendation denying relief and rejecting Nursing Facility's billing practice. Specifically, the Department disallowed Nursing Facility's practice of recouping unpaid copayments from residents eligible for medical assistance by billing the Department for the copays as medical expenses. The Department also concluded this practice constituted balance-billing prohibited by applicable law. Nursing Facility argues the Department did not promulgate a regulation explicitly precluding its billing practice. Discerning no error below, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case involves the interplay between the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and the ultimate source of funding for covered services, when a participating provider renders services to individuals eligible for medical assistance under both programs. Nursing Facility billed the Department for amounts corresponding to services for which payment was limited to the Medicaid rate, resulting in the Department paying more than the maximum Medicaid rate for the services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Statutory Framework\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Generally\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Medicaid, established by Title XIX of the Social Security Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201396\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 1396v, is a cooperative federal-state program through which the federal government funds the states to provide medical assistance to low-income persons. Participating states\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   must submit a \"State Plan\" to the federal Department of Health and Human Services for approval. The State Plan establishes financial eligibility criteria and identifies covered services and corresponding rates. The federal Department of Health and Human Services approved Pennsylvania's State Plan, the Medical Assistance (MA) Program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In addition to need-based Medicaid, medical assistance is available to individuals aged 65 or older under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act through Medicare. Medicare is comprised of two principle\n   parts: Part A (for inpatient hospital and post-hospital care), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1395c - 1395i-5 ; and Part B (for physician services and outpatient services), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1395j - 1395w-4. Individual enrollment in Medicare Part A is automatic based on age. Enrollment in Part B is voluntary, offering participating individuals supplemental insurance for services not covered by Part A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Cost-Sharing/Copay Limits\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Part B imposes cost-sharing obligations on participating individuals for co-insurance, including deductibles, monthly premiums, and copays. Generally, this means an individual enrolled in Medicare Part B will pay co-insurance amounts, including copays corresponding to Part B services. As the elderly poor may not have the financial means to pay cost-sharing amounts, Medicaid funds are used to enroll individuals qualifying for both Medicare and Medicaid, known as \"dual eligibles,\" in Medicare Part B by paying their cost-sharing obligations. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395v, \u00a7 1396a(a)(10)(E). Once dual eligibles are enrolled, Medicare directly reimburses providers for 80% of the reasonable charges for Part B services. Part B copays, including those payable through Medicaid, are intended to cover the remaining 20%.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   However, Congress amended Medicaid through Section 4714 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, regarding state liability for Medicare cost-sharing (1997 Amendment), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(n). The 1997 Amendment clarified that a state is not required to make any payment for any incurred expenses \"relating to payment for ...\n   <em>\n    copayments for [M]edicare cost-sharing\n   </em>\n   to the extent the payment under [Medicare] for the service would exceed the payment amount that otherwise would be made under the State Plan.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201396\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 1396a(n)(2) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The 1997 Amendment expressly caps a state's payment at the Medicaid rate for Medicare cost-sharing, including Part B copays. This Medicaid rate cap applies even when the Medicare rate is equal to or greater than the rate set forth in the State Plan, thereby eliminating a state's payment obligation. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(n)(3). The 1997 Amendment also provided in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (A) for purposes of applying any limitation under title XVIII on the amount that the [qualified Medicare beneficiary] may be billed or charged for the service, the amount of payment made under title XVIII plus the amount of payment (\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   ) under the State plan shall be considered to be payment in full for the service;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (B)\n   <em>\n    the [qualified Medicare beneficiary] shall not have any legal liability to make payment to a provider\n   </em>\n   ... for the service; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (C) any lawful sanction that may be imposed upon a provider ... for excess charges under this title or title XVIII shall apply to the imposition of any charge imposed upon the individual in such case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201396\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Thus, under this provision, the legal liability of a qualified Medicare beneficiary, such as the legal liability of a resident in a nursing facility to pay that facility, is limited.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Department administers the MA Program (Medicaid) for the Commonwealth. The Human Services Code (the Code)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   vests the Department with the authority to establish rules, regulations, and standards for programs it administers. The\n   Department's administration of the MA Program must comply with federal law. Thus, the approved State Plan must comply with federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Shortly after enactment of the 1997 Amendment, the Department issued a notice in the Pennsylvania Bulletin that it was amending the State Plan \"to specify that the Department\n   <em>\n    will not pay Medicare cost-sharing amounts\n   </em>\n   related to any services\n   <em>\n    to the extent that the payments made under the Medicare Program exceed the payments that would be made by the [MA] Program for such services\n   </em>\n   if provided to an eligible [MA] recipient.\" Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 745a (emphasis added). The amendment to the State Plan, effective January 1, 1998, conformed to federal law as set forth in the 1997 Amendment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201396\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As amended, the State Plan provides the MA Program will pay for unsatisfied Medicare cost-sharing for Part B services provided to dual eligibles\n   <em>\n    up\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    to the fee allowable under the MA Program for covered services\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. at 750a. It specified MA \"\n   <em>\n    will not pay Medicare cost-sharing\n   </em>\n   \" when the Medicare payment for the service \"exceeds the applicable [MA] fee or payment\" for the service.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201396\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Department explained its change to the State Plan in MA Bulletin No. 35-98 -10, 36-98-10 (MA Bulletin). The MA Bulletin echoed the language of the 1997 Amendment, stating the MA fee - which is Pennsylvania's Medicaid rate for services - \"\n   <strong>\n    is the maximum payment that may be received by the facility for services provided to both [dual eligible] residents and non-QMB\n   </strong>\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   <strong>\n    MA residents.\n   </strong>\n   \" R.R. at 669a (bold in original). It also restated this Medicaid rate cap applied to Medicare cost-sharing amounts, including Part B copays.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    B. MA Participation and Payments to Nursing Facilities\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The MA Program pays nursing facility providers a \"per diem rate\" on behalf of MA-eligible residents for room, board, and related services.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=55%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201187.2\">\n    55 Pa. Code \u00a7 1187.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (corresponding to facility rate of payment per resident day). The MA Program also pays the allowable fees for Medicare Part B services provided to MA-eligible residents in participating nursing facilities. However, the MA Program does not pay\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   fees for Part B services if the amount paid to the nursing facility by Medicare covers or exceeds the fee set by the MA Program. Because the MA fees are \"almost always lower\" than the amount Medicare pays, participating providers may receive only 80% of the reasonable charge for Part B services from Medicare, with no payment from the MA Program for the remaining 20% (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Part B copay). R.R. at 1172a (ALJ Recommendation).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   A patient \"who is eligible for MA and has monthly income ( [Social Security], pensions, etc.) may be responsible for a patient pay liability to the facility.\" ALJ's Recommendation, 7/28/16, Finding of Fact (F.F.) No. 7. The local County Assistance Office calculates the amount based on the patient's financial eligibility (Patient Liability). This Patient Liability is subtracted from the per diem rate paid to a nursing facility under the MA Program. For example, if the monthly Patient Liability is $1,000, and the MA per diem rate is $200, equaling $6,000 (30 days x $200/day), the Department will pay a nursing facility $5,000 ($6,000-$1,000).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=55%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201187.2\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=55%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201187.2\">\n    at n.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Providers that elect to participate in the MA Program enter into provider agreements setting the terms for MA-covered services.

Section 4.9 of the Provider Handbook explains that for dual eligibles, \"the Medicare [P]rogram must be billed first if the service is covered by Medicare. Payment will be made by MA for the Medicare Part B deductible and co[-]insurance [such as copays]\n   <em>\n    up to the MA fee\n   </em>\n   .\" R.R. at 573a (emphasis added). So when the MA fee is insufficient, Part B copays are left unpaid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Deductions from the Patient Liability amount are permitted for \"Other Medical Expenses.\" \"Other Medical Expenses\" are costs of medical goods or services \"\n   <em>\n    incurred\n   </em>\n   during that month.\" F.F. No. 10 (emphasis added). The nursing facility debits the Patient Liability for these \"other medical expenses\" that are ultimately paid under the MA Program. The nursing facility then bills the MA Program for the amount of the \"other medical expenses\" to offset the amount subtracted from the Patient Liability. Billing for \"other medical expenses\" in this manner, and deducting costs from Patient Liability, is permitted. F.F. No. 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In practice, when a nursing facility resident receives a pair of glasses that costs $300, the glasses qualify as \"other medical expenses.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20447.15\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20447.15\">\n    at n.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this example, a nursing facility deducts the $300 cost incurred for the glasses from the resident's $1,000 Patient Liability, resulting in a Patient Liability of $700. Importantly, a reduction in the otherwise unrecoverable Patient Liability for \"other medical expenses\" effectively increases the amount paid to a nursing facility by the MA Program. Using the eyeglasses example, because the Department pays the nursing facility its per diem rate for room and board ($6,000) minus the Patient Liability ($700) through the MA Program, the MA Program pays the nursing facility $5,300, instead of $5,000 in the absence of a deduction for \"other medical expenses.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Disputed Billing Practice\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   This case involves Nursing Facility's attempt to recover part of the otherwise unrecoverable Part B copays by utilizing its residents' Patient Liability amounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In 2009, on the advice of counsel, Nursing Facility, and other nursing facilities owned by Guardian Elder Care LLC (Guardian), began billing the MA Program for dual eligible residents' Part B copays by including them as an \"other medical expense\" (Disputed Billing Practice).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Most of Nursing Facility's residents are dual eligibles. Using the Disputed Billing Practice, Nursing Facility attempted to recoup unpaid copays corresponding to Part B services by deducting the amount of the copays from Patient Liability amounts as it is permitted to do for \"other medical expenses.\" Then, Nursing Facility billed the Department for Part B copays as for any other \"other medical expenses.\" Because they were included as routine \"other medical expenses,\" the MA Program paid the Part B copays. In so billing, Nursing Facility sought more than the MA fee for the Part B service. As a result, the MA Program paid more than the maximum MA fee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Nursing Facility receives 80% of the \"reasonable charge\" for Part B services directly from Medicare. In almost all\n   cases, the Medicare amount (80%) is higher than the maximum allowed fee for the same service under the MA Program. R.R. at 279a. Because providers agree to accept the MA fee as payment in full, and Medicare paid the MA fee amount, providers may not recover the Part B cost-sharing,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , copays, from the state. Nursing Facility engaged in the Disputed Billing Practice in order to recoup the remaining 20% corresponding to Part B copays.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Nursing Facility executed a provider agreement with the Department, to participate in the MA Program, effective January 1, 1997. R.R. at 757a (Provider Agreement). Nursing Facility agreed to comply with applicable federal and state law governing the Medicare and Medicaid programs. As a participating provider, Nursing Facility received the Provider Handbook explaining proper billing practices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   This litigation stems from the Department's review of Nursing Facility in 2011 for the billing cycle of January 2009 through December 2009. During this period, Nursing Facility and other Guardian-owned facilities engaged in the Disputed Billing Practice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Department prepared a Field Operations Review Summary seeking claims adjustments based on the Disputed Billing Practice. It disallowed the Disputed Billing Practice for using incorrect Patient Liability amounts, and for billing Part B copays as \"other medical expenses.\" Nursing Facility appealed the Department's Field Summary and related claims adjustments in April 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Nursing Facility agreed to an administrative hearing to allow the underlying appeal as a test case, such that the ruling would apply to all 22 Guardian facilities that engaged in the Disputed Billing Practice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The ALJ held a two-part hearing in February 2015. The ALJ found the testimony of all of the witnesses credible. F.F. No. 21. Based on the briefs and the evidence, the ALJ determined the Department properly denied the claims in which Nursing Facility used its Disputed Billing Practice to recoup Part B copays as \"other medical expenses.\" Accordingly, the ALJ denied relief. Nursing Facility appealed to the BHA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The BHA issued an order adopting the ALJ's recommendation. Nursing Facility timely requested reconsideration. After granting reconsideration, the Secretary upheld the BHA's decision. Nursing Facility then petitioned this Court for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   After briefing and argument before this Court\n   <em>\n    en\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    banc\n   </em>\n   , the matter is ready for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Issues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The ultimate issue before this Court is whether the Department properly disallowed Nursing Facility from recouping residents' Part B (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , physician and physical therapy services) copays by deducting them from Patient Liability, and billing the Department for the copays as \"other medical expenses.\" The parties also dispute whether Nursing Facility engaged in balance-billing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   On appeal,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nursing Facility argues the Department had no basis for\n   disallowing its attempt to recover Medicare Part B copays through the Disputed Billing Practice. Specifically, it challenges the MA Bulletin as grounds to bar the Disputed Billing Practice when the Department did not promulgate it as a regulation. Further, it maintains the regulation pertaining to Medicare co-insurance,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=55%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201187.102\">\n    55 Pa. Code \u00a7 1187.102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , applies only to Medicare Part A (relating to inpatient facility care). Nursing Facility also contends deducting Part B copays from the Patient Liability does not constitute balance-billing because the MA Program pays the Part B copays, not the residents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Department responds that the Disputed Billing Practice directly violates federal and state law. The Department maintains it may enforce federal law without implementing a specific regulation. It also argues the Nursing Facility's deduction of copays corresponding to Part B services (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , physical therapy) from Patient Liability to recover the unpaid 20%, which is the balance of the reasonable charge paid by Medicare for the Part B service, constitutes balance-billing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Source of Agency Authority\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   First, we consider Nursing Facility's contention that the Department lacks authority for disallowing the Disputed Billing Practice. Essentially, it asserts the sole source for the Department's authority to disallow the practice is the MA Bulletin. Because the MA Bulletin was not promulgated as a regulation, and is instead a statement of policy, Nursing Facility maintains it is unenforceable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   We discern no merit in Nursing Facility's contentions. At the outset, we disagree that the Department's position depends upon the MA Bulletin's validity as a regulation. The Department had additional legal grounds for disallowing the Disputed Billing Practice, found in federal and state law and documents governing Nursing Facility's participation in the MA Program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In focusing on the MA Bulletin, Nursing Facility digresses from the ultimate issue in this case: whether the Disputed Billing Practice is disallowed. Regardless, the MA Bulletin represents an example of the Department's interpretive authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    1. MA Fee Cap\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Under the Disputed Billing Practice, Nursing Facility received payments from the MA Program - in excess of the MA fee - corresponding to Part B copays. By so doing, Nursing Facility disregarded federal and state laws that provide the MA Program shall be a payer of last resort and is not responsible to pay more than the MA fee for a covered service. These laws apply regardless of any shortfall providers experience when the MA fee is insufficient to cover 100% of the reasonable charge for Part B services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The 1997 Amendment clarified that Medicaid, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(n), did not require state Medicaid programs to pay Medicare cost-sharing amounts when to do so would require states to pay more than the Medicaid rate. Recognizing that providers may not receive 100% of the reasonable charge with this limitation, the 1997 Amendment prohibited providers from holding patients liable for the shortfall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In a series of cases decided around the time Congress enacted the 1997 Amendment, a number of our sister jurisdictions\n   construed its effect. Most courts held a state may limit its cost-sharing obligation to the Medicaid fee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McCreary v.

The MA Program does not pay the copay because its liability is capped at the MA fee. To recover the unpaid copay, Nursing Facility debits the Patient Liability by $200. By including the Part B copays in a resident's obligations, as a cost the resident\n   <em>\n    owed\n   </em>\n   , Nursing Facility holds the resident liable for the payment of the unpaid balance of a bill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Nursing Facility admitted that through the Patient Liability it billed the resident for \"other medical expenses,\" including Part B copays. In describing its sources of income, the Chief Financial Officer for Guardian testified, \"[t]he resident would see a bill for what monthly was their obligation [the Patient Liability], and then [the Department] was also be [sic] billed for the amount that [it] would owe the facility.\" R.R. at 136a-37a. He explained the Disputed Billing Practice thus billed \"[b]oth\" the patient and the Department.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=55%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20181.452\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Based on the record, the ALJ found Nursing Facility billed dual eligibles for Part B copays through Patient Liability. F.F. No. 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   That the amount is ultimately paid by the Department does not save the Disputed Billing Practice from constituting balance-billing. Nursing Facility would be unable to bill the Part B copays as \"other medical expenses\" if it did not first deem them costs owed by the residents. Absent holding the patient liable for the Part B copays through the Patient Liability (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the amount the patient is responsible to pay for care), Nursing Facility obtains no access to the Department's MA Program funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   As a factual predicate, Nursing Facility's billing of Part B copays as \"other medical expenses\" depends on its entitlement to receive the amount of the Part B copays as costs incurred by the resident. Pursuant to the 1997 Amendment, and the State Plan implementing it, Nursing Facility is not permitted to bill Part B copays to the Department if to do so exceeds the MA fee for the service; it is also not permitted to bill the patients for the difference between the reasonable charge and the MA fee. Here, Nursing Facility did both.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. at 1179a (ALJ Recommendation).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   In sum, by deducting the amount of Part B copays from Patient Liability, and representing them as costs incurred, Nursing Facility held patients liable for the payments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Patient Liability is the means by which Nursing Facility billed residents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   R.R. at 136a-37a. By utilizing that mechanism, and including the Part B copays as costs that residents incurred, Nursing Facility held dual eligibles legally liable for their payment without collecting the amount from the residents. By so recouping the unpaid balance of the Medicare reasonable charge through Patient Liability, Nursing Facility engaged in balance-billing. Thus, the Department did not err in so concluding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Remand\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Lastly, we address Nursing Facility's request for a remand to the Department to analyze the validity of the MA Bulletin. Nursing Facility argues the Department abused its discretion when it did not issue any findings or conclusions as to its validity challenge. Again, we disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   As explained above, the Disputed Billing Practice is not permitted by federal law, the State Plan or the Provider Agreement. In the administrative appeal, Nursing Facility bore the burden of proof, not the Department. Nursing Facility failed to meet its burden. Accordingly, the alleged status of the MA Bulletin as an unpromulgated regulation makes no difference to the outcome here. Because the Department did not need to assess the MA Bulletin to decide Nursing Facility's appeal, a remand to address its validity is unnecessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Revisions to policy statements, however, are not subject to such procedures. The majority correctly applied the principles of the 1997 Amendment to Part B. However, the manner in which the Department achieved the application of Part B, through a Department Bulletin, appears to skirt the regulatory review procedures set forth in the Commonwealth Documents Law, 45 P.S. \u00a7 1102 ;\n   <em>\n    Hillcrest Home, Inc.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The Department did not take the additional steps required by the Commonwealth Documents Law, including formal notice, comment, and review procedures to amend\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=55%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201187.102\">\n    55 Pa.
