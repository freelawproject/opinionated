Hall, appeals from the trial court's judgment of civil contempt rendered against him because he, in violation of an order of the court, unilaterally withdrew funds from a joint bank account and deposited them into his personal savings account, and because the parties placed the funds in an account that did not meet the requirements of the court order. On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the court (1) improperly held him in contempt although he allegedly relied on the advice of counsel when he withdrew the funds, and (2) improperly denied the parties' joint motion to open and vacate the judgment of contempt. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The following undisputed facts and procedural history provide the context for this appeal. The parties\n   were married on August 10, 1996, and have three children together. On February 3, 2014, the plaintiff commenced a dissolution action. The parties subsequently entered into a pendente lite stipulation on October 27, 2014, which provided in relevant part: \"The funds currently being held in escrow [by a law firm] in the approximate amount of $533,588 shall be released to the parties for deposit into a joint bank account requiring the signature of both parties prior to any withdrawals....\" The court,\n   <em>\n    Colin, J.\n   </em>\n   , approved the parties' stipulation and made it a court order. After this order, the parties set up a joint account and transferred the escrow funds into it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Approximately one year later, on September 23, 2015, the defendant, Deborah Hall, filed a motion for contempt. She alleged that on September 22, 2015, the plaintiff committed a wilful violation of the October 27, 2014 court order when he withdrew the sum of $70,219.99 from the joint account-the balance of the account at the time-and placed it into a separate, personal account.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following an evidentiary hearing, the court,\n   <em>\n    Tindill, J.\n   </em>\n   , on December\n   7, 2015, granted the defendant's motion for contempt. Thereafter, the plaintiff, who then was self-represented, filed a motion for reconsideration, which the court denied without issuing a written decision.\n   Subsequent to the court's judgment of contempt; see footnote 1 of this opinion; on January 27, 2016, the parties entered into a separation agreement. That same day, the court,\n   <em>\n    Hon. Stanley Novack\n   </em>\n   , judge trial referee, accepted the parties' separation agreement and incorporated it into its judgment of dissolution. Section 10 of the separation agreement provided in relevant part as follows: \"The parties stipulate and agree that they will file a joint motion to open and vacate the findings of contempt in that they believe such findings could interfere with the parties' future employment.... The parties understand that this motion must be filed within four (4) months of each of the orders and it is within the discretion of the Court to act thereon.\" Also on January 27, 2016, the plaintiff filed an appeal from the court's contempt judgment\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and its denial of his motion for reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Five days later, on February 1, 2016, the parties filed a joint motion to open and vacate the judgment of contempt requesting that the court vacate its order of contempt. The parties specifically relied on \u00a7 10 of their separation agreement in support of their joint motion to open and vacate. Judge Tindill denied the joint motion to open and vacate on March 9, 2016, without issuing a written decision. The plaintiff then filed an amended appeal on March 29, 2016, challenging the denial of the motion to open and vacate. The plaintiff's amended appeal is now before this court. Additional facts and procedural history will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The plaintiff's first claim is that the trial court improperly held him in contempt of court. He argues that a court should not find that a litigant wilfully violates a court order when he or she reasonably acts in reliance on counsel's advice. According to the plaintiff, his attorney \"advised him\" to withdraw the funds from the joint account in violation of the October 27, 2014 court order, and the court failed to address \"the evidence on advice of counsel, despite the fact that [he] testified about this repeatedly.\" He also claims that the court \"compounded its error by denying reconsideration\" because it overlooked the evidence demonstrating that he in fact relied on counsel's advice in withdrawing funds from the joint account. We are unpersuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The record and the court's written memorandum of decision on the defendant's motion for contempt reveal the following undisputed facts and procedural history. After the parties set up the joint bank account pursuant to the court's October 27, 2014 order, they knew that the account did not comply with that order \"the very first day\" they opened it. More specifically, the joint account they set up permitted online access and, therefore, did not require signatures from either party, as required by the order, prior to the withdrawal or transfer of funds. The plaintiff testified that banks no longer require dual signatures on accounts. Nonetheless, the court order\n   mandating that the funds be placed in an account \"requiring the signature of both parties prior to any withdrawals\" was not modified before the defendant filed her motion for contempt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At some point thereafter, the plaintiff became concerned that the defendant was unilaterally withdrawing funds from the joint account and spending them on alcohol and drugs. Therefore, according to the plaintiff, on September 22, 2015, he withdrew the $70,219.99 from\n   the joint account, without seeking the court's approval, in an attempt to preserve the remaining marital assets contained in that account. He then placed the withdrawn funds into a separate account solely in his name that the defendant could not access. On November 2, 2015, he testified: \"I felt I was complying with the terms of the court order by moving the funds and wanting to put them into an account that did comply with the court order. And I demanded that [the defendant] meet me at a bank where we could set up such an account that did comply with the order.\" Immediately after making this statement, the following examination took place regarding the September 22, 2015 withdrawal of the $70,219.99 from the joint account:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"The Court:\n   <em>\n    Were you represented by counsel at that time\n   </em>\n   ?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"[The Plaintiff]:\n   <em>\n    Yes, I did consult with counsel\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"[The Defendant's Counsel]: Yes. And so is your testimony, Mr. Hall-because I'm hearing you say two different things-is your testimony today [that] the reason why you moved the account, the money from the account, was because it didn't comply with the original court order or was it because you had a concern that [the defendant] was becoming drug-dependent at that point in time?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"[The Plaintiff]: The reason I felt action had to be taken was because I had recently learned about her drug abuse. The reason I felt that it was justified in acting to move the funds at that time was in order-so that I could comply with the court order.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The court then adjourned for the day, and the parties did not appear in court again in connection with the contempt proceeding until December 1, 2015. During the December 1, 2015 hearing, the parties revisited\n   the plaintiff's September, 2015 withdrawal of the $70,219.99. The plaintiff again testified that he withdrew the $70,219.99 from the joint account because the defendant was withdrawing funds from that same account and \"spending it on cocaine binges.\" The court then asked the plaintiff, \"And when was it that you removed the money, September what?\" In response, the plaintiff testified, \"Sometime in September\n   <em>\n    after consulting with my counsel about the situation\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At various times during the proceeding, the plaintiff testified that he withdrew funds from the parties' joint account after consulting with counsel, but did not testify that he was advised by counsel to withdraw the $70,219.99 before he did so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   When the plaintiff's counsel asked him why he should not be held in contempt, the plaintiff testified: \"I believe that what I was doing was in order to comply with Judge Colin's orders from October, 2014. And that I was not utilizing the funds in any way in violation of the spirit of that agreement and that I took steps to try and work with her to comply with the order, set up a compliant account but at that point in time, there was no further cooperation on her side.\n   <em>\n    Furthermore, I would say throughout the entire\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    process, I was consulting with counsel about what was the proper course of action\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The court completed the evidentiary portion of the hearing on December 1, 2015. The parties agreed that the record contained sufficient evidence for the court to rule on both motions for contempt; see footnote 1 of this opinion; and waived argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In its December 7, 2015 memorandum of decision, the court found that the plaintiff wilfully had violated the court's October 27, 2014 order. The court first found that, on April 28, 2015, the plaintiff \"unilaterally and without the defendant's consent, withdrew $237,643.11 and deposited it into his own ... savings account.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   It also found that, \"[o]n September 22, 2015, the plaintiff wilfully violated the order a second time when he moved $70,219.99 from the joint account to that same savings account. Unlike the account into which the escrow funds were originally deposited pursuant to the court order, the defendant did not have access to the account into which the money was transferred.\" The court further found that the plaintiff acknowledged that his conduct violated the court order, but that he asserted five reasons as to why it was not \"wilful.\" The court rejected each of the plaintiff's contentions. It did not find that the plaintiff had relied on the advice of counsel when he transferred the funds into his personal account, nor did it state that the plaintiff made any argument to that effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   After the court found the plaintiff in contempt, the plaintiff, then self-represented, filed a motion for reconsideration, which was later amended after he retained new counsel. Among other claims, he asserted that \"the court inquired of the plaintiff as to whether in moving funds from the parties' joint account he acted on the advice of counsel, to which he testified that he had.\" He claimed that his previous counsel did not pursue this line of questioning and also \"did not offer into evidence exculpatory e-mails from September, 2015.\" In support of his motion for reconsideration, the plaintiff submitted an affidavit in which he averred that in August, 2015, his previous counsel had advised him that he could transfer funds from the joint account in order to prevent\n   dissipation of marital assets.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   He further asserted, for the first time, that his previous counsel confirmed that advice via e-mail in September, 2015. In support of this assertion, the plaintiff attached to his affidavit an e-mail chain allegedly between himself and his previous counsel discussing the September 22, 2015 withdrawal. The court denied the motion for reconsideration on January 4, 2016, without issuing a written decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On July 15, 2016, the plaintiff filed a motion for articulation, requesting that the court provide the factual and legal bases for denying both the motion for reconsideration and the joint motion to open and vacate. See part II of this opinion. On July 27, 2016, the court denied the plaintiff's motion for articulation, and the plaintiff subsequently filed in this court a motion for review of that denial. This court granted the motion for review and, on October 26, 2016, ordered the court to (1) articulate the factual and legal bases for its denial of the\n   plaintiff's motion for reconsideration, and (2) issue a written memorandum of decision detailing the factual and legal bases for its denial of the joint motion to open and vacate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On January 9, 2017, in compliance with this court's October 26, 2016 order, the trial court issued an articulation, detailing its factual and legal reasons for denying the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration. Although the court set forth in great detail the reasons for its decision, only the following portions are directly relevant to this appeal. It initially noted \"that there had been no misapprehension of facts by the court.\" The court determined that it was undisputed that the plaintiff violated the court order by making the two separate withdrawals of $237,643.11 and $70,219.99 from the joint account, a total of $307,863.10. It also stated that the plaintiff \"is a licensed attorney in New York and Massachusetts and therefore has a better understanding and appreciation of the law and legal procedures than the average litigant or layperson.\" The plaintiff's assertions in his motion for reconsideration, according to the court, also \"validate[d] [its] finding that [he] wilfully engaged in self-help....\" Finally, it stated that the plaintiff's \"dissatisfaction with the services and counsel of his attorney of record during the evidentiary hearing is not a basis for reconsideration of the court's finding of wilful contempt based on the evidence....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We now turn to the legal principles governing our review of the plaintiff's claim. \"[O]ur analysis of a [civil] judgment of contempt consists of two levels of inquiry. First, we must resolve the threshold question of whether the underlying order constituted a court order that was sufficiently clear and unambiguous so as to support a judgment of contempt.... This is a legal inquiry subject to de novo review.... Second, if we conclude that the underlying court order was sufficiently clear and unambiguous, we must then determine\n   whether the trial court abused its discretion in issuing, or refusing to issue, a judgment of contempt, which includes a review of the trial court's determination of whether the violation was wilful or excused by a good faith dispute or misunderstanding.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Giordano\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Giordano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5735962\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/127/498/#p502\">\n    127 Conn.

The two are distinguished by the type of penalty imposed....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \"To impose contempt penalties, whether criminal or civil, the trial court must make a contempt finding, and this requires the court to find that the offending party wilfully violated the court's order; failure to comply with an order, alone, will not support a finding of contempt.... Rather, to constitute contempt, a party's conduct must be wilful.... A good faith dispute or legitimate misunderstanding about the mandates of an order may well preclude a finding of wilfulness.... Whether a party's violation was wilful depends on the circumstances of the particular case and, ultimately, is a factual question committed to the sound discretion of the trial court.... Without a finding of wilfulness, a trial court cannot find contempt and, it follows, cannot impose contempt penalties.\" (Citations omitted; footnote omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    O'Brien\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    O'Brien\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489768\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/161/1236/#p97\">\n    326 Conn. 81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 97-99,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489768\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/161/1236/#p97\">\n    161 A.3d 1236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017). The clear and convincing evidence standard of proof applies to civil contempt proceedings like those\n   at issue here. See\n   <em>\n    Brody\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Brody\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=315%20Conn.%20300\">\n    315 Conn. 300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 318-19,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=105%20A.3d%20887\">\n    105 A.3d 887\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The plaintiff does not challenge the court's finding that the October 27, 2014 order, which incorporated the parties' stipulation, was clear and unambiguous.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   He focuses his appeal instead on the court's judgment of contempt. He argues that in withdrawing the $70,219.99 from the parties' joint account in September, 2015, he acted on the advice of counsel. He states in support of his argument that he \"testified about this repeatedly\" during the contempt proceeding and that \"his former attorney\n   <em>\n    advised him\n   </em>\n   \" to remove the funds from the joint account. (Emphasis added.) We disagree that the plaintiff testified, or presented any other evidence, that he\n   <em>\n    relied\n   </em>\n   on counsel's advice. At most, he testified that he had\n   <em>\n    consulted\n   </em>\n   with his attorney about the appropriate course of action under the circumstances. Nor did the court specifically\n   <em>\n    ask\n   </em>\n   the plaintiff whether he acted on the advice of counsel in connection with the September, 2015 transfer of the $70,219.99 from the parties' joint account into a separate account that the defendant could not access. Rather, the court simply asked, \"Were you represented by counsel at that time?\" And the plaintiff responded, \"Yes, I did\n   <em>\n    consult\n   </em>\n   with counsel.\" (Emphasis added.) The record, therefore, does not support the plaintiff's argument on appeal that he repeatedly testified about his\n   <em>\n    reliance\n   </em>\n   on counsel's advice when he withdrew the $70,219.99 from the parties' joint account in violation of the October 27, 2014 court order. Nor does it support his argument that counsel advised him to do so. The record therefore lacks the evidentiary foundation necessary for our favorable\n   consideration of the plaintiff's argument.

As previously discussed, and contrary to his argument on appeal, the plaintiff\n   <em>\n    did not\n   </em>\n   testify in that hearing that he relied on counsel's advice when he made the September, 2015 withdrawal in violation of the October, 2014 court order. Nor did the court specifically \"[inquire] of the plaintiff as to whether in moving funds from the parties' joint account\n   <em>\n    he acted on the advice of counsel\n   </em>\n   , to which he testified that he had,\" as the plaintiff argued in his motion for reconsideration. Therefore, both his argument and his attempts to introduce additional evidence in support of that argument-an affidavit indicating that he relied on counsel's advice and the e-mail exchange allegedly\n   between him and his previous counsel-amounted to an attempted impermissible second bite of the apple after a multiday hearing.

He argues that the court's memorandum of decision demonstrates that it \"ignored or misconstrued\n   important evidence and statements made at the hearing on the motion, thereby improperly turning a remedial order into a punitive one.\" According to the plaintiff, the trial court improperly concluded that there was no evidence before it demonstrating the \"adverse professional effect\" that the contempt finding would have on his career.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   We are unpersuaded.\n   The record and the court's memorandum of decision disclose the following undisputed facts and relevant procedural history. On February 1, 2016, the parties, within the four month period set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 52-212a, filed a joint motion to open and vacate the judgment of contempt. The motion stated in relevant part: \"The parties submit that it would be in the interest of justice to vacate [the findings of contempt] and otherwise leave the compliance orders in force.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The parties appeared before the court on February 22, 2016, to argue that particular motion. During oral argument, the plaintiff asserted: \"I do believe there's a sound basis for [the motion to open and vacate]. I also do think that it's very deleterious to my career to have this contempt citation. I'm in the banking-I'm a lawyer. It's a question on every application, have you been ... in contempt of any order? It would have ramifications for my licensing in the securities industry, et cetera. I think, likewise, the various issues that arose with [the defendant's] potential contempt ... I think the best thing for us now is to just move on with a clean slate. We had a very contentious fall. Things are working well with us now. And it seems in the best interest of all parties to just start fresh and allow us to put that behind us.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Richard Albrecht, the plaintiff's newly retained attorney, was arguing another matter in a different courtroom and, therefore, was not present when the plaintiff made these statements. The court then continued the matter to a later date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The parties again appeared before the court on March 7, 2016, to argue the motion to open and vacate. During\n   that proceeding, Albrecht argued, inter alia, that the motion to open and vacate should be granted because the contempt finding would impact the plaintiff's professional career. As previously set forth, the court denied the joint motion to open and vacate on March 9, 2016, without issuing a written decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On January 10, 2017, in compliance with this court's October 26, 2016 order, the trial court issued a written decision detailing the factual and legal reasons for its denial of the joint motion to open and vacate. The basis for the motion, according to the court, was that the adverse effects of a contempt finding on the plaintiff's professional career placed the parties in a \" 'unique situation' \" and, therefore, that the \" 'interests of justice' \" required vacatur of the contempt findings. The court\n   stated, however, \"[t]here is no evidence that the parties' circumstances are unique or distinguishable such that the findings of wilful contempt ... should be vacated in the interests of justice.\" It also stated that \"[t]here is no evidence of what, specifically, is or will be the adverse professional effect on the [plaintiff's] employment or career.\" Although the court stated that the defendant did not oppose the motion to open and vacate, the court found that she did not oppose it essentially to bring the proceedings to a close.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \"We first set forth the legal standards governing our review.... A motion to open a judgment is governed by ... \u00a7 52-212a and Practice Book \u00a7 17-4. Section 52-212a provides in relevant part: Unless otherwise provided by law and except in such cases in which the court has continuing jurisdiction, a civil judgment or decree rendered in the Superior Court may not be opened or set aside unless a motion to open or set aside is filed within four months following the date on which it was rendered or passed.... Practice Book \u00a7 17-4 states essentially the same rule....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \"We do not undertake a plenary review of the merits of a decision of the trial court to grant or to deny a motion to open a judgment.... In an appeal from a denial of a motion to open a judgment, our review is limited to the issue of whether the trial court has acted unreasonably and in clear abuse of its discretion....

Notwithstanding the arguably commonsense appeal of this argument, the plaintiff fails to point to where in the record supporting\n   <em>\n    evidence\n   </em>\n   exists, and we are unable to find such evidence in the record. Accordingly, the court did not abuse its discretion in denying the joint motion to open and vacate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    The plaintiff also filed a motion for contempt on September 24, 2015, alleging that the defendant violated the same October 27, 2014 order on various occasions. The court granted the plaintiff's motion in part and denied it in part. The defendant did not submit a brief in this appeal and, therefore, does not challenge the contempt finding as to her. As discussed in this opinion, however, the court's contempt judgment against the defendant is partially implicated by this appeal insofar as the joint motion to open and vacate the judgments of contempt sought to vacate the court's judgments of contempt rendered against\n    <em>\n     each\n    </em>\n    of the parties. Because the judgment of contempt against the defendant is not otherwise implicated by this appeal, however, references in this opinion to the judgment of contempt refers to the judgment rendered against the plaintiff.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    \"[A] trial court ruling on a motion for contempt in a marital dissolution action is a final judgment for purposes of appeal.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n    <em>\n     Baker\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Baker\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3662299\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/95/826/#p832\">\n     95 Conn.

Although the trial court in\n    <em>\n     O'Brien\n    </em>\n    denied the defendant's motion for contempt because the plaintiff acted on counsel's advice when he violated certain automatic orders; see id. at 583, 591,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=128%20A.3d%20595\">\n     128 A.3d 595\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ; this court, on appeal, \"[took] no position on whether a party may shield himself or herself from a finding of wilful contempt by showing that he or she relied on the advice of legal counsel.\" Id. at 591,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=128%20A.3d%20595\">\n     128 A.3d 595\n    </extracted-citation>\n    n.15.

That's what I need to add. That's it.\" The defendant did not file a brief in this appeal and, therefore, does not challenge the denial of the joint motion to open and vacate.

Although it could do so, a court is not required, however, to vacate its judgment after a contemnor has purged himself or herself of the contemptuous acts. In this case, the court identified three violations of the court order: the improperly established joint bank account, the $237,643.11 withdrawal, and the $70,219.99 withdrawal. Assuming that the plaintiff corrected the first and third violations identified by the court, there is no evidence in the record that he corrected the second violation by returning the $237,643.11 to a properly constituted joint account. Even if that violation is ignored, however, the plaintiff has not established that the court abused its discretion in declining to vacate the contempt judgment for the reasons it set forth in its December 7, 2015 and January 10, 2017 memoranda of decision, and its January 9, 2017 articulation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    We acknowledge the plaintiff's arguments that the court's denial of the motion to open and vacate \"conflicts with the public policy that encourages parties to end their disputes by settling claims\" and that \"the court in a dissolution case must reach a result that is equitable.\" As general propositions, we agree that courts favor settlement in dissolution cases and that a dissolution action is essentially equitable in nature. We are unpersuaded by the plaintiff's arguments, however, because the parties asked the court to undo previous factual findings and the contempt judgment rendered as a result of those findings, made after multiple days of hearings, and agreed that not doing so was within the court's discretion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
