The plaintiff claims that (1) the commissioner, by not allowing her to present evidence to prove that she did not have a work capacity, violated her right to due process, and (2) the commissioner erred in determining that she was not totally disabled. We affirm the decision of the board and dismiss the appeal as to the second claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. The plaintiff worked for the defendant employer, St. Lucian's Residence, Inc.,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   as a cook. The plaintiff sustained compensable bilateral shoulder injuries in the course and scope of her employment on May 10, 2011. The defendants accepted compensability for the plaintiff's injuries and paid her temporary total incapacity benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On March 19, 2014, the defendants filed a form 36,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   seeking to discontinue the plaintiff's temporary total disability benefits on the basis that she had \"achieved maximum medical improvement\" as of February 27, 2014. The defendants attached the opinion of the plaintiff's treating physician, Dr. Robert J. Carangelo, to the form 36. Carangelo opined that the plaintiff had reached maximum medical improvement and assigned a 17.5 percent permanent partial disability to her right shoulder and a 12.5 percent permanent partial disability to her left shoulder. At an informal hearing, the commissioner approved the form 36. The plaintiff objected and requested a formal hearing. On February 10, 2015, the plaintiff sent all parties notice of a formal hearing to address the \"Form 36/Discontinuation of Benefits.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On March 11, 2015, the commissioner held a formal hearing on the form 36 to determine whether the plaintiff had achieved maximum medical improvement. At the hearing, the plaintiff neither provided evidence nor argued that she had not reached maximum medical improvement. Instead, the plaintiff testified about her\n   background and her injuries. The following exchange between the plaintiff and her occurred:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"[The Plaintiff's Counsel]: What is your native tongue?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"[The Plaintiff]: Polish....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"[The Plaintiff's Counsel]: How well do you speak English? ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"[The Plaintiff]: A little bit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"[The Plaintiff's Counsel]: How old are you?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"[The Plaintiff]: Fifty-four.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"[The Plaintiff's Counsel]: \"What country did you grow up in?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"[The Plaintiff]: In Poland.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"[The Plaintiff's Counsel]: What is your level of education?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The defendants' counsel then objected, but the commissioner overruled the objection, stating: \"Hang on.

I understand you're claiming that she has an\n   <em>\n    Osterlund\n   </em>\n   claim. That's not on the notice.... I cannot, based on the notice that I have, reach a determination whether she's vocationally disabled or not. And quite frankly, I don't think [the defendants' counsel] is prepared to litigate that any way, but it's not on the notice. We're here to determine whether she was ... at maximum medical improvement on the date the form 36 was granted. I appreciate what you're telling me.... Look, you may have a very good\n   <em>\n    Osterlund\n   </em>\n   claim, but this right now is not the place to litigate it. I'm not suggesting you\n   may or may not do well on that, but what we're here to discuss is the form 36. I can certainly put it down for an\n   <em>\n    Osterlund\n   </em>\n   claim if you want and [the defendants' counsel] can get [a] vocational expert ....

I don't know in advance what it's about. Unfortunately, I didn't handle the prior hearings, so I'm here on what we're here for. You know, [the form 36] was granted a year ago. You could certainly have pursued a vocational claim a year ago. Maybe you didn't have the evidence at that point or not, I don't know, or you could have asked to have that issue advanced.

If you want to pursue [the vocational disability] claim, you're more than welcome to. You may have a very good claim. I'm not suggesting you don't. What I'm suggesting is, we're not going to do that here because the issue is a form 36, and it's a no decision... Just like ... if we were here for something else, I wouldn't let [the defendants] add something on in a surprise to you.... [I]f you want to pursue a vocational disability [claim], I would put this file down for two or three weeks, and you could come and you bring the evidence....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \"[The Plaintiff's Counsel]: I will have the\n   <em>\n    Osterlund\n   </em>\n   claim that you think is appropriate.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   After reiterating that the plaintiff was welcome to introduce evidence to suggest that she was not at maximum medical improvement, the commissioner stated: \"What I'm going to do is put this down for a hearing in three weeks .... The claim you're going to make at that time is [that the plaintiff is] vocationally disabled.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   In his November 10, 2015 decision, the commissioner determined that the plaintiff had reached maximum medical improvement and that she had a work capacity. Accordingly, he granted the form 36, effective as of the date on which the defendants filed it, March 19, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   On November 23, 2015, the plaintiff, without pursuing the vocational total disability claim pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Osterlund\n   </em>\n   as the commissioner had recommended, appealed to the board, arguing that \"the trial commissioner could not rule on a form 36 establishing her attainment of maximum medical improvement without considering whether she was still temporarily totally disabled.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   In its September 14, 2016 decision affirming the commissioner's decision, the board found in relevant part the following: \"Essentially, on March 11, 2015, the [defendants] were prepared to proceed with their arguments in favor of granting the form 36 and the [plaintiff] had not offered notice to the trial commissioner nor to the [defendants] that she was pursuing a claim that she was entitled to total disability based on an\n   <em>\n    Osterlund\n   </em>\n   theory; nor is it clear she had evidence necessary as of that date to establish a prima facie case on such a claim. Under these circumstances the trial commissioner essentially was obligated to follow the precedent in\n   <em>\n    Martinez-McCord\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   , No. 5055, CRB-7-06-2 (February 1, 2007) to rule on the issue which was capable of\n   being addressed at that juncture and bifurcate the issues and\n   address the balance of the issues at a later proceeding. 'Bifurcation of the trial proceedings lies solely with the discretion of the trial court ... and appellate review is limited to a determination of whether this discretion has been abused.'\n   <em>\n    Swenson\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sawoska\n   </em>\n   , [\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"742907\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/18/597/#p601\">\n    18 Conn.

If a new issue or new evidence is considered at a formal hearing, the trial commissioner must offer the opposing party the ability to prepare on the issue and challenge the evidence.

Our Supreme Court stated in\n   <em>\n    Osterlund\n   </em>\n   ... that [a] finding that an employee is able to work at some gainful occupation within his reasonable capacities is not in all cases conclusive that he is not totally incapacitated. If, though he can do such work, his physical condition due to his injury is such that he cannot in the exercise of reasonable diligence find an employer who will employ him, he is just as much totally incapacitated as though he could not work at all.... If, because of the employee's injury, his labor becomes unmarketable, in spite of his diligent efforts to find work, his earning power is gone and he is totally incapacitated....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \"This court previously has stated that [i]n order to receive total incapacity benefits under \u00a7 31-307, a plaintiff bears the burden to demonstrate a diminished earning capacity by showing either that she has made\n   adequate attempts to secure gainful employment\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   that she truly is unemployable.... Whether the plaintiff makes this showing of unemployability by demonstrating that she actively sought employment but could not secure any, or by demonstrating through a nonphysician vocational rehabilitation expert or medical testimony that she is unemployable ... as long as there is sufficient evidence before the commissioner that the plaintiff is unemployable, the plaintiff has met her burden....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \"Whether a claimant is realistically employable requires an analysis of the effects of the compensable injury upon the claimant, in combination with his preexisting talents, deficiencies, education and intelligence levels, vocational background, age, and any other factors which might prove relevant. This is of course the analysis that commissioners regularly undertake in total disability claims ....

In her request for a formal hearing, she only identified \"Form 36/Discontinuation of Benefits\" as an issue for the formal hearing. The form 36 filed by the defendants stated that \"maximum medical improvement\" was the basis for the discontinuation of temporary total benefits. As a result, the March 11, 2015 hearing was scheduled to determine whether the plaintiff had reached maximum medical improvement. As the plaintiff conceded at the hearing, she did not have evidence to rebut the defendants' claim that she had reached maximum medical improvement. Instead, she sought to present evidence in support of an\n   <em>\n    Osterlund\n   </em>\n   claim, without providing fair notice. If the commissioner had let this occur, the defendants would have been subjected to trial by ambuscade, a violation of their cognizable due process right to notice. Thus, the plaintiff's due process claim is further undermined\n   because, as a result of plaintiff's trial tactics, the commissioner was left with no choice but to delay the plaintiff from presenting her vocational total disability claim pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Osterlund\n   </em>\n   in order to protect the defendants' right to due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The plaintiff also claims that the commissioner erred in determining that she was not totally disabled.

For us to now review this claim, as the plaintiff characterizes it, on appeal, would violate the principles of ripeness by prematurely adjudicating a hypothetical claim.

When liability or extent of disability is contested by formal hearing before the commissioner, the claimant shall be entitled, if he prevails on final judgment, to payment for oral testimony or deposition testimony rendered on his behalf by a competent physician, surgeon or other medical provider, including the stenographic and videotape recording costs thereof, in connection with the claim, the commissioner to determine the reasonableness of such charges.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    The plaintiff argues that the commissioner's decision not to allow her to present evidence could have a preclusive effect in later proceedings. She has failed to support this assertion with any authority. At oral argument before this court, the defendants conceded that the plaintiff can still pursue a vocational total disability claim.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    The record does contain some evidence that the plaintiff presented in support of her\n    <em>\n     Osterlund\n    </em>\n    claim. This evidence includes her limited testimony at the March 11, 2015 hearing, her vocational capacity evaluation, and her functional capacity evaluation. We do not know, however, what else she might have testified to, what her neighbor, a purported fact witness, might have testified to, and whether or on what grounds the defendants would rebut this claim.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
