We conclude that the defendant's right to due process was not infringed and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The record reveals the following relevant facts and procedural history. On September 9, 2013, the defendant was arrested pursuant to a warrant for criminal\n   possession of a firearm in violation of \u00a7 53a-217, altering the identification mark of a firearm in violation of \u00a7 29-36, and having a weapon in a motor vehicle in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 2013) \u00a7 29-38. The charges stemmed from the defendant's alleged involvement with an attempted burglary in Stamford (Stamford arrest).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On September 4, 2014, the defendant pleaded guilty, under the\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   doctrine, to criminal possession of a firearm and altering the identification mark of a firearm. The defendant subsequently entered into a\n   <em>\n    Garvin\n   </em>\n   agreement whereby the court agreed to release the defendant on bond while he awaited sentencing and to impose the agreed upon sentence, which was six years incarceration, followed by four years of special parole, so long as he (1) appeared in court for sentencing on December 5, 2014, and (2) was not arrested while out on bond (no new arrests condition). The court advised the defendant that, if he violated a condition of the\n   <em>\n    Garvin\n   </em>\n   agreement, he was no longer entitled to the agreed upon sentence and the court instead could sentence him up to the statutory maximum period of incarceration for the charges to which he pleaded guilty. The court canvassed the defendant as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"Q. Now you're out on bond on these files, sir. You understand you have to be back here on December 5th. Do you understand that, sir?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"A. Yes, sir.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"Q. If you don't come back on that date, I will feel free to sentence you to the maximum term for the charges to which you've plead[ed] [guilty], which is ten years to serve; two [years] mandatory minimum time. Do you understand that, sir?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"A. Yes, sir.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"Q. In addition to that, you would be charged with failure to appear in the first degree, which brings with\n   it an additional five years in the state's prison system. Do you understand that, sir?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"A. Yes, sir.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"Q. Secondarily, if you were to pick up any files between now and the time you are sentenced, be they serious motor vehicle offenses or criminal offenses, I would feel free to sentence you to the maximum term, which is ten years to serve. Do you understand that, sir?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"A. Yes, sir.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"Q. Do you agree to all of that, sir?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"A. Yes, sir.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On December 3, 2014, the sentencing hearing was continued to January 20, 2015. On December 19, 2014, the defendant was arrested in connection with a shooting in the Norwalk-Stamford area and charged with attempt to commit murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49 and 53a-54a (a), reckless endangerment in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-63, criminal possession of a pistol or revolver in violation of General Statutes (Supp. 2014) \u00a7 53a-217c, unlawful discharge of a firearm in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-203, altering the identification mark of a firearm in violation of General Statutes (Supp. 2014) \u00a7 29-36, and stealing a firearm in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-212 (Norwalk arrest).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On October 14, 2015, following numerous continuances, the court held a sentencing hearing on the charges to which the defendant had pleaded guilty under the\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   doctrine as a result of his Stamford arrest. The court noted the\n   <em>\n    Garvin\n   </em>\n   agreement that the\n   defendant had entered into with respect to those charges. The defendant's attorney, Richard Meehan, Jr., then asked the court whether it would (1) consider sentencing the defendant to the original agreed upon disposition, which was six years to serve, followed by four years of special parole, or (2) refrain from sentencing him until the Norwalk case was resolved because he claimed that a third-party witness would exonerate him of those charges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In response to Meehan's request, the court stated that \"[w]hen the\n   <em>\n    Garvin\n   </em>\n   warnings are given-and the\n   <em>\n    Garvin\n   </em>\n   warnings are not predicated upon guilt beyond a reasonable doubt-the\n   <em>\n    Garvin\n   </em>\n   warnings are given with the understanding that if [the defendant is] involved in any kind of subsequent behavior that\n   <em>\n    results in a judge finding probable cause for his arrest\n   </em>\n   , be it a serious motor vehicle matter or a criminal matter, then he has violated the\n   <em>\n    Garvin\n   </em>\n   warnings given by the [c]ourt. That was the agreement he agreed to at the time the\n   <em>\n    Garvin\n   </em>\n   warnings were given, not proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Despite the court's explanation, the defendant failed to argue that his Norwalk arrest was not supported by probable cause or otherwise contest its validity. Nor did the defendant explicitly request a hearing of any kind.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The court then heard from the state, which requested that the court increase the defendant's total sentence to ten years of incarceration. The defendant subsequently made a formal motion to continue the sentencing until the Norwalk case was resolved. The court denied the defendant's motion for continuance and sentenced him to two consecutive five year terms of incarceration for criminal possession of a firearm in violation of \u00a7 53a-217 and altering the identification mark of a firearm in violation of \u00a7 29-36, for a total effective sentence of ten years of incarceration, two years of which were a mandatory minimum period of incarceration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On November 21, 2016, the defendant filed the present appeal. On June 26, 2017, during the pendency of this appeal, the Norwalk case was resolved when the defendant pleaded guilty\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   under the\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   doctrine to criminal possession of a firearm in violation of \u00a7 53a-217 and carrying a pistol without a permit in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 29-35 (a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   On appeal, the defendant claims that the court deprived him of his right to due process by finding that he violated the no new arrests condition of the\n   <em>\n    Garvin\n   </em>\n   agreement and increasing his sentence without first holding a\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   hearing to determine whether his Norwalk arrest was supported by probable cause. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The state contends that this claim is not preserved. The defendant, however, argues that his assertion that he would be exonerated of the charges stemming from his Norwalk arrest was enough to put the court on notice that he was requesting a\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   hearing. We agree with the state that the claim the defendant advances on appeal was not distinctly raised to the trial court and is therefore unpreserved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The defendant's request that his sentencing in the Stamford case be postponed until the ultimate question of his guilt in the Norwalk case was decided is fundamentally different than a request for adjudication by the court regarding the validity of his Norwalk arrest. At no point during the defendant's October 14, 2015 sentencing hearing did the defendant contest whether his Norwalk arrest was supported by probable cause or otherwise challenge the validity of the arrest, despite the court's statement that \"the\n   <em>\n    Garvin\n   </em>\n   warnings are not predicated upon guilt beyond a reasonable doubt-the\n   <em>\n    Garvin\n   </em>\n   warnings are given with the understanding that if [the defendant is] involved in any kind of subsequent behavior that results\n   <em>\n    in a judge finding probable cause for his arrest\n   </em>\n   ... then he has violated the\n   <em>\n    Garvin\n   </em>\n   warnings ....\" (Emphasis added.) We do not mean to suggest that the defendant was required to use the precise phrase, \"I am requesting a\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   hearing,\" in order to preserve his claim. At the very least, however, he needed to put the court on notice that he was\n   challenging the validity of the arrest itself. Because he failed to do so, we conclude that his claim is not preserved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The defendant requests that, in the event we conclude that his claim is not preserved, we review it pursuant to\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"566558\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/213/233/#p239\">\n    213 Conn. 233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 239-40,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=567%20A.2d%20823\">\n    567 A.2d 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989), as modified by\n   <em>\n    In re Yasiel R.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=317%20Conn.%20773\">\n    317 Conn. 773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 781,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20A.3d%201188\">\n    120 A.3d 1188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). Under\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   , \"a defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional\n   magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation ... exists and ... deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\" (Emphasis in original; footnote omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 239-40,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=567%20A.2d%20823\">\n    567 A.2d 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As a threshold matter, we note that the defendant's claim is reviewable under\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   because the record is adequate for review and the claim is of constitutional magnitude. Specifically, the issue of whether the court was required to hold a\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   hearing before finding that the defendant violated the no new arrests condition of the\n   <em>\n    Garvin\n   </em>\n   agreement implicates his constitutional right to due process. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3667007\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/278/1/#p11\">\n    278 Conn. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   7 n.8, 11-13,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=895%20A.2d%20771\">\n    895 A.2d 771\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The defendant cannot satisfy the third prong of\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   , however, because no constitutional violation occurred in the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   We begin by setting forth the legal principles relevant to the defendant's claim. A\n   <em>\n    Garvin\n   </em>\n   agreement is a conditional plea agreement. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415495\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/145/174/\">\n    145 Conn.

If a defendant enters into a\n   <em>\n    Garvin\n   </em>\n   agreement and, thereafter, violates a condition of that agreement, the court may decline to impose the agreed upon sentence and instead increase the defendant's sentence up to his or her maximum statutory exposure.

The defendant further appears to argue that the hearing to which he was entitled would include, in addition to any inquiry regarding whether his Norwalk arrest was supported by probable cause, an opportunity to contest his ultimate criminal liability. In\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   , however, our Supreme Court determined that due process did not\n   require the court to find that the defendant actually committed the postplea offense that led to her arrest before concluding that she violated the\n   <em>\n    Garvin\n   </em>\n   agreement.

Thus, even if the court did conduct a\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   hearing in the present case, any evidence relating to the defendant's ultimate\n   criminal liability would not have altered the court's conclusion that he violated the\n   <em>\n    Garvin\n   </em>\n   agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Moreover, absent any indication that the defendant's Norwalk arrest was not valid, the court was free to consider the arrest at sentencing without first holding a\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"A sentencing judge has very broad discretion in imposing any sentence within the statutory limits ....

Typically, a defendant who enters into a\n    <em>\n     Garvin\n    </em>\n    agreement agrees to a particular sentence of incarceration, but wishes to be at liberty pending sentencing. Thus, the court will release the defendant on bond prior to sentencing and, in exchange, the defendant agrees to abide by certain conditions. Oftentimes, those conditions include a requirement that the defendant appear at the sentencing hearing and refrain from being arrested. If the defendant violates a condition of the\n    <em>\n     Garvin\n    </em>\n    agreement, the court may impose a longer sentence than that to which the defendant originally agreed.
