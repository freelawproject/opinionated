Bar R. XI \u00a7 14 (g) affidavit, it is\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   ORDERED that Fred W. Young is hereby disbarred from the practice of law in the District of Columbia. Disciplinary Counsel has established by clear and convincing evidence that the facts stipulated to by respondent in his Virginia disciplinary proceeding constitute intentional misappropriation of entrusted funds. Further, the presumed discipline for intentional misappropriation is disbarment and disbarment is a substantially different discipline than the three-year suspension imposed by the State of Virginia. Therefore, we find that Disciplinary Counsel has met the requirement of D.C. Bar R \u00a7 11 (c)(4).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Loomis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7266305\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/84/515/\">\n    84 A.3d 515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.C. 2014) (imposing disbarment for misappropriation when the State of California had suspended respondent for two years stayed in favor of a three-year period of probation);\n   <em>\n    In re Sheridan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9431499\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/798/516/\">\n    798 A.2d 516\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.C. 2002) (imposing disbarment for misappropriation when the State of Maryland indefinitely suspended respondent). It is\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FURTHER ORDERED that for purposes of reinstatement the period of respondent's disbarment will not begin to run until such time as he files a D.C. Bar R. XI, \u00a7 14 (g) affidavit.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
