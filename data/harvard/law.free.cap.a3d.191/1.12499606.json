Therein, he claimed that the sentencing statute for second-degree murder, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1102(b), is void for vagueness, in violation of his due process rights under the Constitution of the United States and/or of this Commonwealth.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellant also specifically averred\n   in his\n   <em>\n    Habeas\n   </em>\n   Petition that his claim was not cognizable under the PCRA.\n   <em>\n    Habeas\n   </em>\n   Petition at 1-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The trial court, concluding that Appellant's claim asserted the illegality of his sentence, treated his\n   <em>\n    Habeas\n   </em>\n   Petition as a PCRA petition subject to the PCRA's timeliness provisions. Trial Court Opinion (\"TCO\"), 5/5/17, at 3-4. On that basis, the PCRA court determined that Appellant's petition was untimely, and that none of the PCRA's timeliness exceptions applied. As such, on November 10, 2016, the court issued notice, pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 907, that it intended to dismiss Appellant's\n   <em>\n    Habeas\n   </em>\n   Petition without a hearing. Appellant did not file a response. On January 13, 2017, the trial court entered an order dismissing Appellant's\n   <em>\n    Habeas\n   </em>\n   Petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal. Appellant did not file, and the PCRA court did not order him to file, a Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) statement. The trial court issued its Rule 1925(a) opinion on May 5, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Appellant now presents the following question for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Did the lower court err in construing Appellant's state habeas corpus petition as a 2\n   <sup>\n    nd\n   </sup>\n   PCRA petition (and thereby time-barring it), when the PCRA statutes do not clearly state whether the issue presented is cognizable under the PCRA; whereas the writ of state\n   <em>\n    habeas corpus\n   </em>\n   may be sought to inquire into the cause of detention \"under any pretense whatsoever[?\"]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Appellant's Brief at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   This Court's standard of review regarding an order denying a petition under the PCRA is whether the determination of the PCRA court is supported by the evidence of record and is free of legal error.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

We must begin by addressing the timeliness of Appellant's\n   <em>\n    Habeas\n   </em>\n   Petition, which was construed by the lower court as a PCRA petition, because the PCRA time limitations implicate our jurisdiction and may not be altered or disregarded in order to address the merits of a petition.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v. Bennett\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3250218,3250807\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/593/382/\">\n    593 Pa. 382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3250218,8353109,8353173,3250807\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/930/1264/\">\n    930 A.2d 1264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1267 (2007). Under the PCRA, any petition for post-conviction relief, including a second or subsequent one, must be filed within one year of the date the judgment of sentence becomes final, unless one of the following exceptions set forth in 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(1)(i)-(iii) applies:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    (b) Time for filing petition.-\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (1) Any petition under this subchapter, including a second or subsequent petition, shall be filed within one year of the date the judgment becomes final, unless the petition alleges and the petitioner proves that:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (i) the failure to raise the claim previously was the result of interference by government officials with the presentation of the claim in violation of the Constitution or laws of this Commonwealth or the Constitution or laws of the United States;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (ii) the facts upon which the claim is predicated were unknown to the petitioner and could not have been ascertained by the exercise of due diligence; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (iii) the right asserted is a constitutional right that was recognized by the Supreme Court of the United States or the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania after the time period provided in this section and has been held by that court to apply retroactively.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(1)(i)-(iii). Any petition attempting to invoke one of these exceptions \"shall be filed within 60 days of the date the claim could have been presented.\" 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Instantly, Appellant makes no argument that his\n   <em>\n    Habeas\n   </em>\n   Petition is timely under Section 9545(b)(1). Instead, he claims that the PCRA court erred by construing his\n   <em>\n    Habeas\n   </em>\n   Petition as a PCRA petition. Specifically, he asserts that his void-for-vagueness claim, directed at the sentencing provision for second-degree murder applied in his case, is not cognizable under the PCRA statute and, therefore, that the statute's timeliness provisions do not apply to his\n   <em>\n    Habeas\n   </em>\n   Petition. For the following reasons, we agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Section 9542 provides, in pertinent part, that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   This subchapter provides for an action by which persons convicted of crimes they did not commit and\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     persons serving illegal sentences\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   may obtain collateral relief. The action established in this subchapter\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     shall be the sole means of obtaining collateral relief\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   and encompasses all other common law and statutory remedies for the same purpose that exist when this subchapter takes effect, including habeas corpus....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9542 (emphasis added). Appellant correctly notes that this provision exists in tension with the eligibility-for-relief provisions of the PCRA statute. Section 9543 provides, in pertinent part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    (a) General rule.-\n   </strong>\n   To be eligible for relief under this subchapter, the petitioner must plead and prove by a preponderance of the evidence all of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (1) That the petitioner has been convicted of a crime under the laws of this Commonwealth and is at the time relief is granted:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (i) currently serving a sentence of imprisonment, probation or parole for the crime;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (ii) awaiting execution of a sentence of death for the crime; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (iii) serving a sentence which must expire before the person may commence serving the disputed sentence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (2) That the conviction or sentence resulted from one or more of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (i) A violation of the Constitution of this Commonwealth or the Constitution or laws of the United States which, in the circumstances of the particular case, so undermined the truth-determining process that no reliable adjudication of guilt or innocence could have taken place.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (ii) Ineffective assistance of counsel which, in the circumstances of the particular case, so undermined the truth-determining process that no reliable adjudication of guilt or innocence could have taken place.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (iii) A plea of guilty unlawfully induced where the circumstances make it likely that the inducement caused the petitioner to plead guilty and the petitioner is innocent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   (iv) The improper obstruction by government officials of the petitioner's right of appeal where a meritorious appealable issue existed and was properly preserved in the trial court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (vi) The unavailability at the time of trial of exculpatory evidence that has subsequently become available and would have changed the outcome of the trial if it had been introduced.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (vii)\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The imposition of a sentence greater than the lawful maximum.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (viii) A proceeding in a tribunal without jurisdiction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9543(a) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   There is no dispute that the Appellant's\n   <em>\n    Habeas\n   </em>\n   Petition satisfies Section 9543(a)(1), as Appellant is currently serving a sentence of imprisonment. However, the only provisions of Section 9543(a)(2) that might arguably pertain to sentencing claims which, like the one presented by Appellant in his\n   <em>\n    Habeas\n   </em>\n   Petition, do not also pertain to matters of underlying guilt or innocence, are Sections 9543(a)(2)(vii) and (viii). As the jurisdiction of trial/sentencing court is not in question, that leaves only Section 9543(a)(2)(vii), which permits relief under the PCRA statute for claims involving the \"imposition of a sentence greater than the lawful maximum.\" 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9543(a)(2)(vii). Appellant asserts that the void-for-vagueness claim set forth in the\n   <em>\n    Habeas\n   </em>\n   Petition (essentially a due process claim), does not posit that his sentence exceeds the lawful maximum for second-degree murder and, therefore, is not a claim that is eligible for relief under the PCRA statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The trial court does not indicate in its opinion why it construed Appellant's void-for-vagueness argument as an illegal-sentencing claim that is cognizable under the PCRA. Instead, the court baldly states, without citing any pertinent authority and without offering any analysis, that \"Appellant's issue is cognizable under the PCRA.\" TCO at 3-4. Likewise, the Commonwealth argues that: \"Essentially, [Appellant] claims that he received a sentence greater than the lawful maximum; an issue which is squarely cognizable under the PCRA.\" Commonwealth's Brief at 5. However, the Commonwealth also provides no support for this assertion in its brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Appellant does not explicitly claim that his sentence exceeds the lawful maximum, nor is his claim easily construed as such. Instead, he contends that-in crafting the sentencing statute for second-degree murder-the legislature failed to give adequate or reasonable notice of the penalty for that offense, especially in light of other sentencing provisions, such as the minimum/maximum rule.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   If anything, Appellant is challenging the minimum sentence imposed (that is, that no minimum sentence was imposed); he does not claim that his sentence exceeded the lawful maximum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Nor does Appellant's claim fall within the well-recognized categories of illegal sentencing issues that are cognizable under the PCRA under applicable case law.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   The phrase 'illegal sentence' is a term of art in Pennsylvania Courts that is applied to three narrow categories of cases. Those categories are: \"(1) claims that the sentence fell 'outside of the legal parameters prescribed by the applicable statute'; (2) claims involving merger/double jeopardy; and (3) claims implicating the rule in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Apprendi v.

Additionally, \"[t]his Court has also held that claims pertaining to the Eighth Amendment's Cruel and Unusual Punishment\n   Clause also pertain to the legality of the sentence.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

None of these categories apply to Appellant's issue, which is grounded in due process concerns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Lawrence\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   is instructive here. In that case, the appellant challenged the constitutionality of the sentencing provision for juveniles convicted of murder, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1102.1, arguing,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that the statute violated equal protection and\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   principles.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Lawrence\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6914045\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/99/116/#p122\">\n    99 A.3d at 118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In order to escape waiver concerns, the appellant argued that his claims implicated the legality of his sentence. However, the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Lawrence\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Court determined those issues were not illegal-sentencing claims, despite the fact that they targeted a sentencing statute. The Court reasoned that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   In our view, there is a meaningful difference between the remaining two arguments [the a]ppellant raises in this case and issues pertaining to the Eighth Amendment, merger,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Apprendi\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Alleyne\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . The Eighth Amendment, merger,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Apprendi\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , and even\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Alleyne\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   all directly circumscribe the trial court's sentencing process and sentencing authority. Stated another way, the goal of the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause, the merger doctrine,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Apprendi\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Alleyne\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   is to protect defendants from the imposition of punishments\n   <strong>\n    by trial judges\n   </strong>\n   that are unconstitutional, imposed through unconstitutional processes, or are a \"greater punishment than the legislature intended.\" [\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ]\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Andrews\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , [\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1276823\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/564/321/\">\n    564 Pa. 321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11115540,1276823\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/768/309/\">\n    768 A.2d 309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 313 (2001) ]. However, as is relevant in this case, the Equal Protection Clause and the\n   <em>\n    Ex Post Facto\n   </em>\n   Clauses serve to restrict legislative power. [The a]ppellant does not argue that the trial court did not follow Section 1102.1's mandate or text in carrying out its traditional sentencing function. Nor does Appellant argue that any part of the sentencing process was unconstitutional. Rather, [the a]ppellant argues that the General Assembly passed a statute that, in his view, unconstitutionally treats some juveniles differently than others, and retroactively changes the punishment for the crime after it was committed. These arguments do not address the same concerns as the Eighth Amendment, the merger doctrine,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Apprendi\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Alleyne\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . Because [the a]ppellant's Equal Protection and\n   <em>\n    Ex Post Facto\n   </em>\n   Clause arguments directly seek protection from legislatures, not judges, we hold that these arguments fall into the category of \"a sentencing issue that presents a legal question [rather than a claim that the] sentence [is] illegal.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

It does not challenge the sentencing court's authority or actions insomuch as it challenges the legislature's ostensible failure to provide adequate notice of the penalty for second-degree murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   However, Appellant's void-for-vagueness claim, just like all claims (but for the three categories of illegal-sentencing claims,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Munday\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ), is subject to waiver. \"\n   <em>\n    Habeas corpus\n   </em>\n   is an extraordinary remedy and is available after other remedies have been exhausted or ineffectual or nonexistent. It will not issue if another remedy exists and is available.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth ex rel. Johnson v. Bookbinder\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"785056\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-super/213/335/\">\n    213 Pa.Super. 335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=247%20A.2d%20644\">\n    247 A.2d 644\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 646 (1968). As Appellant's claim could have been raised at his sentencing hearing, or in a post-sentence motion, he failed to exhaust all available remedies before resorting to\n   <em>\n    habeas corpus\n   </em>\n   . Accordingly, we deem his claim waived and, therefore, affirm the trial court's order dismissing his petition on that basis. \"To the extent our legal reasoning differs from the trial court's, we note that as an appellate court, we may affirm on any legal basis supported by the certified record.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

Super. 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Thus, in sum, because Appellant's claim does not challenge the imposition of a sentence in excess of the lawful maximum, it does not fall under the purview of Section 9543(a)(2)(vii). And, to the extent that Section 9543(a)(2)(vii) encompasses all illegal-sentencing issues, Appellant's claim does not implicate any category of illegal sentences previously recognized by Pennsylvania Courts. Moreover, because Appellant's constitutional challenge to Section 1102(b) does not implicate his guilt or innocence for the underlying offense, his void-for-vagueness claim cannot arise under the typical provision used to address constitutional errors, Section 9543(a)(2)(i). Nevertheless, because Appellant could have challenged the constitutionality of Section 1102(b) at sentencing or in a post-sentence motion, he has failed to exhaust all available remedies before seeking relief under\n   <em>\n    habeas corpus\n   </em>\n   . Thus, Appellant effectively waived the issue raised in the\n   <em>\n    Habeas\n   </em>\n   petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Order\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     affirmed\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Section 1102(b) mandates that \"a person who has been convicted of murder of the second degree ... shall be sentenced to a term of life imprisonment.\" Appellant claims that Section 1102(b) is void for vagueness because it fails to give adequate notice that a sentence of life imprisonment is, in fact, life imprisonment\n    <em>\n     without the possibility of parole\n    </em>\n    .\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    Appellant's\n    <em>\n     Habeas\n    </em>\n    Petition, 9/13/16, at 3 (unnumbered pages);\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      but see\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Castle v.
