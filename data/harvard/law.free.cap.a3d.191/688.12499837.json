He also appeals from the aggregate sentence of thirty-five years in prison, thirty of which are subject to the No Early Release Act (NERA), N.J.S.A. 2C:43-7.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant presents the following points of argument:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   POINT I: THE JUDGE'S ANSWER TO THE JURY'S LEGAL QUESTION ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A KNOWING AND A RECKLESS STATE OF MIND WAS FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED, INCLUDING TELLING THE JURY THAT THE TWO ARE \"NOT VERY MUCH DIFFERENT.\" (NOT RAISED BELOW)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   POINT II: A CRIMINAL ATTEMPT CAN ONLY BE COMMITTED WITH A PURPOSEFUL STATE OF MIND; YET THE JURY INSTRUCTION AND RE-INSTRUCTION ON BURGLARY DID NOT MAKE THAT POINT CLEARLY, THUS CONSTITUTING PLAIN ERROR; IF THE ARSON CONVICTIONS ARE REVERSED, THE MERGED BURGLARY CONVICTION MUST BE REVERSED AS WELL. (NOT RAISED BELOW)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   POINT III: THE ARSON CONVICTIONS SHOULD HAVE MERGED. (NOT RAISED BELOW)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   POINT IV: CONSECUTIVE SENTENCES SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN IMPOSED WHEN ONE OVERALL CRIMINAL EPISODE OCCURRED; ALSO, TWO EXTENDED TERMS WERE ILLEGALLY IMPOSED.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We reverse all but one of the arson convictions, because the State violated the rule against multiplicity. Where a defendant\n   sets one fire, it is improper for the State to charge that defendant with multiple counts of arson based on the number of victims who were endangered by the fire. The State may address the harm to the victims by charging the defendant with aggravated assault, attempted murder, or other applicable offenses, in addition to the arson count.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   We affirm defendant's conviction on one count of second-degree arson. We also affirm the burglary conviction. For defendant's one second-degree arson conviction, we affirm the extended-term sentence of twenty years in prison subject to NERA. We also affirm the five-year consecutive sentence imposed for terroristic threats. The additional sentences for arson are hereby vacated. We remand to the trial court for the limited purpose of issuing an amended judgment of conviction consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In light of the limited issues raised, it is not necessary to recount the trial record in detail. Defendant does not challenge the weight of the evidence, which in this case was overwhelming. The State's proofs included security videos of defendant at the crime scene, expert testimony, DNA evidence, cell phone records and threatening text messages, and defendant's statement to the police. Defendant's trial testimony significantly contradicted his earlier statement, and even on a cold record, his testimony could fairly be described as incredible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   We summarize the State's proofs as follows. Defendant was jealous and angry because his former girlfriend, K.G., had ended their sexual relationship and had begun a sexual relationship with defendant's brother. In the days leading up to the fire, and on the day of the fire, defendant sent K.G. text messages threatening to kill her and telling her that she was \"dead.\" On the night of November 3, 2011, defendant broke into the building where K.G. lived in a third-floor apartment, and at a time when defendant's brother was visiting K.G. The break-in was captured on a security video, which showed defendant with his shoes covered by plastic bags and carrying a red can.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On the third floor, defendant poured gasoline directly outside the door of K.G.'s apartment and then poured a line of gasoline down the hallway toward the exit stairway door. He set the gasoline on fire, left the building, and abandoned the red gasoline can, a hat, and some other items in the bed of a nearby truck. The police found those items; defendant's DNA was on the hat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At the time defendant set the fire, he knew that other apartments on the third floor were occupied by elderly and disabled residents. The hallway was engulfed in smoke and flames, temporarily trapping the residents in their apartments. Fortunately, the fire caused the building's sprinkler system to activate, and the flames were quickly extinguished.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendant's first two arguments merit little discussion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   2:11-3(e)(2). We find no plain error with respect to defendant's first point, asserting that the trial judge erred in responding to the jury's question about the difference between \"knowing\" and \"reckless.\" The judge did remark that the knowing and reckless states of mind were \"not very much different.\" However, viewed in context, that comment would not have confused the jury, because the judge also explained in detail and correctly, the difference between the two states of mind. In light of the record, we find no plain error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Second-degree burglary requires proof that defendant entered a structure without permission, with the purpose to commit an offense therein, and that during the course of the burglary, defendant either purposely, knowingly or recklessly inflicted bodily injury on a person, or attempted to inflict injury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.J.S.A. 2C:18-2.

However, in this case, there was overwhelming evidence that during the burglary, defendant purposely attempted to inflict bodily injury on one or more of the residents. He not only entered the building, but\n   he poured gasoline outside K.G.'s door and set it alight. On this record, there is no possibility that the error produced an unjust result.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   2:10-2;\n   <em>\n    Prall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12492165,12460934\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/231/567/\">\n    231 N.J. at 587-88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12492165,12460934\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/231/567/\">\n    177 A.3d 755\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Where it is included, danger to others relates to the degree of the offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.J.S.A. 2C:17-1(a)(1), (3), and (4) (second-degree aggravated arson); N.J.S.A. 2C:17-1(b)(1) (third-degree arson).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Comparison to Other Statutes\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In construing the arson statute, it is also helpful to consider the wording and interpretation of other statutes addressing\n   crimes against property and crimes against persons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The State argues that because second and third degree arson, as defined in N.J.S.A. 2C:17-1(a)(1) and (b)(1), include placing another person in danger, the statute should be construed as permitting multiple charges of arson if multiple victims are endangered. However, when we consider other statutes that include harm to persons as an element, we find the State's argument unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   We begin by considering the way our courts have construed the robbery statute. Theft can be transformed into robbery, if the thief threatens someone with bodily injury or \"[i]nflicts bodily injury or uses force\" on another person, while committing or attempting to commit the theft or while escaping from the scene. N.J.S.A. 2C:15-1(a). Arguably, this portion of the robbery statute was intended to prevent and punish violence against theft victims or bystanders. However, that does not mean that a thief can be charged with multiple counts of robbery if he or she injures or\n   threatens to injure multiple people while committing one theft.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Burglary consists of entering a structure with the purpose to commit an offense therein. N.J.S.A. 2C:18-2. Burglary is a third-degree crime, unless the actor commits or attempts to commit certain additional acts in the course of the burglary. For example, burglary is a second-degree crime if in the course of committing the offense, the actor \"purposely, knowingly or recklessly inflicts, attempts to inflict or threatens to inflict bodily injury on anyone[.]\" N.J.S.A. 2C:18-2(b). However, that does not mean that one burglary can be charged as multiple burglaries if the actor harms or menaces multiple people in the course of committing the burglary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lewis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"367622\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/223/145/#p152\">\n    223 N.J. Super. at 153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=538%20A.2d%20399\">\n    538 A.2d 399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that a second-degree burglary conviction would not merge with convictions for aggravated manslaughter and other offenses, because the crime of burglary \"was completed upon entry\" into the building).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   We also glean insight into the multiplicity issue by considering statutes that unambiguously address crimes against the person. The statutes prohibiting assault and homicide primarily grade offenses against persons based on the degree of harm the actor causes or attempts to cause to the victim. For example, simple assault, a disorderly persons offense, is defined, in part, as attempting to cause or causing \"bodily injury to another,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   N.J.S.A. 2C:12-1(a)(1), while aggravated assault, a second, third or fourth-degree offense, is defined, in part, as causing or attempting to cause \"serious bodily injury to another.\" N.J.S.A. 2C:12-1(b)(1). Portions of the grading section provide that aggravated assault is a higher degree crime if the victim is actually injured.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.J.S.A. 2C:12-1(b). Murder and felony murder are first-degree crimes requiring proof that the actor killed the victim or that the victim was killed while the actor was engaged in committing\n   or attempting to commit certain other enumerated offenses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.J.S.A. 2C:11-3(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   By contrast, second and third-degree arson do not require proof that any victim was actually injured or killed, and the offenses are not graded differently depending on whether victims were threatened with injury, serious injury, or death. In fact, the first-degree arson offenses either require no proof that anyone was endangered, or turn on the use of the structure rather than the degree of danger to the victims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.J.S.A. 2C:17-1(d) (arson for hire); N.J.S.A. 2C:17-1(g) (arson of a place of public worship). The Legislature carefully crafted the statutes on assault and murder, to differentiate the grading and the punishment depending on the degree of harm or attempted harm to the victim. The arson statute is not similarly crafted, suggesting that its primary focus is not on punishing for the harm caused to each individual victim, but on punishing for the act of setting the fire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Because the arson statute does not distinguish between the type or degree of harm to the person, under the State's interpretation, someone who set a fire for the purpose of slightly injuring five people could be punished more harshly than someone who set a fire for the purpose of killing one person. This anomalous result suggests that the State's construction of the arson statute is contrary to the Legislature's intent. It is one thing to punish a crime - such as theft, burglary, or arson - more harshly if people are endangered or hurt while the crime is being committed, and quite another thing to permit multiple charges and multiple punishments without differentiating among the degrees of harm\n   caused to the victims. We conclude that the Legislature intended each act of fire-setting to be charged and punished as one crime, and intended that the injury or intended injury to each victim be charged and punished using the appropriate statutes governing assault or homicide.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   All of the New Jersey published opinions we have found reflect that approach to charging.

In imposing that sentence, the trial court properly considered, as aggravating factors, the number of victims, their vulnerability, and the heinous nature of the crime.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.J.S.A. 2C:44-1(a)(1) (nature and circumstances of the offense); N.J.S.A. 2C:44-1(a)(2) (gravity and seriousness of harm). The crime was particularly heinous because many of the inhabitants were elderly or disabled, and defendant knew of their vulnerable condition. Moreover, defendant set the fire in a manner calculated to trap K.G. in her apartment and cause her death. We affirm the twenty-year NERA sentence for the second-degree arson conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   After reviewing the sentencing transcript, we find that the trial court gave an adequate statement of reasons for imposing a consecutive five-year term for the terroristic threats conviction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.
