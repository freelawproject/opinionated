On February 22, 2013, the General Assembly enacted a bill titled \"An Act Concerning Gas Companies-Rate Regulation-Infrastructure Replacement Surcharge,\" the STRIDE statute, creating an exception to the normal ratemaking process. The law took effect on June 1, 2013. 2013 Md. Laws, ch. 161, \u00a7 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The STRIDE statute created \u00a7 4-210 of the Public Utilities Article. To increase the pace of natural gas infrastructure improvements, promote public safety, and enhance gas pipeline system reliability, the General Assembly created incentives for public service companies to submit STRIDE-compliant infrastructure plans, which would receive more timely cost recovery than would otherwise be available under the traditional rate setting process. Pursuant to the STRIDE statute, a public service company may file \"a plan to invest in eligible infrastructure replacement projects\" with the Commission accompanied by \"a cost-recovery schedule ... that includes a fixed annual surcharge on customer bills to recover reasonable and prudent costs\" of those projects.

PU \u00a7 4-210(d). The proposed 2013 STRIDE plan consisted of four distribution system replacement programs, all of which were located within the company's Maryland service territory. Subsequently on March 10, 2015, Washington Gas filed an application for approval of a proposed amendment to add four new transmission system programs. While the majority of the assets included in the amended application were physically located in Maryland, three proposals contained individual projects located outside of Maryland. Specifically, Transmission Program 1 contained two projects replacing pipeline in Virginia, Transmission Program 2 contained four infrastructure replacement projects in Virginia, and Transmission Program 4 contained six replacement projects in Virginia or Washington, D.C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Commission was required to approve or deny the amended application within 150 days of the amendment's filing. PU \u00a7 4-210(e)(2). The Commission deferred its decision and delegated the matter to a public utility law judge on March 16, 2015. PU \u00a7 3-104(d)(1). The Commission staff and the OPC intervened in the proceeding before the public utility law judge, then-Chief Judge Terry J. Romine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   An evidentiary hearing was held on April 29, 2015, and initial and reply briefs were filed on May 14 and May 21, 2015, respectively. The parties mainly disputed whether Washington Gas could recover costs for infrastructure replacement projects located outside of Maryland through the STRIDE statute. Washington Gas contended that since Maryland customers would benefit from the improvements located outside of\n   Maryland, PU \u00a7 4-210 permitted STRIDE cost recovery on those out-of-state assets. On May 27, 2015, Chief Judge Romine issued an order, concluding that for \"an infrastructure replacement project to be an 'eligible infrastructure replacement' under the STRIDE law,\" and thus qualifying for accelerated cost recovery associated with the project through the STRIDE surcharge mechanism, the project \"must be located on pipeline system located in the State and subject to the Commission's jurisdiction.\" Further, Chief Judge Romine stated that the STRIDE statute \"is clear and unambiguous; the incentive for cost recovery outside a base rate proceeding is available to 'accelerate\n   gas infrastructure improvements in the State.' \" Since Transmission Programs 1, 2, and 4 included infrastructure located outside of Maryland, Chief Judge Romine denied STRIDE cost recovery for the out-of-state portions of the amended STRIDE plan. Washington Gas appealed the order to the full Commission, arguing that the company should be entitled to accelerated recovery of costs for parts of the projects not located in the State of Maryland. PU \u00a7 3-113(d)(2)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In a July 2, 2015 order, the full Commission affirmed Chief Judge Romine's legal analysis, determining that Washington Gas may not recover costs associated with out-of-state projects under the STRIDE statute and that recovery was limited to improvements physically located in Maryland. The full Commission found that \"PU \u00a7 4-210(b) of the STRIDE Law clearly expresses the legislative intent behind the statute\" and \"[t]o interpret \u00a7 4-210(b) any other way would be contrary to accepted principles of statutory construction, and would render the words 'in the State' meaningless.\" The Commission concluded that that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   [t]he Company may include the appropriate Maryland-allocated share of out-of-state projects in the rate base in its next rate case, as has been the Company's practice, but there is no basis to accelerate cost recovery for improvements that the General Assembly did not intend to make eligible under the STRIDE [statute].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Washington Gas then petitioned for judicial review of the Commission's decision to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County on July 30, 2015. PU \u00a7 3-201(b). After holding a hearing, the Honorable Joseph M. Quirk entered an order and accompanying opinion on March 23, 2016 denying the petition for judicial review and affirming the final order of the Commission. Judge Quirk concluded that the legislative intent section of the STRIDE statute is unambiguous and dispositive of the issue. Additionally, Judge Quirk stated that the adoption of Washington Gas's argument would \"cause [the] STRIDE[ ] [statute's] narrow exception to the normal ratemaking process to swallow the rule, effectively permitting concurrent recovery of costs incurred by gas companies if the public utility could show that the utility company actions had\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   bearing on Maryland's overall infrastructure safety.\" (Emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Washington Gas appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. The Court of Special Appeals examined both the plain text and legislative history of PU \u00a7 4-210.\n   <em>\n    Washington Gas Light Co. v. Md. Pub. Serv.

Parties' Contentions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Washington Gas argues that the Commission, the circuit court, and the Court of Special Appeals incorrectly interpreted the STRIDE statute for three principal reasons. First, Washington Gas asserts that the Commission's interpretation of the STRIDE statute violated rules of statutory construction because the Commission did not apply the statutorily defined and unambiguous term \"eligible infrastructure replacement.\" Washington Gas asserts that there is no dispute among the parties and the tribunals that Washington Gas met the STRIDE statute's five criteria found in PU \u00a7 4-210(a)(3) and, as such, the projects should be approved as \"eligible infrastructure replacement.\" Second, Washington Gas argues that the Commission's reliance on the legislative intent provision, PU \u00a7 4-210(b), and its \"in the State\" language was misapplied because PU \u00a7 4-210(b) is a preamble. According to Washington Gas, the \"sole purpose of the legislative intent provision is to guide the Court's interpretation of ambiguous terms in the controlling sections of the law.\" Washington Gas asserts that since the statute's five eligibility criteria are unambiguous, it was improper to combine the ambiguous legislative intent provision with the \"controlling section of the law.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kent v. Somervell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1737054\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/g-j/7/265/#p274\">\n    7 G. &amp; J. 265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 274 (1835). Lastly, Washington Gas argues that \"even if principles of statutory construction allow a legislative intent provision to be used as a substantive part of the statute, the Commission should have applied the interpretation of the legislative intent provision that is most consistent\n   with the other, unambiguous provisions of [the] STRIDE [statute].\" Washington Gas asserts that the legislative intent provision should reflect the General Assembly's desire to \"accelerate projects that would result in safety and reliability improvements for Maryland gas customers\" instead of imposing a geographic limitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Regarding legislative intent, Washington Gas concedes that STRIDE projects located outside of Maryland were not discussed or debated during the STRIDE statute's legislative hearing and floor proceedings. Further, Washington Gas notes that it assisted in the drafting of the statute and that if out-of-state projects had been broached during debate, the company's representatives would have addressed the importance of not limiting STRIDE projects based upon geographic location since Maryland customers benefit from these out-of-state projects. In summary, Washington Gas asserts that there is nothing in the legislative history which proves the Commission's interpretation that the law applies solely to projects physically located in Maryland.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Commission's argument is straightforward: the General Assembly used explicit, unambiguous language that limited accelerated cost recovery projects to those projects physically located in Maryland. OPC agrees with the Commission's argument and further contends that the legislative intent section is an operative part of the STRIDE statute and is not a preamble. In support, OPC points to Washington Gas's repeated acknowledgement in its brief that acceleration of infrastructure replacement is a vital component of PU \u00a7 4-210 even though \"accelerate,\" like the phrase \"in the State,\" only appears in PU \u00a7 4-210(b). As an alternative argument, OPC asserts that even if the legislative intent section is considered a preamble, a preamble is still allowed to confine the breadth of a statute if there is no conflict between the preamble and an express statutory provision.\n   <em>\n    Consolidated Real Estate and Fire Ins.

OPC counters Washington Gas's argument, stating that since Washington Gas helped draft the STRIDE statute, one would expect the statute to clearly support Washington Gas's current position.

In the 2011 Session, Senate Bill 332, and the cross-filed House Bill 856, had hearings in their respective committees, Senate Finance Committee and House Economic Matters Committee, but were subsequently withdrawn. Of note, the unsuccessful 2011 legislation contained this statement of legislative intent: \"The General Assembly finds and declares that the purpose of this section is to promote gas infrastructure improvements in the State by establishing a mechanism for gas companies to promptly\n   recover investments in eligible infrastructure replacement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In the 2012 Session, Senate Bill 541, cross-filed as House Bill 662, received a favorable report with amendments from the Senate Finance Committee but failed on a rare procedural second reading vote on the Senate floor. After the Senate floor defeat, House Bill 662 passed the House with amendments but then received an unfavorable report from the Senate Finance Committee because the Senate bill had already failed on the procedural second reader vote. The 2012 legislation modified the statement of legislative intent: \"It is the intent of the General Assembly that the purpose of this section is to accelerate gas infrastructure improvements in the State by establishing a mechanism for gas companies to promptly recover reasonable and prudent costs of investments in eligible infrastructure replacement projects separate from base rate proceedings.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The following year, Senate Bill 8, cross-filed as House Bill 89, was passed into law. Senate Bill 8 contained the exact legislative intent language as well as the eligible infrastructure replacement definition found in the 2012 legislation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2013 Md. Laws, ch. 161. Interestingly, Senate Bill 8 Fiscal Note highlighted accidents occurring \"\n   <em>\n    in Maryland\n   </em>\n   from 2002 through 2011, totaling $12 million in property damage and causing one fatality and 16 injuries.\" Senate Bill 8 Fiscal Note, at 6 (emphasis added). Nothing in Senate Bill 8 Fiscal Note suggested that legislators contemplated out-of-state projects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   During deliberations for Senate Bill 8, organizations, including Washington Gas, submitted position statements. In its position statement's introduction, Washington Gas commented that many individuals and entities \"have spent the past two years discussing ... the need to speed up the replacement of aging natural gas infrastructure in Maryland.\" Washington Gas stated that the replacement of gas infrastructure was necessary because \"Maryland ranks ninth (1,422 miles) in the U.S. of states with the largest amount of cast iron gas pipes. ... Of the eight states with larger amounts of cast iron pipe, seven of them have accelerated pipeline replacement programs similar to what this bill would establish.\" Additionally, Washington Gas's position statement asserted that in total \"30 states and the District of Columbia [ ] have passed legislation, or regulation to do what S[enate] B[ill] 8 seeks to do.\" Of note, Washington Gas observed that \"Maryland residents support this surcharge mechanism as a way of paying for the replacement of older pipeline systems.\" Supporting this argument, Washington Gas references letters of support, including those from \"seven mayors representing older, predominantly African-American\n   <em>\n    communities in Prince George's County that have aging pipe in service\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added). Washington Gas concluded by commenting that a \"significant portion of the entire nation's energy infrastructure is old\n   <em>\n    and Maryland is no exception\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added). Clearly, Washington Gas did not discuss using the STRIDE statute with regard to out-of-state infrastructure projects. Washington Gas's argument\n   focused on the benefits to Maryland customers but only in reference to problems with infrastructure located in Maryland.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Another public service company, Baltimore Gas and Electric (\"BGE\"), submitted a position statement in support of Senate Bill 8, \"arguing that \"[s]ignificant and sustained investment is needed to replace outdated gas infrastructure in Maryland.\" BGE detailed that its \"650,000 natural gas customers [are] served by 7,000 miles of gas mains covering approximately 800 square miles across Central Maryland.\" BGE also stressed that \"Maryland has the\n   opportunity to join the dozens of other states that have recognized the policy priority of accelerating the replacement of outmoded gas delivery infrastructure.\" In listing some of the significant benefits to Maryland, BGE concluded that the bill would create new jobs in Maryland and a safer, more reliable gas system. BGE, like Washington Gas, described issues with gas lines located in Maryland, making specific references to the amount of mileage of BGE gas lines in Maryland, in its support for the STRIDE statute but did not discuss out-of-state infrastructure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The U.S. Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (\"PHMSA\") submitted a position statement supporting the passage of Senate Bill 8. In its statement, PHMSA emphasized that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   3019 miles of gas distribution pipeline in Maryland were installed prior to 1960 which equates to one out of every five miles. These pipelines have been in the ground for over 50 years. Cast iron, which can be prone to failure, made up nearly 10 percent of Maryland's natural gas distribution mains. Only five States have more cast iron pipe than Maryland and according to a 2011 survey by the National Association of Pipeline Safety Representatives, Maryland is the only state in the top 10 that does not have cost recovery mechanisms for cast iron replacement programs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In its position statement, the Commission did not support or oppose the legislation but rather suggested informational comments and recommended technical amendments. The Commission reiterated its duty \"to ensure a safe and reliable distribution\n   infrastructure throughout the State\" and recognized \"the importance of upgrading the State's gas pipeline infrastructure.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   OPC opposed the STRIDE statute and in its position statement argued that \"a surcharge mechanism, in addition to base rates,\" was not \"needed to ensure the delivery of safe and reliable service by natural gas companies.\" Later in its position statement, OPC stated that \"[e]ven if a gas utility faces a major and sudden need for reliability or safety improvements (and there is no evidence of such a problem in Maryland), utility regulatory accounting requires that these rising expenses be normalized, that is, the rates should reflect only capital expenditures that are in excess of the Company's normal capital spending.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In response to opposition to the STRIDE statute, the bill file contains two pieces of literature sponsored by the gas distribution industry. First, a document entitled \"Pass Strategic Infrastructure Development and Enhancement (STRIDE) and STRIDE FORWARD to accelerate upgrades to Maryland's natural gas infrastructure\" noted that \"Maryland lags behind other states in driving accelerated upgrades of its natural gas pipes.\" The document stressed that a majority of states have already adopted measures for accelerated natural gas pipeline replacement programs and that the PHMSA applauded Maryland's efforts to explore similar acceleration measures such as Senate Bill 8. Similarly, the second document is entitled \"STRIDE: In Step with AARP's Consumer Safeguards.\" In the introductory paragraph, the document stated that \"STRIDE (Maryland Senate Bill 8 and House Bill 89) is a proposal\n   <em>\n    to replace Maryland's outmoded, leak-prone gas pipes\n   </em>\n   at much faster rates and at the least possible cost to utility customers.\" (Emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The resounding theme of the proponents' testimony emphasized that Maryland was one of few states between 2011\n   and 2013 that had not adopted accelerated cost recovery for gas infrastructure replacement systems. Moreover, the testimony urged passage of the STRIDE statute because Maryland had\n   and continues to have outdated gas pipe lines which need to be replaced for safety purposes. Therefore, while the legislative history does not specifically indicate that the legislation was intended only to apply to projects within state lines, each of the documents in the bill file focus on the goal of replacing the gas pipes and related infrastructure within the State of Maryland specifically. As such, this Court recognizes that the legislative history supports the interpretation that the General Assembly intended to accelerate cost recovery for infrastructure replacement projects located within Maryland. Stated another way, there is nothing in the legislative history to support the theory that the STRIDE statute was enacted for accelerated cost recovery for improvements made outside of the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Finally, at oral argument, Washington Gas argued that the STRIDE statute should be viewed as analogous to Virginia's cost-allocation statute, the Steps to Advance Virginia's Energy Plan (\"SAVE\") Act, which allows for accelerated cost recovery for out-of-state projects.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   While the SAVE Act is similar to the STRIDE statute,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   the SAVE Act does not reference geography anywhere in its text.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2056-603\">\n    Va.
