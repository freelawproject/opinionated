One method of attacking a witness's credibility is impeachment. In this opinion, we address two questions of Maryland evidentiary law pertaining to impeaching witness credibility. First, we consider\n   whether a witness's statement that another witness \"would not tell the truth about certain things[,]\" was admissible as a personal opinion about that witness's character for untruthfulness. Second, we explore the admissibility of out-of-court threats as nonhearsay evidence of bias.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2008, Julius Devincentz, Jr. and Y.D. began a romantic relationship. Y.D., her daughter K.C., and her son S., moved into Devincentz's home in Elkton, Maryland from Pennsylvania. Devincentz's children, Brianna, Joshua, and Kenny also lived at the house. Devincentz and Y.D. lived together with their children as a blended family until the couple separated in November 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In April 2015, K.C. left the Devincentz home and went to the Maryland Salem Children's Trust, a residential facility for juveniles. Some months into her stay, in September 2015, K.C. told her therapist that Devincentz had sexually abused her when she was six or seven years old. The therapist reported K.C.'s allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The State charged Devincentz with one count of continuing course of conduct against a child, two counts of sexual abuse of a minor, one count of second-degree sexual offense, one count of third-degree\n   sexual offense, one count of fourth-degree sexual offense, and one count of second-degree assault. In 2016, Devincentz was tried in the Circuit Court for Cecil County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   K.C. was the State's primary witness. She testified that, on multiple occasions, when she was about seven years old, and nobody else was home, Devincentz\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   would watch porn on our desktop computer in the living room, and he would ask me to come over and sit on his lap, and I would be scared and sometimes I would say no, and he would force me to sit on his lap, and he would touch me in my private area.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   K.C. testified that Devincentz placed his hand underneath her clothes and underwear and touched the inside of her vagina\n   for approximately 10 or 15 minutes. Afterward, Devincentz told her not to tell anyone. She also testified that Devincentz watched pornography on the computer while other members of the household were present. Two or three weeks after the first incident, Devincentz again digitally penetrated K.C. while she was in bed. K.C. told Devincentz that she did not like it, asked him to get away from her, and threatened to tell her mother. Devincentz gave K.C. a five-dollar bill and told her not to say anything.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   K.C. also alleged that when she was around 10 or 12 years old, on several occasions, Devincentz offered her money to lift up her shirt. She always refused to do so. She testified that on one occasion he slapped and grabbed her bottom. K.C. explained that she did not report Devincentz's actions out of fear that she \"was going to get physically hurt\" and because she did not want to ruin her mother's relationship with Devincentz.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   K.C. testified that she and Devincentz argued about her attitude, disputes with others in the household, her noncompliance with his requests to do chores, and her failure to do things the way he wanted. On cross-examination, K.C. acknowledged that she \"was a very angry person,\" and that she \"would butt heads a lot.\" K.C. explained that she clashed with Devincentz because \"he was very demanding,\" she \"didn't like the tone of voice he would use[,]\" and \"because he hurt\" her. She attributed her difficulties with others in the house to the strain of keeping the abuse secret. K.C. stated that she did not get along with Joshua because he was \"hardheaded,\" and he did not like her family. K.C. wanted to move back to Pennsylvania and live with her father. K.C. explained that she did not disclose the abuse earlier because she was afraid of Devincentz and Joshua. She stated that Joshua \"posed a threat\" to her, but that \"nobody threatened [her].\" Joshua would \"scream at her and [get] in [her] face.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After the State rested, defense counsel called Joshua. The State objected because defense counsel had not provided prior notice of the witnesses he planned to call and refused to proffer the subject matter of their testimony. Defense counsel contended that the State received notice because both witnesses were issued subpoenas. The State explained that it sought a proffer \"because if these witnesses are character witnesses, this may open the door for impeachment purposes.\" The trial judge overruled the State's objection and permitted the defense to call its witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Joshua testified consistently with K.C. about the composition of the Devincentz household. He explained that K.C. \"never really liked [Devincentz],\" she \"didn't like\n   [Devincentz's] rules ... [and s]he wanted to be able to do whatever she wanted ....\" Joshua witnessed arguments between Devincentz and K.C. Defense counsel attempted to elicit testimony about an argument that occurred after K.C. stole a cell phone. The State objected on the grounds of relevance. Defense counsel proffered that Joshua witnessed the argument and that \"[i]t goes to motive.\" The trial judge ruled that Joshua could testify about the argument, but not about K.C.'s alleged theft because he lacked first-hand knowledge. The following exchange occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [\n   <strong>\n    Defense Counsel\n   </strong>\n   ]: I asked you a question about the cell phone situation. Without characterizing how that came up, as a result of that argument, what occurred?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [\n   <strong>\n    Joshua\n   </strong>\n   ]: [K.C.] was unhappy with [Devincentz]'s decision on the argument. And once it was resolved by a third party\n   <strong>\n    [, K.C.] was yelling and screaming and saying things that she could do that would get him in trouble.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [\n   <strong>\n    Prosecutor 1\n   </strong>\n   ]: Objection.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [\n   <strong>\n    Prosecutor 2\n   </strong>\n   ]: Objection.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    The Court\n   </strong>\n   : Sustained.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [\n   <strong>\n    Defense Counsel\n   </strong>\n   ]: Now, were those things that you heard?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   [\n   <strong>\n    Joshua\n   </strong>\n   ]: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (Emphasis added). Defense counsel did not make a proffer after the trial judge sustained the objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Joshua testified that he never saw anyone using the family computer to look at pornographic material and never saw such material stored on the computer. Defense counsel then asked about K.C.'s relationships with other family members.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [\n   <strong>\n    Defense Counsel\n   </strong>\n   ]: Now, would it be fair to say that [K.C.] had problems not only with [Devincentz,] but with other people in the family?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [\n   <strong>\n    Joshua\n   </strong>\n   ]: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   [\n   <strong>\n    Defense Counsel\n   </strong>\n   ]: Would you describe what you mean by that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   [\n   <strong>\n    Joshua\n   </strong>\n   ]: [K.C.] had a problem with her mouth. [K.C.] would say things to people, about people, and then she would like to argue with you.\n   <strong>\n    And she would not tell the truth about certain things.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   [\n   <strong>\n    The State\n   </strong>\n   ]: Objection.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    The Court\n   </strong>\n   : I'll sustain that. But [K.C.] would argue with people, right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [\n   <strong>\n    Joshua\n   </strong>\n   ]: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    The Court\n   </strong>\n   : Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [\n   <strong>\n    Joshua\n   </strong>\n   ]: And [K.C.] would give her side[,] and then there would be the other person's side.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   [\n   <strong>\n    Defense Counsel\n   </strong>\n   ]: I have nothing further, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   (Emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The jury found Devincentz guilty of sexual abuse of a minor and second-degree assault, but acquitted him of the charge of a continuing course of conduct against a child. The trial court sentenced him to 25 years in prison for the sexual abuse of a minor, and a consecutive 10 years for second-degree assault.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Devincentz appealed. In an unreported decision, the Court of\n   Special Appeals affirmed his conviction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Devincentz v. State\n   </em>\n   , No. 1297, Sept.

An appellate court will not \"decide any other issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court ....\" Md. Rule 8-131(a). The Court of Special Appeals concluded that Devincentz had not preserved either issue relating to Joshua's testimony for review because defense counsel did not make a proffer regarding\n   the relevance or substance of the excluded testimony.\n   <em>\n    Devincentz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204231583\">\n    2017 WL 4231583\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3. Devincentz and the State agree that the absence of a proffer does not bar appellate review when the substance and relevance of the excluded evidence is apparent from the context. Devincentz avers that Joshua's testimony and the circumstances of the trial satisfied these criteria, and the State disagrees. Maryland Rule 5-103(a)(2) requires that, to preserve a claim that a trial court erroneously excluded evidence, the party must be prejudiced by the ruling and \"the\n   <strong>\n    substance of the evidence was made known to the court by offer on the record or was apparent from the context within which the evidence was offered\n   </strong>\n   .\" (Emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The most common method of preserving a claim that the trial court erred is to proffer the substance and relevance of the excluded evidence.\n   <em>\n    Merzbacher v.

Although I agree with the Majority that Julius Devincentz, Jr., Petitioner, preserved the instant issues for appellate review, I disagree with the Majority's resolution of the merits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Maj. Op. at 533-35, 191 A.3d at 381-82. I would hold that the Circuit Court for Cecil County did not err or abuse its discretion in sustaining the prosecutors' objections to Joshua Devincentz (\"Joshua\")'s testimony-namely, that the alleged victim, K.C., \"would not tell the truth about certain things[,]\" and that K.C. was \"saying things that she could do that would get [Devincentz] in trouble.\" In my view, both instances of Joshua's testimony were inadmissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Joshua's testimony-that K.C., \"would not tell the truth about certain things\"-was not admissible under Maryland Rule 5-608(a)(1) or Maryland Rule 5-405(a). Maryland Rule 5-608(a)(1) provides: \"[A] character witness may testify (A) that the witness has a reputation for untruthfulness, or (B) that, in the character witness's opinion, the witness is an untruthful person.\" Maryland Rule 5-405(a) states: \"In all cases in which evidence of character ... of a person is admissible, proof may be made by testimony as to reputation or by testimony in the form of an opinion.\" Joshua was not asked whether K.C. had a reputation for being untruthful, or whether, in his opinion, K.C. was an untruthful person, and he did not testify as such. To the contrary, in response to a question as to whether K.C. had \"problems\" with her family members other than Devincentz, Joshua testified, among things, that K.C. \"would not tell the truth about certain things.\" At best, it is unclear whether Joshua intended to testify regarding specific instances of untruthfulness by K.C., was passing on hearsay information about K.C., or simply speculating for no reason at all that K.C. would not tell the truth about certain things. The contention that Joshua was attempting to give testimony about K.C.'s reputation for untruthfulness, or to give \"personal opinion testimony\" about K.C. being an untruthful person, is based wholly on conjecture and is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Devincentz's counsel did not attempt to elicit from Joshua that, in his opinion, K.C. was an untruthful person, or that K.C. had a reputation for untruthfulness. Such testimony would have been admissible under Maryland Rules 5-608(a)(1)(A) and (B) and 5-405(a). It is evident that Devincentz's counsel did not ask for, and Joshua did not give, testimony as to his opinion of K.C. as an untruthful person or\n   her reputation. Instead, Devincentz's counsel asked Joshua to describe K.C.'s \"problems\" with her family members other than Devincentz; and, after being asked that question, Joshua testified, at the end of a list of other things, that K.C. \"would not tell the truth about certain things.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Majority improperly concludes that Joshua's testimony was \"a personal opinion[.]\" Maj.

Op. at 543, 191 A.3d at 387 (footnotes omitted) (last alteration and ellipsis in original). To point out that the Majority's reasoning is flawed would be an understatement.

Nor did Joshua testify that K.C. had a \"general behavior pattern\" of being untruthful. Joshua simply testified that K.C. was untruthful \"about certain things.\" Obviously, character testimony need not be given in specific or formulaic phrases. The problem with Joshua's testimony is not that he failed to use particular words; the problem is that, unlike the witness in\n   <em>\n    Jensen\n   </em>\n   , Joshua was never asked and never testified, in any way, about whether he had an opinion as to K.C.'s untruthfulness. Joshua's testimony-that \"[K.C.] had a problem with her mouth. [K.C.] would say things to people, about people, and then she would like to argue with you. And [K.C.] would not tell the truth about certain things\"-in no way satisfied the requirements of Maryland Rules 5-608(a)(1)(A) and (B) and 5-405(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Similarly, I would hold that the circuit court did not err or abuse its discretion in sustaining the prosecutors' objections to Joshua's testimony that K.C. was \"saying things that she could do that would get [Devincentz] in trouble.\" Devincentz was not entitled to offer K.C.'s statement as evidence of alleged bias against him under Maryland Rule 5-616(b)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Maryland Rule 5-616(b)(3) states: \"Extrinsic evidence of bias, prejudice, interest, or other motive to testify falsely may be admitted whether or not the witness has been examined about the impeaching fact and has failed to admit it.\" Maryland Rule 5-616(b)(3) establishes that a witness need not be confronted with, and have failed to admit, evidence of bias, prejudice, interest, or other motive to testify falsely for such evidence to be found admissible. As such, Maryland Rule 5-616(b)(3) establishes only that such evidence may be admitted without the requirements set forth in Maryland Rule 5-613(a) and (b) that the evidence be disclosed to the witness, the witness have an opportunity to deny or explain same, and the witness failed to admit having made the alleged statement. Maryland Rule 5-616(b)(3) does not override Maryland Rule 5-802, which provides that hearsay is inadmissible \"[e]xcept as otherwise provided by these rules or permitted by applicable constitutional provisions or statutes[.]\" In other words, Maryland Rule 5-616(b)(3) does not provide that evidence of bias shall be automatically admitted, regardless of whether the evidence is hearsay or otherwise subject to exclusion under the Maryland\n   Rules,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Joshua's testimony regarding K.C.'s statement was not exempt from the rule against hearsay simply because the alleged statement potentially pertained to K.C.'s bias against Devincentz.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   K.C.'s statement was hearsay because Devincentz offered it to prove the truth of the matter asserted-namely, that K.C. could, in fact, do \"things ... that would get [Devincentz] in trouble.\" At trial, Devincentz's theory of the case was that K.C. had falsely accused him of abuse because she wanted to leave his household. During Devincentz's opening statement, his counsel informed the jury that the reason that the charges were brought was that K.C. had an agenda, that she wanted to live with her biological father, and that Devincentz and her mother blocked her effort. Similarly, Devincentz's counsel stated during closing argument that: \"[K.C.] wanted to live somewhere else. [K.C.] wanted away from this household. [K.C.] wanted away from [ ] Devincentz. And guess what. [K.C.]'s there. If [K.C.] hadn't made these allegations, she\n   wouldn't be there.\" Clearly, Joshua's testimony that K.C. was \"saying things ... that would get [Devincentz] in trouble\" directly supported Devincentz's theory of the case. Specifically, Joshua's testimony was offered as proof of Devincentz's position that K.C.'s allegation of abuse was an attempt to get him \"in trouble\" so that she could leave his household. Simply put, Devincentz's counsel did not assert that K.C. fabricated her allegations of abuse because she disliked Devincentz or was biased against him. Devincentz's counsel set forth a theory of the case that K.C. falsely accused him of abuse because she wanted to leave his household, and introduced Joshua's testimony to prove the point. There is no Maryland case law that supports the proposition that, where a witness provides testimony in support of a defendant's theory of the case, the testimony may be interpreted not to be proof of the truth of the matter asserted, but rather evidence of the witness's bias.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   The Majority opines that Devincentz offered K.C.'s statement not to prove that she could get him in trouble, but instead as impeachment evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Maj.

K.C.'s statement that she could do things to get Devincentz in trouble was evidence that she did exactly what he contended at trial that she did-namely, make up an allegation of abuse so that she would move out of his household.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Devincentz did not offer K.C.'s statement to impeach her-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , to show that she was generally untruthful. To the contrary, Devincentz's position was that K.C.'s statement was true-that she, in fact, did something to get him in trouble, in the form of falsely accusing him of abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Similarly, I would conclude that K.C.'s statement is not subject to the then-existing mental, emotional, or physical condition hearsay exception,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the \"statement of intent\" hearsay exception, which generally applies to \"[a] statement of the declarant's then[ ]existing state of mind ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   (such as intent, plan, motive, design, mental feeling, pain, and bodily health), offered to prove the declarant's then[-]existing condition or the declarant's future action[.]\" Md. R. 5-803(b)(3). A statement is not subject to the \"statement of intent\" hearsay exception where the statement is too \"remote[ ] in time\" from the future action that the declarant stated that he or she would take.\n   <em>\n    McCray v.

Because \"the duration of states of mind or emotion varies with the particular attitudes or feelings at issue and with the cause,\" the time between the declarant's statement of intent and the declarant's action must be short enough for there to be \"some probability\" that the declarant's state of mind when he or she made the statement of intent was the same by the time that the declarant took the future action that he or she stated that he or she would take.\n   <em>\n    Robinson v.

Given that K.C.'s statement occurred during, or shortly after, an argument between her and Devincentz, the statement must have occurred while K.C. lived at Devincentz's house. Thus, K.C.'s statement apparently occurred sometime during the approximately six-and-a-half years between October 2008, when she moved into Devincentz's house, and April 2015, when K.C. moved out of Devincentz's house. The length of this timeframe is considerable, and strongly weighs in favor of a determination that K.C.'s statement was far too remote in time from the future action that K.C. allegedly indicated that she would take.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Even if Devincentz is given the benefit of the doubt, and it is assumed that K.C.'s statement occurred right before she moved out of Devincentz's house in April 2015, that leaves approximately five months between April 2015 and September 17, 2015, when K.C. told her therapist that Devincentz had abused her. A statement of intent that a declarant makes approximately five months before the action that he or she stated that he or she would take is too remote in time to be subject to the \"statement of intent\" hearsay exception. If approximately one month is too long a timeframe,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2260628\" index=\"352\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/66/246/#p258\">\n    66 Md.

Even if Devincentz had established that K.C.'s statement occurred right before she moved out of his house-which, again, he did not-K.C.'s statement would still be too remote in time to qualify for the \"statement of intent\" hearsay exception.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   In addition to the significant timeframe between K.C.'s statement and her allegation of abuse, the circumstances under which K.C. first alleged abuse indicate that the \"statement of intent\" hearsay exception is inapplicable. Devincentz's theory of the case was that K.C. falsely accused him of abuse so that she could leave his household-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , stop living with him. K.C.'s allegation of abuse, however, did not occur while K.C. was living in Devincentz's house. Instead, K.C.'s allegation of abuse occurred while K.C. was living at the residential program at the Maryland Salem Children's Trust. As such, K.C. no longer had the need to make an allegation of abuse to change her living arrangements with Devincentz. Additionally, K.C. made her allegation of abuse not to a law enforcement officer, but instead to a therapist. Thus, the method through which K.C. alleged abuse did not demonstrate an intent to get Devincentz \"in trouble,\" but rather demonstrated that K.C. sought treatment for the alleged abuse. These circumstances, like the attenuation in time between the statement and K.C.'s report of Devincentz's alleged abuse to her therapist, lead to the conclusion that the \"statement of intent\" hearsay exception does not apply, and that the circuit court properly excluded Joshua's testimony that K.C. was \"saying things that she could do that would get [Devincentz] in trouble.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   In my view, the majority opinion effectively eviscerates the requirements of Maryland Rules 5-608(a)(1)(A) and (B) and 5-405(a), and leads to a situation in which any time a witness utters testimony referring to another witness, with whom he or she is familiar, as not truthful that testimony would be construed to be \"a personal opinion\" and admissible. And, the majority opinion disregards the rules with respect to hearsay evidence. Although, as the majority opinion states, \"the trial of any case is a search for truth,\" Maj.
