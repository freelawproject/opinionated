Md. Code (1992, 2015 Rep. Vol.), Bus. Reg. (\"BR\") \u00a7 7-301,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   The overarching issue presented in these consolidated cases is whether MCALA, as revised by the 2007 departmental bill, is constrained to the original scope of collection agencies seeking consumer claims or whether the revised statutory language propels MCALA requirements across the threshold of the mortgage debt arena, requiring principal actors of Maryland's mortgage market to obtain a collection agency license.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   MCALA was first enacted in 1977 to protect Maryland consumers from abusive debt collection practices employed by the collection agency industry. 1977 Md. Laws, ch. 319. The Act specifically defined \"collection agencies\" as entities engaged in the practice of collecting consumer debts for others, excluding those entities collecting debts they owned. Pursuant to MCALA, these third-party debt collectors were required to obtain a license as well as file a surety bond of $5,000 for the benefit of the State and any member of the public damaged by\n   such collection agencies. BR \u00a7 7-301 ; 7-304. The State Collection Agency Licensing Board (\"the Board\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   located within the Department of Labor, Licensing, and Regulation (\"DLLR\" or \"Department\"), is responsible for enforcing the Act. BR \u00a7 7-201.\n   In 2007, DLLR requested a departmental bill (House Bill 1324) to revise the definition of collection agencies required to obtain the MCALA license. Specifically, the Department submitted a bill request, explaining that the legislation would allow DLLR to regulate actors in the collection industry that employ a loophole in MCALA's licensing requirement by purchasing delinquent consumer debt for goods and services by way of a purchase contract that mirrors a collection agency agreement. When enacted, the departmental bill specifically changed MCALA's definition of \"collection agencies\" to include a person who engages directly or indirectly in the business of \"collecting a consumer claim the person owns, if the claim was in default when the person acquired it[.]\" 2007 Md. Laws, ch. 472.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Each of the circuit courts below, along with the Court of Special Appeals, found that foreign statutory trusts acting as a repository for defaulted mortgage debts were required to obtain a license as a collection agency pursuant to MCALA before its substitute trustees filed a foreclosure action in the circuit court. The substitute trustees each petitioned this Court for certiorari, asserting that the circuit courts improperly dismissed the foreclosure actions because the foreign statutory trusts do not fall under the definition of \"collection\n   agencies\" that are licensed and regulated by MCALA. This Court is therefore called upon to determine the scope of MCALA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, the limited legal issue in these consolidated cases is whether the General Assembly intended a foreign statutory trust, as owner of a delinquent mortgage loan, to obtain a license as a collection agency under MCALA before substitute trustees instituted a foreclosure action against a homeowner who defaulted on his or her mortgage. As explained below, the legislative history, subsequent legislation, and related statutes make clear that the 2007 departmental bill did not expand the scope of MCALA to include mortgage industry players seeking foreclosure actions; thus, this Court answers that question in the negative.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   This appeal constitutes two cases consolidated before the Court of Special Appeals\n   as well as two additional actions appealed to this Court directly from circuit court foreclosure proceedings. In each of the cases\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   , the respondents obtained a mortgage loan from a creditor to purchase, convey, or refinance their homes. The loans were evidenced by a promissory note and secured by a deed of trust. Eventually, the homeowners all missed loan payments, resulting in the banks declaring the loans to be in default. At some point after the respondents defaulted on the mortgage loans, the banks transferred the loans and all beneficial interest in the deed of trust as part of a securitized pool of mortgage loans to either Ventures Trust 2013-I-H-R (\"Ventures Trust\") or LSF9 Master Participation Trust (\"LSF9\"), both of which are foreign statutory trusts organized under Delaware law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   These foreign statutory trusts acted through trustees which in these cases were other banks. A separate loan servicer was assigned to communicate with the borrowers and collect the monthly mortgage payments. The trustees subsequently appointed substitute trustees, conveying all rights and duties under the deeds of trust, including the power of sale. The substitute trustees subsequently initiated foreclosure actions to enforce the security interest against the defaulting borrowers, meaning that the substitute trustees are the petitioners in each of the cases\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In response, the defaulting homeowners filed counter complaints arguing that the foreign statutory trusts acted as collection agencies as defined under MCALA when they obtained\n   defaulted mortgage loans and then collected mortgage payments through communication and foreclosure actions without being licensed as required by MCALA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BR \u00a7 7-301,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   The counter complaints further alleged that, by attempting to collect mortgage payments without the required license under MCALA, the foreign statutory trusts violated the Maryland Consumer Debt Collection Act (\"MCDCA\"). Md. Code (1975, 2013 Repl. Vol.), Com. Law (\"CL\") \u00a7 14-201,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In addition to filing counter complaints, the borrowers in default requested that the circuit courts dismiss or enjoin the foreclosure sales. To support the request, the borrowers argued that the foreign statutory trusts brought the foreclosure action without being licensed as a collection agency, violating MCALA and MCDCA, and that any judgment obtained by an unlicensed entity acting as a collection agency would be void.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Finch v. LVNV Funding, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674720\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/212/748/#p759\">\n    212 Md.

In response, the substitute trustees argued that the foreign statutory trusts were neither doing business in the State nor doing business as a collection agency when they filed foreclosure actions, that MCALA did not apply to the\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   proceedings, that the foreign\n   statutory trusts constituted trust companies exempted from the Act, and that the homeowners failed to specify a relevant defense under Maryland mortgage foreclosure law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Md. Code Ann., Real Prop. (\"RP\") \u00a7 7-101,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ; Md. Rules 14-201,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Md.%20Code%20Regs.%2009\">\n    Md. Code Regs. 09\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .03.12.01,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The circuit courts all held motions hearings to consider the various arguments regarding MCALA. In each of the cases\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   , the circuit courts issued an order dismissing the foreclosure proceeding without prejudice after finding that the foreign statutory trusts were in the business of collecting consumer debt because the entities indirectly attempted to collect on a defaulted mortgage loan purchased at a discount. The courts also determined that the foreign statutory trusts did not fall under the trust company exemption to MCALA. After determining that the foreign statutory trusts were subject to the MCALA licensing requirements, the circuit courts\n   noted that there was no dispute that Ventures Trust and LSF9 lacked the required collection agency license. As such, the circuit courts concluded that foreign statutory trusts had no right to bring the foreclosure actions, dismissing each of the cases without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We will summarize the factual background of each of the individual cases in turn below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Kyle Blackstone,\n    <em>\n     et al.\n    </em>\n    v. Dinesh Sharma,\n    <em>\n     et al.\n    </em>\n    ; Terrance Shanahan,\n    <em>\n     et al.\n    </em>\n    v. Seyed Marvastian,\n    <em>\n     et al.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Kyle Blackstone,\n    <em>\n     et al.\n    </em>\n    v. Dinesh Sharma,\n    <em>\n     et al.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In 2006, Ruchi Sharma owned a home located at 10302 Oaklyn Drive, Potomac, Maryland, which she wished to sell to her parents, Mr. Dinesh Sharma and Mrs. Santosh Sharma. In order to finance the home purchase, Dinesh and Santosh Sharma sought to obtain a loan in the amount of $1,920,000.00 from Washington Mutual Bank, FA (\"WMB\"). The loan was evidenced by a promissory note and secured by a deed of trust. WMB asked Ms. Ruchi Sharma, who accompanied Dinesh and Santosh to the bank, to sign the deed of trust because the conveyance was not an arm's length transaction. Therefore, Rushi Sharma, Dinesh Sharma, and Santosh Sharma (\"the Sharmas\") all signed the closing documents, including the deed of trust.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On December 2, 2007, WMB declared the Sharmas to be in default on the promissory note. A little less than six years later, Ventures Trust acquired the Sharmas' loan and all beneficial interest in the deed of trust as part of a securitized pool of mortgage loans. Ventures Trust acted through its trustee, MCM Capital Partners, LLC (\"MCM\"). In 2014, Ventures Trust, through MCM, appointed substitute trustees,\n   Kyle Blackstone, William O'Neil, and Terrance Shanahan. On November 25, 2014, the substitute trustees initiated a foreclosure action in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County to enforce the security interest in the Sharmas' real property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In response, the Sharmas filed a counter complaint against the substitute trustees as well as MCM, as trustee for Ventures Trust. The counter complaint alleged that Ventures Trust acted as a collection agency as defined under MCALA when it purchased\n   the defaulted mortgage loan without being licensed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BR \u00a7 7-301,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   The counter complaint\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   further alleged that by attempting to collect mortgage payments from the Sharmas without the required license under MCALA, Ventures Trust violated the MCDCA. CL \u00a7 14-201,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In addition to the counter complaint, the Sharmas filed a motion to dismiss or enjoin the foreclosure sale pursuant to Md. Rule 14-211. In their motion, the Sharmas contended that any responsive legal claim in a foreclosure proceeding should be heard and decided before the equitable claims. As to the legal issue, the Sharmas argued that the circuit court should dismiss or stay the foreclosure action primarily because Ventures Trust brought the foreclosure action without being licensed as a collection agency. As such, the Sharmas contended that Ventures Trust violated MCALA and MCDCA. The Sharmas further asserted in their motion that Ventures Trust could not obtain relief because of a ruling by the Court of Special Appeals, which held that a judgment obtained by an unlicensed entity acting as a collection agency is void.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Finch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674720\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/212/748/#p759\">\n    212 Md.

In the opposition,\n   the substitute trustees contended that the Sharmas failed to specify a relevant defense, such as a violation of the Maryland Rules or Maryland mortgage foreclosure laws. In addition, Ventures Trust's substitute trustees argued that Ventures Trust falls within the trust companies exemption to MCALA and, as such, is not subject to the licensing requirements under MCALA. Based on this argument, Ventures Trust maintained that it was entitled to bring the foreclosure action without first having to obtain a MCALA license.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Circuit Court for Montgomery County held a motions hearing, during which the presiding judge heard arguments on the Sharmas' motion and Venture Trust's opposition thereto. On August 28, 2015, the circuit court issued an order, granting the Sharmas' motion and dismissing the foreclosure proceeding without prejudice. In a corresponding opinion, the circuit court reasoned that the legislature specifically and explicitly referred to foreign statutory trusts in certain sections of the Maryland Code but decided not to list foreign statutory trusts as an excepted entity from the MCALA requirements. Therefore, the circuit court found that the legislature intentionally omitted the term foreign statutory trusts from the MCALA sections of the Maryland Code. Moreover, the circuit court found that Ventures Trust failed to provide any convincing evidence that they constituted a trust company, which is one type of entity specifically exempted from MCALA. After determining that Ventures Trust was subject to the MCALA licensing requirements, the circuit court also noted that there was no dispute that Ventures Trust lacked the\n   required MCALA license. As such, the circuit court concluded that the Sharmas established that Ventures Trust had no right to bring the foreclosure action, dismissing the case without prejudice.\n   <strong>\n    ii. Terrance Shanahan,\n    <em>\n     et al.\n    </em>\n    v. Seyed Marvastian,\n    <em>\n     et al.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On or about June 23, 2006, Seyed Marvastian (\"Mr. Marvastian\") obtained a loan in the amount of $1,396,500.00 from Premier Mortgage Funding, Inc. to purchase a home located at 7809 Bradley Blvd., Bethesda, Maryland. The loan was evidenced by a promissory note and secured by a deed of trust. Mr. Marvastian's wife, Mrs. Sima Marvastian, was listed as the record owner of the real property. In 2012, Mr. Marvastian defaulted on the loan after he failed to make payments. Two years after Mr. Marvastian's loan was declared in default, Ventures Trust acquired the mortgage loan and all beneficial interest in the deed of trust as part of a securitized pool of mortgage loans. Several months later, the substitute trustees initiated a foreclosure action in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County to enforce the security interest in the real property. Mr. and Mrs. Marvastian (\"the Marvasistans\") timely requested foreclosure mediation, which concluded without agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Marvastians filed a counter complaint against one of the substitute trustees, Terrance Shanahan, as well as MCM, as trustee for Ventures Trust. The counter complaint alleged that Ventures Trust acted as a collection agency as defined under MCALA when it brought a foreclosure action on the defaulted mortgage loan that Ventures Trust had purchased without the required license. BR \u00a7 7-301,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   The counter complaint\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   further alleged that by attempting to collect mortgage payments from Mr. Marvastian without the required license under MCALA, Ventures Trust violated MCDCA. CL \u00a7 14-201,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Along with the counter complaint, the Marvastians filed a Rule 14-211 motion to dismiss and/or stay the foreclosure proceeding pending resolution of legal questions. In their\n   motion, the Marvastians argued that the court should stay the foreclosure proceedings in order to first resolve the legal issues presented in the counter complaint. The Marvastians further argued that any court judgment in favor of Ventures Trust would be rendered void because the entity is not licensed as a collection agency as required by MCALA. The substitute trustee and MCM, as trustee for Ventures Trust, filed an opposition to the homeowners' Rule 14-211 motion to dismiss and/or stay foreclosure proceedings. In their opposition, the substitute trustees argued that adjudicating the counter complaint will not have any effect on the foreclosure action because Ventures Trust is exempt from the licensing requirements under MCALA. The substitute trustees further contended that the Marvastians failed to specify any viable defenses to the foreclosure. In addition, the opposition asserted that the Marvastians' motion was frivolous with the only purpose of delaying the foreclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The circuit court held a motions hearing on March 26, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   After hearing arguments\n   from both parties on the Rule 14-211 motion, the Court issued an order dated May 12, 2015, making findings of fact and conclusions of law. Specifically, the order found that \"Ventures Trust did business as a 'collection' agency in Maryland by seeking to collect [Mr. Marvastian's] mortgage debts that it purchased after default through a loan servicer.\" As such, the order concluded that \"Ventures Trust is [ ] subject to MCALA's licensing requirements for collection agencies\" and \"none of the Maryland Code's definitions of 'trust company' includes Delaware Statutory Trusts[.]\" Ultimately, the circuit court dismissed the foreclosure action without prejudice after concluding that the Marvastians established that Ventures Trust had no right to file the foreclose action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   After the circuit court issued the order, the trustee and substitute trustee filed a motion to alter or amend judgment\n   pursuant to Md. Rule 2-534. Through its trustees, Ventures Trust argued that the circuit court erred in concluding that MCALA applies to foreclosure proceedings and statutory foreign trusts mainly because of the potential conflict between Maryland registration requirements for statutory trusts, Md. Code Ann., Corps. &amp; Ass'ns (\"CA\") \u00a7 12-902(a), and MCALA, BR \u00a7 7-301(a). The Marvastians' filed a reply, contending that the circuit court properly concluded that a foreclosure proceeding is a form of debt collection and that Ventures Trust does not fall under the MCALA exemption for trust companies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On July 22, 2015, the circuit court held a second motions hearing in order to hear arguments on the motion to alter the court's judgment and any opposition thereto. After the second motions hearing, the circuit court issued another order, finding that there is \"a clear legislative intent to subject foreign statutory trusts that collect debts in Maryland by bringing foreclosure actions in Maryland courts to MCALA's licensing requirement[.]\" The circuit court also found that \"MCALA's licensing requirement, Bus. Reg. \u00a7 7-301(a), and the registration requirement of CA \u00a7 12-902(a) serve distinct purposes; thus, it is not incongruous for the legislature to subject foreign statutory trusts that bring foreclosure action in Maryland to the former but to exempt them from the latter.\" As such, the circuit court denied Venture Trust's motion to alter or amend the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. Consolidation and Court of Special Appeals\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On September 10, 2015, Ventures Trust, through its trustees and substitute trustees, filed a notice of appeal to the Court of Special Appeals in both cases,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the foreclosure actions against the properties owned by the Sharmas and the Marvastians. The Court of Special Appeals consolidated the two foreclosure cases into one appeal and issued a reported opinion on June 6, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    Blackstone v.

The consolidated appeal involved two questions: (1) whether a party who authorized a trustee to initiate a foreclosure action needs to be licensed as a collection agency under MCALA; and (2) whether the MCALA licensing requirement applies to foreign statutory trusts, such as Ventures Trust. The Court of Special Appeals held\n   that Ventures Trust, as a foreign statutory trust, must meet the licensing requirements under MCALA before bringing a foreclosure action unless some other exception in MCALA applies. The Court of Special Appeals further concluded that the exception for trust companies under MCALA does not apply to Ventures Trust because it does not act as a trustee or operate as a commercial bank under the Black's Law Dictionary 10th ed. 2014 definitions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BR \u00a7 7-102. As such, the Court of Special Appeals ultimately held that Ventures Trust was barred from bringing the foreclosure action without the MCALA license, affirming the judgment of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County.

(\"Bank of America\") to refinance their home located at 11810 Tridelphia Road, Ellicott City, Maryland. The loan was evidenced by a promissory note and secured by a deed of trust. The Alternburgs defaulted on the loan by failing to make a loan payment in 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Four years later, Bank of America assigned all beneficial interest under the promissory note and deed of trust to U.S. Bank Trust, as trustee for LSF9. In 2016, U.S. Bank Trust appointed substitute trustees, Laura H.G. O'Sullivan, Erin M. Shaffer, Chasity Brown, Lauren Bush, and Rachel Kiefer.

Moreover, the Altenburgs contended that any judgment in favor of LSF9, acting as an unlicensed debt collector, would be void.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Finch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674720\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/212/748/#p759\">\n    212 Md.

The Altenburgs also asserted that LSF9 does not constitute a trust company, which is one entity exempted from the MCALA licensing requirement. In response, the substitute trustees filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss, arguing that MCALA does not apply to\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   proceedings in which substitute trustees pursue the right to foreclose on real property pursuant to a deed of trust. The substitute trustees further asserted that LSF9 constitutes a trust company, which is specifically exempted from MCALA, because a foreign statutory trust could easily fit within the broad, undefined phrase.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The circuit court held a hearing on the Altenburgs' motion to dismiss and opposition thereto. During the motions hearing, the parties argued as to whether certain facts should be stipulated. As a result, the circuit court scheduled a second motions hearing at a later date to allow the parties time to either stipulate to certain facts or to file discovery requests. On July 13, 2016, the parties filed a pleading, stipulating to the fact that LSF9 \"acquired the Promissory Note ('Note') secured by the Deed of Trust that is the subject to this action for a sum less than the total amount remaining due on the Note on the date on which LSF9 acquired the Note.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The circuit court held a second motions hearing, during which the court heard additional arguments on the motion to\n   dismiss the foreclosure action. At the end of the second motions hearing, the circuit court made oral findings of fact and conclusions of law on the record. The court specifically concluded that the instant action constituted a consumer claim and that LSF9 required a license under MCALA before bringing the foreclosure action. As such, the circuit court further found that LSF9 did not have the ability to bring the foreclosure action because the foreign statutory trust did not have a license under MCALA at the time it initiated the action. For those reasons, the court granted the Altenburgs' motion to dismiss. The circuit court entered an order dated August 25, 2016, dismissing the action without prejudice.

The loan was evidenced by a promissory note and secured by a deed of trust. The Neviasers defaulted on the loan in 2009 when they failed to make a loan payment. Six years later, Bank of America, as successor by merger to Countrywide Bank, FSB, transferred all interest in the Neviasers' loan to LSF9. In 2015, LSF9 assigned the deed of trust to U.S. Bank Trust, as trustee for LSF9. The trustee, in turn, appointed substitute trustees, Martin S. Goldberg, Doreen A. Strothman, Virginia S. Inzer, William K. Smart, and Taryn L. Alvey.

Moreover, the Neviasers contended that LSF9 is not exempt from MCALA under the trust company exception because it is not an incorporated entity engaged in banking. In addition to these arguments, the Neviasers urged the circuit court to conclude that LSF9 is estopped from obtaining a different\n   result in the present action than the judgment by the Circuit Court for Howard County in the Alternburgs' case, discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . In response, the substitute trustees filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss the foreclosure case, making four arguments: (1) LSF9 was not doing business in the State as defined under MCALA when it brought the foreclosure action; (2) LSF9 was not engaging in the business of a collection agency; (3) LSF9 fell under MCALA's trust company exemption; and (4) the rule of lenity required that any ambiguity in the coverage of MCALA favors a ruling for LSF9 because the act contains criminal penalties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The court held a motions hearing, at which time the judge heard arguments from the Neviasers and the substitute trustees\n   as to whether the foreclosure proceeding should be dismissed. After the hearing, the court held the matter\n   <em>\n    sub curia\n   </em>\n   . By memorandum order, the circuit court concluded that the foreclosure proceedings constituted consumer claims under MCALA. Moreover, the court determined that LSF9 was in the business of collecting consumer claims because the entity indirectly attempted to collect on a defaulted mortgage that it purchased at a discount. The court also rejected LSF9's argument that the trust company exemption under MCALA applied or that the rule of lenity resolved any ambiguities in LSF9's favor.

This is the ultimate question before this Court.

The petitioners in these consolidated cases, the substitute trustees of the foreign statutory trusts, each make slightly nuanced arguments as to why the foreign statutory trusts did not need to obtain a license under MCALA before the substitute trustees filed foreclosure proceedings on the trusts' behalf. Specifically, the substitute trustees of Ventures Trust, the foreign statutory trust that owned the mortgage loans obtained by the Sharmas and the Marvastians, contend that entities do not need an MCALA license when pursuing an\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   foreclosure action because such a proceeding is brought against the property rather than for money owed on a consumer debt. In addition, Ventures Trust's substitute trustees assert that requiring a foreign statutory trust foreclosing on a mortgage to obtain a license under MCALA for \"doing business\" as a collection agency would conflict with the Corporations &amp; Associations Article of the Maryland Code, which states that foreign statutory trusts are not doing business in the State by foreclosing mortgages and deeds of trust.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CA \u00a7 12-908(a)(5). The substitute trustees of Ventures Trust finally argue that requiring foreign statutory trusts to obtain a license under MCALA will not ultimately protect consumers because foreign statutory trusts do not have employees or offices; instead, the trusts act only through trustees and substitute trustees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Deutsche Bank Nat. Tr. Co. v. Brock\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3716553\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/430/714/#p718\">\n    430 Md. 714\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 718,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3716553\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/430/714/#p718\">\n    63 A.3d 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Substitute trustees of LSF9, holder of the Altenburgs' and Neviaser's mortgage loans, make slightly different arguments before this Court. First, LSF9 substitute trustees contend that the entities that either need to be licensed or exempted pursuant to MCALA are the trustees (who appoint the substitute trustees), the substitute trustees (who pursue the foreclosure proceeding), and the mortgage loan servicer (who contacts the debtor). To that end, the substitute trustees for LSF9 argues that the licensure of the foreign statutory trust (a repository that owns the mortgage loans) is irrelevant because these entities do not act or conduct any business. The substitute trustees further assert that \"doing business\" is a legal term of art that can be interpreted by looking to the phrase's definition found within other articles of the Maryland Code. Furthermore, the substitute trustees argue that foreclosure proceedings are not consumer claims as defined under MCALA and that statutory trusts are not engaging in the business of debt collection by having substitute trustees pursue a foreclosure action. The LSF9 substitute trustees also urge this Court to interpret MCALA's exemption for trust companies to include foreign statutory trusts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In response, the defaulting homeowners argue that the plain language of MCALA unambiguously requires any person or entity that collects a consumer claim, if the claim was in default when the party acquired it, to have a collection agency license. Specifically, the respondents contend that the legislature could have intentionally added an exemption for foreign\n   statutory trusts under MCALA, but chose not to do so. In undertaking the statutory interpretation, the borrowers in default assert that other statutes are not relevant to this Court's analysis. Moreover, the respondents argue that the petitioners have conceded that a foreign statutory trust is simply an account, requiring a finding by this Court that such an account cannot fall under the exemption for trust companies.

Plain Language\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Pursuant to our longstanding statutory interpretation case law, we will first analyze the plain language of the statute in discerning the issue before this Court. MCALA generally requires that \"a person must have a license whenever the person does business as a collection agency in the State.\" BR \u00a7 7-301(a). The Act defines collection agency as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   (d) \"Collection agency\" means a person who engages directly or indirectly in the business of:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   (1)(i) collecting for, or soliciting from another, a consumer claim; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   (ii) collecting a consumer claim the person owns, if the claim was in default when the person acquired it;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   (2) collecting a consumer claim the person owns, using a name or other artifice that indicates that another party is attempting to collect the consumer claim;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   (3) giving, selling, attempting to give or sell to another, or using, for collection of a consumer claim, a series or system of forms or letters that indicates directly or indirectly that a person other than the owner is asserting the consumer claim; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   (4) employing the services of an individual or business to solicit or sell a collection system to be used for collection of a consumer claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   BR \u00a7 7-101(d). Under MCALA, a consumer claim is defined as a claim \"for money owed or said to be owed by a resident of the State\" and \"arises from a transaction in which, for a family, household, or personal purpose, the resident sought or got credit, money, personal property, real property or services.\" BR \u00a7 7-101(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The key provisions of MCALA require a person to have a license \"whenever the person does business as a collection agency[.]\" BR \u00a7 7-301(a). Perhaps most significant to the instant appeal is the new language from the 2007 departmental bill that includes an entity that \"engages directly or indirectly in the business of ... collecting a consumer claim the person owns, if the claim was in default when the person acquired it\" to the definition of collection agency. BR \u00a7 7-101(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The General Assembly also limited the scope of MCALA by listing entities exempted from the statute all together.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BR \u00a7 7-102(b). Specifically, the statute \"does not apply to\" many of the mortgage industry actors, including \"(1) a bank; (2) a federal or State credit union; (3) a mortgage lender; ... (5) a\n   licensed real estate broker, or an individual acting on behalf of the real estate broker, in the collection of rent or allied charge for property; (6) a savings and loan association; (7) a title company as to its escrow business; (8) a trust company; [and] (9) a lawyer ....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3688163\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/412/308/#p315\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, the statute does not define any of the exempted entities.\n   On the one hand, this Court cannot ignore that the term \"collection agency\" is commonly understood as those entities with a business model of sending letters to debtors, making collection calls, and filing collection suits for consumer debt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Alexander Gordon, IV, FEDERAL INTERVENTION IN THE MORTGAGE MARKETS , Maryland State Bar Association Inc., GOMF MD-CLE 1707 (2004) (\"traditional debt collection activities (sending dunning letters, making collection calls to consumers)\");\n   <em>\n    Finch v.

This ordinary meaning of collection agencies aligns with a majority of the collection agency definition under MCALA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BR \u00a7 7-101(d)(1)(ii); (2)-(4) (defining collection agencies as those engaged directly or in directly in the business of: collecting for, or soliciting from another, a consumer claim; collecting a consumer claim the person owns, using a name or other artifice that indicates that another party is attempting to collect the consumer claim; giving or using, for collection of a consumer claim, a series or system of forms or letters that indicates that a person other than the owner is asserting the consumer claim; and employing the services of an individual or business to solicit or sell a collection system to be used for collection of a consumer claim).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   On the other hand, however, this commonly understood meaning does not necessarily comport with the prong of MCALA's definition of collection agencies added by the 2007 departmental bill: \"a person who engages directly or indirectly in the business of ... collecting a consumer claim the person owns, if the claim was in default when the person acquired\n   it[.]\" BR \u00a7 7-101(d)(1)(ii). Reading this language alone, it is unclear whether the General Assembly intended to move away from the ordinary meaning of collection agencies. Moreover, the statutory language excerpted above is undoubtedly capable of more than one reasonable interpretation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barbre v.

This language, especially when considering that it includes entities that act \"indirectly,\" could mean that any individual who obtains a single defaulted debt and pursues one lawsuit or contacts the debtor once to collect that debt engages in the business of a collection agency and is required to obtain a license before doing so. BR \u00a7 7-101(d). In the alternative, the language added by the 2007 departmental bill could signify that the General Assembly intended to license those businesses that are commonly understood to be collection agencies that were also buying defaulted consumer debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   In addition to the conflict between the common understanding of collection agencies and the language added by the 2007 departmental bill, MCALA also includes the phrase \"engages directly or indirectly in the business of[.]\" BR \u00a7 7-101(d).

This Court opined:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   The ordinary and customary meaning is that reflected in Webster's Third New International Dictionary as 'commercial or mercantile activity customarily engaged in as a means of livelihood' or\n   <strong>\n    two definitions given by Funk and Wagnall's New Standard Dictionary of the English Language:\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    '1.

Specifically, the foreign statutory trusts that own the mortgage loans in the cases\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   do not have any employees or offices, do not have any registered agent, and do not have any specifically identified pursuit in the State of Maryland. Instead, LSF9 and Ventures Trust both act solely through trustees and substitute trustees. Therefore, it would be hard for this Court in the first instance to conclude that the foreign statutory trusts engage, either directly or indirectly, in the business of a collection agency when it is hard to deduce if these entities are even conducting \"business\" under Funk and Wagnall's definition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The defaulting homeowners contend that MCALA's definition of consumer claim is unambiguous and resolves the issue before this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, MCALA defines\n   consumer claim to include a claim that \"is for money owed or said to be owed\" and \"arises from a transaction in which ... the resident sought or got ...\n   <strong>\n    real property\n   </strong>\n   [.]\" BR \u00a7 7-101(f) (emphasis added). Though the borrowers may be correct that certain real property transactions or other consumer loans involving property fall within this definition, that is not the crucial question presented in this appeal. This Court must instead determine whether the General Assembly intended to license certain actors in the mortgage industry, such as foreign statutory trusts, as opposed to solely those actors in the collection agency industry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Just as the Court of Special Appeals determined in\n   <em>\n    Gordon\n   </em>\n   , this Court concludes that the plain language of MCALA is\n   ambiguous \"in the context of\" whether a foreign statutory trust that owns a defaulted mortgage debt falls under the scope of MCALA when a substitute trustee brings a foreclosure action on the trust's behalf.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=276%20A.2d%20658\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We cannot determine from the plain language alone if the legislature intended the MCALA licensing requirement to apply to a foreign statutory trust that obtained a defaulted mortgage loan, after which a substitute trustee filed a foreclosure action to protect the trust's security interest.

Critical to this analysis, the legislature grouped together a subsection of exempted actors for banks, trust companies, savings and loan associations, as well as building and loan associations, and mortgage bankers.

Dep't Fiscal Servs.,\n   <em>\n    The Collection Agency Licensing Board: An Evaluation Report Prepared Pursuant to the Regulatory Programs Evaluation Act of 1978\n   </em>\n   (1980) (hereinafter cited as \"Evaluation Report\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   1978 Md. Laws, ch. 808. In an introductory letter to the report, the Department of Fiscal Services explained that the document consisted of an \"evaluation of the Maryland Collection Agency Licensing Board\" meant \"to assist the Senate Economic Affairs Committee and the House Environmental Matters Committee in preparing their report to the General Assembly.\" Evaluation Report at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The evaluation report first provided a description of \"the Industry,\" in which the Department of Fiscal Services noted that in \"Maryland, only third-party collectors are licensed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Currently, 174 debt collection agencies have received licenses through the Collection Agency Licensing Board of Maryland.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. The report continued its description of the collection agency industry:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   Collection agencies collect money due to businesses or creditors other than the agency itself. Usually creditors refer to collection agencies accounts that are long overdue and difficult to collect. The service is generally performed on a commission or on a percentage basis .... A mail survey of 89 licensed collection agencies in Maryland reveals that most clients are either hospitals, doctors, retail stores or banks .... Collection agencies usually attempt to collect debts over the telephone or by mail. Typically, an agency has a telephone bank of employees and a clerical support staff. Most collection agencies are small businesses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3. In connection with its industry description, the Department of Fiscal Services included a table (\"Table 1\") in which the Department broke down the clients of collection agencies, listing medical clients, such as doctors and hospitals, as constituting 54% of clients, retail stores as constituting\n   23% of clients, banks as constituting 10% of clients, and insurance companies, credit card companies, utilities, newspapers, and contractors as constituting 13% of clients.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   The Department of Fiscal Services also explained the continued need for regulation. Specifically, the Department noted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n   Creditors typically refer to collection agencies only the least collectible accounts. Since agencies are compensated only when they collect, this can lead to abuse. Board members mention harassment, abusive language, and attempting to collect debts not owed as the most prevalent forms of abuse in Maryland. Other abuses include misrepresentation, disclosing credit information to third parties, impersonating government officials or attorneys and simulating the legal process .... The primary justification for regulation of this industry is the protection of the public.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   This legislative history provides insight into the purpose of the original collection agency licensing statute. Specifically,\n   Senator Blount's testimony confirms that the legislature was acting to license and regulate the collection agency industry after the high number of complaints regarding the industry's harassing practices. Indeed, the bill file makes clear that collection agency harassment was prevalent during this time period in 1976 and 1977 when the rate of unemployment and inflation sharply increased.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Senator Blount Testimony. The Fiscal Note also indicated that the Department of Licensing and Regulation only anticipated that 110 collection agencies would be required to apply for a license, which signifies that the legislature had a general idea of the actors involved in the collection agency industry and intended specifically to license and regulate those actors in order to prevent abusive practices.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   SB 435 Fiscal Note, at 1. Senator Blount made clear to the Senate Economic Affairs Committee that certain actors would be excluded and that mortgage bankers should be added to those entities exempted from MCALA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Senator Blount Amendments. Overall, the language of the original collection agency licensing statute and the pertinent legislative history indicates that the scope of the initial licensing requirement was limited to an\n   <em>\n    industry\n   </em>\n   of collection agencies, which largely consisted of small businesses collecting medical and retail accounts by contacting debtors via telephone or mail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   In 2007, DLLR requested House Bill 1324, which sought to address new issues under the collection agency licensing act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2007 Md. Laws, ch. 472. Significant to the instant appeal, the 2007 departmental bill changed the definition of \"collection agency\" to include \"a person who: (1) engages directly or indirectly in the business of: ... collecting a consumer claim the person owns, if the claim was in default when the person acquired it[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Once again, the plain language of the legislation does not provide a definitive scope of regulation. In other words, the language of House Bill 1324 does not unambiguously indicate whether DLLR requested the bill in order to expand the scope of MCALA to industries beyond the ordinary understanding of collection agencies. Moreover, it is not clear whether the Department intended to regulate any\n   person who buys a single defaulted account and then pursues a lawsuit to collect that debt. Equally unclear is whether DLLR was simply trying to license certain collection agencies that bought the defaulted accounts before engaging in collection practices. This Court will consider further legislative history to discern the reason the General Assembly revised MCALA in 2007.\n   This Court has long considered the \"bill request form\" as part of its legislative intent analysis.\n   <em>\n    Kaczorowski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2068038\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/309/505/#p515\">\n    309 Md. 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 515,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2068038\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/309/505/#p515\">\n    525 A.2d 628\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987) (\"We identified that scheme or purpose after an extensive review of the context of [the contested legislation], which had effected major changes [on the overall statute].

(Md. 2007) (written testimony of Eileen Brandenberg) (emphasis added) (hereinafter cited as \"HB 1324 Brandenberg Testimony\"). Once again, the testimony of the two State Collection Agency Licensing Board members focused on consumer debt sought by specific collection agencies. Neither of the board members indicated that the departmental bill would require actors within the mortgage industry to obtain a license as a collection agency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   It is also significant that the bill file does not contain any written testimony in opposition of the bill from any other representatives of the mortgage industry, such as Wells Fargo Home Mortgage Servicing, Maryland Mortgage Bankers Association, Mortgage Bankers Association of Metropolitan Washington, Maryland Coalition of Title Insurers, etc. These same representatives, along with other mortgage industry members, submitted written and oral testimony\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   in response to the 2009 foreclosure reform bills.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   If these same lobbyists believed the 2007 departmental bill required mortgage industry members to obtain a license as a collection agency, then they most assuredly would have submitted written testimony in opposition of the bill or proposed specific amendments excluding those mortgage industry members. It is understandable, however, that these mortgage industry representatives did not file any testimony because all of the bill file documents above indicate that the departmental bill aimed only to clarify that MCALA applies to those collection agencies that were\n   buying defaulted consumer debts before engaging in collection practices to avoid the licensing requirement. Nothing in the bill file suggests that DLLR was requesting the General Assembly to expand their regulating and licensing authority under MCALA to the mortgage industry. Moreover, the language in the purpose paragraph does not provide the mortgage industry with any notice that the departmental bill would be including mortgage industry actors or mortgage loans into the realm of the collection agency industry. This lack of notice would explain why the mortgage industry actors did not submit testimony in opposition to the bill, believing that House Bill 1324 was still limited to \"professional collector[s] of defaulted debt.\" HB 1324 Hayes Testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   The 2007 viewpoint of the Commissioner and Board members, who are ultimately responsible for licensing and regulating the collection agencies, is critical to this Court's legislative intent analysis. Ms. Brandenberg emphasized that the issue before the State Collection Agency Licensing Board was a few collection agencies that are outside the scope of authority only\n   because the actors purchased the consumer debt. Similarly, Ms. Hayes supported House Bill 1324 because unlicensed \"professional collector[s]\" were purchasing defaulted debt and subsequently receiving contingent fees from the original creditor if the debt purchaser successfully collected the debt. Moreover, the Commissioner's testimony highlights that the 2007 departmental bill still focused on regulation of the \"collection agency industry,\" in which certain collection agencies were purchasing debt in order to own the debt and thus avoid the licensing requirement. The legislative history, therefore, highlights that the Board was seeking to regulate those collection agencies that purchased the defaulted consumer debts as a means of avoiding obtaining a license under MCALA. As such, this Court is persuaded that the General Assembly did not intend to significantly enlarge the scope of MCALA to entities outside of the collection agency industry. Instead, the 2007 legislation merely served as a way to regulate those collection agencies that exploited a loophole that occurred\n   when the agency purchased the defaulted account before collecting as owners of the consumer debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   This Court interprets the legislative history to signify that the General Assembly intended MCALA, when originally enacted and when revised in 2007, to regulate and license the collection agency industry. The legislative history persuades this Court that the General Assembly did not intend to regulate or license the mortgage industry actors, including foreign statutory trusts serving as a repository for mortgage loans, as collection agencies due to the specific exemptions and the limited scope of MCALA. Nevertheless, we will also look to related statutes and subsequent legislation in order to confirm this interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C.

Nearly 70 percent of all homeowners obtain their residential mortgage\n   loans through a broker. In mortgage transactions, non-bank originators, such as brokers, collect fees up front for their services. The broker originates the loan and a lender underwrites the loan.\n   <strong>\n    Often as soon as the loan settles, the loan is packaged with other loans into mortgage backed securities (MBS) to make them attractive to investors.\n   </strong>\n   The homeowner has no connection with the holder of the mortgage note and may not even know who the note holder is.\n   <strong>\n    The loan goes to a servicer who services the loan for the note holder and collects payments and fees from the homeowner\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9 (emphasis added). Therefore, the Task Force explained that the current model of the mortgage industry includes: (1) a broker, matching the lender to borrower; (2) a lender, typically a bank; (3) a mortgage backed security, which is typically a package of loans to be sold to investors; and (4) a mortgage loan servicer, who services the loan and collects payments from the borrower.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   This \"mortgage marketplace,\" or \"mortgage industry,\" encompasses a \"primary and secondary mortgage market\" that requires securitization.

As discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , DLLR estimated that there were 1,304 licensed collection agencies in 2007, and that the departmental bill would place 40 new debt purchasers under the Board's regulation with an additional two applications each year.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , HB 1324 Fiscal Note, at 2; Secretary Proposal for Legislation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   Overall, the subsequent legislation in response to the 2007 Homeownership Preservation Task Force's recommendations confirms that the General Assembly intended to solve two different problems by enacting revisions to MCALA (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , to regulate and license certain collection agencies engaged in collecting consumer debts in exchange for a percentage of the debt) and changes to the Maryland Code and Maryland Rules relating to the mortgage industry actors and foreclosure (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , to protect homeowners by adding certain requirements to the foreclosure process and heavier regulation of the mortgage industry actors). The complete absence of any discussion of MCALA or collection agencies when the legislature considered the problem of rising foreclosure rates as well as bad practices by certain actors within the mortgage industry persuades this Court that the General Assembly did not intend to license one of the mortgage industry actors, foreign statutory trusts, under MCALA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   After a majority of the Maryland mortgage foreclosure law reform legislation was passed in 2008 and 2009, the General Assembly also enacted the Maryland Statutory Trust Act in 2010.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CA \u00a7 12-901\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   A \"statutory trust\" constitutes any unincorporated business, trust, or association that filed an initial certificate of trust in Maryland and is governed by a\n   governing instrument. CA \u00a7 12-101(h). A \"foreign statutory trust\" is simply a statutory trust that is formed under the laws of another state. CA \u00a7 12-101(d). The Statutory Trust Act requires foreign statutory trusts to \"register with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation prior to conducting business in the State.\" Dep't Legis. Servs.,\n   <em>\n    Fiscal and Policy Note, Senate Bill 787\n   </em>\n   , at 3 (2010 Session). Moreover, all foreign statutory trusts are to submit to certain penalties for failing to register.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   When passing the 2010 Maryland Statutory Trust Act, the General Assembly recognized that a statutory trust has \"general powers\" to: make contracts; incur liabilities and borrow money; sell, mortgage, convey, or otherwise dispose of assets; issue notes and secure obligations by mortgage or deed of trust; acquire or purchase or hold interests in real or personal property; purchase, receive, or deal in stock; acquire shares of beneficial interest; invest or lend money; and, sue and be sued in all courts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. By specifically noting these general powers, the Fiscal and Policy Note affirms that the legislature understood that statutory trusts serve functions within many different industries. However, the legislature specifically concluded that: \"In addition to any other activities which may not constitute doing business in this State, for the purposes of this subtitle,\n   <strong>\n    the following activities of a foreign statutory trust do not constitute doing business in this State\n   </strong>\n   ... (5)\n   <strong>\n    Foreclosing mortgages and deeds of trust on property in this State\n   </strong>\n   [.]\" CA \u00a7 12-908(a)(5) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   Therefore, there is a direct conflict between the homeowners' arguments that MCALA requires foreign statutory trusts to obtain a license before engaging in the business of a collection\n   agency by instituting a foreclosure action and the Maryland Statutory Trust Act's recognition that foreign statutory trusts are not doing business in Maryland when foreclosing on a mortgage. As such, these consolidated cases present an instance in which both of the statutes, MCALA and the Maryland Statutory Trust Act, may apply and conflict. We have previously explained that when two statutes apply to the\n   same situation, then this Court will attempt to harmonize the statutes.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-180\">\n   We presume that the legislature intends its enactments \"to operate together as a consistent and harmonious body of law.\" Thus, when two statutes appear to apply to the same situation, this Court will attempt to give effect to both statutes to the extent that they are reconcilable. Nevertheless, \"if two statutes contain an irreconcilable conflict, the statute whose relevant substantive provisions were enacted most recently may impliedly repeal any conflicting provision of the earlier statute.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

When enacting and revising MCALA, the legislature intended to license a certain group of actors within the collection agency industry, including those entities that purchased delinquent consumer debt in exchange for a contingency fee. Foreign statutory trusts were not within the purview of the collection agency industry that the General Assembly intended to license. The year after the General Assembly enacted the 2007 departmental bill, the legislature enacted a comprehensive foreclosure reform, addressing the rising number of foreclosures in Maryland by requiring all entities instituting foreclosure proceedings to comply with specific homeowner protection procedures. When enacting the Maryland Statutory Trust Act in 2010, the legislature did not require foreign statutory trusts to register with the State when bringing foreclosure actions because the General Assembly appreciated that MCALA was limited to the collection agency industry and the previously enacted foreclosure reform would control the foreclosure proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   The defaulting homeowners in these consolidated cases assert that the above language is irrelevant to the present inquiry because the Maryland Statutory Trust Act specifically states that it is only \"for purposes of [that] subtitle[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   CA \u00a7 12-908(a). As such, the borrowers contend that the Maryland Statutory Trust Act does not in any way reflect on the General Assembly's intent in enacting and revising MCALA. However, this argument ignores the practical considerations of the legislature. The General Assembly enacted the Maryland Statutory Trust Act in 2010, three years after the departmental bill sought to close a loophole under MCALA and just one year after major foreclosure reform legislation. Needless to say, requiring the statutory trusts to comply with a separate registration system to pursue an\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   foreclosure would have been redundant after enacting a comprehensive scheme governing all foreclosure proceedings in Maryland.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   When viewing MCALA, the foreclosure reform legislation, and the Maryland Statutory Trust Act together, it becomes clear that the General Assembly sought to regulate and license a separate collection agency industry that assists creditors in obtaining consumer debt (or buys that debt, whether at a discounted price or contingently, to pursue on its own account) when it enacted and revised MCALA. In 2008 and 2009, the legislature enacted specific procedures and requirements for any person, party, or entity seeking an\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   foreclosure proceeding. Then in 2010, the General Assembly enacted a registration statute for statutory trusts and foreign statutory trusts under the Maryland Statutory Trust Act. When enacting the Maryland Statutory Trust Act, the legislature specifically exempted the trusts from obtaining registration when simply seeking a foreclosure, recognizing that the previous foreclosure law reform would provide the required procedures and protections. This reading of the related statutes prevents any direct conflict and gives effect to all of the General Assembly's individual policy goals.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Immanuel\n   </em>\n   , 449 Md. at 87,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485482,6775958\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/449/76/\">\n    141 A.3d 181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   Although the plain language of MCALA is ambiguous as to whether the General Assembly intended to require licensure for foreign statutory trusts as collection agencies, the legislative history, subsequent legislation, and related statutes provide\n   this Court with strong evidence of legislative intent. Specifically, the broad legislative history conveys that the General Assembly was concerned with abusive practices within the collection agency industry when it enacted the original collection agencies licensing statute. 1977 Md. Laws, ch. 319. When the legislature enacted the first statute requiring collection agencies to obtain a MCALA license, the General Assembly specifically exempted mortgage industry actors.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485482,6775958\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/449/76/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   In the years leading up to 2007, the Department recognized that certain collection agencies pursuing consumer debt had found a way to bypass the licensing requirement under MCALA. Specifically, certain members of the collection agency industry were purchasing the debt from their clients, often on a contingent fee basis, so that they would not be a third-party collection agency. In other words, the collection agencies were entering into agreements with their clients in which the agencies agreed to collect the debt they bought as opposed to acting as an agent for the original creditor. These agreements would effectively put the collectors outside of the Board's authority. Therefore, the Department submitted a bill request to the Governor for his consideration of a departmental bill that would close this loophole. DLLR stated in its bill request that the departmental bill aimed to license persons who buy the defaulted debt for \"goods and services\" before engaging in typical collection practices. Secretary James D. Fielder,\n   <em>\n    Proposal for Legislation 2007 Session\n   </em>\n   , Department of Labor, Licensing, and Regulation (Md. 2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   The Department did not request, and the General Assembly did not intend, to expand the scope of MCALA's licensing requirement to other industries beyond the collection agency industry. There is nothing in the Department's bill request form, the fiscal and policy note, or the written testimonies that suggest DLLR was proposing to license and regulate the mortgage industry by revising the definition of \"collection agency\" under MCALA. Overall, the legislative history of the 2007 departmental bill reveals that the changes did not intend to expand the scope of MCALA beyond the collection agency industry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   Similarly, there is nothing in the legislative history of the Maryland mortgage foreclosure law reform that suggests the General Assembly considered MCALA to be licensing the mortgage industry actors. In fact, the Task Force, which was created specifically to review the Maryland laws relating to foreclosure as well as suggest changes to that foreclosure law, did not mention MCALA's licensing requirement. The Task Force explained to the General Assembly that the mortgage marketplace\n   often involves packages of loans, called mortgage backed securities.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Task Force Report. As this Court has explained, securitization requires special purpose vehicles, such as trusts, to serve as a repository for the mortgage backed securities. Both this Court and the Task Force recognized that a separate trustee would serve to manage the loans in the mortgage backed securities while a loan servicer would collect payments from the borrowers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3705691\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/424/232/#p243\">\n    424 Md. at 237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3705691\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/424/232/#p243\">\n    35 A.3d 452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Deutsche Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3716553\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/430/714/#p718\">\n    430 Md. at 718\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3716553\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/430/714/#p718\">\n    63 A.3d 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   After the Task Force's Report, the General Assembly enacted Maryland foreclosure law reform in the 2008, 2009, and 2010 legislative sessions to set forth specific procedures and requirements for all parties seeking an\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   foreclosure proceeding. It would have been contradictory for the General Assembly to have passed foreclosure reform legislation specifying how mortgage industry entities should purse foreclosure actions without mentioning the requirement for an MCALA license if the legislature believed that these same parties were included under the scope of MCALA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   Similarly, when the General Assembly enacted the Statutory Trust Act in 2010, the legislature specifically decided that the statutory trusts were not doing business in Maryland when foreclosing on deeds of trust, recognizing that the previous Maryland mortgage foreclosure law reform would dictate the requirements for the\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   proceeding. As such, the legislative history surrounding MCALA, the Maryland mortgage foreclosure law, and the Statutory Trust Act all confirm the mortgage industry did not fall under the scope of MCALA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   Therefore, this Court holds that the General Assembly did not intend for foreign statutory trusts to obtain a collection agency license under MCALA before its substitute trustees file a foreclosure action in circuit court. Pursuant to our legislative intent analysis, we conclude that foreign statutory trusts are outside of the scope of the collection agency industry regulated and licensed under MCALA. In each of the cases\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   , the owner of the mortgage loan was a foreign statutory trust serving as a special purpose vehicle. These foreign statutory trusts were not required to obtain a license under MCALA before the substitute trustees instituted foreclosure proceedings on their behalf. As such, the circuit courts in the cases\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   erred in dismissing the foreclosure proceedings on the basis that the owners of the mortgage loans were foreign statutory trusts that were not licensed as a collection agency under MCALA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   <strong>\n    IN NO. 40, THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS I S REVERSED, AND THE CASE IS REMANDED TO THAT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   <strong>\n    COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO REVERSE THE JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY AND REMAND THE CASES TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.

Accordingly, I must dissent from the Majority Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Issue\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   The issue in this case is relatively simple. In 2007, the General Assembly amended the Maryland Collection Agency Licensing Act,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   known by the mellifluous acronym \"MCALA,\" to extend the licensing requirement of that law to a \"person\" - a term that includes entities\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   - that collects consumer debt that the person owns as well as consumer debt owned by others. The obvious purpose, demonstrated both by the amendment's language and by its legislative history, was to require those who buy, and attempt to collect, defaulted consumer debt to obtain the requisite license. The main question before us is whether the amended statute applies to those who buy, and attempt to collect, defaulted consumer mortgage debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   Petitioners are substitute trustees who have initiated foreclosure proceedings on behalf of foreign statutory trusts with respect to defaulted residential mortgage debt purchased by the trusts. The circuit courts and the Court of Special Appeals all concluded that MCALA covers that collection activity and that the trusts must be licensed under MCALA to undertake it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   Petitioners have advanced essentially three theories for reversing those decisions: (1) that the trusts do not act as a \"collection agency\" under MCALA; (2) that the act of foreclosing on a residential mortgage is not the collection of a debt under the statute; and (3) that, even if their activities do bring the trusts within MCALA, they need not obtain a license because the trusts qualify for a statutory exemption in MCALA for financial institutions known as \"trust companies.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Application of MCALA in these cases\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   The starting point, of course, is the text of the statute. Pertinent to these cases, the licensing requirement of MCALA applies to an entity that \"engages directly or indirectly in the business of ... collecting a consumer claim the [entity] owns if the claim was in default when the [entity] acquired it....\" BR \u00a7 7-101(d)(1)(ii) (definition of \"collection agency\"). A \"consumer claim\" is defined to be a claim that is \"for money owed\" and that \"arises from a transaction in which, for a family, household, or personal purpose, the [debtor] sought or got ... real property....\" BR \u00a7 7-101(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   Application of the statute in these cases is straightforward. The debt at issue in each case is a loan for the purchase of a residential property secured by a deed of trust - colloquially, a mortgage. Thus, the debt represents money owed in connection with a transaction for \"a family, household, or personal purpose\" involving real property. There is no question that these debts\n   fit the definition of \"consumer claim.\" In each case, a statutory trust acquired the consumer claim at a discount, as the debt was already in default. These trusts were created specifically for the purpose of acquiring these claims (together with numerous other similar consumer claims) for the purpose of collecting those debts for the benefit of the trust and, of course, the owners of the trust. Accordingly, each of these trusts, acting through the Petitioner trustees, is an entity in the business of collecting consumer claims that it owns and that it acquired when the claim was already in\n   default. Thus, in each case, the trust must be licensed pursuant to MCALA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Majority Opinion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   The Majority labors over 64 pages to justify its conclusion that the statute does not mean what it says. Before detailing the problems with that analysis, it is worth noting that the Majority Opinion explicitly declines to endorse Petitioners' argument that a foreclosure action is not collection of a debt under MCALA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Majority op. at ---- - ---- n.3. Nor does the Majority Opinion adopt Petitioners' argument that these entities are \"trust companies\" - correctly in my view.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (If these entities were trust companies, there would be no need for the Majority Opinion to comb through the legislative history to justify an exemption for them - the text of the statute clearly exempts trust companies. BR \u00a7 7-102(b)(8) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   To the extent that the Majority Opinion agrees with the Petitioners, it deviates from our usual approach to statutory construction and, in the course of that journey, creates its own criteria for application of MCALA that do not appear in the\n   statute itself. The problems with this approach and with the conclusions that the Majority Opinion draws are several:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   \u2022\n   <em>\n    In the beginning is the text\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   Every appellate decision that sets forth the process for the interpretation of statutes - decisions too numerous to be counted - says that we start with the text. The Majority Opinion acknowledges this bedrock principle,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   but essentially skips that step and focuses on the legislative history to find some justification for ignoring the clear import of the plain text of the statute. Indeed, a reader of the Majority Opinion does not encounter the current text of the key statutory provisions until pages 114-16,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=191%20A.3d%201204\">\n    191 A.3d 1204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -05, nearly halfway into the opinion. The Majority Opinion notes that the statute defines \"collection agency.\" But it then\n   quickly casts aside the statutory definition in favor of what it describes as the \"commonly understood\" definition, declares a \"conflict\" between the two, and then spends most of its analysis on legislative history materials. This approach to statutory construction has been likened by a federal appellate judge to \"entering a crowded cocktail party and looking over the heads of the guests for one's friends.\" Jack Schwartz &amp; Amanda Stakem Conn,\n   <em>\n    The Court of Appeals at the Cocktail Party: The Use and Misuse of Legislative History\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=54%20Md.%20L.%20Rev.%20432\">\n    54 Md.

That may be true, but the Majority Opinion's use of legislative history to reach a contrary result is shaky, even if one is willing to ignore the statutory text.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   \u2022\n   <em>\n    The Majority Opinion substitutes its own criteria for the statutory criteria.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   Instead of focusing on the terms used in the statute, the Majority Opinion instead explores the legislative history materials to determine whether these trusts are \"actors\" in the appropriate \"industry.\" The Majority Opinion posits that the General Assembly exempted the \"mortgage industry\" from MCALA (ignoring the statutory language that exempts specific entities or individuals, but not \"industries\"), identifies Petitioners as \"actors\" in the \"mortgage industry\" (again, terms not found in the statute), and concludes that Petitioners are not subject to MCALA. Majority op. at ---- - ----. The terms \"collection agency industry,\" \"mortgage\n   industry,\" or \"actors\" in those industries do not appear in the statute. It is not necessary to wrestle with those concepts when the actual statutory language can be applied in a straightforward manner.\n   In tagging these statutory trusts as \"actors\" in the \"mortgage industry,\" the Majority Opinion describes in some detail the use of securitized mortgage pools. Majority op. at 137-39. Of course, securitized mortgage pools were a key driver of the financial downturn known as the Great Recession, although there is nothing inherently bad, and probably much that is economically beneficial, in the securitization of mortgage pools when it is done ethically with appropriate standardization and regulation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the Majority Opinion never quite explains how it has determined that these particular statutory trusts are part of what it characterizes as the exempt \"mortgage industry.\" There is no indication in the record that these trusts make loans for residential properties or originate mortgages. Nor is there any indication that they provide liquidity to the mortgage market by purchasing a mortgage from an originator shortly after the mortgage is issued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   What these trusts do, apparently, is buy mortgage debt at a price below face value after the mortgage is in default and attempt to collect that debt through foreclosure of the deed of trust or otherwise. These entities are not supporting the mortgage market by spreading the risk of default. The mortgages that are pooled and securitized in these entities were\n   <em>\n    already\n   </em>\n   in default. This is simply the incursion of the debt buying and collection industry into another sphere of economic activity involving yet another form of bad debt - defaulted\n   mortgage debt - a recent phenomenon documented in legal literature and the financial press.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Judith Fox,\n   <em>\n    The Foreclosure Echo: How Abandoned Foreclosures are Re-entering the Market Through Debt Buyers\n   </em>\n   , 26 Loyola Consumer L. Rev. 25, 68-70 (2013) (\"As debt collectors, who traditionally shied away from mortgage deficiency collection, enter the market, they are likely to bring the problems associated with the collection of credit cards into the world of mortgage deficiencies.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Matthew Goldstein,\n   <em>\n    As Banks Retreat, Private Equity Rushes to Buy Troubled Home Mortgages\n   </em>\n   , New York Times (September 28, 2015); Carolyn Said,\n   <em>\n    Vulture Investors buy up distressed mortgages\n   </em>\n   , San Francisco Chronicle (June 7, 2010); Jim Wasserman,\n   <em>\n    Debt collectors can come calling years after a mortgage default,\n   </em>\n   Washington Post (March 27, 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   \u2022\n   <em>\n    The Majority Opinion confuses registration of a type of business organization with regulation of a type of business.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   The Majority Opinion conjures a false dichotomy when it argues that foreign statutory trusts, like the entities involved in these cases, are regulated separately from collection agencies. Majority op. at 141-44. This argument confuses registration requirements related to the\n   <em>\n    form of business organization\n   </em>\n   of an entity with regulation of the\n   <em>\n    type of business\n   </em>\n   that the entity engages in.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   The Foreign Statutory Trust Act requires foreign statutory trusts that \"do business\" in Maryland to register with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation (\"SDAT\"). Maryland Code,\n   Corporations &amp; Associations Article (\"CA\"), \u00a7 12-902. If a foreign statutory trust fails to register, the consequence is that the trust cannot bring suit in a Maryland court. CA \u00a7 12-903. The statute excludes certain activities from the concept of \"doing business,\" with the result that a foreign statutory trust may engage in those activities in Maryland without having to register with SDAT in order to bring suit in a Maryland court. CA \u00a7 12-908. The Majority Opinion notes that one of activities on the list of exclusions is\n   \"foreclosing mortgages and deeds of trust\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   and concludes that \"there is a direct conflict [with the argument] that MCALA requires foreign statutory trusts to obtain a license as a collection agency before engaging in foreclosure proceedings.\" Majority op. at 142. Based in part on that alleged conflict, it concludes that the licensing requirement in MCALA must not apply to a foreign statutory trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   But that analysis does not pay heed to the statutory text - this time, the text of the Foreign Statutory Trust Act. The exceptions to the concept of \"doing business\" in the Foreign Statutory Trust Act are \"for the purposes of this subtitle\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   -\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the Foreign Statutory Trust Act - not for purposes of MCALA or any other statute. There is no \"conflict.\" All the exception in the Foreign Statutory Trust Act means is that a foreign statutory trust may initiate a foreclosure action in a Maryland court without first registering with SDAT. It does nothing to exempt the trust from other applicable Maryland laws. There are seven other listed exceptions from the concept of \"doing business\" that also have the effect of exempting a foreign statute trust from the SDAT registration requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CA \u00a7 12-908(a). But those exceptions do not set the foreign statutory trust free from other Maryland laws. For example, under CA \u00a7 12-908(a)(7), a foreign statutory trust may rent and operate property as a result of a foreclosure proceeding without registering with SDAT. But that does not exempt the trust from landlord-tenant laws in Maryland.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   More broadly, a statutory trust is simply a form of business organization, in the same way that a corporation or a limited liability company is a form of business organization. Depending on an entity's form of business organization, the entity must comply with different organizational and registration requirements set forth in the Corporations &amp; Associations Article of the Maryland Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the form of business\n   organization does\n   not necessarily tell one anything about what kind of business the entity conducts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   The type of business that an entity engages in may subject it to regulation by the State, local, or federal governments. That substantive regulation of the entity's business does not necessarily depend on its form of organization. An entity may be appropriately organized and registered under the Corporations and Associations Article, but may still be required to obtain a license and comply with statutes that regulate the type of business that it conducts. A collection agency organized as a corporation that complies with whatever filing and registration requirements would apply to that form of business organization does not thereby become exempt from MCALA. Neither does a statutory trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   \u2022\n   <em>\n    The Majority Opinion limits the scope of MCALA contrary to legislative intent.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   The Majority Opinion refers repeatedly to the small number of collection agencies (110) covered by MCALA when it was first enacted in 1977 and the reported number of entities (40) that exploited a loophole in that statute in the mid-2000s.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Majority op. at 122, 124-25, 128-29, 130-31, 131-32, 140-41. It infers that the statute was intended to be very limited in its scope. Of course, the numbers cited by the Majority Opinion relate to a period before the proliferation of statutory trusts that buy defaulted mortgages and attempt to collect them. This is not a situation where there are a limited number of collection agency licenses to be awarded, like taxi medallions. Rather, the number of individuals or entities subject to a particular type of regulation grows with the growth of the activity that is regulated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   The number of lawyers has grown\n   exponentially since the profession was first regulated in this State. The same is likely true of most other regulated businesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   There is no question that the public officials responsible for enforcing MCALA at that time of the 2007 amendment of the statute believed that the original definition of \"collection agency\" in the statute was too narrow in not encompassing debt buyers and that they pointed to specific entities that were exploiting that loophole at that time. But that does not mean that the reach of the amended statute was limited to those few examples. As the Majority Opinion recounts, one of the agency board members who testified before the Legislature sought the amendment because debt purchasers \"are increasing in number\" partly as a result of \"unregulated newly-evolved kinds of businesses not covered under current licensing laws\" that were engaged in the purchase and collection of defaulted debt.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Majority op. at 132-34 (quoting testimony of Eileen Brandenberg, member of State Collection Agency Licensing Board before House Economic Matters Committee). The statutory trusts in these cases are \"a newly evolved kind of business\" that would not have been\n   covered under the original version of MCALA. But they come clearly within the plain language that the General Assembly enacted to respond to that concern.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Summary\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   The Majority Opinion concludes that foreign statutory trusts are not required to\n   be licensed under MCALA. However, it explicitly does not decide whether foreclosure of defaulted mortgage debt by someone other than a foreign statutory trust is \"debt collection\" under the statute and whether trustees or substitute trustees, who are the agents of these trusts, must be licensed under MCALA. Majority op. at 95-96 n.3. It may well be that the bottom line of the Majority Opinion is that the homeowners in these cases simply identified the wrong party in their motions and counter-complaints.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   In my view, however, the language of MCALA is clear. The legislative history of the statute does not contradict that language. The statutory trusts in these cases are in the business of buying and attempting to collect defaulted consumer debt that was already in default when they acquired it. They must obtain a collection agency license. The decisions of the circuit courts and the Court of Special Appeals should be affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   Judge Adkins has advised that she joins this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-236\">\n    The Board also enforces the Maryland Consumer Debt Collection Act (\"MCDCA\").
