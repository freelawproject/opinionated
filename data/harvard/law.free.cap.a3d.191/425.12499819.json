If the answer to this question is \"yes,\" then a child who was not a participant in the research study but who the medical research institute knew resided in the property with a participant of the research study, would have an opportunity for recourse in the event of an alleged injury, as the medical research institute would owe that child a duty of care. To prevail, such a person would, of course, still need to establish the other three elements of negligence,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , a breach of the duty of care, \"a legally cognizable causal relationship between the breach of duty and the harm suffered, and damages.\"\n   <em>\n    Kiriakos v. Phillips\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4310917,12485102\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/448/440/\">\n    448 Md. 440\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 456,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4310917,12485102\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/448/440/\">\n    139 A.3d 1006\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1016 (2016) (cleaned up). If the answer to the question is \"no,\" then a child who was not enrolled in the research study but who was allegedly injured would not have the ability to pursue a claim for negligence against the medical research institute, despite any purported injury. Thus, we must determine whether a duty of care exists under the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Before we answer this significant question, we briefly set the stage. From 1993 to 1999, Kennedy Krieger Institute, Inc. (\"KKI\"), Petitioner, conducted a \"Lead-Based Paint Abatement and Repair and Maintenance Study\" (\"the R &amp; M Study\") to investigate the effectiveness of various levels of repair and maintenance interventions,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , lead-based paint abatement methods, in reducing exposure to lead in houses and reducing children's blood-lead levels. Shortly after the R &amp; M Study concluded, in\n   <em>\n    Grimes v. Kennedy Krieger Inst., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"270345\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/366/29/#p48\">\n    366 Md. 29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 48-56, 63,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"270345\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/366/29/#p48\">\n    782 A.2d 807\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 819-24, 828 (2001), this Court discussed the R &amp; M Study at length, and held that\n   a trial court erred in granting KKI's motions for summary judgment in two cases in which the plaintiffs were child participants in the R &amp; M Study by consent agreements. We explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   Such research programs[,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , the R &amp; M Study,] normally create special relationships and/or can be of a contractual nature, that create duties. The breaches of such duties may ultimately result in viable negligence actions. Because, at the very least, there are viable and genuine disputes of material fact concerning whether a special relationship, or other\n   relationships arising out of agreements, giving rise to duties existed between KKI and both sets of [plaintiff]s, we hold that the [trial c]ourt erred in granting KKI's motions for summary judgment in both cases ....

Unlike the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Grimes\n   </em>\n   , however, Ashley was not a participant in the R &amp; M Study, which only included children aged six months to four years. In May 1994, when Ashley's mother, Jacqueline Martin, completed an eligibility questionnaire for the R &amp; M Study, Ashley was five years old, and was ineligible to be a participant. In May 1994, Ashley's younger sister, Anquenette Partlow (\"Anquenette\"), who was two years old, became a participant in the R &amp; M\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Study through a consent form signed by Martin. Although Ashley was not a participant in the R &amp; M Study, she lived in the subject property with her family, including Anquenette, during her younger sister's participation in the R &amp; M Study.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In response to Ashley's complaint, KKI filed various motions for summary judgment, including one concerning the claim for negligence, arguing that it did not owe a legal duty to Ashley because Ashley was not a participant of the R &amp; M Study and it did not own, lease, or operate the subject property. Following a hearing, the circuit court issued an order granting the motions for summary judgment. In a memorandum opinion, the circuit court concluded that KKI did not owe Ashley a duty of care, and that the researcher-subject duty that this Court recognized in\n   <em>\n    Grimes\n   </em>\n   did not extend to Ashley. The circuit court also ruled that KKI did not owe Ashley a duty of care under the Baltimore City Housing Code, and that Ashley had failed to allege facts sufficient to support a claim for violation of the Maryland Consumer Protection Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Ashley appealed. In an unreported opinion, the majority of a panel of the Court of Special Appeals reversed the circuit court's grant of summary judgment in KKI's favor as to Ashley's negligence claim, concluding that a \"special relationship created by the R &amp; M Study encompassed her as well as her sister.\"\n   <em>\n    Ashley Partlow v. Kennedy Krieger Inst., et al.\n   </em>\n   , Nos. 44 and 530, Sept.

App. Oct. 23, 2017). The Court of Special Appeals held that KKI owed Ashley a duty of care under the common law, stating \"that KKI owed to Ashley the same duty of care it owed to R &amp; M Study participants who lived in the same dwelling pursuant to the same lease agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7, *9.

Put plainly, under the circumstances of this case, KKI owed Ashley a duty of care under the common law. Our holding is based on the balance of the factors set\n   forth in\n   <em>\n    Kiriakos\n   </em>\n   for determining the existence of a duty under the common law, as consideration of those factors weighs heavily in favor of imposing a duty on KKI to Ashley, and imposing a duty of care on KKI does not create an indeterminate class of potential plaintiffs exposing KKI to unending liability. Additionally, irrespective of the establishment of a duty under traditional tort analysis, the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment in KKI's favor because there was sufficient evidence of a special relationship between KKI and Ashley to submit the issue to the trier of fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    The R &amp; M Study\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   From 1993 to 1999, KKI, a research organization associated with The Johns Hopkins Hospital, Johns Hopkins University, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and Johns\n   Hopkins University School of Public Health (together, \"Johns Hopkins\"), conducted the R &amp; M Study to investigate the use of lead-based paint abatement measures in reducing exposure to lead in houses.

We understand that your house is going to have special repairs done in order to reduce exposure to lead in paint and dust. On a random basis, ho[us]es will receive one of two levels of repair. We are interested in finding out how well the two levels of repair work. The repairs are not intended, or expected, to completely remove exposure to lead.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   We are now doing a study to learn about how well different practices work for reducing exposure to lead in paint and dust. We are asking you and over one hundred other families to allow us to test for lead in and around your ho[us]es up to 8 times over the next two years provided that your house qualifies for the full two years of study. Final eligibility will be determined after the initial testing of your ho[us]e. We are also doing free blood lead testing of children aged 6 months to 7 years, up to 8 times over the next\n   two years. We would also like you to respond to a short questionnaire every 6 months.

In the future we would mail you a check in the amount of $15 each time the full questionnaire is completed. The dust, soil, water, and blood samples would be tested for lead at [KKI] at no charge to you. We would provide you with specific blood-lead results.

The fourth group consisted of houses, which had at one time lead present but had since allegedly received a complete abatement of lead dust. The fifth group consisted of modern houses, which had never had the presence of lead dust. The twenty-five ho[us]es in each of the first three testing levels were then to be compared to the two control groups: the twenty-five ho[us]es in Group 4 that had previously been abated and the 25 modern ho[us]es in Group 5.

In 1992, Polakoff transferred ownership of the Property to CFOD-2 Limited Partnership, a limited partnership that had an entity known as Chase Management, Inc. as its general partner. Polakoff is the\n   president of Chase Management, which took care of the day-to-day operations and management of the Property. According to Polakoff, he was solicited by KKI, and volunteered the Property to be a part of the R &amp; M Study.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In December 1993, KKI hired an outside contractor to test the Property for the presence of lead-based paint and lead dust. The Property tested positive for the presence of lead-based paint throughout the house, at a multitude of locations. The Property also tested positive for the presence of lead dust throughout the house. According to Dr. Farfel, both the testing for lead-based paint and lead dust qualified the Property for the R &amp; M Study, and the Property was deemed structurally sound. Once it qualified for the R &amp; M Study, the Property was randomly assigned to Level II intervention,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Group 2. As such, the cost of repairs was capped at $3,500. In a letter dated April 12, 1994, a company named Environmental Restorations, Inc. sent Polakoff a \"Lead Paint Abatement/Construction Proposal\" proposing repairs totaling $3,500 that were \"designed to remove or encapsulate certain lead[-]based painted surfaces within the [P]roperty.\" Polakoff gave approval for the repairs in that amount to be done, and the repairs were completed sometime shortly thereafter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Ashley\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   On December 10, 1988, Ashley was born. From birth until 1994, Ashley resided with her mother, Martin, at various\n   properties. At some point in 1994, Martin and her friend, Catina Higgins, learned that the Property was available to rent. According to Martin, when the women asked about renting the Property, they were advised that, as part of the rental application, they would need to provide their children's blood-lead level test results. According to Martin, after she asked why blood-lead level test results were needed, the management office responded that it was required because the Property was \"lead-free\" and that either $7,000 or $17,000 worth of repairs had been done on the Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   On May 13, 1994, Martin and Higgins signed a lease, renting the Property.

Shortly after the lease was signed, all five individuals-the two women and three children-moved into the Property. At that time, Ashley was five years old and Anquenette was two years old.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   According to Martin, shortly after moving into the Property, she met with a KKI representative, completed a questionnaire, and agreed to send Ashley and Anquenette to KKI to have their blood drawn. The questionnaire was completed on May 24, 1994. The questionnaire was designed to be used by a KKI representative to determine whether a household would or would not be eligible for participation in the R &amp; M Study. The questionnaire that Martin completed appears to have been filled in by a KKI representative; Martin's signature is not on the questionnaire, but the KKI representative's initials are. According to the questionnaire, Martin indicated that one child between the ages of six months and four years lived in the Property, and she provided Anquenette's information, including her date of birth. Significantly, as part of the questionnaire, the\n   KKI representative asked Martin to identify the\n   name, age, sex, and race of each occupant of the Property. According to the questionnaire, Martin identified herself, Higgins, Ashley, Myron, and Anquenette, and indicated the respective ages of the individuals, including that Ashley was five years old.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   On May 24, 1994, the same day that Martin answered questions for the eligibility questionnaire, Martin enrolled Anquenette in the R &amp; M Study by signing a Clinical Investigation Consent Form.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   At a deposition, as part of this case, Martin testified about the circumstances surrounding leasing the Property and blood-lead level testing of her children:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   [MARTIN:] I asked if we didn't -- if the doctors didn't -- if they didn't get the lead levels, what would be -- would we still be able to rent the house.

Martin testified that she believed that KKI was testing Ashley and Anquenette to ensure that their blood-lead levels were safe, and denied knowing that the family was participating in the R &amp; M Study:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   [W]hen [KKI] came to the house, they -- when they asked me did I want my kids to go to [KKI] to get their lead levels taken, which I thought would be a good gesture, a good thing to make sure my kids didn't -- did not have lead, that's how I took it.

(Cleaned up). As the circuit court noted, Ashley was treated at KKI, but not because she was a participant of the R &amp; M Study. At a motions hearing, Ashley acknowledged that she was seen at KKI because she was referred there through the Baltimore City Health Department. Nonetheless, the Lead Poisoning Questionnaire informed of Ashley's residence at the Property, and a blood-lead level report dated November 9, 1994 included the handwritten notation \"In R &amp; M House\" on the upper-right portion of the page, indicating that KKI was aware that Ashley resided in a property subject to the R &amp; M Study.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Martin, Ashley, Anquenette, Higgins, and Myron resided at the Property from May 1994 until some point in February 1995.

According to Ashley, KKI was responsible for her exposure to lead at the Property based on Anquenette's enrollment in the R &amp; M Study. Ashley alleged that KKI \"controll[ed] the decisions about the scope of the repairs[,] the manner and means of repairs[,] and the level of interventions to be performed\" at the Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   After the filing of the complaint and answers by defendants, KKI filed various motions for summary judgment, including a motion for summary judgment as to negligence. In the motion, KKI argued that it did not owe a duty to Ashley because: (1) Ashley was not a participant of\n   the R &amp; M Study; and (2) KKI did not own, lease, or operate the Property, and was not involved with Ashley's residence there. In an accompanying memorandum of law, KKI asserted that it had no duty to Ashley arising from a researcher-subject relationship because Ashley was not enrolled in the R &amp; M Study. KKI also maintained that Ashley's negligence claim failed because there was no evidence that she suffered any injury resulting from exposure to lead at the Property. Ashley filed an opposition to the motion for summary judgment as to negligence, contending that her lack of participation in the R &amp; M Study was of no consequence as to whether KKI owed her a duty of care. Ashley argued that KKI owed her a duty of care for several reasons, including that KKI knew that she was residing at the Property and that she was going to be exposed to lead there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   On February 13, 2015, the circuit court conducted a hearing on the various motions, including KKI's motion for summary judgment as to negligence. At the conclusion of the hearing, the circuit court took the matter under advisement. On February 19, 2015, the circuit court issued an order granting KKI's motions for summary judgment, including the motion for summary judgment as to negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   On March 24, 2015, the circuit court issued a memorandum opinion explaining the reasons for the order. The circuit court concluded that KKI owed Ashley no duty of care, and, that\n   \"[t]he researcher-subject duty recognized in\n   <em>\n    Grimes\n   </em>\n   [ ] does not extend to [ ] Ashley[,]\" and that KKI, therefore, was entitled to judgment as a matter of law as to the counts for negligence, lack of informed consent, common law fraud/intentional misrepresentation, and additional grounds for punitive damages.

KKI argues that it did not have a \"direct relationship\" with Ashley, who was not enrolled in the R &amp; M Study, and that, notwithstanding the foreseeability of the harm alleged, a duty must be premised on the existence of a \"direct relationship\" between a plaintiff and a defendant. KKI asserts that\n   <em>\n    Grimes\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable from this case because Ashley did not participate in the R &amp; M Study, KKI never obtained informed consent from Martin for Ashley to participate, and KKI alleged that it did not monitor Ashley, gather information about her, or treat her for lead exposure or injuries. KKI maintains that the Court of Special Appeals impermissibly expanded\n   <em>\n    Grimes\n   </em>\n   to create a duty between KKI and any individual who lived in a property with an R &amp; M Study participant, creating an indeterminate class of potential plaintiffs to whom a duty would extend. According to KKI, it was inconsistent for the Court of Special Appeals to hold that KKI owed Ashley a duty under the common law while at the same time not finding a duty arising under the Baltimore City Housing Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Ashley responds that that the circumstances of this case demonstrate that a duty of care is warranted because KKI knew that the Property contained lead and knew that Ashley-then a child-was residing in the Property and that she would be exposed to lead in the same manner and under the same conditions as her sister. Ashley asserts that there is no logical basis on which to distinguish between her and her sister for purposes of determining whether KKI owed a duty. Ashley maintains that, in determining whether a duty of care exists in personal injury cases, Maryland courts focus on the foreseeability of the harm, not on the existence of a \"direct relationship\" between the plaintiff and defendant. Ashley contends that, in personal injury cases, a \"direct relationship\" is not required for a duty to exist. Ashley argues that, instead, courts examine a set of factors, including, among other things,\n   the foreseeability of harm to a plaintiff, as well as the degree of certainty that the plaintiff suffered the injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Ashley asserts that, even if a relationship between a plaintiff and defendant is required to establish a duty of care, she and KKI had such a relationship. Ashley maintains that duties created by the special relationship between KKI and her sister should be extended where KKI knew that she was being exposed to the same hazard and knew the exposure extended to a minor child who was vulnerable to the toxin at issue. Ashley argues that recognizing the existence of a duty in this case does not create an indeterminate class of potential plaintiffs because only a limited number of individuals are in the same position as she is-namely, children who KKI knew would be exposed to the exact same danger as the R &amp; M Study participants.

The context of the statement was a non-therapeutic study that promises no medical benefit to the child whatever, so that any balance between risk and benefit is necessarily negative.

When these factors are considered along with the predominant foreseeability factor, finding a duty becomes the clear choice. Thus, we conclude that the duty to warn in this context exists in the limited circumstances when (1) a manufacturer's product contains asbestos components, and no safer material is available; (2) asbestos is a critical part of the pump sold by the manufacturer; (3) periodic maintenance involving handling asbestos gaskets and packing is required; and (4) the manufacturer knows or should know of the risks from exposure to asbestos.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   <em>\n    May\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4165540\" index=\"251\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/446/1/#p5\">\n    446 Md. at 10-11, 18-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4165540\" index=\"252\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/446/1/#p5\">\n    129 A.3d at 989, 994\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Here, we hold that a duty of care exists in the limited circumstances where: (1) a medical research institute knows of the presence of a child, who is not a participant in a research study concerning lead-based paint abatement of a property, who resides at a property that is subject to the research study during a participant child's enrollment in the study; (2) the medical research institute has signed a consent agreement with a parent or guardian for a participant child's enrollment in the research study and both the participant and non-participant children reside at a property subject to the study; (3) the medical research institute knows or should know of the presence or suspected presence of lead in the property; (4) the medical research institute determined the level of lead-based\n   paint abatement for the property;\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (5) the non-participant child who resided at the property during the research study was allegedly injured by being exposed to lead at the property.

KKI could have anticipated that both participant children and non-participant children living in Group 2 properties could accumulate lead in their blood as a result of the R &amp; M Study, and be injured.

The factor of foreseeability of harm weighs strongly in favor of imposing a duty on KKI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   With respect to the degree of certainty that Ashley suffered the injury, Ashley alleged that she was exposed to lead at the Property as a result of the R &amp; M Study, thereby causing her permanent injury. Indeed, in the complaint, Ashley alleged that lead poisoning caused her severe\n   and permanent brain damage, as well as physical pain and mental anguish, and that her IQ has been significantly diminished. Specifically, in response to defense motions, Ashley submitted a neuropsychological evaluation, which indicated that her full-scale IQ is 65. And, allegedly, while residing at the Property, Ashley had elevated blood-lead levels. In exhibits attached to a motion for partial summary judgment, Ashley included records reflecting the following. Within four months after moving into the Property, Ashley's blood-lead level was reported as 21 micrograms per deciliter (\u00b5g/dL). Later, while still residing at the Property, Ashley's blood-lead level was reported as \"19, 19.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   On or about February 16, 1995, Ashley allegedly moved\n   out of the Property; on February 17, 1995, Ashley's blood was collected, and on February 20, 1995, Ashley's blood-lead level was reported as 13 \u00b5g/dL.

The allegation in this case is that Ashley was directly injured by the R &amp; M Study in the same manner as her sister, who was a participant in the study.

Even though the program may have been well intended in the sense that its ultimate goal was to find practical methods to abate the ill effects of lead-based paint, those conducting the program were required to consider the obvious consequences of their actions, and we attribute moral blame for their failure to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   The moral blame of KKI's conduct attendant to children who were participants in the R &amp; M Study was readily apparent to this Court in\n   <em>\n    Grimes\n   </em>\n   . We conclude that KKI's conduct is equally blameworthy with respect to children like Ashley, who KKI knew resided in a property subject to the R &amp; M Study with a participant of the study. Indeed, KKI's conduct is just as blameworthy with respect to Ashley when compared to Anquenette because KKI's conduct with respect to Ashley reeks of indifference to the circumstance that she was exposed to lead in a house that was subject to the study and for which KKI\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   prescribed limited funds for lead-based paint abatement. Because the R &amp; M Study necessarily would have impacted not only participant children, but also non-participant children residing in properties subject to the study, exposing both sets of children equally to lead, KKI's conduct was just as blameworthy with respect to non-participant children as it was with respect to children participating in the study. The factor of moral blameworthiness weighs in favor of establishing a duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   As to the policy of preventing future harm, in\n   <em>\n    Kiriakos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4310917,12485102\" index=\"284\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/448/440/\">\n    448 Md. at 490\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4310917,12485102\" index=\"285\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/448/440/\">\n    139 A.3d at 1036\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , we explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-174\">\n   The prophylactic factor of preventing future harm has been quite important in the field of torts. The courts are concerned not only with the compensation of the victim, but with admonition of the wrongdoer. When the decisions of the courts become known, and defendants realize that they may be held liable, there is of course a strong incentive to prevent the occurrence of the harm. Not infrequently[,] one reason for imposing liability is the deliberate purpose of providing that incentive.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   (Cleaned up). It is important to prevent medical researchers from using young children in research experiments like the R &amp; M Study, and then disavowing responsibility for children who are not a part of the study but equally exposed to its hazards. There is a strong incentive to prevent the harm that may occur to such children, and to incentivize medical researchers to fully advise parents of the risks attendant to such studies on all children, not just children who participate in the study. This is a case in which KKI knew that a non-participant child, Ashley, was or was likely to be exposed to lead as a result of its conduct in connection to the study.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"675760\" index=\"286\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/388/407/#p415\">\n    388 Md. at 423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"675760\" index=\"287\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/388/407/#p415\">\n    879 A.2d at 1097\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]his is not a case in which an actor, such as a doctor, knew or should have known that an unsuspecting person had or was likely to have a disease and failed to advise that person or a third party to avoid transmission of the contagion.\" (Citations omitted) ). The prevention of such future harm is imperative. Consideration of this policy heavily favors imposing a duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   Concerning the extent of the burden on KKI and consequences to the community of imposing a duty, we conclude that the risk of harm to children who are exposed to lead-based paint outweighs the extent of any burden to KKI of imposing a duty. The consequences of subjecting children to lead and the attendant long-term effects of lead poisoning on developing brains are potentially great, such that the burden of tort liability is outweighed by the benefit of protecting\n   children who were exposed to lead during the R &amp; M Study. This factor strongly favors imposition of a duty of care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   Insofar as the availability, cost, and prevalence of insurance for the risk involved is concerned, on brief, neither party provided information about the availability or cost of insurance. And, at oral argument, Ashley's counsel stated that there was \"no evidence [ ] either way\" concerning insurance. In the absence of such information, we decline to address the seventh factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   Reviewing six of the seven factors, we conclude that the seven-pronged test for balancing the policy considerations necessary to determine whether a duty of care exists under the common law weighs heavily in favor of recognizing such a duty, and, indeed, establishes that KKI owes Ashley a duty of care. In short, in a personal injury case, a duty of care may arise without the existence of a direct or special relationship between a plaintiff and defendant, and such a duty has arisen under a traditional tort law analysis in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Special Relationship\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   Although our analysis could conclude at this point, we are also convinced that, viewing the record in the light most favorable to Ashley, and construing any reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the facts against KKI, there was sufficient evidence that KKI had a special relationship with Ashley and her family to submit the issue to the trier of fact,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , a jury. In other words, the grant of summary judgment in KKI's favor was also improper for this reason. The record reflects that KKI knew that Ashley, then a young child, resided in the Property, which was subject to the R &amp; M Study. KKI knew that the Property contained lead, and that Ashley would be exposed to lead in the same manner and under the same conditions as her participant-sister.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   Under the circumstances alleged, the Property qualified for the R &amp; M Study, and was assigned to Group 2; and KKI limited funds for repairs to the Property to $3,500. KKI allegedly sent letters to Martin notifying her of the testing of\n   dust in the Property for lead, the first of which gave the impression that the Property did not contain any lead dust. Two later letters showed that certain locations from which dust was collected contained an \"amount of lead [that] was higher than might be found in a completely renovated house.\" The two later letters suggest that, after the Group 2 abatement procedure, KKI knew that the Property continued to contain lead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   Moreover, Martin testified at a deposition that, while living at the Property, she agreed to send both Ashley and Anquenette to KKI to have their blood drawn. Despite the circumstance that Ashley was not a participant in the R &amp; M Study, KKI maintained records on Ashley, including blood-lead level test results. For example, a Lead Poisoning Questionnaire completed by a KKI interviewer on November 9, 1994, detailed information about Ashley, such as her residential history, hand-to-mouth activity, diet, behavior and symptoms, social history, and past medical history. To be sure, Ashley was treated at KKI because she had been referred to KKI by the Baltimore City Health Department and not as part of the R &amp; M Study. Nevertheless, KKI was aware of Ashley's presence, her exposure to lead at the Property, and her elevated blood-lead levels while living there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   Considering the above, Ashley has sufficiently alleged that a relationship existed between KKI and Ashley and her family. Among other things, as alleged, KKI had a direct relationship with Ashley's family based on the signed consent form enrolling Anquenette in the R &amp; M Study, and KKI conducted testing of Ashley's blood-lead levels while knowing that she resided at a property subject to the study. KKI determined the level of lead-based paint abatement at the Property through the R &amp; M Study, and KKI knew that the Property contained lead even after abatement. KKI undisputedly knew that Ashley resided at the Property and could be harmed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   All\n   of these alleged circumstances support the finding of a special relationship between KKI and Ashley.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Grimes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"270345\" index=\"288\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/366/29/#p48\">\n    366 Md. at 113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"270345\" index=\"289\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/366/29/#p48\">\n    782 A.2d at 858\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , we stated that \"[t]he determination as to whether a 'special relationship' actually exists is to be done on a case by case basis.\" (Citation omitted).

As such, even if a special relationship were required for the imposition of a tort duty in a personal injury case-which it is not-viewing the record in the light most favorable to Ashley, and construing against KKI any reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the facts, leads to the conclusion that there was sufficient evidence to submit the matter to a jury for a determination as to the existence of a special relationship. Because there was sufficient evidence for the case to be submitted to the trier of fact for a determination as to whether a special relationship existed between KKI and Ashley giving rise to a duty of care, in addition to erring by not recognizing the existence of a duty under traditional law analysis, the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment in KKI's favor without permitting the issue of a special relationship to be considered by the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   We acknowledge that there is a key factual distinction between\n   <em>\n    Grimes\n   </em>\n   and this case because the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Grimes\n   </em>\n   were participants in the R &amp; M Study, while it is undisputed that Ashley was not.

Indeed, in\n   <em>\n    Grimes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"270345\" index=\"296\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/366/29/#p48\">\n    366 Md. at 119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"270345\" index=\"297\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/366/29/#p48\">\n    782 A.2d at 861\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , on reconsideration, we clarified that the only legal conclusion that we reached was that, based on the record, the trial courts had improperly granted summary judgment in KKI's favor because there was sufficient evidence that, \"if taken in a light most favorable to the plaintiffs and believed by a jury, would suffice to justify verdicts in favor of the plaintiffs.\" Despite the distinction between\n   <em>\n    Grimes\n   </em>\n   and this case, we reach a similar result here-that Ashley produced sufficient evidence from which a trier of fact could conclude that a special relationship existed between her and KKI, giving rise to a duty of care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Lack of Indeterminate Class of Potential Plaintiffs\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   We reject KKI's contention that recognizing a duty in this case creates an indeterminate class of potential plaintiffs and would expose medical research institutions to unending liability. Our primary holding is that KKI owes a duty of care to Ashley and children like her, who were not participants in the R &amp; M Study, but who KKI knew resided with a participant of the study in a property subject to the study. This creates a finite and identifiable group of potential plaintiffs to whom KKI owes a duty of care, and is most likely to encompass siblings or other relatives of participants of the R &amp; M Study who were either too young (under six months old) or too old (over four years old) to be enrolled as participants themselves. In other words, there exists an identifiable, limited class of potential plaintiffs, and recognizing that KKI owes Ashley a duty of care does not subject KKI to unlimited liability. And, at the risk of stating the obvious, just because\n   we hold that KKI owes Ashley a duty of care, this does not mean that KKI\n   is necessarily liable for negligence. Indeed, to prevail, Ashley and similarly situated children will nonetheless be required to establish the three other elements of negligence-breach of the duty of care, causation, and damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Inapplicability of\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Dehn\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Doe\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     and\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Gourdine\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   This case is readily distinguishable in several key respects from\n   <em>\n    Dehn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Gourdine\n   </em>\n   -cases in which this Court declined to recognize a duty of care.

Indeed, KKI had a relationship with Ashley's entire family (herself, Martin, and Anquenette) by virtue of Anquenette's enrollment in the R &amp; M Study, the family's residence at the Property, which was subject to the R &amp; M Study, and KKI's testing of Ashley's blood-lead levels.

Thus, the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment in KKI's favor. Additionally, because there was sufficient evidence of a special relationship between Ashley and KKI for the issue to be submitted to a jury, the grant of summary judgment was improper on this ground as well. For these reasons, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

I disagree both with the Court's holding that KKI owed a duty of care to Ashley under traditional common law tort principles and with the Majority's conclusion that there was sufficient evidence of a special relationship between KKI and Ashley, creating another ground on which a jury could find a duty existed. Instead, I would affirm the trial court's decision in granting summary judgment in favor of KKI and adopt the sound reasoning of Judge Berger in his concurring and dissenting opinion in the Court of Special Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   In reaching both of this Court's conclusions, the Majority relies heavily on a previous case:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   <em>\n    Grimes v.

In the original\n   <em>\n    Grimes\n   </em>\n   opinion, this Court held that \"special relationships, out of which duties arise, the breach of which can constitute negligence, can result from the relationships between researcher and research subjects.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"270345\" index=\"318\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/366/29/#p48\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"270345\" index=\"318\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/366/29/#p48\">\n    at 94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"270345\" index=\"319\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/366/29/#p48\">\n    782 A.2d 807\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, this Court found that a duty arises by way of a special relationship when a research institute, such as KKI, enters into an agreement with a participating research subject, such as Ashley's sister. Our opinion in\n   <em>\n    Grimes\n   </em>\n   did not, however,\n   analyze whether a special relationship existed between a research institute and non-participants. Overall, the\n   <em>\n    Grimes\n   </em>\n   Court concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-202\">\n   The determination as to whether a \"special relationship\" actually exists is to be done on a case by case basis.

I am equally concerned that the Majority's holding today has the potential to create a duty to \"indeterminate classes of people.\"\n   <em>\n    Partlow v.

Ct. Spec. App. Oct. 23, 2017) (Berger, J., concurring and dissenting). The Majority contends that the class of people to whom KKI will owe a duty of care is \"a finite and identifiable group of potential plaintiffs ...\n   <em>\n    likely\n   </em>\n   to encompass siblings or other relatives of participants of the R &amp; M Study who were either too young (under six months old) or too old (over four years old) to be enrolled as participants themselves.\" Maj. Op. at 660, 191 A.3d at 456(emphasis added). In my view, the Majority does not fully appreciate that today's decision \"expand[s] the universe of potential plaintiffs.\"\n   <em>\n    Dehn v. Edgecombe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"419069\" index=\"328\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/384/606/\">\n    384 Md. 606\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 627,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"419069\" index=\"329\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/384/606/\">\n    865 A.2d 603\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005). Indeed, this Court's opinion now exposes KKI to a large number of negligence actions brought by siblings and relatives with whom the researchers did not enter into an agreement, did not monitor \"in the same manner as they monitored study participants[,]\" and did not purport to provide care.\n   <em>\n    Partlow\n   </em>\n   , No. 44,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"330\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204772626\">\n    2017 WL 4772626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *14 (Berger, J., concurring and dissenting).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   Moreover, the Majority does not consider the possibility that individuals outside of siblings and relatives who live with participants in research study will employ this Court's holding\n   to assert a similarly extended duty of care. For example, a boyfriend or girlfriend who lived full-time in the subject property could argue that this Court's reasoning should apply in his or her circumstance, resulting in KKI owing a duty to individuals unrelated to study participants. Another potential plaintiff could be the children of boyfriends, girlfriends, or other residents of a transient nature, who resided in the subject property part-time but did not participate in the research study. Such an unrelated child could also argue that a duty of care should be extended to those circumstances. As is exposed by these hypotheticals, this Court has intentionally limited a duty of care to \"manageable bounds\" to prevent boundless liability based on the same action.\n   <em>\n    Dehn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"419069\" index=\"331\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/384/606/\">\n    384 Md. at 627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"419069\" index=\"332\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/384/606/\">\n    865 A.2d 603\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Nazarian held only that there was a special relationship between KKI and Ashley, requiring the same duty of care to Ashley that KKI owed to study participants.\n   <em>\n    Partlow\n   </em>\n   , No. 44,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"337\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204772626\">\n    2017 WL 4772626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8-9. This Court today holds: (1) KKI owed a duty of care to Ashley under traditional common law tort principles;\n   <strong>\n    and\n   </strong>\n   (2) that there is sufficient evidence to find a special relationship between KKI and Ashley, creating a duty of care. The two holdings by this Court provide potential plaintiffs with two alternatives from which to plead duty of care. As a result of the Majority's expanded holding, non-participant individuals can now file a complaint for negligence against KKI alleging that the research institute owed a duty of care under traditional common law tort principles and that there was a special relationship,\n   providing an alternative ground from which a court can find a duty of care. Therefore, I am even more troubled by the possibility that an indeterminate class of potential plaintiffs now has\n   <strong>\n    two\n   </strong>\n   options from which to allege duty of care on the part of research institutions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.

KKI's counsel asserted that landlords could make independent decisions about lead-based paint abatement and that some used their own funds to make their own repairs. KKI's counsel claimed that these properties stayed in the study and that \"[s]ome landlords did their own repairs. Some landlords did more. Some landlords did nothing.\" When asked by the Court about the practical implications on the R &amp; M Study of landlords being able to act independently with respect to lead-based paint abatement,\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , whether that would have affected the data/results of the study, KKI's counsel asserted that no one would have stopped a landlord from completing repairs above that required by the study. When asked whether the record in this case contained any examples of situations in which a landlord made repairs independent of the R &amp; M Study, KKI's counsel stated that he did not believe that matter was at issue in the case. And, when asked a similar question again, KKI's counsel simply stated that the case was decided on summary judgment and that \"that was not an issue on summary judgment.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-224\">\n    Put simply, KKI's counsel was unable to identify anything in the record demonstrating that the owner in this case or landlords in general performed lead-based paint abatement above the level set by the R &amp; M Study. As a practical matter, logic would dictate that, if a landlord/owner completed repairs above that set by the R &amp; M Study, then that property would no longer qualify to be a part of the group to which it was designated-Group 1, 2, or 3-because more funds would have been expended than set for the group to which the property was assigned. This necessarily would have affected or undermined the research of the R &amp; M Study. In any event, here, the record is devoid of any suggestion that CFOD-2 or Polakoff performed lead-based paint abatement efforts at the Property in excess of the $3,500 of repairs set for Group 2 properties. That the agreement between KKI and a landlord/owner may not have specifically prohibited the landlord/owner from performing additional abatement repairs is of no moment. In this case, the record demonstrates that KKI determined the level of lead-based paint abatement for the Property and that the fourth factor for the existence of a duty of care is satisfied.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-225\">\n    Our holding is limited to the circumstances of this case and, specifically, to the circumstance that the record demonstrates that KKI knew that Ashley resided in the Property with a participant of the R &amp; M Study. In other words, we leave for another day the question of whether KKI would owe a duty to an individual who KKI should have known resided in a property subject to the R &amp; M Study with a participant of the study. We need not wade into the waters of defining the parameters of a \"should have known\" standard because our holding applies to individuals, such as Ashley, who KKI\n    <strong>\n     knew\n    </strong>\n    resided in a property with a participant of the R &amp; M Study.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-226\">\n    It appears that the blood-lead level result of \"19, 19\" reported by KKI could be read to mean 19 \u00b5g/dL.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-227\">\n    Before moving into the Property, Ashley had reported blood-lead levels of 18 \u00b5g/dL and 21 \u00b5g/dL.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-228\">\n    The record demonstrates the following pattern with respect to Ashley's blood-lead levels: before moving into the Property, her levels were 18 \u00b5g/dL and 21 \u00b5g/dL; while residing in the Property, her levels were 21 \u00b5g/dL and 19 \u00b5g/dL; and, after moving out of the Property, her levels were 13 \u00b5g/dL and 16 \u00b5g/dL. To be sure, this indicates that at one point Ashley's blood-lead level decreased slightly-from 21 \u00b5g/dL to 19 \u00b5g/dL-while she resided in the Property, and decreased further shortly after she moved out of the Property. That Ashley's blood-lead level decreased slightly while residing in the Property, however, does not necessarily demonstrate that she was not injured by lead at the Property. Indeed, Ashley's blood-lead levels remained elevated both during and after she resided in the Property.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Grimes\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"270345\" index=\"350\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/366/29/#p48\">\n     366 Md. at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    59 &amp; n.23,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"270345\" index=\"351\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/366/29/#p48\">\n     782 A.2d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    825 &amp; n.23 (This Court indicated that, as of 1993 and 1994, the Centers for Disease Control classified blood-lead levels of 15-19 \u00b5g/dL as \"Class IIB (Moderately elevated)\" and levels of 20-44 \u00b5g/dL as \"Class III (Highly elevated)[.]\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-229\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Rogers v.

Adkins, we rejected the contention that a plaintiff alleging negligence in a lead-based paint case has to show a reasonable probability that an elevated blood-lead level represented an increase in the plaintiff's blood-lead level at a particular property, explaining:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-230\">\n    To reach a jury, [the plaintiff] must only show that it is reasonably probable that [the subject property] contributed to his elevated lead levels-he does not have to demonstrate that his lead level increased when he moved in.... The fact that a lead-exposed child might have lived or spent time in more than one lead-based-painted property should not foreclose that child as a matter of law from pursuing any one of those potential sources-as long as he is able to rule in the subject property[.] Although [the plaintiff] cannot prove that his blood lead levels increased when he moved to [the subject property], they remained elevated without decrease while he lived there. [A doctor] testified that once [the plaintiff] was no longer exposed to lead, his blood lead levels would decrease after about 30 to 45 days. From this, a jury could reasonably infer that if [the subject property] was not a contributing source, [the plaintiff's] March 1997 lead level would have been lower.... Viewing th[e] evidence in the light most favorable to [the plaintiff], a jury could reasonably infer that his blood lead level declined in April 1997 because had left the source of his exposure, which was [the subject property].\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-231\">\n    (Cleaned up). In other words, a plaintiff alleging negligence in a lead-based paint case is not required to demonstrate that his or her blood-lead level increased when he or she moved into the subject property to establish that property as a reasonably probable cause of his or her elevated blood-lead levels. Thus, in ultimately establishing negligence, it is an issue for the trier of fact to determine whether Ashley's elevated blood-lead levels at the Property demonstrate that she was injured at the Property. We simply conclude that, based on the information that Ashley provided in support of her claim, the factor concerning the degree of certainty that she has suffered injury plainly weighs in favor of establishing a duty.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-232\">\n    We note that KKI does not dispute that it knew that Ashley resided at the Property.

The Court of Special Appeals concluded that no duty of care arose under the Baltimore City Housing Code because KKI did not satisfy the definitions of \"owner,\" \"operator,\" or \"agent\" under the Baltimore City Housing Code.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Partlow\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"354\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204772626\">\n     2017 WL 4772626\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *9-10.

KKI has not briefed the matter nor brought the Court's attention to any specific regulations that it contends would conflict with imposition of a duty of care.
