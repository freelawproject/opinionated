The defendant was charged with felony murder and first degree robbery, among other crimes, after he and an accomplice, Emmitt Scott, allegedly robbed Ruben Gonzalez (victim) and Jose Rivera at gunpoint and Scott shot and killed the victim. The trial court denied the defendant's pretrial motion to suppress an identification that Rivera had made of the defendant while the defendant was being arraigned in an unrelated robbery case, as well as any in-court identification that Rivera might later be asked to make of the defendant. Following a trial, the jury found the defendant guilty of one count each of felony murder and conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree, and two counts of robbery in the first degree.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On appeal,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the defendant claims that the trial court violated his due process rights under the federal constitution\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   by denying his motion to suppress Rivera's out-of-court and in-court identifications of him because, contrary to the conclusion of the trial court, the former was the product of an unnecessarily suggestive procedure and neither was reliable. The defendant further claims that, even if the state's use of Rivera's out-of-court and in-court identifications did not violate his\n   due process rights under the federal constitution, the admission of those identifications violated his due process rights under the state constitution, which, the defendant contends, are more protective than his federal due process rights. Although we agree with the defendant that the out-of-court identification procedure was unnecessarily suggestive, we also conclude that Rivera's identification of the defendant was nevertheless sufficiently reliable to satisfy federal due process requirements. Accordingly, for purposes of the federal constitution, the defendant was not entitled to suppression of those identifications. We further conclude that the due process guarantee of the state constitution in article first, \u00a7 8,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   provides somewhat broader protection than the federal constitution with respect to the admissibility of eyewitness identification testimony but that, in the present case, the trial court's failure to apply the state constitutional standard that we adopt today was harmless because the court reasonably could not have reached a different conclusion under that more demanding standard. We therefore affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of the defendant's claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   After working together during the night shift at a warehouse in the town of Newington, the victim drove Rivera back to Rivera's home in the Fair Haven section of the city of New Haven, arriving at about 3 a.m. on July 31, 2012. The victim and Rivera were rolling a blunt in the victim's car when the defendant and Scott approached on either side of the vehicle. Scott, who was standing on the passenger side, demanded that Rivera roll down the\n   window, and both the victim and Rivera were then ordered out of the car. The victim and Rivera initially refused to exit the car but did so after Scott struck Rivera on the head with his gun. After the defendant and Scott searched the victim and Rivera for cash and valuables, the defendant rummaged through the car's interior for two to three minutes, during which Scott kept his gun pointed at Rivera. When the defendant found $600 and a cell phone in the center console, he said \"[b]ingo,\" and he and Scott began to walk away. As they were leaving, the victim shouted from behind them, \"I'll remember your face,\" whereupon Scott turned and shot the victim twice, killing him. The entire incident lasted approximately ten minutes.\n   Jeffrey King, an officer with the New Haven Police Department (department), was the first officer on the scene, arriving at approximately 3:30 a.m. At that time, Rivera provided King with a description of the shooter, Scott. With respect to the lighting, the crime scene was so well lit by nearby streetlamps and house lights that King did not need to use a flashlight in connection with his investigation, despite the early morning hour.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Rivera was then taken from the crime scene to police headquarters, where he was interviewed by Detective Nicole Natale. At that time, Rivera described the shooter's accomplice-who had been standing on the driver's side of the vehicle and whom he would later identify as the defendant-as an African-American male with a thin build, approximately six feet, one inch, or six feet, two inches, in height, approximately twenty-six or twenty-seven years old, with short cropped hair, and as wearing a white t-shirt and blue jeans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Eight days later, on August 8, 2012, after learning that Scott was a suspect in several Fair Haven robberies, Natale performed a sequential photographic lineup for Rivera that included Scott's photograph. Rivera failed to identify Scott as one of the assailants. Later that day,\n   a fingerprint found on the front driver's side door of the victim's car was identified as belonging to the defendant. Although Natale used the fingerprint to obtain a photograph of the defendant through a police database, she never presented the defendant's photograph to Rivera in a lineup procedure or otherwise. On August 10, 2012, a fingerprint found on the front passenger's side door of the victim's car was identified as belonging to Scott.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Thereafter, the police learned that both the defendant and Scott were due to be arraigned on unrelated charges in court in New Haven on August 13, 2012. Robert Lawlor, an inspector with the state's attorney's office in the judicial district of New Haven, accompanied Rivera to the courthouse on that day so that Rivera could observe the arraignments and possibly identify the two men who had accosted him and the victim. Although Lawlor knew that the defendant and Scott were to be arraigned, he did not inform Rivera of that fact, and he never made Rivera aware of the defendant's name. The defendant and Scott were among fourteen arraignees who were being detained pending arraignment; the other twenty arraignees who appeared that day had not been in custody prior to their arraignment. Lawlor and Rivera both sat in the front row of the courtroom's public gallery, with Lawlor seated six seats away from Rivera. From his vantage point, Rivera watched the defendant, Scott, and the twelve other custodial arraignees-all of them handcuffed and surrounded by marshals-enter the courtroom single file through a door located only five feet away from him. Rivera recognized the defendant and Scott \"as soon as they walked through the door.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Once he was outside\n   the courtroom, Rivera told Lawlor with \"[n]o hesitation\" that he was \"100 percent positive those are the two suspects .... I will never forget it.\" Lawlor responded that, in fact, they \"may be\" the suspects, at which point the two men left the courthouse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Prior to trial, the defendant moved to suppress Rivera's identification of him at\n   the arraignment proceeding and any subsequent identification that he might be asked to make of the defendant at trial. The trial court held a hearing on the motion and denied it in an oral ruling the following day, concluding that the arraignment identification procedure was not unnecessarily suggestive. At trial, Rivera testified and identified the defendant as the driver's side assailant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In a supplemental memorandum of decision issued after the trial, the court reiterated its finding that the identification procedure was not unnecessarily suggestive because, of the thirty-four total arraignees, fifteen were African-American males, which matched the description Rivera gave to Natale the morning of the murder. The trial court also supplemented its oral ruling with a finding that, even if the identification procedure was unnecessarily suggestive, the identification itself was reliable under the totality of the circumstances. In support of this conclusion, the trial court observed the following: Rivera had approximately ten minutes to observe the assailants during the commission of the crimes; the area was well illuminated despite the late hour, and the assailant's face was not covered; the car's interior dome light shone on the assailant's face while he searched inside the car; Rivera was only a few feet from the assailant and had a clear view of him; Rivera was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of the incident and otherwise was alert and attentive during the commission of the crime; Rivera's description of the assailant was specific in regard to his approximate age, height, weight, hairstyle, skin tone\n   and clothing; Rivera was 100 percent certain that the defendant was one of the perpetrators; and the length of time between the crime and Rivera's identification of the defendant was only about two weeks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The defendant first claims that the trial court's denial of his motion to suppress Rivera's in-court and out-of-court identifications violated his due process rights under the federal constitution because they both were the product of an unnecessarily suggestive arraignment identification procedure and were not reliable under the totality of the circumstances. The state contends that the trial court properly admitted Rivera's identification testimony after correctly determining that the identification procedure at issue was not unduly suggestive and that, even if, contrary to the trial court's finding, that procedure was impermissibly suggestive, Rivera's identification of the defendant at the arraignment proceeding was nonetheless reliable under all of the circumstances. We agree with the defendant that the procedure that the state used to obtain Rivera's identification of the defendant was unnecessarily suggestive. We also conclude, however, that that identification was reliable under all of the relevant circumstances and, consequently, that it was admissible and did not require the suppression of Rivera's in-court identification of the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At the outset, we briefly summarize the well established legal principles that govern our analysis of the defendant's federal constitutional claim. \"In the absence of unduly suggestive procedures conducted by state actors, the potential unreliability of eyewitness identification testimony ordinarily goes to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility, and is a question for the jury.

Specifically, the trial court found that the composition of the corporeal array\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   was not unnecessarily\n   suggestive because, of thirty-four total arraignees, fifteen of them matched Rivera's description of the driver's side assailant with respect to race (African-American) and gender (male). The court's conception of the array as consisting of the thirty-four arraignees, however, was significantly broader than the actual, operative array from which Rivera identified the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Rivera testified that Lawlor told him that \"we may have suspects in the court\" and that \"there's going to be a group of guys coming out, and let me know if you can identify\n   <em>\n    somebody that is coming out those doors\n   </em>\n   .\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   (Emphasis added.) Indeed, as we have explained, when Lawlor brought Rivera into the arraignment courtroom, he directed Rivera to sit in the front row of the gallery to ensure that he had a clear and unimpaired view of the door through which the custodial arraignees would be entering. Thus, even if we were to assume that all twenty noncustodial arraignees were in the courtroom and identifiable as arraignees during the period of time that Rivera himself was in the courtroom, it is apparent that they only could have been seated next to or behind Rivera and that they were not among the group of arraignees entering the courtroom through the door to which Rivera's attention had been directed. Furthermore, although the testimony conflicted as to how many arraignments Rivera and Lawlor actually observed, there simply is no evidence from which to conclude that they were present for the arraignment of any of the noncustodial arraignees who were African-American males.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   We conclude, therefore, that the trial court incorrectly treated the array as being comprised of all thirty-four arraignees. The proper starting point for the trial court's analysis of the composition of the array, rather, should have been the fourteen custodial arraignees, only nine of whom were African-American males.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The defendant claimed before the trial court that none of those fourteen custodial arraignees was an appropriate filler. In support of this contention, the defendant adduced the testimony of Jennifer Dysart, a psychology professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and a recognized expert in the field of eyewitness identification. Dysart opined that all of the arraignees were inappropriate fillers due to the marked dissimilarities between each of those arraignees and Rivera's original description of the driver's side assailant as a thin, African-American male, approximately six feet, one inch, or six feet, two inches, tall, and about twenty-six or twenty-seven years old. Dysart ruled out female and non-African-American arraignees, leaving nine custodial arraignees who were African-American males. Dysart then eliminated those remaining nine arraignees, either because they were as much as six inches shorter than the person whom Rivera described as the suspect, weighed far more than the suspect, or were significantly older than the suspect. Relying on Dysart's testimony, the defendant renews his claim that the array was manifestly inadequate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The state does not seriously challenge this aspect of Dysart's testimony or otherwise contend that the physical characteristics of a sufficient number of the custodial arraignees were sufficiently similar to those of the defendant so as to satisfy principles of due process. The state's primary contention, rather, is that the physical attributes of the custodial arraignees are relatively unimportant in view of the fact that, according to Rivera, he identified the defendant as the assailant immediately upon observing him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Although, as we noted previously, perfection in the selection of identification fillers is not required, the physical differences between the suspect and the custodial arraignees in the present case were clearly significant enough \"to emphasize or highlight the individual whom the police believe[d] [was] the suspect.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Marquez\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5764830\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/291/122/#p141\">\n    291 Conn. at 143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=967%20A.2d%2056\">\n    967 A.2d 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; see also G.

Moreover, the fact that Rivera identified the defendant immediately upon seeing him at the arraignment is essentially irrelevant for purposes of this prong of the test, which implicates only the physical characteristics of the suspect and those of the other African-American male custodial\n   arraignees. Because none of those custodial arraignees was sufficiently similar\n   to the defendant in height, weight and age, the identification procedure was impermissibly suggestive. We therefore must decide whether the trial court's denial of the defendant's motion to preclude Rivera's identification testimony as violative of federal due process principles may nevertheless be sustained on the ground that Rivera's identification of the defendant at the arraignment proceeding was reliable under the totality of the circumstances. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Manson\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Brathwaite\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6177400\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/432/98/#p113\">\n    432 U.S. at 113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6177400\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/432/98/#p113\">\n    97 S.Ct. 2243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The trial court made express findings regarding each of these so-called\n   <em>\n    Biggers\n   </em>\n   factors, which we now address in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   With respect to the first two\n   <em>\n    Biggers\n   </em>\n   factors, the trial court found that Rivera had \"ample time\"-approximately\n   ten minutes-to observe the assailant from a \"very close\" distance-no more than a few feet-in a well lit area. The trial court further found that Rivera was clearheaded and attentive during his encounter with the assailant, who had nothing covering his face or head and otherwise made no effort to disguise himself. These findings strongly support the trial court's conclusion concerning the reliability of Rivera's identification of the defendant as the perpetrator notwithstanding the state's use of a flawed identification procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The defendant, however, challenges the trial court's findings as clearly erroneous. In particular, he maintains that \"[t]he lighting conditions were poor; it was 3 a.m., and the closest streetlight was on the opposite side of the street.\" He also claims that Rivera and the other assailant were on opposite sides of the vehicle, the interior of the vehicle also was dark, and Scott pointed a gun at Rivera throughout the encounter. Having carefully reviewed the record, we disagree with the defendant that the trial court's findings concerning Rivera's opportunity to observe the defendant are unsupported by the evidence. Despite the hour and the location of the street lights, the trial court reasonably concluded that there was sufficient light in the area such that Rivera had a good view of the suspect for a considerable period of time. Indeed, the fact that King, the responding officer, chose not to use a flashlight because the scene was so well lit belies the defendant's argument that the lighting conditions were insufficient to afford Rivera an adequate opportunity to observe the defendant. Nor was Rivera's ability to view the defendant diminished by\n   the distance between the two men. As the trial court found, Rivera and the defendant were on opposite sides of the vehicle, only a few feet apart. See G. Wells &amp; D. Quinlivan, supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20Law%20%26%20Hum.%20Behav.%209\">\n    33 Law &amp; Hum.

In addition, the trial court reasonably credited testimony adduced by the state establishing that the interior dome light of the car shone on the defendant's face while he was searching inside the car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The record also fully supports the trial court's finding that Rivera was both alert and attentive during the encounter. Rivera testified that he was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of the offense, and he further explained that he consciously tried to record a memory of both assailants' appearances so that he could later retaliate against them for the robbery.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   We previously have recognized that a finding of reliability may be bolstered by the witness' conscious effort to focus on the face of his assailant.

It is expected that the weapon will draw central attention, thus decreasing the ability of the eyewitness to adequately encode and later recall peripheral details.\" [Emphasis omitted.] ). On cross-examination, however, Dysart acknowledged that the weapon focus effect may diminish the longer a witness\n   is confronted with a weapon because, in such circumstances, the witness also has a longer and therefore better opportunity to perceive details other than the weapon. As we have explained, the trial court found that Rivera observed the defendant for ten minutes. Thus, even if the trial court fully credited Dysart's testimony about the weapon focus effect, the court reasonably could have concluded that, under the circumstances, that phenomenon did not operate to appreciably impair Rivera's ability to focus his attention on the perpetrators themselves.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   With respect to the third\n   <em>\n    Biggers\n   </em>\n   consideration, the accuracy of the eyewitness' description of the offender, we agree with the state that Rivera's description of the assailant was both specific and accurate, and included the individual's race (African-American), gender (male), body type (thin), approximate height (six feet, one inch, to six feet, two inches), approximate age (twenty-six to twenty-seven), hair style (short, cropped), and facial hair style (light). This detailed description conforms with considerable accuracy to the information in the record concerning the defendant's physical appearance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The fourth relevant consideration under\n   <em>\n    Biggers,\n   </em>\n   the level of certainty that Rivera displayed with respect to his identification of the defendant, also strongly favors the state's contention that Rivera's identification\n   was reliable for purposes of the analysis required under the federal constitution. Rivera demonstrated not just high confidence in his identification, but \"100 percent\" certainty immediately after identifying the defendant and before receiving any feedback from Lawlor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, the defendant's expert, Dysart, testified that concern about a witness' potentially inflated confidence in\n   an identification may be reduced when the witness' confidence level is recorded before any confirmatory comments by officials conducting the identification procedure, as in the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Contrary to the defendant's claim, we agree with the trial court that the final\n   <em>\n    Biggers\n   </em>\n   factor, namely, the length of time between the crime and the identification, provides no persuasive reason for questioning the reliability of Rivera's identification of the defendant. Two weeks passed from the date of the offense until Rivera was given the opportunity to identify the defendant as a perpetrator at the defendant's arraignment on unrelated charges.

First, although we do not necessarily agree with the defendant that our conclusion in\n   <em>\n    Guilbert\n   </em>\n   that, as an evidentiary matter, defendants are entitled to present expert testimony that \"there is at best a weak correlation between a witness' confidence in his or her identification and the identification's accuracy\"; id., at 253,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20A.3d%20705\">\n    49 A.3d 705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; necessarily conflicts directly with the\n   <em>\n    Biggers\n   </em>\n   directive that courts consider the eyewitness' level of confidence, we believe that the\n   <em>\n    Guilbert\n   </em>\n   approach provides courts with greater flexibility and specificity. Second, we identified in\n   <em>\n    Guilbert\n   </em>\n   several factors that may affect the reliability of an eyewitness identification that were not expressly recognized by the court in\n   <em>\n    Biggers\n   </em>\n   , including the witness' focus on a weapon, the level of stress at the time of observation, the problems of cross-racial identification, postevent exposure to information about the subject of the identification, and the potential for unconscious transference.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Id., at 253-54,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20A.3d%20705\">\n    49 A.3d 705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For the same reasons that we concluded in\n   <em>\n    Guilbert\n   </em>\n   that focusing the trial court's attention on these specific factors instead of on the more general\n   <em>\n    Biggers\n   </em>\n   factors would enhance the accuracy of the evidentiary inquiry into the reliability of an eyewitness identification, we conclude that using the\n   <em>\n    Guilbert\n   </em>\n   framework would enhance the accuracy of the constitutional inquiry into the reliability of an identification\n   that has been tainted by improper state conduct. Third, the\n   <em>\n    Guilbert\n   </em>\n   approach allows the reliability analysis to evolve as the relevant science evolves.

Accordingly, we agree with the defendant that\n   <em>\n    Guilbert\n   </em>\n   supports the proposition that, under our state constitution, the\n   <em>\n    Biggers\n   </em>\n   analysis is inadequate to prevent the admission of unreliable identifications that are tainted by an unduly suggestive procedure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   With respect to the next\n   <em>\n    Geisler\n   </em>\n   factor, persuasive federal precedent,\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   the defendant contends that, although federal courts continue to be bound by the\n   <em>\n    Biggers\n   </em>\n   test, there are signs that a change may be in the offing.

As the defendant notes, several state courts have rejected the\n   <em>\n    Biggers\n   </em>\n   analysis under their respective state constitutions in favor of a more expansive standard. For example, in 2011, the Supreme Court of New Jersey concluded that, in light of recent scientific developments that \"abundantly [demonstrate] the many vagaries of memory encoding, storage, and retrieval; the malleability of memory; the contaminating effects of extrinsic information, the influence of police interview techniques and identification procedures; and the many other factors that bear on the reliability of eyewitness identifications\"; (internal quotation marks omitted)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Henderson\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4151901\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/208/208/#p288\">\n    208 N.J. at 283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4151901\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/208/208/#p288\">\n    27 A.3d 872\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; the\n   <em>\n    Biggers\n   </em>\n   test provided inadequate protection against the risk of misidentification.

Before reaching its conclusion, the New Jersey Supreme Court appointed a special master who, following extensive hearings conducted for the purpose of evaluating scientific and other evidence about eyewitness identifications, issued a comprehensive report containing numerous findings and recommendations.

On the basis of those findings and recommendations, the court in\n   <em>\n    Henderson\n   </em>\n   concluded that the New Jersey constitution required a new framework \"that allows judges to consider all relevant factors that affect reliability in deciding whether an identification is admissible; that is not heavily weighted by factors that can be corrupted by suggestiveness; that promotes deterrence in a meaningful way; and that focuses on helping jurors both [to] understand and evaluate the effects that various factors have on memory ....\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4151901\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/208/208/#p288\">\n    Id., at 288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4151901\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/208/208/#p288\">\n    27 A.3d 872\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . With these criteria in mind, the court adopted the following framework: First,\n   to obtain a pretrial hearing, the defendant has the initial burden of showing that some system variable\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   undermined the reliability of the eyewitness identification.

Specifically, the defendant claims that the trial court would have been precluded from considering the defendant's level of confidence. In addition, he contends, the trial court would have been compelled to consider the tendency of eyewitnesses to overestimate the duration and quality of their opportunity to view the perpetrator, Rivera's lack of sleep and the poor lighting at the scene of the crime, the tendency of fear and stress to impair perception and recall, the two week interval between the crime and the observation, Rivera's nonspecific description of the perpetrator's facial features, and the fact that Rivera and the defendant were of different races.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   We disagree with the defendant's claim. Dysart testified at the suppression hearing and at trial that the presence of a weapon can divert an eyewitness' attention from the perpetrator's face to the weapon, that eyewitnesses may have difficulty identifying persons of a different race, that high levels of stress adversely affect the accuracy of an identification, and that,\n   because the perpetrators in the present case were rifling through the car for much of the time, Rivera's opportunity to view them would have been relatively short. In addition, Dysart testified at trial that \"there is a moderate relationship between accuracy and [confidence]\" when the eyewitness immediately expresses high confidence after a nonsuggestive procedure, but that positive\n   feedback can artificially inflate confidence and can lead witnesses to overestimate the quality of their opportunity to observe the perpetrator. Although the specific factors that Dysart addressed are not expressly included in the\n   <em>\n    Biggers\n   </em>\n   framework, that framework does direct the court to consider \"the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime,\" \"the witness' degree of attention,\" and \"the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the confrontation ....\"\n   <em>\n    Neil\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Biggers\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173155\" index=\"259\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/409/188/#p196\">\n    409 U.S. at 199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173155\" index=\"260\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/409/188/#p196\">\n    93 S.Ct. 375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These general factors encompass the more specific reliability factors that we have identified in the present case and that were addressed by Dysart. Indeed, as the Supreme Court of Utah has observed with respect to the\n   <em>\n    Ramirez\n   </em>\n   reliability factors, which are similar to the factors that we have adopted; see\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ramirez\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12049871\" index=\"261\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/817/774/#p781\">\n    817 P.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   781 ; footnote 27 of this opinion; the factors that we have adopted \"are generally comparable to the\n   <em>\n    Biggers\n   </em>\n   factors\" and are merely intended to \"more precisely define the focus of the relevant inquiry.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ramirez\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 781 ; see also\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hunt\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"861199\" index=\"262\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/275/811/#p818\">\n    275 Kan. at 818\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"861199\" index=\"263\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/275/811/#p818\">\n    69 P.3d 571\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[the\n   <em>\n    Ramirez\n   </em>\n   standard] should not be considered as a rejection of the\n   <em>\n    Biggers\n   </em>\n   model but, rather, as a refinement in the analysis\"). Moreover, to the extent that the defendant contends that the trial court did not adequately consider the corrupting effect that the suggestiveness of the procedure had on Rivera's memory, nothing in\n   <em>\n    Biggers\n   </em>\n   or its progeny\n   <em>\n    bars\n   </em>\n   the trial court from considering evidence that the witness' memory has been affected by a suggestive procedure.

Nor is there any evidence that the trial court believed that it was\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   under\n   <em>\n    Biggers\n   </em>\n   to assume that there is a correlation between confidence and accuracy under all circumstances, despite Dysart's testimony to the contrary. Rather, the trial court's finding that such a correlation existed in the present case was supported by Dysart's testimony that there\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   a \"moderate\" correlation between confidence and accuracy when confidence is expressed immediately after the identification and before the eyewitness has received any positive feedback. Although we have concluded that the identification procedure in the present case was suggestive-which, according to Dysart, can weaken the correlation between confidence and accuracy-Dysart did not testify that, if a procedure is suggestive in any manner and to any degree, that suggestiveness automatically and fully negates the correlation. The trial court's conclusion that Rivera's confidence was indicative of accuracy is also supported by the fact that Rivera's description of the defendant was, in fact, accurate. Finally, the defendant has not identified any evidence that he was prevented from presenting at the suppression hearing or at trial on the ground that it was not relevant under\n   <em>\n    Biggers\n   </em>\n   . Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court's application of the\n   <em>\n    Biggers\n   </em>\n   framework instead of the reliability standard that we have adopted in the present case was harmless because it is not reasonably possible that the court would have reached a different conclusion as to the admissibility of Rivera's identification under our\n   new framework.

Moreover, at the probable cause hearing, Rivera testified that he sat in the courtroom \"waiting to see who is going to come out the door.\" He also testified that \"[t]hey [were] just bringing in inmates from the day before that. They [were] bringing them all in.

As we previously have explained, \"[t]his statute demonstrates a clear legislative concern that suggestive identification procedures are a significant cause of erroneous convictions and should be eliminated to the extent possible.\"\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Dickson\n    </em>\n    , supra,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12486149\" index=\"324\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/141/810/#p419\">\n     322 Conn. at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    425 n.10,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12486149\" index=\"325\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/141/810/#p419\">\n     141 A.3d 810\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Raising similar concerns, the amici curiae, the Connecticut Innocence Project and the Innocence Project, argue that, for purposes of our state constitutional framework, any material violation of the identification procedures mandated by \u00a7 54-1p should render the identification inadmissible per se. We are not persuaded by this contention. If, despite the noncompliance with \u00a7 54-1p, the identification is deemed to be reliable under the expanded framework that we have adopted in this case, we can perceive no compelling justification for precluding its use by the state. We emphasize, however, that our conclusion that the parties are entitled to present expert testimony on factors affecting the reliability of an identification encompasses testimony on the corruptive effect of system variables.
