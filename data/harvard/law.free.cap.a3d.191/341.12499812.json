In its judgment entered in the Business and Consumer Docket, the court (\n   <em>\n    Murphy, J.\n   </em>\n   ) determined that the Maine resident's proportion of business taxes paid in New Hampshire by the LLC did not qualify that resident for a tax credit against her individual Maine income taxes. We affirm that judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b6 2] James and Ann Goggin appeal from a judgment affirming the State Tax Assessor's denial of a tax credit for a share of New Hampshire business taxes paid by a New Hampshire LLC proportional to the membership interest that Ann had in the LLC. They argue that the court erred in interpreting Maine's individual income tax statutes and that, as applied, Maine's income tax statutes discriminate against interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [\u00b6 3] The facts are drawn from the parties' stipulations of fact and their joint exhibits. The joint exhibits consist, primarily, of Maine and New Hampshire tax documents. James and Ann Goggin lived in Maine at all relevant times, and they filed joint federal and State income tax returns. GHK Company, LLC, is a limited liability company formed in New Hampshire in 1994 to own, develop, maintain, and lease a parcel of commercial real estate in New Hampshire. For federal income tax purposes, the LLC was classified as a partnership for the 2012 through 2014 tax years, which are the years at issue here. In each of those three years, the LLC received rental income from its property. For each of those years, Ann was allocated a percentage interest in the profits and losses of the LLC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b6 4] The State of New Hampshire does not impose income taxes on individuals except on certain \"income received from interest and dividends\" not at issue here.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.H.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2077%3A3\">\n    N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 77:3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (I)(a) (2012). The State of New Hampshire imposed on the LLC, however, both a \"business profits tax\" and a \"business enterprise tax.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.H.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2077\">\n    N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -A:2, 77-E:2 (2012).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On its federal \"Return of Partnership Income\" forms, the LLC took deductions for the New Hampshire business\n   taxes it paid. Specifically, among other deductions, it deducted the amount of the New Hampshire business taxes from the amounts of rental real estate income that the LLC reported to the federal government. Ann Goggin's share of the rental income was determined as a percentage of those reduced amounts for purposes of the LLC's attached Schedule K-1 forms stating her \"Partner's Share of Income, Deductions, Credits, etc.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b6 5] For each of the 2012 to 2014 years, the Goggins reported in their joint federal income tax return an amount of income from the LLC that was similar to the amount stated in the corresponding year's federal LLC form reporting Ann Goggin's share of the LLC's rental income.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b6 6] When the Goggins filed their joint Maine income tax returns for the 2012 through 2014 tax years, they did not claim a credit for the New Hampshire business taxes paid by the LLC. Because the calculation of the Maine tax obligation was based on the Goggins' federal adjusted gross income, the income that they reported in their Maine tax returns also did not include any income that the LLC had received but then paid in New Hampshire business taxes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b6 7] In January 2016, the Goggins filed an amended Maine return for each of the 2012, 2013, and 2014 tax years seeking a personal income tax credit, and corresponding refund, for the portion of the New Hampshire business tax paid by the LLC that was proportional to Ann's membership interest. The amended Maine returns did not, however, add to the Goggins' Maine adjusted gross income any amount of the LLC's income that went to pay the New Hampshire LLC taxes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b6 8] Maine Revenue Services denied the refund by letter dated May 9, 2016, and the Goggins requested reconsideration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   36 M.R.S. \u00a7 151(1) (2017). In a written decision dated September 21, 2016, the State Tax Assessor upheld the denial of their claims for refunds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b6 9] The Goggins then filed, in the Superior Court, a petition for judicial review of the Assessor's final agency action and de novo determination of all facts and law. See 36 M.R.S. \u00a7 151(2)(F)(2), (G) (2017). Upon the parties' agreement and the Goggins' application, the matter was accepted for transfer to the Business and Consumer Docket. The court received briefs and heard arguments from the parties regarding their jointly stipulated facts and supporting exhibits. The court affirmed the judgment of the Assessor, reasoning that no income tax credit applied because (1) the New Hampshire business taxes were imposed on the LLC and were not an \"amount of income tax imposed on [an] individual,\" 36 M.R.S. \u00a7 5217-A (2017), and (2) Maine's tax statutes do not violate the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. The Goggins timely appealed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   5 M.R.S. \u00a7 11008 (2017) ; M.R. App. P. 2A, 2B(a)(1), (c)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A. Interpretation of Maine's Income Tax Statutes\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b6 10] When a taxpayer appeals to the Superior Court from a decision of the State Tax Assessor, the Superior Court \"conduct[s] a de novo hearing and make[s] a de novo determination of the merits of the case.\" 36 M.R.S. \u00a7 151(2)(G). \"Because the Superior Court is not acting in an appellate capacity, we review its determinations directly.\"\n   <em>\n    Linnehan Leasing v.

They argue that the court's, and the Assessor's, formalistic interpretation of the statute results in the \"double taxation\" of Maine entrepreneurs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [\u00b6 12] \"In interpreting a tax statute, we look first to its plain meaning to give effect to the Legislature's intent.\"\n   <em>\n    State Tax Assessor v.

That case is distinguishable on two bases, however.

Second, the term \"income tax\" in Maine's statute is a term of art; the statute does not use broad terminology to provide a credit for all taxes \"on income\" imposed by other states, including taxes on other states' business entities' income, but instead provides a credit only for\n   <em>\n    income taxes\n   </em>\n   paid by individuals on income derived from other states.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    MacFarlane v.

If the tax credit were also applied as the Goggins suggest, it would result in a small windfall to them: they would enjoy both the deduction from their adjusted gross income of a proportionate amount of New Hampshire business taxes paid by the LLC\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   a credit for a proportionate share of the taxes that the LLC paid to New Hampshire. Given our obligation to construe tax credits narrowly, we cannot interpret the income tax credit provision to provide such a windfall to those who pay the New Hampshire business taxes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    MCI Commc'ns Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12322994\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/164/952/\">\n    2017 ME 119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12322994\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/164/952/\">\n    164 A.3d 952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   B.

Although New Hampshire's taxation scheme may create a disincentive to form such entities in New Hampshire, it is not the application of\n   <em>\n    Maine's\n   </em>\n   tax laws that creates that result.
