We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On the basis of the evidence before it, the jury reasonably could have found the following facts beyond a reasonable doubt. On July 28, 2014, Keith Johnson was living near the intersection of Indian Place and Indian Avenue in Bridgeport. Tonahja Cohen and Johnson are cousins. At approximately 5:30 p.m. on that date, the defendant called Cohen and asked him to come to the\n   place where Johnson was living.\n   Cohen drove to the location in his Chevrolet Monte Carlo automobile and parked behind the defendant's Chevrolet Malibu automobile. He met the defendant, who was angry, but Cohen did not know why. The defendant had a handgun, which Cohen took from him and put in the trunk of the Monte Carlo. Cohen wanted to ensure that nothing happened. He then went into the house and asked Johnson to come outside. When Johnson came out, he too had a gun, which was put in the trunk of the Monte Carlo. The defendant, Johnson, and Cohen got into the Malibu, which the defendant drove around while they tried to work things out. According to Cohen, Johnson and the defendant were arguing about \"some bullshit.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At about that time, Officer Brian Pisanelli of the Bridgeport Police Department received a radio communication from Officer Bruno Rodrigues that prompted Pisanelli to drive to Indian Avenue. Detective Martinez was in a car directly behind Pisanelli. As Pisanelli drove north on Indian Avenue, approaching its intersection with Indian Place, he saw a Malibu with three occupants and an unoccupied Monte Carlo parked on the right side of the street. He drove along the left side of the Malibu. The defendant attempted to drive off at a high rate of speed but Pisanelli was able to pull in front of the Malibu and block it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Pisanelli approached the Malibu and asked the defendant for his operator's license, registration, and insurance card, which the defendant was unable to produce. Pisanelli issued a motor vehicle summons to the defendant, who gave his address as 190 Denver Avenue in Bridgeport. Pisanelli arrested the defendant, placed him in the rear seat of his patrol car and drove him to the police department on Congress Street. During the drive, Pisanelli did not question the defendant but the defendant spontaneously stated, \"I brought that gun over to settle the score with [Johnson].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Other Bridgeport police officers arrived on the scene: Rodrigues, Officer Ilidio Pereira, Detective Borrico and Detective John Tenn. Those officers interacted with Cohen and Johnson. Rodrigues asked Cohen if he could search the Monte Carlo. Cohen agreed, gave Rodrigues the keys, and stated that whatever is in there was not his. Rodrigues used the keys to open the trunk of the Monte Carlo, where he saw two handguns. Cohen was placed under arrest and later was charged with possession of firearms in a motor vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In May, 2016, the defendant was charged in a substitute information with criminal possession of a firearm by a person previously convicted of a felony in violation of \u00a7 53a-217(a)(1),\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   possession of a weapon in a motor vehicle in violation of \u00a7 29-38(a),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and carrying a pistol or revolver without a permit in violation of \u00a7 29-35(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   At trial, he stipulated that he was a convicted felon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Cohen testified at trial that he was charged with two counts of possession of weapons in a motor vehicle and that he pleaded guilty to those charges and could be sentenced to ten years incarceration, execution suspended after five years in prison, with the right to argue for less. He, however, expected that the sentencing judge would be informed of his testimony in the present\n   matter and that he would receive a sentence of probation only. Cohen also testified that he was convicted of two felonies in 2013, was sentenced to probation, and that he had violated his probation. Given his two prior felony convictions, Cohen knew that being charged in the present matter was a federal crime. In addition, Cohen had new charges pending against him in New Haven.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Marshal Robinson, a firearms examiner, testified that the Ruger handgun and the Smith &amp; Wesson semi-automatic weapon retrieved from the trunk of the Monte Carlo were operable. Vincent Imbimbo, an employee of the state police firearms unit, testified that he was unable to locate a pistol permit issued to the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At the conclusion of the state's case-in-chief, counsel for the defendant orally moved that the charges against the defendant be dismissed on the ground that the state's key witness, Cohen, lacked credibility given his criminal record and the consideration he expected at his pending sentence. Cohen was the only person who testified that he saw the defendant with a gun. The court noted that Pisanelli testified that the defendant made an unsolicited statement that he had brought a gun with him. The court stated that the question of credibility was for the jury to determine and found, therefore, that there was sufficient evidence from which the jury reasonably could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The court, therefore, denied the defendant's motion to dismiss the charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The jury found the defendant guilty of all charges. On September 9, 2016, the court sentenced the defendant to ten years incarceration, two of which are mandatory, to be served concurrently with an unrelated conviction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The defendant claims on appeal that there was insufficient evidence to establish his conviction of criminal possession of a firearm in violation of \u00a7 53a-217(a)(1),\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   possession of a weapon in a motor vehicle in violation of \u00a7 29-38(a)\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   and carrying a pistol without a permit in violation of \u00a7 29-35(a)\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   because there is\n   insufficient evidence that he possessed a handgun in his motor vehicle for which he did not have a permit. The defendant's claim basically challenges the jury's credibility determinations and, therefore, fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"In reviewing a sufficiency of the evidence claim, we apply a two-part test.

Second, we determine whether [on the basis of] the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the jury reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt ....

The defendant argues that Cohen was not a credible witness because he is a convicted felon, who testified that one of the handguns belonged to the defendant in order to avoid being sentenced to prison and to protect Johnson, his cousin. In asserting this claim, the defendant has ignored Pisanelli's testimony that the defendant spontaneously admitted to him that he \"brought the gun over to settle the score with\" Johnson. The defendant, however, claims that the testimony \"just does not make sense\" given the defendant's experience in the criminal justice system and the circumstances surrounding his arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The defendant claims as well that the testimony of other state witnesses was unpersuasive, particularly the testimony regarding the defendant's place of residence and whether he had a permit for a handgun. The defendant's claim, therefore, is predicated on a credibility determination made by the jury. The record discloses that during its deliberations, the jury focused on the testimony of both Cohen and Pisanelli and asked to rehear their respective testimonies. The testimony of both witnesses reasonably supported the jury's determination that the defendant brought a handgun near the intersection of Indian Avenue and Indian Place on July 28, 2014. Cohen testified that the defendant arrived at the scene with a gun, and the jury reasonably could have inferred from Pisanelli's testimony that the defendant drove\n   to the scene with a handgun in his Malibu. \"Insofar as this is a pure credibility determination, it is unassailable.\"\n   <em>\n    Breton\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489584\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/159/1112/#p694\">\n    325 Conn. 640\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 694,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489584\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/159/1112/#p694\">\n    159 A.3d 1112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"Credibility must be assessed ... not by reading the cold printed record, but by observing firsthand the witness' conduct, demeanor and attitude .... An appellate court must defer to the trier of fact's assessment of credibility because [i]t is the [fact finder] ... [who has] an opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witnesses and the parties; thus [the fact finder] is best able to judge the credibility of the witnesses and to draw necessary inferences therefrom ....
