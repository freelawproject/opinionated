The Superior Court granted ... a judgment of strict foreclosure ... on February 6, 2014.... [The] defendant's law day was extended multiple times-most recently on May 9, 2016, when the Superior Court denied [the] defendant's April 29, 2016 motion to open the judgment and extended his law day, sua sponte, to June 28, 2016.... On June 24, 2016, [the] defendant filed another motion to open [the] judgment (his third in this case) in the Superior Court .... On June 27, 2016-[forty-nine] days after the judgment [was rendered]-he filed an appeal [from the court's May 9,\n   2016 denial of his second motion to open], which was assigned [docket number] AC 39352 in [the Appellate] Court .... On July 5, 2016, [the] plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss the appeal, arguing that it was untimely, that the late appeal did not create an appellate stay, and that, because [the] defendant's June 28 law day had passed without [the] defendant exercising the equity of redemption, title had already vested absolutely in [the] plaintiff, rendering the case moot .... On July 8, 2016, [the] defendant filed a motion for permission to file a late appeal .... On July 13, 2016, [the] defendant filed an objection to the motion to dismiss .... On July 18, 2016, [the] plaintiff filed a response in opposition to [the] defendant's motion to file a late appeal .... On September 14, 2016, this court granted [the] plaintiff's motion to dismiss ....

[The] defendant initially claimed that this court had remanded the case to set a new law day, but the Superior Court pointed out that no remand language appeared in the order dismissing the appeal .... The Superior Court also expressed concern that, by demanding that [the] plaintiff seek a new law day, [the] defendant was creating a new 'perpetual motion machine' like the one described in\n   <em>\n    First Connecticut Capital, LLC\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Homes of Westport, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4061302\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/112/750/\">\n    112 Conn.

At the hearing, [the] defendant once again conceded that the appeal was untimely, but argued that the appellate stay provided by Practice Book \u00a7 61-11 applied ....

The parties, with the approval of the Superior Court, requested that we undertake to answer two reserved questions. We conclude that we have jurisdiction to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"As did the common law, \u00a7 49-22 permits a court, in its discretion and if the mortgagee is so entitled, to issue an execution of a judgment of ejectment in favor of the mortgagee after a successful action to foreclose the mortgage, as long as the person in possession is a party to the mortgage action .... Because \u00a7 49-22 requires the trial court to determine whether the mortgagee is entitled both to foreclosure and to possession before issuing an execution of a judgment of ejectment, it expressly contemplates that there may exist circumstances in which a mortgagee is entitled to foreclosure, but is not entitled to possession. Indeed, courts have recognized that, 'in equity, title and possession\n   of premises may not automatically be linked.' \" (Emphasis omitted; footnote omitted.)\n   <em>\n    First Federal Bank, FSB\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Whitney Development Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1200391\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/237/679/#p690\">\n    237 Conn. 679\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 690-91,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=677%20A.2d%201363\">\n    677 A.2d 1363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1996) (reversing judgment granting execution of judgment of ejectment rendered against party tenant in possession of mortgaged property following judgment of strict foreclosure). Furthermore, this court previously has held that a mortgagor can challenge on appeal an execution of ejectment that he claims was issued in violation of the appellate stay. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Wells Fargo Bank of Minnesota, N.A.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Morgan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3565266\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/98/72/#p84\">\n    98 Conn.

Similarly, a foreclosure plaintiff would have the right to appeal from a decision of the trial court denying its application for the issuance of an execution of ejectment. Accordingly, we conclude that this is a case in which an appeal could have been filed had judgment been rendered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Notwithstanding our jurisdiction to decide these reserved questions, in accordance with the standards articulated in Practice Book \u00a7 73-1, we also must determine whether we\n   <em>\n    should\n   </em>\n   entertain the questions.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Wang\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=312%20Conn.%20222\">\n    312 Conn. at 229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=92%20A.3d%20220\">\n    92 A.3d 220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \" Section 73-1 (f) provides that '[t]he court will not entertain a reservation for its advice upon questions of law arising in any action unless the question or questions presented are such as are, in the opinion of the court, reasonably certain to enter into the decision of the case, and it appears that their present determination would be in the interest of simplicity, directness and economy of judicial action.' \" Id.\"Neither our Supreme Court nor this court is bound to entertain a reservation, and whether it will do so rests in its discretion ....

Accordingly, we will proceed to answer them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Our analysis of the parties' reserved questions requires us to construe Practice Book \u00a7 61-11,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   particularly\n   subsection (a). \"The interpretive construction of\n   the rules of practice is to be governed by the same principles as those regulating statutory interpretation ....

When [the provision] is not plain and unambiguous, we also look for interpretive guidance to the ... history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the ... policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing [provisions] and common law principles\n   governing the same general subject matter .... We recognize that terms [used] are to be assigned their ordinary meaning, unless context dictates otherwise .... Put differently, we follow the clear meaning of unambiguous rules, because [a]lthough we are directed to interpret liberally the rules of practice, that liberal construction applies only to situations in which a strict adherence to them [will] work surprise or injustice.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Meadowbrook Center, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Buchman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12494685\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/181/550/#p594\">\n    328 Conn. 586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 594-95,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12494685\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/181/550/#p594\">\n    181 A.3d 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The plaintiff argues that Practice Book \u00a7 61-11 is plain and unambiguous. As to subsection (a), the plaintiff argues that the second sentence of that subsection complements the first sentence, requiring, under our well established principles of statutory construction, that both sentences be read together to secure the proper meaning and intent of the rule. According to the plaintiff, when read together, the first two sentences of \u00a7 61-11 (a)\"stay the enforcement of a final judgment ... to permit\n   aggrieved parties the opportunity to appeal up until the time for exercising that right expires, and then\n   <em>\n    extend\n   </em>\n   ... such a stay until the final determination of the cause\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   an appeal is [\n   <em>\n    timely\n   </em>\n   ] filed .... [N]othing in the text creates a new stay [after] the former stay terminates and the appellant ... [decides to file a late appeal] after the deadline.\" (Emphasis altered.) The plaintiff further argues that, under \u00a7 61-11 (a), \"any automatic stay of execution ends when the appeal period expires .... [N]o new automatic stay arises for a late filed appeal.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The defendant also argues that Practice Book \u00a7 61-11 is plain and unambiguous. His reading of the rule, however, differs from that of the plaintiff. The defendant contends, contrary to the plaintiff, that the second sentence of subsection (a) should be read independently from the first sentence, and that it means exactly\n   what it says: \"If an appeal is filed, such proceedings shall be stayed until the final determination of the cause.\" The defendant argues that there is nothing in that sentence that says the appeal must be timely filed in order for a stay to be initiated. The defendant further contends that other parts of \u00a7 61-11, particularly subsections (b) and (c), \"explicitly list the types of matters for which no automatic stay is permitted under ... [\u00a7] 61-11 (a).\" He argues: \"An appeal filed outside the [twenty] day appeal period is not included on this list of matters where no automatic appellate stay is available.\" He contends, therefore, that the fact that the rule does not mention a late appeal, supports his position that, as \u00a7 61-11 (a) clearly states: \"If an appeal is filed, such proceedings shall be stayed until the final determination of the cause.\" The defendant, citing to\n   <em>\n    Stratford\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    LeBlanc\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12490409\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/167/1015/\">\n    175 Conn.

He argues that, in these foreclosure cases, despite acknowledging that the appeals were late, we remanded\n   <em>\n    White Water Mountain Resorts of Connecticut, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , to the trial court with direction to reset the law days, and we remanded\n   <em>\n    LeBlanc\n   </em>\n   to the trial court with direction to set a new sale date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Although the parties' agree that Practice Book \u00a7 61-11 is plain and unambiguous, they each advance a different interpretation of that rule. On the basis of our own consideration of the language of \u00a7 61-11 and its relationship to other rules, particularly Practice Book \u00a7 61-12\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   ;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   see General Statutes \u00a7 1-2z (\"[t]he meaning of a statute shall, in the first instance, be ascertained from the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes\"); although we agree that Practice Book \u00a7 61-11 is plain and unambiguous, we conclude that the plaintiff's interpretation of the rule is accurate. See\n   <em>\n    Honulik\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Greenwich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4147843\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/293/698/#p710\">\n    293 Conn. 698\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 710-11,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=980%20A.2d%20880\">\n    980 A.2d 880\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009) (\"[t]he mere fact that the parties advance different interpretations of the language in question does not necessitate a conclusion that the language is ambiguous\" [internal quotation marks omitted] ). Specifically, we conclude that, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 61-11, unless otherwise provided by statute or other law, the filing of a late appeal does not revive the automatic stay of execution in a noncriminal case. Accordingly, we also conclude that the defendant's late appeal from the denial of his second motion to open the judgment of strict foreclosure did not revive the automatic stay to toll the running of the law day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We address the first reserved question, \"[except where otherwise provided by statute or other law,] [d]oes the filing of an appeal 'after the time to file an appeal has expired' ... automatically stay the trial court proceedings in a noncriminal case pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 61-11 until the final determination of the cause,\" and we answer that question in the negative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In construing the meaning of Practice Book \u00a7 61-11, in accordance with \u00a7 1-2z, we first turn to the language of the rule. Subsection (a) provides in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"Except where otherwise provided by statute or other law, proceedings to enforce or carry out the judgment or order shall be automatically stayed until the time to file an appeal has expired. If an appeal is filed, such proceedings shall be stayed until the final determination of the cause ....\" Subsection (b) provides in relevant part: \"Under this section, there shall be no automatic stay in actions concerning attorneys ... juvenile matters ... or in any administrative appeal except as otherwise provided in this subsection.\" Subsection (c) provides in relevant part: \"Unless otherwise ordered, no automatic stay shall apply to orders of relief from physical abuse ... to orders for exclusive possession of a residence ... to orders of periodic alimony, support, custody or visitation in family matters brought ... or to any decision of the superior court in an appeal of a final determination of a support order by a family support magistrate ....\" Subsection (d) provides in relevant part: \"In all cases not governed by subsection (c), termination of a stay may be sought in accordance with subsection (e) of this rule ....\" Subsection (e) provides in relevant part: \"A motion to terminate a stay of execution filed before judgment is entered shall be filed with the trial court .... If such a motion is filed after judgment but before an appeal is filed, the motion shall be filed with the clerk of the trial court .... After an appeal is filed, such a motion shall be filed with the appellate clerk and shall be forwarded by the appellate clerk to the trial judge for a decision ....\" Finally, subsection (f) provides in relevant part: \"Requests for a stay pending appeal where there is no automatic stay shall be governed by Section 61-12....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The text of Practice Book \u00a7 61-11 (a) dictates that, unless otherwise provided by statute or other law, in noncriminal cases, an automatic stay is in place \"\n   <em>\n    until the time to file an appeal has expired\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis\n   added.) Clearly then, the automatic stay expires when the applicable appeal period expires. The second sentence of the rule then provides that \"[i]f an appeal is filed, such proceedings shall be stayed until the final determination of the cause.\" We acknowledge that subsection (a) certainly could be more explicit in its second sentence by setting forth the requirement that an appeal be\n   <em>\n    timely\n   </em>\n   for the automatic stay to remain in place. Nevertheless, examining \u00a7 61-11 as a whole, as we must, it is clear to us that, unless otherwise established by statute or other\n   law, only a timely appeal stays the proceedings \"until the final determination of the cause.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As this court recently explained: \"It is axiomatic that, with limited exceptions, an appellate stay of execution arises from the time a judgment is rendered until the time to file an appeal has expired. Practice Book \u00a7 61-11 (a). If an appeal is filed, any appellate stay of execution in place during the pendency of the appeal period continues until there is a final disposition of the appeal or the stay is terminated. Practice Book \u00a7 61-11 (a) and (e). If no appeal is filed,\n   <em>\n    the stay automatically terminates with the expiration of the appeal period\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.)\n   <em>\n    Sovereign Bank\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Licata\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12491327\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/172/1263/#p99\">\n    178 Conn.

An appeal filed outside the [twenty] day appeal period is not included on this list of matters where no automatic appellate stay is available. Practice Book [\u00a7] 61-11 (d) and (e) provide the mechanism for terminating the automatic stay that is otherwise available under Practice Book \u00a7 61-11 (a), and [\u00a7] 61-11 (f) provides the mechanism for obtaining a stay of proceedings when the matter is one in which no automatic stay is provided under [\u00a7] 61-11 (b) and (c).\" We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   First, subsections (b) and (c) of Practice Book \u00a7 61-11 list only the types of matters as to which there is no automatic stay. They do not address the timing requirement set forth in \u00a7 61-11 (a). If anything, the language of \u00a7 61-11 (b) supports our interpretation of \u00a7 61-11 (a). Section 61-11 (b) provides that \"any stay that was in effect during the pendency of any administrative appeal in the trial court shall continue until the filing of an appeal or the expiration of the appeal period, or any new appeal period, as provided in Section 63-1.\" Thus, like in \u00a7 61-11 (a), once the appeal period expires, so does the existing stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Practice Book \u00a7 61-11 (f), which is entitled \"Motions to request stay,\" provides in relevant part: \"Requests for a stay pending appeal where there is no automatic stay shall be governed by Section 61-12.\" Nowhere in\n   subsection (f) does it provide that a request for a stay can be made only in matters where there is no automatic stay as provided under \u00a7 61-11 (b) and (c). Rather, subsection (f) directs a party to request a stay \"where there is no automatic\n   stay\" by using the procedure set forth in \u00a7 61-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Practice Book \u00a7 61-12 provides in relevant part: \"In noncriminal matters in which the automatic stay provisions of Section 61-11 are not applicable ... any motion for a stay of the judgment ... shall be filed in the trial court .... Such a motion may also be filed before judgment and may be ruled upon at the time judgment is rendered .... The motion shall be considered on an expedited basis ....\" Clearly, taken together, these rules also provide a means to request a stay of execution in a noncriminal case when the automatic stay has expired, i.e. there is no automatic stay, and a late appeal is filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The defendant also argues that Practice Book \u00a7 61-11 (g) and (h)\"make no mention of the automatic stay being unavailable for late filed appeals.\" Although we agree with the defendant's statement, we disagree that it supports his argument that, pursuant to subsection (a), an automatic stay is created, or recreated, when a late appeal is filed. Section 61-11 (g) addresses only the issue of how many times a foreclosure defendant is entitled to an automatic stay while appealing denials of motions to open. It in no way modifies the timing requirement of \u00a7 61-11 (a). Similarly, \u00a7 61-11 (h) addresses only a last minute motion to open filed by a foreclosure defendant to disrupt a scheduled foreclosure sale. It does not expand a foreclosure defendant's rights to an automatic stay. To the contrary, it \"stays\" only the filing of a motion to approve the sale \"until the expiration of the appeal period following the denial of the motion [to open] without an appeal having been filed.\" Practice Book \u00a7 61-11 (h). Consistent with our\n   interpretation of \u00a7 61-11 (a), this language provides the defendant with relief only if he files a timely appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Additionally, the defendant argues that the plaintiff's interpretation of Practice Book \u00a7 61-11\"would yield an absurd and unworkable result\" because it would permit an execution on a judgment for millions of dollars and the seizure of bank accounts despite the filing of an appeal, albeit, a late appeal. He also argues that it would permit title to pass in a foreclosure case, even after an appeal, again, albeit, a late appeal, has been filed. The final example given by the defendant in support of his argument that the plaintiff's interpretation \"would yield an absurd and unworkable result\" is that, if Connecticut still had a death penalty, we could be in a situation where the plaintiff's reading of \u00a7 61-11\"conceivably [could result] in the state ending the life of someone whose death penalty conviction is validly before this court on appeal .... Without a stay in place for a late filed appeal, appellees could execute on judgments issued by the trial court at [its] leisure, while those very same judgments remained in doubt on appeal.\" Clearly, the defendant is misguided in this final argument; \u00a7 61-11 applies only in noncriminal matters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   As to the first two arguments, we also are not persuaded. Although the defendant is concerned that a defendant in a civil action could be harmed if a late appeal did not reinstate the automatic Practice Book \u00a7 61-11 stay, we conclude that there is nothing absurd or unworkable about a system that allows a plaintiff to enforce a judgment rendered in its favor when the defendant has not properly exercised his right to challenge that judgment. Indeed, it seems more absurd to construe the rule to allow a party who has sat on his rights to use an untimely appeal to reinstate the expired automatic stay and thereby thwart a plaintiff's legally proper efforts to collect or to proceed with a foreclosure once a judgment has been rendered and the defendant\n   has failed to file a timely appeal.\n   Furthermore, the defendant who files a late appeal still has remedies available to him to stop the execution of the judgment. The defendant can request a discretionary stay under Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 61-11 (f) and 61-12 in such instances, or file a motion to open the judgment before the running of the law days in a strict foreclosure, in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 49-15 and Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 61-11 and 63-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Finally, the defendant points us to two foreclosure cases from this court where, after considering the defendants' late filed appeals, we remanded the cases to the trial court to either reset the law day or reset the sale date.

We do not find either decision helpful to our analysis.

Although we do recognize that this court remanded those cases to the trial court for a resetting of the law days or the resetting of the sale date, respectively, the issue of whether the Practice Book \u00a7 61-11 automatic stay had expired was not raised on appeal, and, therefore, this court did not consider it. Accordingly, we do not find these cases helpful to our analysis. In fact, both our Supreme Court and this court consistently have described the right to an automatic stay as arising out of a timely filed appeal.

(Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The defendant in this case has not identified any statute or law other than Practice Book \u00a7 61-11 (a) as the basis for his argument that his late filed appeal resulted in an automatic stay. Consequently, under the facts stipulated to by the parties, it is clear that the defendant's late filed appeal did not trigger an automatic stay. The defendant filed his second motion to open the judgment of strict foreclosure, which the trial court denied on May 9, 2016. Pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 61-11 and 63-1, that judgment was stayed for twenty days. On June 27, 2016, clearly well beyond the twenty day appeal period, the defendant filed an appeal from that denial, which, upon motion by the plaintiff, this court then dismissed, without a written opinion. The law day in this case had been set for June 28, 2016. Although there had been an automatic stay from the court's May 9, 2016 denial of the defendant's second motion to open, that automatic stay expired twenty days later when the defendant failed to file a timely appeal. No request for a discretionary stay was made by the defendant. Accordingly, the running of the law day was not tolled. In summation, although \"[t]he denial of a motion to open a judgment of strict foreclosure is an appealable final judgment itself and distinctly appealable from the underlying judgment\";\n   <em>\n    Connecticut National Mortgage Co.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Knudsen\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12488110\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/150/675/#p689\">\n    323 Conn. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   687 n.8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12488110\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/150/675/#p689\">\n    150 A.3d 675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; if the appeal from that judgment is not timely filed and no request for a discretionary stay is made and granted, the law day will not be tolled and the appeal will become moot if the law day passes before the appeal is decided.
