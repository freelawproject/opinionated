The named plaintiff, Anthony Smith,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   commenced this action, pursuant to \u00a7 52-556, against the defendant Department of Transportation,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   seeking damages stemming from an accident that occurred when a bus owned and operated by the state collided with a vehicle that the plaintiff was driving. After the plaintiff claimed the action to the jury trial list, the defendant filed a motion to strike the case from that list on the ground that a jury trial is not authorized by \u00a7 52-556. The trial court granted the defendant's motion, and a trial to the court ensued, following which the court rendered judgment for the plaintiff, awarding him damages. The plaintiff appeals\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   from that judgment, claiming that the trial court incorrectly determined that \u00a7 52-556 does not afford him the right to a jury trial. Relying on the established principle that a common-law negligence action carries with it the right to a jury trial, the plaintiff maintains that, even though \u00a7 52-556 does not expressly provide for a jury trial, that provision\n   constitutes a waiver of sovereign immunity that permits such an action against the state, thereby entitling him to a trial by jury. The defendant contends that \u00a7 52-556 does not give rise to a common-law negligence claim but, rather, creates a new cause of action, unknown at common law, such that the plaintiff has no right to a jury trial. We agree with the defendant, and, accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The record reveals the following undisputed facts and procedural history. On October 23, 2012, the plaintiff was driving to work when his vehicle was struck by a bus owned by the state and operated by a state employee, who was driving the bus within the scope of his employment. The accident occurred when the operator drove the bus through a red light at the intersection of West Main Street and South High Street in the city of New Britain and collided with the plaintiff's vehicle as the plaintiff, who had a green light, was lawfully negotiating a left turn at that intersection. The plaintiff's vehicle was damaged, and the plaintiff sustained injuries to his neck, back and legs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The plaintiff sought damages stemming from the bus operator's alleged negligence, and, subsequently, the plaintiff claimed the case for a jury trial. The defendant moved\n   to strike the case from the jury docket on the ground that no jury trial was authorized under \u00a7 52-556. Thereafter, the trial court,\n   <em>\n    Abrams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    J.\n   </em>\n   , granted the defendant's motion and ordered the case transferred from the jury list to the court trial list. The plaintiff filed a motion for reconsideration of the trial court's decision, which the court denied. Thereafter, the court issued a memorandum of decision explaining why the plaintiff was not entitled to a jury trial. The plaintiff then filed a notice of intention to appeal that from that decision. Following a court trial, the trial court,\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    J.\n   </em>\n   , rendered judgment for the plaintiff and awarded\n   damages in the amount of $31,953.12. This appeal followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly struck the case from the jury docket because \u00a7 52-556 authorizes a trial by jury. The plaintiff argues that the statute is a waiver of sovereign immunity that permits an action long recognized at common law-one sounding in ordinary negligence-to be brought against the state. In support of this contention, the plaintiff maintains that the legislature, by including the word \"negligence\" in the statute, intended to incorporate the substantive legal principles that govern such common-law actions, including the right to a jury trial, which, this court has determined, is guaranteed under article first, \u00a7 19, of the Connecticut constitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response, the defendant contends that the right to a jury trial cannot be implied in a statute waiving sovereign immunity but, rather, must be affirmatively expressed in the statutory language. We agree with the defendant that, because \u00a7 52-556 does not expressly provide for a right to a jury trial, the trial court properly struck the plaintiff's case from the jury docket.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As a preliminary matter, we set forth the legal principles that govern our resolution of the plaintiff's claim. Whether there is a right to a jury trial under \u00a7 52-556\n   presents an issue of statutory interpretation, over which we exercise plenary review.

Thus, \"in determining whether a party has a right to a trial by jury under the state constitution ... the court must ascertain whether the action being tried is similar in nature to an action that could have been tried to a jury in 1818 when the state constitution was adopted. This test requires an inquiry [into] whether the [cause] of action has roots in the common law, and, if so, whether the remedy involved was one in law or equity.

The only language in \u00a7 52-556 that even arguably may be read to reflect an intent by the legislature to provide for a jury trial is the term \"negligence,\" but, at the very most, such a legislative intent may only be\n   <em>\n    implied\n   </em>\n   by the use of that term. As we have explained, we will construe a statute waiving sovereign immunity as providing for a right to a jury trial only if that right is granted expressly; language that may be construed as containing an implied grant of that right will not suffice. See\n   <em>\n    Skinner\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Angliker\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"540910\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/211/370/#p373\">\n    211 Conn. at 381\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=559%20A.2d%20701\">\n    559 A.2d 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Indeed, the language of \u00a7 52-556 stands in marked contrast to at least one other statute that waives sovereign immunity-the state's highway defect statute, General Statutes \u00a7 13a-144 -in which the legislature expressly provided for the right to a jury trial. If the legislature intended for \u00a7 52-556 to include the right to a jury trial, the legislature could have, and likely would have, included such a provision in the statute. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Heredia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=310%20Conn.%20742\">\n    310 Conn. 742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 761,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20A.3d%201163\">\n    81 A.3d 1163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013) (\"[w]hen a statute, with reference to one subject contains a given provision, the omission of such provision from a similar statute concerning a related subject ... is significant to show that a different intention existed\" [internal quotation marks omitted] ); see also\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bush\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489398\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/157/586/#p290\">\n    325 Conn. 272\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 290,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489398\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/157/586/#p290\">\n    157 A.3d 586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017) (\"[w]e are not permitted to supply statutory language that the legislature may have chosen to omit\" [internal quotation\n   marks omitted] ). Moreover, the plaintiff cites to no legislative history, and we have found none, that supports his contention. Accordingly, and mindful of the general principle that we are to strictly construe waivers of\n   sovereign immunity so as to make the least, rather than the greatest, change in that immunity; see, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Housatonic Railroad Co\n   </em>\n   . v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Revenue Services\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6775397\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/301/268/#p288\">\n    301 Conn. at 289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20A.3d%20759\">\n    21 A.3d 759\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; we agree with the defendant that there is no right to a jury trial for actions brought under \u00a7 52-556.

In reliance on this language, the plaintiff asserts that the legislature, in enacting \u00a7 52-556, intended that the substantive rules governing negligence actions generally would apply to actions brought under \u00a7 52-556, including, in particular, the right to a jury trial guaranteed by article first, \u00a7 19, of the Connecticut constitution. We are not persuaded by this argument. As we have explained, prior to 1818, there was no right to a jury trial for a negligence action against the state because the doctrine of sovereign immunity barred such an action, and, consequently, \"there is no constitutional right of jury trial in civil actions based on statutes effectively waiving such immunity in particular situations.\"\n   <em>\n    Canning\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lensink\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"525754\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/221/346/\">\n    221 Conn. at 353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=603%20A.2d%201155\">\n    603 A.2d 1155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Moreover, the legislature's use of the word \"negligence\" in \u00a7 52-556 merely addresses the circumstance\n   under which the legislature has waived sovereign immunity but does not purport to confer the right to a jury trial. In other words, in enacting \u00a7 52-556, the legislature simply sought to waive the immunity otherwise available to the state for the negligence of certain of its employees, nothing more and nothing less. Our conclusion in this regard finds support in a case recently decided by the Appellate Court.

In\n   <em>\n    Perez\n   </em>\n   , the Appellate Court was required to determine whether General Statutes \u00a7 4-159 (c),\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   which authorizes the legislature to permit certain claims to be brought against the state, entitled Christian Perez, the plaintiff in that negligence action, to a jury trial because that provision contains language indicating generally that the state should be held liable as if it \"were ... a private person ....\" General Statutes \u00a7 4-159 (c) ; see\n   <em>\n    Perez\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    University of Connecticut\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 288,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12498829\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/189/664/\">\n    189 A.3d 664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In rejecting the contention that Perez had a right to a jury trial, Judge Prescott explained that \u00a7 4-159 (c)\"merely addresses the standard under which the General Assembly will decide whether to waive sovereign immunity\";\n   <em>\n    Perez\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    University of Connecticut\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 288,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12498829\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/189/664/\">\n    189 A.3d 664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; and was not intended to serve \"as a grant to [Perez] of all the rights he would have had if the action [had been] brought against a private person rather than the state,\" including the right to a trial by jury.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12498829\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/189/664/\">\n    Id., at 289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12498829\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/189/664/\">\n    189 A.3d 664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We reach the same conclusion in the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Finally, the plaintiff asserts that \"[n]umerous cases have been brought against\n   state employees or officials for negligent operation of a motor vehicle since the earliest enactment of ... \u00a7 52-556\" and that \"[m]any\n   of these cases have permitted a jury trial.\" Contrary to the suggestion of the plaintiff, however, the mere fact that some cases brought under \u00a7 52-556 have been tried to a jury does not mean that a jury trial is authorized thereunder. In those cases, both the court and the parties may have\n   <em>\n    assumed\n   </em>\n   that \u00a7 52-556 grants that right, but any such assumption is irrelevant for purposes of our analysis. More important, the plaintiff cites no instances in which a case brought pursuant to \u00a7 52-556 proceeded to a jury trial\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   a motion to strike the claim from the jury trial list had been filed. We therefore find no merit in the plaintiff's claim that \u00a7 52-556 entitles him to a jury trial simply because other cases brought pursuant to that provision have been tried-without objection-to a jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that there is no right to a jury trial for an action brought under \u00a7 52-556. Accordingly, the trial court properly struck the present action from the jury trial list so that the case would be tried to the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In this opinion the other justices concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    General Statutes \u00a7 52-556 provides: \"Any person injured in person or property through the negligence of any state official or employee when operating a motor vehicle owned and insured by the state against personal injuries or property damage shall have a right of action against the state to recover damages for such injury.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    The named plaintiff's wife, Marilyn Smith, also was a party to this action. Her loss of consortium claim against the named defendant, William J. Rudolph, was withdrawn and her remaining loss of consortium claim against the defendant Department of Transportation was dismissed. In the interest of simplicity, we refer to Anthony Smith as the plaintiff throughout this opinion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    Because all of the claims asserted against the named defendant, William J. Rudolph, previously were withdrawn, the Department of Transportation is the sole remaining defendant in this action. In the interest of simplicity, we refer to the Department of Transportation as the defendant throughout this opinion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    The plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court from the judgment of the trial court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    After this appeal was filed, we granted the application of the Connecticut Trial Lawyers Association to file an amicus curiae brief in support of the plaintiff's claim.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    Article first, \u00a7 19, of the Connecticut constitution provides: \"The right of trial by jury shall remain inviolate.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    The plaintiff also claims that the activity in which the bus operator was engaged when the accident occurred, namely, driving a bus, implicates a ministerial duty for which there is no sovereign immunity. The plaintiff cannot prevail on this claim for two reasons. First, there is nothing in the trial court record or in the record before us to rebut the defendant's contention that this claim was not advanced in the trial court, and, therefore, it is not properly preserved. Second, in contrast to principles governing governmental or municipal liability, we never have recognized an exception to sovereign immunity predicated on a ministerial duty.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Canning\n    </em>\n    , the court distinguished statutes waiving sovereign immunity that are silent with respect to the right to a jury trial from those that expressly preclude such a right; see, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 4-61 (a) (requiring court trial in actions against state on highway and public works contracts); General Statutes \u00a7 4-160 (f) (requiring court trial in actions against state authorized by claims commissioner); and from those that expressly provide for such a right; see General Statutes \u00a7 13a-144 (permitting plaintiff to elect jury trial in action to recover damages for injuries sustained on state highways or sidewalks).
