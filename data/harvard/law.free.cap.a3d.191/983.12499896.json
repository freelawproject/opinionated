They disputed, however, whether the trial court could also find the defendant liable for attorney's fees incurred by the plaintiff in defense of the federal action commenced by the Tribal Nation to which the defendant was not a party (federal action attorney's fees).

The trial court concluded that the defendant was liable for the federal action attorney's fees pursuant to \u00a7 12-161a. The trial court further stated that the plaintiff could file a motion for attorney's fees within thirty days and that a hearing would be scheduled thereafter to determine the amount of the attorney's fees to which the plaintiff is entitled.

See footnote 1 of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On appeal to this court, the defendant claims that the Appellate Court improperly dismissed its appeal because there was an appealable final judgment. The defendant claims that this conclusion is supported by this court's recent application of\n   <em>\n    Paranteau\n   </em>\n   's bright line rule in\n   <em>\n    Hylton\n   </em>\n   , which,\n   the defendant argues, stands for the proposition that \"when attorney's fees are awarded as punitive damages, a litigant can appeal the legal basis for awarding fees\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the trial court has acted on a motion for attorney's fees and determined the amount of recoverable fees.\" (Emphasis in original.) The defendant further emphasizes that this court stated in\n   <em>\n    Benvenuto\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Mahajan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"102139\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/245/495/#p501\">\n    245 Conn. 495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 501,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=715%20A.2d%20743\">\n    715 A.2d 743\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998), that this bright line rule \"applies across the board, even to cases that might not seem particularly apt for it.\" To this end, the defendant contends that, in\n   <em>\n    Hylton\n   </em>\n   , this court considered how the bright line rule adopted in\n   <em>\n    Paranteau\n   </em>\n   related to the well established principle that judgments rendered on liability alone are not final for purposes of appeal until the amount of damages is determined and, moreover, that the Appellate Court's reliance on its cases applying footnote 11 of\n   <em>\n    Paranteau\n   </em>\n   as a basis for dismissing the appeal was misplaced because those cases were decided prior to\n   <em>\n    Hylton\n   </em>\n   . The defendant argues that the circumstances of its appeal are more factually similar to those of\n   <em>\n    Hylton\n   </em>\n   than the circumstances considered in footnote 11 of\n   <em>\n    Paranteau\n   </em>\n   because, \"[i]n this case, as in\n   <em>\n    Hylton\n   </em>\n   , the Superior Court has already resolved the legal question of whether the plaintiff has the right to [file] a motion to recover attorney's fees as a form of damages. In this\n   case, as in\n   <em>\n    Hylton\n   </em>\n   , the defendant wishes to challenge\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   legal determination, which is completely separate from and will not be affected by any subsequent decision by the Superior Court regarding the measure of recoverable [attorney's] fees.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Emphasis in original.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In response, the plaintiff relies on footnote 11 of this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Paranteau\n   </em>\n   and contends that \"[t]he defendant's argument that this court has adopted the 'bright line' rule that judgments are final before the amount of recoverable attorney's fees has been determined does not apply [when] judgment has [rendered] on the issue of liability only.\" The plaintiff argues that\n   <em>\n    Benvenuto\n   </em>\n   \"does not support the defendant's position\" and that the Appellate Court was correct in determining that the trial court's decision was not a final judgment, as that judgment was rendered as to liability only. The plaintiff then claims that the defendant's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Hylton\n   </em>\n   is misplaced because the trial court did not render a judgment disposing of the merits of the present case insofar as \"[t]he defendant is appealing only the trial court's ... judgment as to liability only in favor of the plaintiff with respect to the federal action attorney's fees, which were awarded pursuant to \u00a7 12-161a.\" We agree with the defendant, and conclude that the trial court's determination that the defendant is liable for the federal action attorney's fees was an appealable final judgment, despite the fact that the amount of those fees had not yet been determined.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As a preliminary matter, we set forth the standard of review. \"The lack of a final judgment implicates the subject matter jurisdiction of an appellate court to hear an appeal.

In a strict foreclosure case, until the amount of attorney's fees is set by the court, the total amount of the debt is not fully determined, and any party wishing to redeem on his or her law day will not know precisely how much to pay in order to do so. That reasoning argues with considerable persuasiveness for a conclusion that, in such a case, there is no final judgment for purposes of appeal until attorney's fees are determined. Thus, a judgment of strict foreclosure that does not contain a determination of attorney's fees does not fit comfortably with traditional notions of finality.\" Id., at 501,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=715%20A.2d%20743\">\n    715 A.2d 743\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   This court, however, concluded that\n   <em>\n    Paranteau\n   </em>\n   's bright line rule nonetheless applies to appeals in strict foreclosure cases.

The gist of that reasoning is that it is more efficient, for the courts and the parties, to have a bright line rule because a case-by-case approach as to whether a claim for attorney's fees is collateral or integral to a judgment on the merits promotes, rather than eliminates, uncertainty as to when an appeal on the merits must be taken.... With a bright line rule that a judgment on the merits is final for purposes of appeal, notwithstanding that a determination has not yet been made regarding the recoverability or amount of attorney's fees, the parties and the courts will not be burdened with having to decide how the claim for attorney's fees fits, or does not fit, with the judgment\n   on the merits.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=715%20A.2d%20743\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   This court emphasized that \"[t]here are numerous contexts in which attorney's fees may be awarded, including foreclosure actions, actions on notes or other contracts with attorney's fees clauses, and statutory claims that carry with them the potential for an award of attorney's fees.

By opting for a bright line rule, we implicitly recognized that there would be some cases-indeed, this is such a case-in which the application of the bright line [rule] would mean that an attorney's fees award that would otherwise be considered integral to the judgment on the merits would nevertheless be severable from that judgment for purposes of finality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \"Furthermore, reading\n   <em>\n    Paranteau\n   </em>\n   narrowly, so as to apply only to a supplemental postjudgment claim for attorney's fees ... would require the court and parties in each case to determine whether the claim fit within that category.

Given our conclusion with respect to the defendant's claim pursuant to\n    <em>\n     Hylton\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Paranteau\n    </em>\n    , we need not address these alternative arguments.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    We note that the plaintiff contends that \"[t]here is no merit to the defendant's claim that the trial court lacked statutory authority to award attorney's fees\" under \u00a7 12-161a and that \"[t]he defendant is endeavoring to sidestep the trial court's ruling on this matter and to substitute its own perception of the outcome.\" We leave the resolution of this argument, which pertains to the merits of the appeal rather than to appellate jurisdiction, to the Appellate Court in the first instance.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    Footnote 11 of\n    <em>\n     Paranteau\n    </em>\n    can be explained as part of an effort to save jurisdiction over that appeal given the facts of that particular case, which predated our clarification in\n    <em>\n     Ambroise\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     William Raveis Real Estate, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"738682\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/226/757/#p762\">\n     226 Conn. 757\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 762-63,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=628%20A.2d%201303\">\n     628 A.2d 1303\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1993), that the twenty day time limitation for filing an appeal set forth in Practice Book \u00a7 63-1 (a) is not subject matter jurisdictional. See\n    <em>\n     Benvenuto\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Mahajan\n    </em>\n    , supra,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"102139\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/245/495/#p501\">\n     245 Conn. at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    503-505 and n.4,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=715%20A.2d%20743\">\n     715 A.2d 743\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Nevertheless, footnote 11 is in tension with\n    <em>\n     Paranteau\n    </em>\n    's bright line rule as it has been extended in\n    <em>\n     Benvenuto\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Hylton\n    </em>\n    . Although the Appellate Court has dismissed several appeals following the rationale of\n    <em>\n     Paranteau\n    </em>\n    's footnote 11; see footnote 2 of this opinion; we observe that the footnote must be considered in the context of this court's subsequent decisions in\n    <em>\n     Benvenuto\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Hylton\n    </em>\n    , which emphasize the importance of the bright line rule with respect to attorney's fees awards that are not rendered postjudgment.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
