Appellant attacks the constitutionality of the search warrant, which led to the recovery of drugs, currency, and other items, as well as the sufficiency of the evidence. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The facts germane to Appellant's issues largely concern the affidavit of probable cause for the anticipatory search warrant, which was executed at Appellant's residence on June 29, 2011. That application set forth the following. Beginning in 2009, the Pennsylvania State Police (\"PSP\") utilized a confidential informant (\"CI\") who was a member of the Pagan Motorcycle Club, and who had previously provided reliable information. On April 28, 2011, the CI informed the lead investigator, Pennsylvania State Police Trooper Matthew Baumgard, that Appellant, whom the CI identified as a member of the Pagan Motorcycle Club, unexpectedly arrived at his home and offered to sell him three one-half ounce packages of cocaine for $650 per package. The CI declined, stating that he had just purchased cocaine from \"Tony\" and was dissatisfied with the quality. The CI contacted the authorities to report this development.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On May 16, 2011, the CI informed Trooper Baumgard that Appellant had invited him to Appellant's home. Upon arrival, Appellant showed the CI one-half pounds of cocaine. Appellant said he obtained the package due to the CI's dissatisfaction with Tony's product, and offered him the entire package in exchange for $5,000 paid over time. The CI agreed and took the cocaine, which he then turned over to the authorities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Based on this information, the authorities applied for an order authorizing a consensual wiretap of conversations occurring inside Appellant's residence pursuant to 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5704(2)(iv), with the CI agreeing to wear a recording device.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The order was granted later that day, and, significant to Appellant's challenges on appeal, authorized continuous interception of all in-home conversations for a period of thirty days. The Commonwealth also obtained an extension of the order after the thirty days expired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Thereafter, the CI made several visits to Appellant's home and recorded the ensuing conversations. On May 16, 20, 25, and 31, 2011, the CI went to Appellant's home and delivered cash provided by the authorities to Appellant in installments. Officers surveilled Appellant's home during each meeting, and met with the CI afterwards\n   to discuss what occurred and retrieve the recordings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Next, on June 9, 2011, Appellant gave the CI two more ounces of cocaine in exchange for his agreement to deliver payment over time. Additionally, Appellant offered to sell the CI methamphetamine for $1,300 per ounce. Later that evening, Appellant arrived at the CI's doorstep and delivered the methamphetamine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 13, 2011, the CI paid cash to Appellant for the cocaine that was supplied on June 9, 2011. Additionally, on June 15, 2011, Appellant supplied more cocaine, which the CI then paid for on June 20, 2011.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Similarly, on June 22, 2011, Appellant gave the CI more cocaine at Appellant's residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On June 27, 2011, the CI visited Appellant's home and paid for the cocaine received five days prior. During this meeting, Appellant indicated that he would once again have a quantity of cocaine and methamphetamine available for pickup on June 29, 2011. On the basis of the foregoing information, Trooper Baumgard requested an anticipatory search warrant for Appellant's home, which was to be executed upon Appellant's contact with the CI on the 29th.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On June 29, 2011, Appellant called the CI and informed him that he was at home. Trooper Baumgard authorized the execution of the search warrant, which yielded the following items from the master bedroom: a United American bank bag containing drugs, a briefcase containing drugs in a separate bank bag, a digital scale, and a black accordion file next to the bed containing documents and mail establishing that Appellant and his wife lived at the home. A total of 84.2 grams of cocaine was seized in addition to 99.64 grams of methamphetamine. The parties stipulated to the recovery of these items following the search warrant, as well as to expert testimony that, based on all the circumstances, the drugs were possessed with the intent to deliver. Appellant was found guilty of all charges and received the aforementioned sentence. Appellant presents the following issues for our review.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   I. Whether the June 29, 2011 search warrant for Appellant's home was rendered invalid because it relied almost exclusively on an order or search warrant as described in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

Whether the June 29, 2011 search warrant was invalid because it failed to meet the specific requirements of an anticipatory warrant?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   III. Whether the Commonwealth presented sufficient evidence of possession to sustain the conviction against appellant?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Appellant's brief at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We address Appellant's third issue first, since a successful sufficiency of the evidence charge requires discharge.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

Our standard of review is well-settled. Whether the evidence was sufficient to sustain the charge presents a question of law. Our standard of review is\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   and our scope of review is plenary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

In conducting our inquiry, we\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   examine whether the evidence admitted at trial, and all reasonable inferences drawn therefrom, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as verdict winner, support the jury's finding of all the elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.

Appellant argues that the evidence only establishes that he was present in the same residence where the drugs were found. It is true that mere presence cannot sustain a finding of possession. However, the Commonwealth is not required to show actual physical possession of the drugs. Constructive possession is sufficient, which\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   is an inference arising from a set of facts that possession of the contraband was more likely than not. We have defined constructive possession as \"conscious dominion.\" We subsequently defined \"conscious dominion\" as the power to control the contraband and the intent to exercise that control. To aid application, we have held that constructive possession may be established by the totality of the circumstances.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

The intent to exercise control over a piece of contraband can be proven by circumstantial evidence and all the circumstances in question.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Muniz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Appellant argues that the Commonwealth could not establish possession because he was merely present and \"there is\n   <strong>\n    no\n   </strong>\n   evidence regarding how long [Appellant] had been at the residence prior to law enforcement's arrival.\" Appellant's brief at 54 (emphasis in original). We do not find that this fact precludes a finding of possession. It would be rather remarkable to conclude that an unknown party secreted, without Appellant's knowledge, approximately 200 grams worth of drugs in his master bedroom. Additionally, Appellant highlights that his wife was present, suggesting that she may have possessed the drugs without Appellant's knowledge. However, our law holds that two persons may constructively possess the same item.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

We find that, when viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the totality of the circumstances established that Appellant constructively possessed the drugs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We now address Appellant's averment that the search warrant was defective. \"The ultimate issue in a suppression hearing is whether the police officer affiants had probable cause at the time they applied for a search warrant.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

Appellant's challenge to the recordings relies on both statutory and constitutional grounds. We first turn our attention to the Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Control Act (hereinafter \"the Act\"), 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 5701 - 5782.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    The Wiretap Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Act prohibits the intentional interception of any oral communication unless all parties consent to the recording. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5703. The Act sets forth a number of exceptions, including an exception for consensual interceptions authorized by one party to the conversation, subject to the following requirements:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   It shall not be unlawful and no prior court approval shall be required under this chapter for:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   (2) Any investigative or law enforcement officer or any person acting at the direction or request of an investigative or law enforcement officer to intercept a wire, electronic or oral communication involving suspected criminal activities, including, but not limited to, the crimes enumerated in section 5708 (relating to order authorizing interception of wire, electronic or oral communications), where:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (i) Deleted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (ii)\n   <strong>\n    one of the parties to the communication has given prior consent to such interception\n   </strong>\n   .

Consequently, Appellant views each subsequent recording as an unconstitutional search without prior judicial approval.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In supporting their respective positions, the parties' briefs extensively discuss\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Brion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   and the statutory differences between consensual and nonconsensual wiretaps. For example, the Commonwealth argues that if the Act permits a nonconsensual wiretap for thirty days, then it necessarily follows that a consensual recording is likewise constitutionally permissible for at least the same length. Moreover, the Commonwealth states that Appellant's interpretation places an onerous burden on law enforcement, as the Commonwealth would have to seek new orders if the target happened to exit and re-enter his residence while the consenting party was on site. Appellant responds that the Commonwealth's argument misses the mark, since a nonconsensual wiretap order imposes more stringent requirements, including the need for the Commonwealth to demonstrate that normal investigative techniques have failed or are too dangerous to employ. In Appellant's view, the Commonwealth effectively obtained a \u00a7 5708 wiretap order while sidestepping the requirements applicable to such orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Finally, the Commonwealth advances the position that the search warrant does not rely on the actual recordings, and states that \"even if no recording device had been used in this case at all, the observations of the Troopers and the information relayed to them by the CI ... would still have established probable cause[.]\" Commonwealth's brief at 12.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response, Appellant counters that \"there is no way to ascertain to what extent the affiant may have relied on what he heard on the illegally obtained and recorded intercepts[.]\" Appellant's reply brief at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   We agree with the Commonwealth with respect to its latter position, and affirm on that basis.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

In reaching this conclusion, we find that the parties have largely overlooked a critical distinction between the voluntary disclosure of information versus the recording of same. In truth, Appellant seeks to suppress\n   <strong>\n    information\n   </strong>\n   , not the recordings. For the reasons that follow, we find that this is not a mere technical distinction and is outcome determinative. We therefore decline to reach Appellant's constitutional argument that the Act permits only one in-home intercept.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    III\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    Constitutional Protections\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   We begin by discussing whether and when citizens have a constitutional interest in private conversations, as protected by the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitutions or Article I, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution.

Briefly stated, James Hoffa, the president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, was on trial for another matter over a lengthy period of time. During that trial,\n   Edward Partin, a local Teamsters official, visited Hoffa's hotel room. Partin, who was under indictment for embezzlement, had agreed to act as an informer for the Government. Partin engaged in multiple conversations with Hoffa and his associates, which concerned schemes by Hoffa to bribe the jury. Partin thereafter disclosed the contents of those conversations to federal agents. These conversations occurred at various locations, including Hoffa's hotel. Partin testified at a later trial, where Hoffa was convicted of attempting to influence a juror.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Hoffa alleged that his Fourth Amendment rights were violated because Partin failed to disclose his role as a government informer. Therefore, \"by listening to [Hoffa]'s statements Partin conducted an illegal 'search' for verbal evidence.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11337025\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/385/293/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11337025\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/385/293/\">\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11337025\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/385/293/\">\n    at 300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11337025\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/385/293/\">\n    87 S.Ct. 408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It is obvious that the petitioner was not relying on the security of his hotel suite when he made the incriminating statements to Partin or in Partin's presence.

He was not a surreptitious eavesdropper.\n   <strong>\n    Partin was in the suite by invitation, and every conversation which he heard was either directed to him or knowingly carried on in his presence\n   </strong>\n   . The petitioner, in a word, was not relying on the security of the hotel room; he was relying upon his misplaced confidence that Partin would not reveal his wrongdoing.

The Court reasoned that since\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Hoffa\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   permits an agent to write down what he hears, it follows that he may both record and transmit the conversations.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   If the conduct and revelations of an agent operating without electronic equipment do not invade the defendant's constitutionally justifiable expectations of privacy, neither does a simultaneous recording of the same conversations made by the agent or by others from transmissions received from the agent to whom the defendant is talking and whose trustworthiness the defendant necessarily risks.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   Our problem is not what the privacy expectations of particular defendants in particular situations may be or the extent to which they may in fact have relied on the discretion of their companions.

So far, the law permits the frustration of actual expectations of privacy by permitting authorities to use the testimony of those associates who for one reason or another have determined to turn to the police, as well as by authorizing the use of informants in the manner exemplified by\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Hoffa\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Lewis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n   <strong>\n    If the law gives no protection to the wrongdoer whose trusted accomplice is or becomes a police agent, neither should it protect him when that same agent has recorded or transmitted the conversations which are later offered in evidence to prove the State's case\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11714876\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/745/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11714876\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/745/\">\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11714876\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/745/\">\n    at 751-52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11714876\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/745/\">\n    91 S.Ct. 1122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added, citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Appellant, on the other hand, apparently sees no constitutional distinction between\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Hoffa\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Katz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .

The States are free to impose greater protections, and, as previously mentioned, our Supreme Court has directly confronted the issue of in-home recordings under the Pennsylvania Constitution in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Brion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , which we now examine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Brion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , the police, with prosecutorial approval, sent a consenting confidential informant to purchase marijuana from Michael Brion at his residence and record the conversation. The Commonwealth had relied upon 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5704(2)(ii), which, as previously quoted, permitted interceptions upon prosecutorial approval and where one party to the conversation consents.

Our Supreme Court agreed, finding that compliance with \u00a7 5704(2)(ii) under the circumstances resulted in an unconstitutional search. First, the Court held that an individual has a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to the conversations under Article I, Section 8, thereby departing from the foregoing federal precedents.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   [T]he instant case involves conversations taking place in the sanctity of one's home.

Thus, under Pennsylvania Constitutional jurisprudence, it is manifest that a citizen's expectation of privacy can extend, in some circumstances, to information voluntarily disclosed to others.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   In the context of a verbal communication, in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Brion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , our court held that Article I, Section 8 prevents police from sending a confidential informant into the home of an individual to electronically record his conversation by use of a body wire absent a prior determination of\n   probable cause by a neutral judicial authority. In finding a constitutionally-recognized expectation of privacy, our court's primary focus was on the zone of privacy in the home and the face-to-face conversations taking place therein. The majority did not embrace an analysis based on the disclosure of information, which, as described above, and by the dissenters in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Brion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , would have resulted in no recognized expectation of privacy. Thus, contrary to the analysis utilized in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     White\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , our court, while still applying the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Katz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   privacy expectation construct, found a legitimate expectation of privacy in face-to-face conversations conducted within one's home.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   In summary, unlike the United States Supreme Court, our court has declined to embrace a constitutional analysis under Article I, Section 8 that relies primarily upon a principle of disclosure.

Implicit in this observation about the very nature of privacy expectations in oral communications was the recognition that one's listeners can, and often do, repeat the content of a conversation to anyone they choose. That reality, in turn, suggests that, at least in the absence of some recognized privilege, the speaker cannot be said to possess any reasonable expectation that the contents of the conversation itself will remain private once the words are related to another.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 633-34 (Castille, C.J., concurring) (emphases in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The instant case squarely presents the issue of whether a defendant is entitled to preclude consideration of the substance of conversation, assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that the simultaneous recording of that conversation occurred in violation of Appellant's constitutional rights as set forth in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Brion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    IV\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    Validity of the Affidavit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   More specifically, the question is whether the affidavit of probable cause could lawfully include the\n   <strong>\n    information\n   </strong>\n   learned from Appellant's conversations with the CI, even if the conversations were unlawfully recorded. We hold that the information itself was not subject to suppression, and that remains true even if all recordings after the first violated Appellant's rights under Article I, Section 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Applying the foregoing precedents and principles, we find that the Commonwealth received the information twice: once when the CI told the officers that which Appellant voluntarily disclosed, and a second time when the CI performed a search by capturing Appellant's actual words on tape.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Brion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   and the Pennsylvania Constitution dictate that Appellant had a reasonable expectation of privacy that his words would not be recorded, but we find that Appellant had no reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to the information itself, which he freely disclosed to the CI, who in turn relayed the information to the authorities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Brion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , and the Act's implementation of that case, addresses only whether there is a reasonable expectation of privacy that Appellant's conversations would not be recorded by his guests. This is evident from the fact that the issue in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Brion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   was an attempt to suppress the recording itself as substantive evidence. We decline to extend an expectation of privacy to the information\n   itself. Appellant took the risk that the CI was acting on behalf of the Commonwealth, and as a result had no reasonable expectation of privacy in what he said and showed the CI.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Hoffa\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . To take Appellant's argument to its logical conclusion,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   that Appellant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the actual substance of his conversations, then the Commonwealth needed prior judicial approval before asking the CI to enter Appellant's residence in the first instance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   That result would remarkably expand the reach of\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Brion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , and would constitutionally prohibit the use of,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , confidential informants and undercover agents, without prior judicial approval.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Thus, when we remove the recordings themselves from the equation, the Commonwealth lawfully obtained everything Appellant relayed to the CI.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"[E]vidence ... is potentially suppressible as fruit of the poisonous tree stemming from unconstitutional police conduct. However, ... any such evidence may be admitted where the Commonwealth sufficiently proves that it was ... discoverable through an independent source.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

The independent source in this case was Appellant's voluntary disclosures to the CI. Therefore, the search warrant did not rely upon evidence derived from an unlawful wiretap, but rather the information disclosed to the authorities, which happened to also be recorded. Therefore, it is incorrect to posit that the Commonwealth derived its evidence from an unlawful wiretap, since the Commonwealth knew the same information with or without the recordings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <strong>\n    V\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <strong>\n    The Continuing Vitality of\n    <em>\n     Brion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   We are, of course, mindful of the fact that this Court has no authority to overrule Pennsylvania Supreme Court precedent. In reaching our conclusion, we do not hold that the multiple intercepts were consistent with\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Brion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   and its interpretation of Article I, Section 8, an issue that both parties ask us to reach. The parties presented reasoned arguments respecting that issue. As Appellant notes, the Act was amended to codify\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Brion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , and the statutory language facially permits the Commonwealth to secure an open-ended order authorizing in-home intercepts for an indefinite period of time. On the other hand, Appellant's proposed \"one recording only\" rule would require the Commonwealth to secure a separate order if the target and the consensual recorder happened to leave the home for a trip to the store and returned to a residence. The lack of statutory direction on this point is a matter for the Legislature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   We emphasize that in our holding today, we offer no opinion on whether the recordings themselves violated Appellant's constitutional rights under Article I, Section 8. In the event that Appellant's rights actually were violated, suppression of the recordings themselves is no mere constitutional consolation prize.

If the government were to execute an anticipatory warrant before the triggering condition occurred, there would be no reason to believe the item described in the warrant could be found at the searched location; by definition, the triggering condition which establishes probable cause has not yet been satisfied when the warrant is issued.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276079\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/90/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276079\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/90/\">\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276079\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/90/\">\n    at 94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276079\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/90/\">\n    126 S.Ct. 1494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (cleaned up).\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   As stated in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Wallace\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Grubbs\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   decision\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   established two requirements which an affidavit of probable cause in support of an anticipatory search warrant must meet under the Fourth Amendment: (1) there is probable cause to believe the triggering condition will occur; and (2) if the triggering condition occurs there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.

He argues that the Commonwealth was required to establish the probability of a drug delivery to Appellant's residence. \"The affiant therefore sought to establish that appellant Katona\n   <strong>\n    would\n   </strong>\n   obtain drugs[.]\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   We disagree. This case is not a typical anticipatory search warrant case, since, as reflected in the foregoing quotations, the triggering condition is usually the arrival of some illegal material, such as a package containing child pornography or narcotics. However, Appellant's argument proceeds from a flawed premise, as the triggering condition was not the\n   <strong>\n    receipt\n   </strong>\n   of the drugs, but rather Appellant's signal that he would\n   <strong>\n    deliver\n   </strong>\n   drugs to the CI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Wallace\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , establishes that anticipatory warrants are not limited to the arrival of an item. Therein, our Supreme Court reviewed an anticipatory search warrant regarding the sale of drugs from a particular residence. The application for the search warrant relied upon information from a CI that a black male known as Greg used a gold-colored Mercedes to deliver narcotics. The application represented that the informant stated he could purchase cocaine from Greg at a particular residence between the hours of 7:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. The CI also provided Greg's cell phone number.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Based on this information, an officer sought an anticipatory search warrant for that residence. The affidavit set forth that further investigation revealed that Gregory Wallace lived at the particular home, and a criminal background check revealed that Wallace had listed in his papers the same phone number supplied by the CI. The affidavit further stated that the CI had reliably provided information in the past. The search warrant was to be executed upon the triggering condition of the sale of drugs at the residence. The warrant was issued, and, on that same day, the CI entered the residence and returned several minutes later with two bags of cocaine. Authorities then executed the search warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Our Supreme Court determined that the anticipatory warrant application amounted to little more than an assertion that the informant could arrange a drug sale, which is insufficient. In other words, the fact that drugs were actually sold to the CI from Wallace's residence said nothing about whether the magistrate could lawfully conclude\n   <em>\n    ex ante\n   </em>\n   that probable cause existed that the sale would occur. In this vein,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Wallace\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   emphasized that the search warrant application gave no indication that the drugs would be inside Wallace's residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   The CI's information revealed only that \"Greg\" sold cocaine from his car, not his home, and the warrant did not provide any details of \"Greg's\" prior sales. Moreover, the fact that the phone number and address were linked to Wallace was of little value, as that information was publicly available. Additionally, the police failed to confirm through their own investigation that Wallace used his residence for selling drugs. Of note to the issue at bar, the Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   There was no factual basis in the affidavit which established that the confidential informant had any past relationship with \"Greg,\" ever witnessed \"Greg\" in possession of drugs, or, critically, had been inside of Appellant's home recently and observed drugs stored there. Furthermore, there were no facts in the affidavit which suggested that the confidential informant had, at any time, personally purchased drugs from \"Greg,\" or witnessed \"Greg\" selling drugs at\n   <strong>\n    any\n   </strong>\n   location, let alone at Appellant's home. In short, the affidavit contained only the informant's bare assertion that he could effectuate a controlled purchase at Appellant's home at a particular time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 1050 (emphasis in original). Notably,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Wallace\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   did not suggest that the Commonwealth would have to establish that Wallace's home would\n   <strong>\n    receive\n   </strong>\n   the drugs which were then sold. The case implicitly endorsed the notion that the sale of drugs from a home could serve as a triggering condition if sufficiently supported.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   In contrast to\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Wallace\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , the affidavit for the anticipatory search warrant in this case supplied a wealth of information regarding the recent presence of narcotics in Appellant's residence, as well as Appellant's prior deliveries to the CI. The application sets forth the details of four prior occasions where Appellant supplied drugs to the CI, two of which occurred at Appellant's residence. Each time, Appellant would supply more drugs when the CI paid for the prior deliveries. The last three deliveries all occurred within weeks of each other. Thus, the application established a pattern whereby Appellant would provide a fresh delivery of drugs upon payment for the previous deliveries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Most significantly, the June 27, 2011 incident concluded with Appellant telling the CI that additional drugs would be available on June 29, a statement that was made after the CI provided payment for the last delivery. We find that a reviewing magistrate could determine that \"(1) there is probable cause to believe the triggering condition will occur; and (2) if the triggering condition occurs there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 1049. While the triggering condition largely overlaps with the second requirement, as Appellant's contact to the CI provided the basis to believe Appellant's residence contained the contraband, this is not a case, as in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Wallace\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , where the affidavit did little more than indicate that a drug sale could be arranged. The search warrant application provided sufficiently specific information to conclude there was probable cause to believe that Appellant would call the CI on June 29, 2011, to supply more drugs. Therefore, we deny relief on this ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Judgment of sentence affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Judge Olson, Judge Ott, Judge Stabile and Judge Dubow join this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   President Judge Gantman concurs in the result of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Judge Lazarus files a dissenting opinion in which Judge Shogan joins.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   President Judge Emeritus Bender did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   DISSENTING OPINION BY LAZARUS, J.:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   I respectfully dissent. The Majority bases its holding on what it characterizes as a \"critical distinction between the voluntary disclosure of information versus the recording of same.\" Majority Opinion, at p. 16. The Majority finds Appellant is seeking to suppress\n   <strong>\n    information\n   </strong>\n   , not the recordings. The Majority states: \"[T]he search warrant did not rely upon evidence derived from an unlawful wiretap, but rather the information disclosed to the authorities, which happened to also be recorded.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 23. The Majority, therefore, declines to reach the Appellant's argument that the Wiretap Act permits only a single, in-home nonconsensual intercept per order. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5704(2)(iv).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Keeping in mind that the determination of whether information supporting the issuance of the warrant is sufficiently reliable to establish probable cause often hinges upon whether that information is corroborated, I agree that the affidavit of probable cause was arguably sufficient. However, the search warrant was \"irremediably tainted,\" and application of the \"independent source doctrine\" is not appropriate here. As our Supreme Court stated in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

My reading of the Wiretap Act, however, does not authorize\n   <em>\n    unlimited\n   </em>\n   in-home intercepts for a 30-day period, as contemplated in the wiretap order in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   The order, dated May 16, 2011, authorized\n   <em>\n    consensual\n   </em>\n   interception and provided for intercepted conversations \"\n   <em>\n    between the date of this Order and thirty (30) days thereafter\n   </em>\n   , at the residence of [Appellant] or at any other location within Westmoreland County where [Appellant] may have an expectation of privacy such as one would have in one's own home.\" Order, 5/16/11, at \u00b6 1 (emphasis added). But this is not a section 5712 wiretap; it is a section 5704(2)(iv) consensual intercept. The 30-day period is the permissible length of a\n   <em>\n    non-consensual\n   </em>\n   interception\n   <em>\n    under section 5712\n   </em>\n   of the Wiretap Act, not section 5704.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5712(b).

That it is unnecessary for law enforcement to obtain a new consent from the CI prior to each intercept has no\n   bearing on the requirement of probable cause prior to an in-home intercept. Rather, the issue is whether a single order can allow for unlimited interceptions in Appellant's home without additional probable cause that an incriminating conversation will occur upon each entry. The CI is not our concern; it is the Appellant's expectation of privacy in the words he utters in his home that is the focus of the protection.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Katz v.
