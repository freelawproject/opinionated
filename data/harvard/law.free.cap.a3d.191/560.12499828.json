Litigation in New Jersey over Accutane's side effects has spanned more than a decade. This action is a continuation in that series of litigated matters. Since those actions first commenced in New Jersey in 2005, a number of epidemiological studies have been published, all concluding that there is no causal relationship between Accutane and Crohn's disease. Plaintiffs' experts dispute the conclusions of those studies, calling them flawed and lacking in value. Having rejected the evidence and conclusions of those epidemiological studies, one of plaintiffs' experts, relying on other facts and forms of data, asserts the contrary view that Accutane can in fact cause Crohn's disease. Defendants challenged the methodology used by both of plaintiffs' experts as unreliable and sought the exclusion of that expert testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After a Rule 104 pretrial evidentiary hearing, the trial court excluded the testimony, holding that plaintiffs' experts' methodology was unsound because they did not interpret the relevant data and apply it to the facts of this case as would\n   other experts in the field. The Appellate Division reversed, concluding that plaintiffs' experts employed a sound methodology and simply interpreted the data differently than defendants' experts.\n   Our Court was among the foremost to shift from exclusive reliance on a \"general acceptance\" standard\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   for testing the reliability of scientific expert testimony to a methodology-based approach.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Landrigan v. Celotex Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"301165\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/127/404/#p414\">\n    127 N.J. 404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 414,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"301165\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/127/404/#p414\">\n    605 A.2d 1079\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992) ;\n   <em>\n    Rubanick v. Witco Chem. Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"333371\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/125/421/#p447\">\n    125 N.J. 421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 447,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"333371\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/125/421/#p447\">\n    593 A.2d 733\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1991). We initially took that step to allow the parties in toxic tort civil matters to present novel scientific evidence of causation if, after the trial court engages in rigorous gatekeeping when reviewing for reliability, the proponent persuades the court of the soundness of the expert's reasoning and methodology. Two years later, with its\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   decision, the United States Supreme Court also abandoned the general acceptance test in favor of a methodology-based approach that entrusted trial courts with the role of gatekeeper. Both our civil standard and the federal standard moved in the same direction and towards the same common goal. Although the two standards are similar both in practice and in overall philosophy, we have never adopted\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   or incorporated the factors identified in\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   for use by our courts when performing the gatekeeper role.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   We granted certification in this matter to address whether the trial court properly excluded plaintiffs' experts' testimony, whether the Appellate Division employed the correct standard in reviewing and overturning that decision, and whether our standard for assessing the reliability of expert witnesses is in need of clarification. It is with regard to the last issue that we are asked whether the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   standard's factors would further elucidate our own standard for the admissibility of expert testimony. We believe that they would.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We perceive little distinction between\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   's principles regarding expert testimony and our own, and believe that its factors for assessing the reliability of expert testimony will aid our trial\n   courts in their role as the gatekeeper of scientific expert testimony in civil cases. Accordingly, we now reconcile our standard under N.J.R.E. 702, and relatedly N.J.R.E. 703, with the federal\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   standard to incorporate its factors for civil cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   This case -- with its adversarial setting and full record -- provides the appropriate setting for illustrating how courts should evaluate the methodology of a credentialed expert when determining whether an opinion is based on scientifically sound reasoning.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kemp ex rel. Wright v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1107512\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/174/412/#p427\">\n    174 N.J. 412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 427,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1107512\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/174/412/#p427\">\n    809 A.2d 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002). Our analysis of this record leads to a clear result: the trial court properly excluded plaintiffs' experts' testimony. Moreover, we reaffirm that the abuse of discretion standard must be applied by an appellate court assessing whether a trial court has properly admitted or excluded expert scientific testimony in a civil case. In this matter, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in its evidential ruling and, therefore, the Appellate Division erred in reversing the trial court's exclusion of the testimony of plaintiffs' experts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Before diving into the record and its contested scientific evidence, we set forth\n   some basic background to the evidential standards in issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   New Jersey Rules of Evidence 702 and 703 control the admission of expert testimony. N.J.R.E. 702 provides that \"[i]f scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.\" N.J.R.E. 703 states that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [t]he facts or data in the particular case upon which an expert bases an opinion or inference may be those perceived by or made known to the expert at or before the hearing. If of a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field in forming opinions or inferences upon the subject, the facts or data need not be admissible in evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    State v. Kelly\n   </em>\n   , this Court applied Rule 702's similarly worded predecessor, Evidence Rule 56, and identified three prerequisites to a determination that expert testimony is permissible:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (1) the intended testimony must concern a subject matter that is beyond the ken of the average juror; (2) the field testified to must be at a state of the art such that an expert's testimony could be sufficiently reliable; and (3) the witness must have sufficient expertise to offer the intended testimony.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   [\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1384335\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/97/178/#p223\">\n    97 N.J. 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 223,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=478%20A.2d%20364\">\n    478 A.2d 364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   That standard provides the baseline for the admissibility of expert testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Official Comments to N.J.R.E. 702 (noting that N.J.R.E. 702 incorporates standard articulated by\n   <em>\n    Kelly\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Kelly\n   </em>\n   criteria elucidated application of the then-applicable \"general acceptance\" standard for admitting scientific evidence, which originated in\n   <em>\n    Frye v.

In\n   <em>\n    Frye\n   </em>\n   , the then Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia excluded an expert's testimony concerning results from an early form of lie-detector test.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11720199\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f/293/1013/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11720199\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f/293/1013/\">\n    at 1013-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[W]hile courts will go a long way in admitting expert testimony deduced from a well-recognized scientific principle or discovery, the thing from which the deduction is made must be sufficiently established to have gained general acceptance in the particular field in which it belongs.\").

Then, in 1991, prior to the United States Supreme Court's seminal\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   decision, in which the Court interpreted the Federal Rules of Evidence on expert testimony, our Court moved away from rigid adherence to the general acceptance standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   This Court held in\n   <em>\n    Rubanick\n   </em>\n   that a court may admit expert scientific evidence on a causation theory in toxic tort litigation so long as \"it is based on a sound, adequately-founded scientific methodology involving data and information of the type reasonably\n   relied on by experts in the scientific field.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"333371\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/125/421/#p447\">\n    125 N.J. at 449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"333371\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/125/421/#p447\">\n    593 A.2d 733\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . One year later, in\n   <em>\n    Landrigan\n   </em>\n   , we reinforced that in toxic tort matters involving novel theories of causation the trial court is obliged to review data and studies relied on by experts proffering an opinion in order to \"determine whether the expert's opinion is derived from a sound and well-founded methodology that is supported by some expert consensus in the appropriate field.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"301165\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/127/404/#p414\">\n    127 N.J. at 417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"301165\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/127/404/#p414\">\n    605 A.2d 1079\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Kemp\n   </em>\n   , we expanded\n   <em>\n    Rubanick\n   </em>\n   to all novel\n   medical causation circumstances and solidified the requirement of a pretrial Rule 104 hearing for assessing an expert's testimony.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1107512\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/174/412/#p427\">\n    174 N.J. at 430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1107512\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/174/412/#p427\">\n    809 A.2d 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Presently, a\n   <em>\n    Kemp\n   </em>\n   hearing is a common pretrial occurrence for resolving the reliability of expert scientific testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   A\n   <em>\n    Kemp\n   </em>\n   hearing provides the record for the present matter. After the conclusion of that hearing, the trial court determined that the contested evidence did not pass muster under our\n   <em>\n    Rubanick\n   </em>\n   evidentiary standard for assessing the reliability of proffered expert scientific testimony. The court made its findings in response to argument by the parties, rejecting the soundness of plaintiffs' experts' methodology.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Accutane is a prescription medication developed by defendants Hoffman-La Roche Inc. and Roche Laboratories Inc. (defendants) and approved by the FDA in 1982 to treat recalcitrant nodular acne. Known chemically as isotretinoin, Accutane is part of a family of Vitamin A derivatives called retinoids. During the pre-approval clinical studies of Accutane, roughly a fifth of patients suffered some form of gastrointestinal side effects. Defendants also learned, after Accutane was on the market, that users were suffering symptoms of gastrointestinal upset such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and peptic ulceration. Defendants eventually\n   amended Accutane's warning label in 1984 to add that Accutane was \"temporally associated with inflammatory bowel disease.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Accutane's alleged role as a cause of gastrointestinal disease ultimately resulted in a series of lawsuits against defendants. On May 2, 2005, this Court designated all pending and future New Jersey actions involving Accutane as a mass tort Multicounty Litigation (MCL) pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   4:38A. All cases involving Accutane were subsequently transferred to Atlantic County to be heard on a coordinated basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The present matter, the latest in a series of cases,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   involves over two thousand plaintiffs who allege that they developed Crohn's disease as a result of taking Accutane. The following basic information is not a matter of dispute between the parties. Crohn's disease is a form of IBD characterized by inflammation and ulcers in the digestive tract that can result in abdominal pain and other complications. Crohn's disease is distinguished from ulcerative colitis, the other form of IBD, by its ability to appear in any portion of the digestive tract, such as the esophagus and small intestine, whereas ulcerative colitis appears only in the large intestine. The scientific community appears to agree that Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are subject to slightly different risk factors. The exact cause of Crohn's disease is unknown.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In the years since many of the earlier cases regarding Accutane and IBD were decided, a series of epidemiological studies were published regarding the potential connection between Accutane and IBD, all of which concluded that Accutane is not causally associated with the development of Crohn's disease. On September 23, 2014, defendants filed a motion seeking a\n   <em>\n    Kemp\n   </em>\n   hearing on the association between Accutane and Crohn's disease. Defendants argued that epidemiological studies published in the scientific\n   literature over the\n   last several years effectively disproved any general causal association between Accutane and Crohn's disease. They contended that those studies are \"the most important and reliable data that exists on Accutane and Crohn's disease\" and are superior to other forms of evidence previously used in the MCL litigation such as case reports, animal studies, and theories on biological mechanisms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The trial court scheduled a\n   <em>\n    Kemp\n   </em>\n   hearing to begin on February 2, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The testimony focused intently on the aforementioned epidemiological studies. Accordingly, some background on the use of such studies in the formation of causal analyses provides context for the discussion of the evidence by the parties and the trial court. Much of the following discussion is taken from the Federal Judicial Center's\n   <em>\n    Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence\n   </em>\n   (3d ed. 2011), a source frequently relied on in the trial court proceedings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Epidemiology \"studies the incidence, distribution, and etiology of disease in human populations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1107512\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/174/412/#p427\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1107512\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/174/412/#p427\">\n    at 551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The first of those studies, published by Bernstein et al.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   in 2009, examined approximately 21,500 subjects and concluded that \"[a]lthough there may be anecdotes of [Accutane ] causing acute colitis [inflammation of the colon], our data suggest that [Accutane ] is not likely to cause chronic IBD.\" In 2010, a study by Crockett et al.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   examining approximately 29,000 subjects found \"no apparent association between isotretinoin and [Crohn's disease ],\" but did find a statistically significant increased risk between isotretinoin and ulcerative colitis.

A study of 46,922 subjects treated with Accutane published by Alhusayen et al.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   in 2013 found \"no significant\n   association between isotretinoin use and IBD.\" In 2014, an abstract by Sivaraman et al. examining 509 subjects concluded that \"Isotretinoin exposure does not appear to confer risk for either UC or CD independent of antibiotic exposure.\"\n   Two other studies -- a 176,889-subject study performed by Fenerty et al.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   and a 1078-subject study by Rashtak et al.,\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   published in 2013 and 2014, respectively -- concluded that Accutane was not causally associated with IBD but did not include specific data for Crohn's disease. Finally, a study of approximately 44,000 subjects by Racine et al.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   published in 2014 concluded that Accutane use \"was associated with a decreased [Crohn's disease ] risk.\" The interpretation of those studies is the central issue in this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Plaintiffs and defendants each produced two expert witnesses. Plaintiffs produced Dr. Arthur Asher Kornbluth, a gastroenterologist, and Dr. David Madigan, a statistician. Defendants produced gastroenterologist Dr. Maria Oliva-Hemker, and biostatistician Dr. Steven Goodman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Plaintiffs' Expert -- Dr. Kornbluth\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Plaintiffs' expert Dr. Arthur Asher Kornbluth is a board-certified physician in internal medicine and in the subspecialty of gastroenterology. He maintains an active clinical practice treating Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis and is also a Clinical Professor of Medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Dr. Kornbluth opined that there is evidence that Accutane can cause Crohn's disease. In rendering a general causation opinion on the key question in this matter, he explained that he based his finding of a causal association on \"the pathogenesis and natural history of Crohn's disease, including the relevant intestinal anatomy on the macroscopic and cellular level,\" \"the pharmacology of Accutane and its metabolites,\" \"reports and assessments of Crohn's disease of acute gastrointestinal toxicity in patients treated with Accutane or its metabolites,\" and \"large clinical trials in patients with Crohn's disease evaluating the clinical benefits of blocking the mechanism of action of Accutane's metabolites.\" Further, in addition to his review of the scientific and medical literature, Dr. Kornbluth also looked to a number of other materials produced as part of the Accutane litigation, including defendants' internal animal studies and causality assessments, and post-marketing reports.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Dr. Kornbluth's testimony had two themes: explaining why he found the epidemiological studies unreliable and uninformative regarding the issue of causation, and explaining his reliance on other forms of evidence such as case reports, animal studies, causality assessments, and his biological mechanism hypothesis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   With regard to the epidemiological studies, Dr. Kornbluth explained that he would not rely on any study that did not provide separate data for Crohn's disease. As a result, he found the Fenerty and Rashtak studies -- both of which analyzed data for IBD generally and not for Crohn's disease specifically -- to be uninformative. As for the studies that did look specifically for Crohn's disease, Dr. Kornbluth stated that most of them, including the Alhusayen, Crockett, Etminan, and Racine studies, were fatally flawed because they did not account for Crohn's disease's\"prodrome,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   meaning the period between the onset of a disease's symptoms and its actual diagnosis. Dr. Kornbluth asserted that the median prodrome for Crohn's disease is roughly two-to-four years, and that the studies in question did not account for that period because they examined study subjects only for roughly one\n   year. Because they did not examine patient data for a sufficient period of time, Dr. Kornbluth argued that those studies missed patients whose prodromes were longer than the studies' observation periods, thus biasing the results towards a finding of no association between Accutane and Crohn's disease. Dr. Kornbluth based his opinion regarding the median prodromal period on two studies: a study by Pimentel et al.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   that contained 45 total subjects with Crohn's disease, and a study by Barratt et al.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   that contained 230 total subjects with Crohn's disease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Dr. Kornbluth detected other problems with the epidemiological studies. He asserted that the Crockett, Bernstein, and Etminan studies did not have enough patients and thus were \"underpowered,\" meaning that they were not properly designed to detect a statistically significant increased risk, even if such a risk actually existed, because the study size was simply too small. He asserted that the Alhusayen and Etminan studies did not adjust for certain confounders, such as family history and smoking. With regard to the Racine and Bernstein studies, he noted that those studies were performed in France and Canada, respectively, and that French and Canadian patients typically receive half the Accutane dosage that American patients receive. Moreover, he noted that the protective effect found in the Racine study's results lessened as the dosages increased, indicating a dose toxicity response. He was also dismissive of the meta-analysis that the Etminan authors performed, stating that it suffered from the same limitations as the studies that went into it and that a meta-analysis based on studies that did not perform an \"adequate analysis\" could not inform the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Dr. Kornbluth also noted that the Bernstein and Alhusayen studies both contained positive \"point estimates,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   indicating an increased risk. He admitted that the results of both studies were not regarded as \"statistically significant,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   but he intimated\n   that the lack of statistical significance was due to the studies' inherent flaws and biases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In the end, the Sivaraman study was the only study upon which Dr. Kornbluth was willing to rely. Even so, he disagreed with the study authors' conclusion. He explained that the study's unadjusted point estimate showed that \"patients with Crohn's disease were five times more likely to have taken Accutane than those who did not,\" and that the study's unadjusted results also showed a statistically significant increased risk. However, in explaining why he disagreed with the Sivaraman authors' conclusion that Accutane does not cause Crohn's disease, he noted that the Sivaraman authors reached their adjusted point estimate by subtracting out patients who had taken antibiotics; while that adjusted point estimate still showed a heightened risk, the smaller number of patients meant that the result lost statistical significance. Moreover,\n   he stated that he could not understand why the study authors had taken that step because \"antibiotics per se did not influence the likelihood of developing Crohn's disease.\" It was thus \"not clear\" to him why the authors made such an adjustment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Moving beyond the epidemiological studies, Dr. Kornbluth examined other lines of evidence that he found supported his causation opinion. He began by explaining why he believes it is biologically plausible for Accutane to cause Crohn's disease, although he had not published his causation theory or otherwise submitted it for peer review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   He then discussed case reports, studied by other researchers, that illustrate what he referred to as \"challenge/dechallenge/rechallenge,\" in which a patient was given Accutane and then developed a form of intestinal inflammation, which then ceased when Accutane use was discontinued and began again upon resumption of Accutane usage. He regarded that to be \"very compelling\" evidence of a causative effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   He discussed his reliance on MedWatch reports -- \"reports made by physicians, patients, [and] others to the FDA describing symptoms that they think were related to ingested medications.\" He noted the significant number of such reports relating to Crohn's disease and other gastrointestinal problems that correlated with the use of Accutane. Similarly, he testified that he relied on defendants' own internal materials, noting that defendants' scientists determined that Accutane should be contraindicated for individuals with certain gastrointestinal problems and expressed \"severe concerns about the likelihood of patients having exacerbations\n   of Crohn's disease or even developing it de novo.\" Dr. Kornbluth asserted that those assessments by defendants' scientists were supportive of a causal link between Accutane and Crohn's disease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Finally, Dr. Kornbluth relied on animal studies to support his theory of causation. He testified that defendants performed experimental tests with Accutane on dogs\n   and that those tests showed a temporal relationship between the administration of Accutane and gastrointestinal distress. Specifically, he noted a challenge/dechallenge relationship in that certain dogs given Accutane experienced gastrointestinal problems that ceased after cessation of Accutane administration. He also noted the indication of a dose toxicity curve, meaning that intestinal damage appeared more severe in dogs given higher doses of isotretinoin. However, he conceded that animal studies are meant only to generate hypotheses about a substance's effect on humans, and that a hypothesis is a \"supposition that is to be further tested.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Plaintiffs' Expert -- Dr. Madigan\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Plaintiffs' second expert, Dr. David Madigan, is a professor of statistics at Columbia University. Dr. Madigan did not give a causation opinion. Only Dr. Kornbluth opined on causation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Dr. Madigan's testimony and expert report focused solely on whether the epidemiological studies in question were appropriately designed to discover an association between Crohn's disease and Accutane, if such an association did in fact exist. He concluded in his expert report that, after accounting for the prodrome associated with Crohn's disease, the available epidemiological studies do not provide statistically reliable information regarding Accutane's causal relation to Crohn's disease. His testimony was consistent with his report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Dr. Madigan explained that he was tasked with examining the available epidemiological studies as they pertained to an association between Accutane and Crohn's disease. He analyzed six of the epidemiological studies: Bernstein, Crockett, Alhusayen, Etminan, Racine, and Sivaraman. He did not analyze the Rashtak and\n   Fenerty studies because they addressed only IBD and did not have separate results for Crohn's disease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Dr. Madigan noted that of the six studies he considered, only two -- Racine and the unadjusted Sivaraman results -- were statistically significant. Dr. Madigan performed a \"power analysis\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   of the four studies that were not statistically significant. He explained that his purpose in doing so was to \"shed some light\" on whether the studies were reliable evidence that there is truly no effect or whether the studies were simply insufficiently powered to discover an effect even if such an effect exists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Dr. Madigan then examined each study's statistical power to detect a fifty percent increased risk; he chose fifty percent because he considered it to be \"an authentically important increased risk.\" He calculated the power for each of the four studies as follows: Bernstein -- 37.8 percent; Crockett -- 18.2 percent; Alhusayen -- 89.4 percent; Etminan -- 22.6 percent. Thus, for example, if there is a fifty percent increased risk of developing Crohn's disease for Accutane users, the probability that the Bernstein study would find a statistically significant result is 37.8 percent. It was thus \"less likely than not\" that most of the studies would find an increased risk if such a risk did in fact exist. Dr. Madigan concluded that this was \"more an absence of evidence than anything.\" After accounting for the median prodromal period, which he derived from the Pimentel and Barratt studies, he determined that the power for three of the four studies had further decreased: Crockett diminished to\n   5.12 percent; Alhusayen diminished to 36.2 percent; and Etminan diminished to 4.5 percent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   According to Dr. Madigan, four of the six studies -- Crockett, Alhusayen, Etminan, and Racine -- were totally unusable because they failed to account for Crohn's disease's prodrome. He explained that by failing to account for the prodrome, the studies were failing to observe cases of Crohn's disease that developed\n   outside of the studies' observation period. In other words, the studies' failure to take account of the prodrome \"biased [the studies] towards the null,\" meaning the studies were systematically biased in favor of not finding any effect. Dr. Madigan therefore concluded that those studies had an overriding flaw and that he was reluctant to refer to their results as \"findings.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   As for the remaining two studies, he explained that questionnaire-based studies such as Sivaraman are immune from the prodrome issue because they ask patients when their symptoms began and, thus, have \"no limit going backwards in time.\" He also explained that there was a \"diminished concern\" for the Bernstein study due to its lengthy observation period. However, Dr. Madigan found other flaws in the Bernstein study, and he declined to rely on its findings. He stated that the study did not adjust for \"unmeasured confounders\" and it was performed in Canada rather than the United States, which created a problem as to \"generalizability\" due to differences in population and the lower dosage given to Canadian patients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Accordingly, for Dr. Madigan, the Sivaraman study remained as the only study on which he was willing to rely, but with caveats. He did not agree with its conclusion. He pointed to the study's\n   <em>\n    unadjusted\n   </em>\n   results as showing a statistically significant increased risk of Crohn's disease for people taking Accutane. Although he acknowledged that the study's authors felt it necessary to adjust for antibiotic exposure, and that their adjusted results did not show a statistically significant increased risk for Crohn's disease, Dr. Madigan disputed that they actually performed an adjustment. He claimed that they actually performed a \"subgroup analysis.\" He asserted that the adjusted figure from that analysis still showed an increased risk, even though it was no longer statistically significant due to the smaller number of patients. Accordingly, he chose to rely on the unadjusted results because a study based on a larger group of people will provide a \"better estimate.\" He further explained that he did not understand why the study authors chose to adjust for antibiotic exposure because the study\n   authors admitted in the study's abstract that \"antibiotic exposure was not associated with Crohn's disease.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In sum, Dr. Madigan found the Sivaraman study to be \"evidence of a strong association between Accutane and Crohn's disease,\" discounting all of the other studies on the basis that they \"represented an absence of evidence\" from which one cannot draw any definitive conclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Dr. Madigan also took the position that a meta-analysis of the studies would be improper. He stated he did not perform a meta-analysis because most of the studies on which the meta-analysis would be based did not account for prodrome, which would render the meta-analysis both misleading and scientifically unreasonable. That is so, he explained, because a meta-analysis will inherit the flaws, biases, and structural problems of the studies upon which it is based.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   In addition, Dr. Madigan performed a disproportionality analysis using the FDA's spontaneous reporting system database. He explained that a disproportionality analysis is a method of studying a spontaneous\n   report database and reviewing the observed rate for a particular drug and a particular adverse event. The observed rate is compared with the rate at which Crohn's disease was reported for other drugs in the database. Analyzing the available data beginning in 1997, Dr. Madigan's results showed a \"striking signal of disproportionality\" indicative of a \"strong association\" between Accutane and Crohn's disease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Defendants' Expert -- Dr. Oliva-Hemker\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Defendants' expert Dr. Maria Oliva-Hemker is a Professor of Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Chief of the Division of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Her testimony focused on disputing Dr. Kornbluth's testimony and explaining why epidemiological studies are preferred to case reports and animal studies in the hierarchy of evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   During the\n   <em>\n    Kemp\n   </em>\n   hearing, she stated that the available scientific evidence does not support any causal association between Accutane and Crohn's disease. Regarding Dr. Kornbluth's testimony on biological mechanism, she explained that Crohn's disease is idiopathic, meaning that its cause is unknown, and that any theory regarding a biological mechanism was therefore unreliable. Moreover, she stated that scientists would not ignore the available epidemiological evidence in favor of a hypothesis about a biological mechanism.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   She also addressed plaintiffs' experts' opinions concerning the prodrome for Crohn's disease. Although admitting that \"the diagnosis time can vary\" and that there are some patients who are not diagnosed for several years, she stated that most patients are typically diagnosed within a year. She based that conclusion on a number of population-based studies, all of which concluded that the median prodrome is under one year. She was dismissive of plaintiffs' experts' use of the Pimentel study for determining the median prodrome for Crohn's disease, explaining that the study was very small and not representative of the average prodromal period, especially in light of the other, larger studies on the issue. She added that the authors of the epidemiological studies would have been aware of the available published data on the median prodromal period and would have accounted for it in designing their studies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   She also discussed the recognized hierarchy of evidence and that certain types of data are meant to \"generate hypotheses,\" whereas other, more reliable forms of evidence are meant to \"test hypotheses.\" She stated that the epidemiological studies are currently the best available data on the issue of Accutane and Crohn's disease and that, from a medical-evidence point of view, Dr. Kornbluth's reliance on case reports and animal studies, which are considered lower forms of evidence, was inconsistent with recognized methodology. Concerning case reports, she testified that they are hypothesis-generating in nature and are \"in the bottom tier of medical evidence.\" She explained that case reports are\n   subject to \"publication bias,\" meaning that only correlative events are reported and that the reports are subjective in nature, often contain incomplete information, and do not account for random chance. Further, she stated that such reports are difficult to interpret because Crohn's disease is a \"relapsing and a remitting condition,\" and thus \"the natural course of the disease may be mistaken for the results of removing or reintroducing the medication.\" She also cited to an article\n   by Reddy et al.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   for the proposition that epidemiological evidence is needed to confirm the inference of causality generated by a case report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Finally, Dr. Oliva-Hemker addressed Dr. Kornbluth's interpretation of defendants' animal studies. She stated that animal studies may sometimes be important for \"generating certain hypotheses,\" but that they are typically considered below human studies in the hierarchy of medical evidence. She noted that it is difficult to extrapolate data from animals to humans because of differences in metabolism, absorption, and other factors. Moreover, she testified that she would not rely on dog studies in this instance because dogs cannot get IBD and because recent research has shown that dogs may have hypersensitive gastrointestinal tracts that can result in distress owing more to the dog's anatomy than to the actual toxicity of the substance under observation. In sum, her testimony concluded that the animal studies are simply not sufficient generally for forming a conclusion about causation here both because of the nature of the disease at issue and because they are merely \"hypothesis-generating data.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   In contrast to the case reports and animal studies, she testified that the epidemiological studies are the best available evidence on the issue of Accutane's relation to Crohn's disease. Moreover, she testified that it would be entirely proper to consider a meta-analysis of the studies when such analysis is available. She explained that researchers now have access to the types of \"hypothesis\n   testing\" epidemiological studies that were sought for testing the viability of adverse event case reports and that those studies have all reached similar findings of no causal effect despite variations in populations, time, and data sets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Defendants' Expert -- Dr. Goodman\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Defendants' second expert, Dr. Steven Goodman, is a Professor of Medicine and Health Research and Policy and Associate Dean for Clinical and Translational Research at Stanford University, where he serves as Chief of the Division of Epidemiology and co-director of Stanford's Meta-Research Innovation Center. Dr. Goodman's testimony focused on why the epidemiologic evidence is the best available evidence on the question of Accutane's causal relation to Crohn's disease and why a meta-analysis was a proper way of pooling those study results to reach a conclusion that Accutane does not cause Crohn's disease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Dr. Goodman stated, during the\n   <em>\n    Kemp\n   </em>\n   hearing and in his expert report, that the epidemiological evidence pertaining to the causal relationship between Accutane and Crohn's disease is as strongly negative as epidemiologic evidence can be, and that there was no biological evidence, including a causal mechanism or otherwise, to contravene that evidence. He stated that the methods Doctors Madigan and Kornbluth used were flawed because they put almost no weight on the epidemiologic evidence and instead relied heavily on the much lesser forms of evidence, which is not how any scientific body would have proceeded. Dr. Goodman emphasized that there is now a consistent body of epidemiological evidence all pointing towards no causal association between Accutane and Crohn's disease and that the weighing of that body of evidence through use of meta-analysis also strongly supported the lack of any association or causal effect between Accutane and Crohn's disease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Dr. Goodman discussed the hierarchy of medical evidence, stating that observational\n   studies are second only to randomized controlled trials in terms of establishing causality. Like Dr. Oliva-Hemker, he explained that epidemiologic studies are a hypothesis-testing\n   form of evidence, which is a higher form of evidence than hypothesis-generating data, such as case reports and animal studies. Moreover, hypothesis-generating evidence is typically used more for developing ideas to later be examined through epidemiological evidence. Accordingly, he was dismissive of any reliance on case reports here, which he stated are almost never used as a basis for a scientific determination of causality. As support for that proposition, Dr. Goodman cited the\n   <em>\n    Reference Manual\n   </em>\n   , which states that case reports are \"at the bottom of the evidence hierarchy\" and must later be \"confirmed with larger, more controlled epidemiological studies.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   For similar reasons, Dr. Goodman was also dismissive of Dr. Kornbluth's interpretation of animal studies, explaining that such studies are hypothesis-generating in nature and that it is difficult to extrapolate results from animal studies to determine the effect a given substance will have on a human subject. Moreover, he believed that the specific animal studies discussed in this matter were essentially meaningless because dogs do not develop IBD. He also took issue with Dr. Kornbluth's invocation of the Hill criteria in assessing the causal relationship between Accutane and Crohn's disease because the studies here showed no strength of association, and so there was no \"association\" in need of study.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   After reviewing all of the epidemiologic evidence, Dr. Goodman stated that none of the studies showed a statistically significant increased risk of developing Crohn's disease from use of Accutane. In addition to his belief that each study contained reasonable results, he also noted the importance of the fact that all of the studies were concordant with each other -- that all of the studies produced consistent results pointing in the same direction was strong evidence that those results are reliable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   With regard to the Sivaraman study, he stated that the study should be interpreted according to its adjusted numbers, and that it was proper for the study authors to adjust for antibiotics. He explained that the adjusted number is always better because it tends to be less biased and therefore more reliable. Moreover, he\n   found the Sivaraman study to be insignificant for purposes of his meta-analysis and in the overall scheme of evidence because of its small size.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   He also explained the methodology of the meta-analysis he performed, describing how smaller and more imprecise studies are given less weight whereas larger and more precise studies are given more weight. He further stated that a meta-analysis is a way to increase precision by pooling studies that address the same question. Moreover, meta-analysis is useful where there is a question about whether independent studies are large enough to detect an effect size. Accordingly, he criticized Dr. Madigan's refusal to perform a meta-analysis of the studies despite arguing that most of the studies were underpowered because meta-analysis was \"in a sense invented\" to address power concerns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   He then went through the results of his meta-analysis, which he performed for both IBD and Crohn's disease. For IBD, the meta-analysis resulted in a relative risk indicative of a protective effect, but with a statistically insignificant confidence interval. For Crohn's disease, the meta-analysis again returned a relative risk indicative of a protective effect, with a non-statistically significant confidence interval.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Dr. Goodman interpreted those results as consistent with \"no effect.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Finally, Dr. Goodman turned his attention to the criticisms levied against the epidemiological studies -- specifically the prodrome issue on which plaintiffs' experts chiefly relied in disregarding the studies. Dr. Goodman criticized plaintiffs' experts' reliance on the Pimentel and Barratt studies for determining a median prodrome length of at least two-to-four years because of the studies' small size and because the Pimentel study's population was taken from patients who gastroenterologists found difficult to manage and diagnose. Dr. Goodman felt that a study by Chouraki et al.,\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   which contained 7409 subjects with Crohn's disease and\n   found a median prodrome of under a year, was much more reliable. Moreover, he stated that every population-based prodrome study -- which are the studies he believed most reliable -- found a prodrome of nine months or less. He thus concluded that the best available evidence on the issue consistently pointed towards a median prodrome of less than a year, which justified the epidemiological studies' use of a one-year observation period. Thus, in his opinion, none of the epidemiological studies were invalid due to a prodrome issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   After the\n   <em>\n    Kemp\n   </em>\n   hearing, the trial court issued an order granting defendants' omnibus motion to bar plaintiffs' experts from testifying on, among other things, whether the epidemiological studies on which the defense relied were flawed and unreliable and whether Accutane can cause Crohn's disease. The trial court also directed the parties to prepare an order listing the lawsuits affected by the ruling, and subsequently issued a May 8, 2015 order dismissing 2076 affected claims with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   In its decision concerning the exclusion of plaintiffs' expert witnesses, the trial court examined the expert testimony and scientific studies, laid out the relevant standard for the admission of expert witness testimony, and determined that plaintiffs' experts' testimony did not meet the applicable standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The trial court stated that\n   <em>\n    Rubanick\n   </em>\n   governed the admissibility of expert witness testimony in toxic tort cases in New Jersey. The court regarded the\n   <em>\n    Rubanick\n   </em>\n   standard, which it understood to be more flexible in assessing medical causation expert testimony than the \"general acceptance\" test of\n   <em>\n    Frye\n   </em>\n   otherwise traditionally used in New Jersey courts, as requiring an expert opinion to be based on a \"sound, adequately-founded scientific methodology involving data of the type reasonably relied on by experts in the scientific field.\" (citing\n   <em>\n    Rubanick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"333371\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/125/421/#p447\">\n    125 N.J. at 449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"333371\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/125/421/#p447\">\n    593 A.2d 733\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Thus, to fulfill its duty as gatekeeper, the trial court considered \"whether\n   other scientists in the field [are] using similar methodologies in forming their opinions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The trial court applied that standard and found plaintiffs' experts' testimony lacking.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   Focusing on the epidemiological studies, the trial court concluded that \"there is no epidemiological evidence to justify a reasonable inference that there is a causal link between isotretinoin and [Crohn's disease ].\" Nor did the court believe that there was any rational basis for\n   plaintiffs to resist the findings of all the epidemiological studies and to rely instead on case reports and animal studies, which the trial court determined were seriously flawed and a less reliable form of evidence than the epidemiological studies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The trial court viewed Dr. Kornbluth and Dr. Madigan as \"self-validating expert[s]\" who were unwilling to subject their ideas for evaluation in the scientific community, either through peer review submission or through the scrutiny of the process of publication in scientific literature. Specifically regarding Dr. Kornbluth, the trial court stated that he \"want[ed] to have it both ways\" by rejecting the best available evidence as flawed and yet relying on inferior forms of evidence. As for Dr. Madigan, the trial court viewed his refusal to perform a meta-analysis and to instead rely on the Sivaraman study for causation and the Pimentel and Barratt studies for median prodrome, to the exclusion of all other studies, as an attempt to explain away the body of evidence on causation and on the median prodromal period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The trial court therefore determined that plaintiffs' experts' examination of the evidence was a \"conclusion-driven\" attempt to cherry-pick evidence supportive of their opinion while dismissing other, better forms of evidence that did not support their opinion. The trial court believed that such a \"stratagem cannot bridge the analytical gaps inherent in Plaintiffs' hypothesis.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Plaintiffs appealed and the Appellate Division reversed, holding that plaintiffs may present the experts' testimony at trial.\n   <em>\n    In re Accutane Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12300241\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/451/153/#p163\">\n    451 N.J.

Defendants assert that the acceptance of such \"internally-inconsistent\" and \"outcome-driven\" testimony robs the expert witness standard of its vitality.

Doctors Madigan and Kornbluth were thus forced to use an inconsistent methodology whereby they \"concocted\" a theory on Crohn's disease's prodrome and selectively applied that theory to evidence that did not support their viewpoints. They did the same for their theories on study power, applying it where necessary to refute the evidence, but then ignoring it for the studies upon which they relied. Defendants argue that the experts' \"contradictory methodology\" should not be allowed to be advanced before a jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that the Appellate Division appropriately employed\n   <em>\n    Rubanick\n   </em>\n   's relaxed admissibility standard in this matter and properly assessed the reliability of plaintiffs' experts' methodology. Plaintiffs cite to the\n   <em>\n    Reference Manual\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that \"epidemiology alone cannot prove causation,\" and contend that defendants have falsely categorized the nature of the expert testimony due to their erroneous belief that the epidemiological studies alone should be considered to the exclusion of all other evidence. According to plaintiffs, epidemiological studies \"are not the be all and end all of causation evidence,\" but rather \"one component of multiple lines of evidence that inform the causation issue.\" Thus, by considering all of the evidence in addition to the epidemiology, plaintiffs argue their experts employed a methodology based on sound scientific principles accepted in the scientific community. They further argue that the Appellate Division correctly found that their experts did not ignore the epidemiology, but rather examined the data with proper consideration of the strengths and limitations of the design of each of the studies,\n   together with study biases. Accordingly, the Appellate Division properly held that the trial court exceeded its gatekeeping function in excluding the expert testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Furthermore, plaintiffs argue that the\n   <em>\n    Reference Manual\n   </em>\n   does not endorse a \"strict application\" of the hierarchy of evidence. In fact, the\n   <em>\n    Reference Manual\n   </em>\n   does not suggest that epidemiological studies are \"beyond scientific criticism\" or that \"no countervailing evidence should be considered.\" Plaintiffs thus contend that their experts did not stray from any \"core scientific principles,\" but simply considered all of the evidence in forming their opinions. Plaintiffs posit that their experts merely viewed the epidemiological studies differently than defendants' experts, and that doing so is not improper because the \"implications of a study are open to debate.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Plaintiffs also dispute the \"key guidelines\" identified by defendants for examining expert testimony. Plaintiffs note that the law does not require that experts submit their opinions for peer review in order to be admissible. Plaintiffs also take issue\n   with defendants' arguments concerning scientific consensus, arguing that consensus is not required in toxic tort cases and that, by arguing the issue, defendants are seeking to take New Jersey back to the \"general acceptance\" standard. Furthermore, plaintiffs contend that defendants' argument for abandoning\n   <em>\n    Rubanick\n   </em>\n   's relaxed standard is at odds with this Court's interpretation of the trial court's gatekeeping role and would allow a trial court to usurp the role of the jury and determine for itself whether to accept an expert's opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Plaintiffs also argue that the Appellate Division gave appropriate deference to the trial court, explaining that \"less deference is owed to a trial court when the issue is the admissibility of expert proofs.\" They claim that the trial court failed to adhere to the principles expounded in\n   <em>\n    Rubanick\n   </em>\n   , which provided \"well-founded support for the level of review that the Appellate Division employed.\" Thus, because the trial court substituted its judgment for that of the jury and improperly weighed the evidence, the Appellate\n   Division properly reversed by applying a standard of review \"long recognized by this Court.\" Finally, plaintiffs argue that there is no reason to import the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   standard into New Jersey law and note that this Court has previously declined to adopt the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Amici curiae Industry Associations, the Academics, and DRI argue that New Jersey's expert witness standard is in need of clarification and urge this Court to join the majority of other states by adopting the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   standard to ensure meaningful judicial gatekeeping and that only reliable and reliably applied expert testimony enters New Jersey's courts. Similarly, amici curiae NJCJI and the Medical Associations argue that the Appellate Division reached an incorrect decision even under existing New Jersey law, but maintain that adoption of the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   standard will provide helpful guidance and ensure meaningful and robust gatekeeping in New Jersey trial courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Specifically, the Industry Associations and the Academics maintain that although\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   and the current standard are somewhat similar,\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   provides \"concrete guidelines\" and a more fulsome analysis that ensures that the expert's methodology is reliable and applied in a way that \"fits\" the facts of a case. Both contend that plaintiffs' experts' testimony would not have withstood that more thorough analysis. Moreover, both argue that tying New Jersey closer to the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   standard would discourage forum shopping. Finally, the Academics assert that the Appellate Division should have applied a pure abuse of discretion standard in reviewing the trial court's ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   The Medical Associations argue that the Appellate Division incorrectly applied New Jersey's expert witness standard by ignoring the hierarchy of evidence and the unanimity of epidemiological evidence in favor of plaintiffs' experts' \"un-vetted postulations.\" They point to a scientific consensus in the medical literature that Accutane does not cause Crohn's disease, and argue that\n   plaintiffs' experts were forced to invert the hierarchy of scientific evidence to overcome the scientific consensus on the issue by relying on inferior forms of evidence such as case reports and animal studies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   NJCJI similarly argues that the Appellate Division permitted plaintiffs' experts to present their unsubstantiated \"outlier viewpoint\" without any meaningful judicial scrutiny or investigation of their methodology. NJCJI claims that the Appellate Division's decision improperly left the question\n   of methodological soundness to the jury while limiting the trial court's gatekeeping function \"to exclude only the most extreme and obvious forms of junk science.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   NJCJI and DRI emphasize that robust gatekeeping is necessary because juries struggle to absorb complex scientific concepts and are poorly equipped to assess methodological soundness. Both amici express the concern that juries may be misled by highly-qualified experts who offer opinions that are not supported by the wider scientific community and that juries faced with complex scientific evidence may simply \"fall back\" on an expert's credentials as a basis for evaluating the testimony at issue. To guard against that risk, DRI argues that experts should be required to prove not only that their methodology is sound, but that such methodology is reliably applied to the facts of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Finally, amicus curiae Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America submitted a brief detailing the scientific principles at issue here and arguing that the trial court correctly excluded plaintiffs' experts' testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Amici curiae NJAJ, ICC, and Kanner argue that this Court should not adopt the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   standard because the current New Jersey standard is well-settled and strikes an appropriate balance between proper judicial gatekeeping and the admission of novel scientific concepts. NJAJ claims that the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   standard is a \"patchwork\" of case law that has been applied inconsistently by both state and federal courts. NJAJ and Kanner further contend\n   that the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   standard requires judges who are unfamiliar with scientific principles to make scientific judgments outside of their area of expertise. NJAJ and ICC argue that\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   imposes undue and unnecessary burdens on courts and litigants by encouraging frivolous challenges to expert witness testimony. Both ICC and Kanner claim that adoption of the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   standard will lead to unjust results because it will result in the exclusion of reliable evidence, which will bar access to justice for innocent victims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   The NJAJ further argues that New Jersey's expert witness standard does not require any clarification or correction and that state trial courts have reliably applied it for many decades. NJAJ contends that defendants have provided no substantive reason why this Court should abandon the expert witness standards that it pioneered and \"which continue to fairly promote just results.\" Furthermore, NJAJ disputes that New Jersey's current expert witness standard promotes the filing of cases in New Jersey by out-of-state plaintiffs, arguing that there is no evidence to support such an assertion. Finally, NJAJ, ICC, and Kanner maintain that the Appellate Division here applied the proper standard and properly found that the trial court exceeded its gatekeeping role by excluding plaintiffs' experts based on nothing more than personal disagreements as to their conclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Our Court was in the vanguard of courts to be persuaded that adherence to the\n   <em>\n    Frye\n   </em>\n   general acceptance standard as the sole test for assessing reliability of scientific expert testimony was unsatisfactorily constricting for fairly assessing reliability in certain areas of novel or emerging fields of science.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   <em>\n    Rubanick\n   </em>\n   marked the broadening of our standard, when this Court concluded that resort to a methodology-based standard would be appropriate for assessing reliability with respect to emerging scientific theory on causation in toxic tort litigation.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"333371\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/125/421/#p447\">\n    125 N.J. at 454\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"333371\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/125/421/#p447\">\n    593 A.2d 733\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It is clear that case reports are \"at the bottom of the\n   evidence hierarchy,\"\n   <em>\n    Reference Manual\n   </em>\n   at 724, and other courts have been skeptical of their value in proving causation,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Allison v.

Cal. 1995) ) ). And while animal studies may be helpful in \"framing hypotheses,\" the\n   <em>\n    Reference Manual\n   </em>\n   intimates that such evidence is far less probative in the face of a \"substantial body of epidemiologic evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 563, 564-65, 564 n.48. Such was the case here; initial animal studies may have suggested a possible causal connection between Accutane and Crohn's disease, but since that time a uniform body of epidemiological evidence has dispelled any such theory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Siharath\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11140423\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/131/1347/#p1361\">\n    131 F.Supp.2d at 1366-68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining why court viewed animal studies with suspicion in absence of confirmatory epidemiological studies and adding generally that extrapolation to humans is \"not considered reliable in the absence of a credible scientific explanation of why such extrapolation is warranted\"). Thus, we do not mean to suggest that animal studies and case reports can never be relied upon for forming an opinion on causation, but we find ample support for the trial court's determination that it was not proper to do so here in light of the uniform body of epidemiological evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   As for the one study on which they did rely -- Sivaraman -- plaintiffs' experts disagreed with the authors' ultimate conclusions\n   and instead focused on unadjusted results. In so doing, plaintiffs' experts dismissed published studies examining thousands of subjects as underpowered and biased in favor of relying on portions of a single unpublished study that examined 509 total subjects.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   In explaining their reasoning for disregarding the results of so many epidemiological studies that consistently failed to show an association between Accutane and Crohn's disease, plaintiffs' experts asserted that the prodrome for Crohn's disease is two years or more. They based that assessment on two smaller studies, Pimentel and Barratt, even though there were other larger studies, such as Chouraki, which had found a much shorter median prodromal period -- a median of approximately less than one year. Thus, despite their expressed concerns regarding study power -- which is based in part on the size of the study at issue -- in rejecting the epidemiological studies, plaintiffs' experts were willing to ignore any such concern when relying on the Pimentel and Barratt studies to form their opinion as to the median prodromal period. Moreover, as the trial court observed, plaintiffs' experts could have performed a meta-analysis to account for the power issue but refused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   The many contradictions in the experts' methodology were not lost on the trial court, which concluded that experts in the scientific community would not accept as consistent with scientific norms a methodology such as that used by plaintiffs' experts. In particular, the court found the methodology unsound because it relied on Sivaraman and Pimentel to the exclusion of other evidence. The trustworthiness of plaintiffs' experts' methodology was further undermined by internal inconsistencies, including the experts' refusal to examine the Rashtak and Fenerty studies on the ground that those studies did not report specific data for\n   Crohn's disease while Dr. Kornbluth tethered his own causation opinion to case reports not specific to Crohn's disease and to studies performed on animals incapable of having any form of irritable bowel disease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   The trial court reasoned that the overall approach taken by Dr. Kornbluth -- rejecting the evidence from the epidemiological studies, which all found no causal association, and proffering his own alternative opinion that a causal association was present based on lesser forms of evidence -- was based on an unsound methodology. That conclusion comports with the decisions of many other courts that experts cannot selectively choose lower forms of evidence in the face of a large body of uniform epidemiological evidence.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re\n   </em>\n   Lipitor,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517254\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/892/624/#p634\">\n    892 F.3d 624\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 634 (4th Cir. 2018) (\"Result-driven analysis, or cherry-picking, undermines principles of the scientific method and is a quintessential example of applying methodologies (valid or otherwise) in an unreliable fashion.\");\n   <em>\n    Allison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11549647\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/184/1300/#p1316\">\n    184 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1316 ;\n   <em>\n    Freeman v.

The trial court found it to be demonstrably contrary to the recognized hierarchy of evidence in the\n   <em>\n    Reference Manual\n   </em>\n   and accepted generally in the scientific community. Indeed, even plaintiffs' experts acknowledged the scientific community's acceptance of a hierarchy of evidence, but they deviated from it. Moreover, as the court noted and found to be compelling, Dr. Kornbluth never submitted his ideas concerning biological mechanism or Accutane's relation to Crohn's disease for peer review or publication. In fact, he previously expressed concern, in an e-mail to a colleague admitted into the record in this matter, about any connection between Accutane and Crohn's disease\n   after the Bernstein study, the first of the epidemiological studies, was published in 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   Finally, it bears noting that Dr. Kornbluth organized his testimony to support his personal view that a causal association existed\n   between Accutane and Crohn's disease through use of the Hill guidelines. However, those guidelines are invoked only after an association between an agent and a particular disease has been determined to be present; their pointed purpose is to determine whether a detected association reflects true causality, it is not to create an association that has not already been detected through appropriate studies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reference Manual\n   </em>\n   at 598-99 (explaining that Hill \"guidelines are employed only\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   a study finds an association to determine whether that association reflects a true causal relationship\"). Here, not one of the epidemiological studies found any statistically significant association between Accutane and Crohn's disease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   In sum, the trial court explained its reasons for concluding that plaintiffs' experts deviated from core scientific principles and strayed from their own claimed methodology in order to reach their conclusions. That the trial court deemed their testimony to be unreliable and excluded it from being presented is unsurprising. Ample evidence in the record supports that conclusion. Applying the abuse of discretion standard and the principles of\n   <em>\n    Rubanick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Landrigan\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Kemp\n   </em>\n   , we conclude that the trial court's determination is unassailable. The Appellate Division judgment, reversing the trial court's exclusion of the expert testimony, is reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   VII.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   The divergent outcomes reached by the Appellate Division and the trial court in this matter provoked the debate among the parties and amici over whether our case law on the gatekeeping function is in need of clarification. Further, we are asked to consider adopting the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   standard, or to at least incorporate use of its factors, as a means to bring greater consistency to the gatekeeping function.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   First, in respect of the gatekeeping role, we emphasize that we expect the trial court to assess both the methodology used by the expert to arrive at an opinion and the underlying data used\n   in the formation of the opinion. That will ensure that the expert is adhering to norms accepted by fellow members of the pertinent scientific community. Methodology, in all its parts, is the focus of the reliability assessment, not outcome.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Clark v.

In this basic goal, there is not much light between our standard and that which has developed in the federal sphere under\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   's initial instruction. Our law moved first, but in the same direction and with the same general goal as that noted by the Supreme Court in its\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   trilogy. Both lines of initial decisions recognized the drawback of limiting expert testimony exclusively through the filter of general acceptance.
