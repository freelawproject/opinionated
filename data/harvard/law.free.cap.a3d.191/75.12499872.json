In doing so, the trial court affirmed the determination of the Office of Open Records (OOR) that the recording, which depicts a school teacher roughly disciplining a student on the school bus, was disclosable. The School District contends that the video is an exempt public record because its disclosure will lead to a loss of federal funding; provides information on discipline, demotion or discharge of an agency employee; and was admitted as evidence at an arbitration proceeding. For the following reasons, we affirm the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On February 21, 2017, Rudy Miller, on behalf of The Express Times (Requester), submitted a written request to the School District, which stated in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   As per Pennsylvania's right-to-know law I'm requesting information in connection with an incident on a school bus outside Paxinosa Elementary School, which is temporarily located in the rear of Easton Area Middle School in Forks Township. It's come to my attention that elementary school teacher Aaron Dufour disciplined a child roughly on a school bus in front of the school on the morning of Feb. 8, 2017; Feb. 9, 2017; or Feb. 10, 2017. It's my understanding he grabbed a child and \"slammed\" him down in a bus seat. It's my understanding that Mr. Dufour has either been suspended or terminated as a result of this incident.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   It's my understanding that each school bus is outfitted with a security camera. I would like a copy of the surveillance video if any exists that captured this incident involving Mr. Dufour on the school bus in front of Paxinosa Elementary School on either Feb. 8, Feb. 9 or Feb. 10, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Reproduced Record at 9a (R.R. __). The written request also sought information about Dufour's employment status and his annual salary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The School District denied the request for the stated reason that disclosure of the video would imperil federal funding and, thus, it was exempt under Section 708(b)(1)(i) of the Right-to-Know Law, 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.708(b)(1)(i). Requester appealed to the OOR. The School District contended that disclosure of the video would violate the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (Privacy Act), 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g, and, therefore, result in a loss of federal funding. Alternatively, the School District argued that the video recording was exempt under Section 708(b)(7)(viii) of the Right-to-Know Law, 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.708(b)(7)(viii), because the video was used \"in the pending action to discipline, demote or discharge [ ] Dufour.\" R.R. 15a. In support, the School District submitted an affidavit of John Castrovinci, its human resources director and open records officer, which stated that Dufour was the subject of a disciplinary proceeding pending with the School Board and that the video had been admitted into evidence in that proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    OOR's Final Determination\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On May 24, 2017, the OOR issued a final determination partially granting Requester's appeal. It held that the exemption under Section 708(b)(1)(i) of the Right-to-Know Law was inapplicable because the video was not an \"education record\" within the meaning of the federal Privacy Act. The OOR did not address whether the exemption under Section 708(b)(7)(viii) of the Right-to-Know Law for information concerning employee discipline applied to\n   the video recording. On the other hand, the OOR held that Requester's questions about Dufour's employment status and salary, which were not put in the form of document requests, did not have to be answered by the School District.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Trial Court Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The School District appealed to the trial court, again relying on Sections 708(b)(1)(i) and 708(b)(7)(viii) of the Right-to-Know Law. The trial court affirmed the OOR and held that the video recording is not an \"education record\" for purposes of the federal Privacy Act. In so holding, the trial court relied upon a New York trial court decision,\n   <em>\n    Rome City School District Disciplinary Hearing v. Grifasi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"87904\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/misc-3d/10/1034/\">\n    10 Misc.3d 1034\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"87904\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/misc-3d/10/1034/\">\n    806 N.Y.S.2d 381\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005). In\n   <em>\n    Grifasi\n   </em>\n   , a school district video camera captured images of students involved in an altercation along with bystanders. A student who was suspended for the incident subpoenaed the school district for copies of the video recordings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court rejected the school district's argument that the videotape was an educational record protected by the Privacy Act, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [The Privacy Act] is intended to protect records relating to an individual student's performance. [It] is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   meant to apply to records, such as the videotape in question which was recorded to maintain the physical security and safety of the school building and which does not pertain to the educational performance of the students captured on this tape....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 383 (internal citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Relying on the\n   <em>\n    Grifasi\n   </em>\n   analysis, the trial court concluded that because the video sought by Requester did not concern any student's academic performance, it was not an educational record. Accordingly, disclosure of the video would not jeopardize the School District's federal funding under the Privacy Act, and the School District did not prove an exemption under Section 708(b)(1)(i) of the Right-to-Know Law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The trial court also rejected the School District's argument that the video recording was exempt from disclosure under Section 708(b)(7)(viii) of the Right-to-Know Law as \" 'information regarding' discipline, demotion or discharge [of Dufour].\" Trial Ct. Op. 12/1/2017, at 6 (citing 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.708(b)(7)(viii) ); R.R. 49a. In so ruling, the trial court found that \"no final action resulting in demotion or discharge has occurred.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The School District appealed to this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In this appeal, the School District presents three issues for our consideration. The School District first argues that the trial court erred in ruling that the video recording is not exempt from disclosure under Section 708(b)(1)(i) of the Right-to-Know Law (loss of federal funding). Second, the School District argues that the trial court erred in holding that Section 708(b)(7)(viii) of the Right-to-Know\n   Law (employee discipline) does not apply to the video. Finally, the School District argues that the video is exempt from disclosure under Section 708(b)(8)(ii) of the Right-to-Know Law (arbitration evidence), 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.708(b)(8)(ii). We address these issues\n   <em>\n    seriatim\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Loss of Federal Funding Exemption\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The School District argues that the trial court erred in holding that the video was not exempt because the Privacy Act prohibits disclosure of a student's education records without parental consent. The School District contends that because the video depicts students on the school bus during the school day, it is an \"education record.\" The School District argues that the trial court erred in holding that the Privacy Act protects only those records that relate to a student's academic performance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Right-to-Know Law requires state and local agencies to provide access to public records upon request. Section 302 of the Right-to-Know Law, 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.302 (\"A local agency shall provide public records in accordance with this act.\"). Section 102 of the Right-to-Know Law defines a \"public record\" as a\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   record, including a financial record, of a Commonwealth or local agency that: (1) is not exempt under section 708[, 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.708 ]; (2) is not exempt from being disclosed under any other Federal or State law or regulation or judicial order or decree; or (3) is not protected by a privilege.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   65 P.S. \u00a7 67.102. A \"record\" is further defined under the Right-to-Know Law as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Information, regardless of physical form or characteristics, that documents a transaction or activity of an agency and that is created, received or retained pursuant to law or in connection with a transaction, business or activity of the agency. The term includes a document, paper, letter, map, book, tape, photograph, film or sound recording, information stored or maintained electronically and a data-processed or image-processed document.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The burden of proving that a \"record\" is exempt from public access is placed on the \"local agency receiving a request by a preponderance of the evidence.\" Section 708(a)(1) of the Right-to-Know Law, 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.708(a)(1).

Here, the School District argues that the Privacy Act forbids disclosure of the video recording without first obtaining the consent of the parents of all students on the bus that appear in the video.

By contrast, here, the video depicts a teacher's alleged misconduct.

In the context of photos and videos, determining if a visual representation of a student is\n   <em>\n    directly\n   </em>\n   related to a student (rather than just incidentally related to him or her) is often context-specific, and educational agencies and institutions should examine certain types of photos and videos on a case by case basis to determine if they directly relate to any of the students depicted therein.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    FAQs on Photos and Videos under FERPA\n   </em>\n   , U.S. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ,\n   <em>\n    https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/faq/faqs-photos-and-videos-under-ferpa\n   </em>\n   (last visited June 12, 2018) (emphasis in original).

It is only an educational record with respect to a student in the video for whom the video may have consequences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Because the video recording sought by Requester is not an \"education record\" for purposes of the Privacy Act, its disclosure will not subject the School District to a\n   loss of federal funding. The trial court did not err in holding that the School District did not prove that the video is exempt from disclosure under Section 708(b)(1)(i) of the Right-to-Know Law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Employee Discipline Exemption\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The School District argues, next, that the trial court erred in holding that the video was not exempt under Section 708(b)(7)(viii) of the Right-to-Know Law because the video is \"[i]nformation regarding discipline, demotion or discharge contained in [Dufour's] personnel file.\" School District Brief at 13. Requester counters that it is unfair to allow the School District to \"indefinitely or permanently deny access to the [v]ideo under the Right-to-Know Law simply by placing the [v]ideo into the employee's personnel file.\" Requester Brief at 17. In any event, Requester maintains that the video is not exempt from disclosure under Section 708(b)(7)(viii) because it does not relate to the discipline, demotion or discharge of Dufour.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Section 708(b)(7)(viii) of the Right-to-Know Law states, in pertinent part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   (b) Exceptions. - Except as provided in subsections (c) and (d) [regarding financial records and aggregated data], the following are exempt from access by a requester under this act:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   (7) The following records relating to an agency employee:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   (viii)\n   <em>\n    Information regarding discipline, demotion or discharge contained in a personnel file\n   </em>\n   . This subparagraph shall not apply to the final action of an agency that results in demotion or discharge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   65 P.S. \u00a7 67.708(b)(7)(viii) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Contrary to the School District's assertion, it has not been established that the video is contained in Dufour's personnel file. The affidavit of the district's open records officer, John Castrovinci, states that the video was \"admitted into evidence in the pending action to discipline, demote or discharge [ ] Dufour.\" Castrovinci Affidavit \u00b6 7; R.R. 18a. It further states that \"[r]ecords responsive to the first part of [the Requester's] request are maintained in [ ] Dufour's personnel file.\" Castrovinci Affidavit \u00b6 3; R.R. 17a. \"The first part of the request,\" as Castrovinci cited in his affidavit, concerned Requester's questions about Dufour's employment status and annual salary, which is not an issue on appeal. R.R. 17a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Further, although the video was admitted into evidence in the pending action to discipline, demote or discharge Dufour, the affidavit also states that \"no final agency action has been taken with regard to [ ] Dufour's employment as a result of the incident referred to in this request.\" Castrovinci Affidavit \u00b6\u00b6 7-8; R.R. 18a. In other words, at the time the School District declined Requester access to the video recording, Dufour had not been disciplined, demoted, or discharged. The video, therefore, is not itself \"information regarding discipline, demotion or discharge\" of Dufour.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The local agency bears the burden of proving that a record is exempt from public access \"by a preponderance of the evidence.\" 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.708(a)(1). Because the School District did not satisfy its burden of proving that the video was contained in Dufour's personnel file and was information regarding discipline, demotion or discharge of Dufour, we hold that the trial court did not err by concluding that Section 708(b)(7)(viii) of the Right-to-Know Law does not apply to the video.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Arbitration Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Finally, the School District argues that the video is exempt from disclosure under Section 708(b)(8)(ii) of the Right-to-Know Law because it is evidence presented at an arbitration proceeding. \"[A]n agency must raise all its challenges before the fact-finder closes the record.\"\n   <em>\n    Levy v.

Cmwlth. 2014). Because the School District has raised this issue for the first time on appeal to this Court, the issue is waived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   For the reasons stated above, we conclude that the trial court did not err in ruling that the video recording is not exempt from disclosure under either Section 708(b)(1)(i) or 708(b)(7)(viii) of the Right-to-Know Law. Further, we determine that the School District waived the issue that the video is exempt from disclosure under Section 708(b)(8)(ii) of the Right-to-Know Law.
