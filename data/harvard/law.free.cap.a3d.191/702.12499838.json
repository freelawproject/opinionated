Fifteen months after D.M. left plaintiffs' home, he returned and killed Ted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We conclude that defendant owed a duty to plaintiffs to exercise reasonable care in placing D.M. in plaintiffs' home, and to reasonably disclose D.M.'s background to enable them to make an informed decision whether to accept him.

D.M. resided in plaintiffs' home between July 2009 and April 2010. He was removed from the home at plaintiffs' request. The removal was prompted by instances of eloping, possessing \"R\" rated movies, bringing four girls into the home without permission, and possessing a prescription medication that was not prescribed for him, apparently to resell. He returned to institutional settings unaffiliated with defendant, and continued to engage in aggressive and erratic behaviors, including acts of delinquency that resulted in contacts with the juvenile justice system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   During the months after his removal, D.M. repeatedly returned to burglarize plaintiffs' home. He returned for a third time fifteen months after his removal. By that time, there were active warrants for his arrest. D.M. intended to flee to Florida, using the fruits of his burglary. But, on this third occasion, he happened upon Ted, who told him to leave the home. D.M. grabbed a kitchen knife and stabbed Ted twenty-five times and killed him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Although plaintiffs were aware that D.M. was a troubled youth - all children placed in their therapeutic home were - defendant withheld significant information about D.M. Defendant did not disclose D.M.'s psychological assessments; the incidents of abuse and neglect by his own parents; the murder of his mother; multiple ill-fated placements; an incident of arson involving a previous foster parent's property; assaults of other foster parents; threats of self-harm; and several instances of terroristic threats,\n   such as to kill with weapons, which he made against multiple targets, including foster parents, a foster child, and a teacher.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In particular, D.M. twisted the arm of one foster mother. He threatened a psychological worker with a baseball bat. He threatened to blow up a school and kill a teacher. He threatened to break a glass over another foster mother who stood in D.M.'s way, as he tried to reach a knife. The same foster mother reported that D.M. attempted to kill himself and another foster child with a knife, and threatened to burn down the home and kill everyone inside. Plaintiffs were also not made aware that immediately before D.M.'s placement in their home, a clinician for another Division contractor recommended that D.M. laterally move to another residential treatment center from the one that discharged him for impulsive and unsafe behaviors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that had defendant adequately disclosed D.M.'s background, they would have rejected his placement, preventing the subsequent homicide. They supplied expert opinions that the placement of D.M. in a foster home, even a therapeutic one, and the failure to inform plaintiffs of D.M.'s dangerous background, violated governing standards of care. One expert opined that the records reflected that D.M. should not have been placed in a foster home and the \"community needed to be protected from him. His aggressive, assaultive behaviors started early and did not change. The professional evaluations\n   were numerous and consistently predicted the danger that he posed to others.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendant contends that it was obliged to comply with the State's \"no eject, no reject\" policy, which required it to accept all referrals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant also contends that plaintiffs knew D.M. was\n   troubled; he was incarcerated when Wanda first talked to him. Wanda had advanced degrees in nursing, and experience working in the mental health field. She and her husband reported that D.M. was never violent or disrespectful during his placement. Defendant also had no knowledge of D.M.'s increasingly erratic behavior and criminal arrests after he left plaintiffs' home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After discovery, the trial court granted defendant's motion for summary judgment. In a brief oral opinion, the trial court held that defendant lacked a duty to warn plaintiffs about the dangerous behavior and acts of delinquency that D.M. committed in the months following his removal from their home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Exercising de novo review,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Henry v.

Plaintiffs do not contend that defendant had a continuing duty to warn plaintiffs about D.M. after he left their home. Rather, they contend defendant had a duty, before D.M.'s initial placement, to exercise reasonable care in determining whether he was suited for plaintiffs' home, and to reasonably inform plaintiffs about D.M.'s history. The crux of the case is whether defendant had such a duty; whether defendant breached that duty; and whether that breach proximately caused Ted's death and other alleged damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jersey Cent.

Furthermore, plaintiffs did not directly sue D.M. He was only named as a third-party defendant by another defendant-entity, Performcare, which was dismissed with prejudice, along with the Division of Child Protection and Permanency (Division), and other entities. Plaintiffs did not appeal those prior dismissal orders. We refer to Therapeutic Alternatives, Inc. as \"defendant.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    N.J.A.C. 10:73-3.11. A policy and procedure manual of defendant states that while it \"maintains a 'no reject, no eject' policy,\" some clients may be discharged from the shelter program for \"behaviors [that] are not sustainable in the treatment home\" such as breaking the law or conditions of release, physical violence to treatment home residents, and \"runaway behavior or other actions [that] compromise the well-being of other clients.\" Even if defendant owed a duty to accept all referrals from the Division, defendant does not rely on a contractual provision or regulation that similarly bound plaintiffs. We note, however, that the contract between defendant and plaintiffs, as \"Provider,\" states, \"Provider understands that a Client [a foster child] is assigned to the Home and that Provider does not 'choose' a Client.\" Once a child was placed, plaintiffs were required to give thirty days' notice if they were no longer able to care for the child, and to confer with defendant \"[i]f the Provider feels unable to provide care to a Client ....\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Plaintiffs' expert further opined that defendant failed to provide adequate services and information during D.M.'s stay in the foster home. However, plaintiffs do not argue before us that their damages were caused by a breach of duty to provide essential services while D.M. was placed in the home, or to remove D.M. sooner than it did. We therefore do not address such potential duties.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    Notably, plaintiffs do not assert that the duty arises out of the contract - although their contract with defendant required defendant to \"communicate to Provider\n    <em>\n     pertinent\n    </em>\n    information regarding Client(s) to be placed in the Home.\" Nor does defendant point to a contractual provision that purports to absolve them of liability. Therefore, we do not address contractual grounds for liability, or the viability of contract-based defenses. Similarly, neither party contends that a State law or regulation governs the nature of defendant's duty.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    That specific knowledge of past behavior distinguishes this case from\n    <em>\n     Peguero\n    </em>\n    , for example, where we held that a fraternity did not owe a duty to the victim of a shooting at a fraternity party, in significant part because the risk of gunfire was not reasonably foreseeable.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4081874\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/439/77/#p88\">\n     439 N.J.

As the state had not offered such a justification for its silence, the court did not address the matter further.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"concurrence\">\n  <author id=\"p-52\">\n   SABATINO, P.J.A.D., concurring.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   I join in Judge Ostrer's erudite and well-reasoned analysis of the common law principles that govern this litigation. I write to add a few prospective comments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Regardless of whether a jury imposes civil liability on this particular defendant, I respectfully urge the State to explore measures that might prevent the fatal tragedy in this case - or some other violent assault by a youth inflicted upon a resource parent - from being repeated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   For example, the State might adopt and enforce stringent regulations obligating private placement agencies to provide sufficient warning of the known dangerous characteristics of troubled youths to resource families, before such youths are taken into their homes. We are unaware that any regulations of that sort exist at the present time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   As a separate measure, the State might insist upon contractual provisions mandating placement agencies to carry out the important responsibility of notification detailed in this opinion. The contracts could specify, for instance, that such agencies face termination, perhaps with financial penalties, if they fail to perform that responsibility. Again, we are unsure from this record if typical State contracts already contain such language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   As it so happened, the State was not a participant in this appeal, as plaintiffs did not seek review of the dismissal of the State defendants from the case. We therefore lack the benefit of the State's briefing and perspective on these weighty issues. Nor have we been fully apprised of how the State's \"no eject, no reject\" policy bears upon the circumstances, and whether that policy imposes undue pressure on agencies to place troubled children rapidly with families.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In any event, perhaps the spotlight of this tragic case will spur more effective ways to protect host families from harm. Ideally that can be done without diminishing the roster of qualified caregivers who are willing to open their homes to difficult needy children. We also are mindful that greater care in the placement process can reciprocally protect children from deficient foster caretakers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   It is not for us as judges, of course, to devise the appropriate policy solutions. Although the specter of civil liability can play an appropriate role in shaping future conduct, well-crafted regulations and vigilant contractual oversight may well offer more effective safeguards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   We therefore commend these policy issues to the efforts and expertise of the other branches of government, and to possible innovations of the private sector.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In the meantime, this litigation will continue in the trial court, as it must, under the applicable rules of law. But no matter who wins or loses before the jury, let us all hope that the life that was senselessly lost in this case will somehow result in more lives being spared in the future.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
