The class actions are premised on allegations that the defendant overcharged service station operators and franchisees for gasoline products.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Generally, the defendant claims that the trial court abused its discretion in certifying the class\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   because it failed to apply the \"rigorous analysis\" that is required before such a certification may be granted. In particular, the defendant claims that the trial court's error is most clearly evidenced by its failure to address various elements of the causes of action and the special defenses when it determined that common issues predominated. We conclude that the defendant has failed to establish that the trial court abused its discretion in ordering class certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The record reveals the following facts, assumed to be true by the trial court for purposes of the certification issues or otherwise undisputed, and procedural history. Kennynick, LLC, and Faugno Acquisition, LLC\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   (Faugno)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (collectively, plaintiffs),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   are service station operators and were franchised dealers for gasoline products supplied by the defendant, which is a wholesale supplier. In 2009, the plaintiffs commenced an action against the defendant, purportedly on behalf of themselves and other persons who had been supplied with gasoline products by the defendant. The complaint alleged that the proposed class members had been overcharged in two respects. First, it alleged that the defendant had charged class members the federal gasoline tax at a rate of 18.4 cents per gallon without applying a federal tax credit that would have had the effect of reducing that rate and that had been effective between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2011.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, it alleged that, at all\n   relevant times since September 27, 2004, the defendant had charged class members the Connecticut gross receipts tax on the basis of the price of gasoline as delivered, and thus had improperly charged for state tax on the defendant's profit (including the federal tax overcharge) and delivery. In reliance on these allegations, the six count complaint set forth claims of (1) breach of contract, (2) unjust enrichment,\n   (3) violation of the Connecticut Petroleum Franchise Act, General Statutes \u00a7 42-133j et seq., (4) violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq., (5) violation of the good faith requirement under the Uniform Commercial Code, General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-305 (2), and (6) misrepresentation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiffs sought relief including money damages for past losses, injunctive relief prohibiting the defendant from conduct that would cause future losses, and punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Shortly thereafter, the defendant commenced a separate action against one of the plaintiffs, Faugno, alleging breach of contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response, Faugno filed a counterclaim, also styled as a proposed class action, which in all material respects mirrored the plaintiffs' complaint in the earlier action. Pursuant to the plaintiffs' motions, and in the absence of objection from the defendant, the trial court consolidated the two actions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2015, after the plaintiffs had obtained compliance with discovery requests, they moved for orders certifying the action as a class action pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 9-9.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant filed an opposition, which\n   included a supporting affidavit by its vice president. The trial court held a hearing on the motion and reserved decision. Thereafter, the trial court issued orders certifying a class action on all counts. The orders defined the class as \"all entities or persons who: (i) purchased gasoline from [the defendant] during the period September 27, 2004 to date; (ii) were charged federal gasoline tax at a rate of 18.4 cents per gallon on such gasoline purchases; (iii) did not receive the federal ... tax credit, while it was in effect, on such gasoline purchases; and (iv) were charged state gross receipts tax on such gasoline\n   purchases based on the price of gasoline, as delivered.\" The orders also approved the plaintiffs as class representatives and their counsel as class counsel. The orders indicated that further articulation would follow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The trial court thereafter issued a memorandum of decision setting forth that articulation, which we explore in fuller detail later in this opinion. In that decision, the trial court noted that the plaintiffs had identified at least eighty-one of the defendant's gasoline customers during the relevant time period as potential members of the proposed class: forty-four had supply contracts with the defendant and thirty-seven had purchased gasoline on an as invoiced basis. With regard to those with written contracts, there were four subclasses with varied arrangements, but all contracts contained an identical provision stating that the \"prices include taxes ... which [the defendant] may be required to collect or pay pursuant to any present or future laws ....\" The court pointed to the fact that all of the potential class members had received invoices from the defendant. The court noted that the plaintiffs had reviewed \"a 'substantial sampling' of the more than\n   14,000 invoices produced by [the defendant] in discovery\" and had represented that \"the invoices appear to be almost identical to the invoices that the [plaintiffs] received for payment.\" The court addressed separately each requirement for class certification under Practice Book \u00a7 9-7, concluding that each had been satisfied. Largely in reliance on the facts and legal issues cited in that analysis, the court also concluded that each of the policy considerations under Practice Book \u00a7 9-8 weighed in favor of allowing the action to proceed as a class action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The defendant appealed from the orders certifying the class. See footnote 1 of this opinion. After the court issued its memorandum of decision, the defendant did not seek any further articulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On appeal, the defendant contends that the trial court abused its discretion in granting class certification because it failed to apply the requisite \"rigorous analysis\" to each class certification requirement. Instead, the defendant contends, the trial court merely required \" 'some showing' \" to support each requirement, engaged in a \"cursory review of the claims and evidence,\" and disregarded certain evidence, elements, and defenses. We conclude that, in light of the claims and arguments advanced to the trial court, its grant of class certification was not an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Given the nature of the defendant's claims, a discussion of the applicable standards that guide our review takes on heightened significance. Therefore, clarifying certain aspects of these standards must be our starting point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"[T]he rules of practice set forth a two step process for trial courts to follow in determining whether an action or claim qualifies for class action status. First,\n   a court must ascertain whether the four prerequisites to a class action, as specified in Practice Book \u00a7 9-7, are satisfied. These prerequisites are: (1) numerosity-that the class is too numerous to make joinder of all members feasible; (2) commonality-that the members have similar claims of law and fact; (3) typicality-that the [representative] plaintiffs' claims are typical of the claims of the class; and (4) adequacy of representation-that the interests of the class are protected adequately....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"Second, if the foregoing criteria are satisfied, the court then must evaluate whether the certification requirements of Practice Book \u00a7 9-8 [3] are satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   These requirements are: (1) predominance-that questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members; and (2) superiority-that a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Neighborhood Builders, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Madison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5770019\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/294/651/#p658\">\n    294 Conn. 651\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 658,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=986%20A.2d%20278\">\n    986 A.2d 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   It is the class action proponent's burden to prove that all of the requirements have been met.

The defendant claims that the trial court incorrectly \"concluded and repeatedly emphasized that once the class members make a threshold showing ... that they met the class definition, then proof of membership in the class will be substantially determinative of the elements of their claims ....\" We conclude that the trial court's analysis was sufficiently rigorous and that its conclusion that the predominance requirement was met was not an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \"[C]lass-wide issues predominate if resolution of some of the legal or factual questions that qualify each class member's case as a genuine controversy can be achieved through generalized proof, and if these particular issues are more substantial than the issues subject only to individualized proof....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \"In order to determine whether common questions predominate, [a court must] ... examine the [causes] of action asserted in the complaint on behalf of the putative class....

It is altogether proper, therefore, that those findings would inform the court's analysis under \u00a7 9-8. See\n   <em>\n    In re Target Corp.

Common questions of fact regarding the purchase of gasoline from the defendant included (1) the price charged for each gallon of gasoline, (2) the lack of benefit from the federal tax credit, and (3) the charge of state gross receipts tax based on the price of gasoline as delivered, including the defendant's profit and delivery charges. Common legal questions included (1) whether the defendant charged its customers for federal gasoline tax at an incorrect rate because it did not apply the federal tax credit during the relevant period, and (2) whether the defendant improperly charged its customers the state gross receipts tax on the price of gasoline as delivered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In its analysis of the requirements of Practice Book \u00a7 9-8, the second prong of the court's predominance analysis can be summarized as follows. With regard to each cause of action, the trial court essentially found that the threshold showing for class membership-the purchase of gasoline from the defendant during the relevant period-left common questions largely determinative of each of the causes of action, namely, whether the defendant (1) charged class members for federal gasoline tax at an incorrect rate because it did not give them the benefit of the federal tax credit, and (2) properly charged the state gross receipts tax on gasoline as delivered. Thus, for example, in considering\n   the bad faith element of a violation of the relevant provision of the Uniform Commercial Code, the court concluded that this element depended on those same common questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The court acknowledged that certain causes of action required additional elements that would not be subject to common proof. For example, the court found that the counts alleging a violation of the Connecticut Petroleum Franchise Act and a violation of CUTPA required an initial determination-that the potential class member is a franchisee of the defendant or suffered an ascertainable loss, respectively-but that the aforementioned threshold showing and common questions would then be applicable to prove the remaining elements of each such cause. With respect to the CUTPA violation, the court indicated that the individualized loss could be determined by a common mathematical equation. Ultimately, the trial court determined that common issues of fact and law predominated with respect to proof of the elements of each of the claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Our review of the trial court's analysis confirms the defendant's contention that the court did not expressly address whether every element of every cause of action would require individualized proof. However, we are not persuaded that these omissions render its decision less than the rigorous analysis called for or otherwise an abuse of discretion. The trial\n   court is required to articulate a conclusion as to each requirement of the class certification rule, in this case, that common issues predominate. See 59 Am. Jur. 2d, supra, \u00a7 89, p. 543 (rigorous analysis \"does not require the court to assign weight to any of the criteria listed, or to make written findings as to each factor, but merely requires the court to weigh and consider the factors and come to a reasoned conclusion as to whether a class action should be permitted for a fair adjudication of the controversy\"); see also\n   <em>\n    In re Hydrogen Peroxide Antitrust Litigation\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4011991\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/552/305/#p310\">\n    552 F.3d at 310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The trial court, [well positioned] to decide which facts and legal arguments are most important to each [rule's] requirement, possesses broad discretion to control proceedings and frame issues for consideration under [the rule]....

It failed to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   We can glean a reasoned basis for the trial court's conclusion. The certified class consists \"of all entities or persons who: (i) purchased gasoline from [the defendant] during the period September 27, 2004, to date; (ii) were charged federal gasoline tax at a rate of 18.4 cents per gallon on such gasoline purchases; (iii) did not receive the federal volumetric ethanol excise tax credit, while it was in effect, on such gasoline purchases; and (iv) were charged state gross receipts tax\n   on such gasoline purchases based on the price of gasoline, as delivered.\" Under that class definition, proof of class membership establishes that the defendant and the class member had some form of agreement for the sale and purchase of gasoline. Qualifying under the class definition requires significant proof, but, notably, proof arising from common sources. Specifically, we agree with the trial court that whether an entity or person qualifies under this definition appears to be provable by way of invoices and contractual information gleaned from the defendant's records, which is class-wide, undisputed evidence.

With respect to the count alleging breach of contract, the defendant contends that the elements of performance and breach require individualized proof.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   We agree that whether the parties performed\n   may require some individualized proof, specifically, to demonstrate that the potential class members actually paid for the invoiced gasoline. However, this question will largely be provable by common evidence, namely, the defendant's records, and does not clearly predominate over the other elements of the cause raising questions common to the class. With regard to the element of breach, we note that the plaintiffs contend that, because the defendant improperly charged federal and state\n   tax fees to the class as a whole, this is a class-wide breach that can be established by common proof. Whether the plaintiffs actually can prove this, or whether the defendant will successfully defend against the allegation, goes to the merits and extends beyond ensuring that the class certification requirements are met. See\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Anthem Health Plans, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3149748\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/275/309/#p322\">\n    275 Conn. at 321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=880%20A.2d%20106\">\n    880 A.2d 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"the question is not whether the ... plaintiffs ... will prevail on the merits, but rather whether the requirements of [the class action rules] are met\" [internal quotation marks omitted] ). Therefore, we are not persuaded that the trial court abused its discretion in finding that the predominance requirement had been met for this count.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   With respect to the count alleging a violation of the Connecticut Petroleum Franchise Act, the defendant asserts that the trial court incorrectly determined that common proof could \"establish a franchise relationship and a right to recovery under the franchise provisions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   The relevant subsections of the act, General Statutes \u00a7 43-133\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   (f) (6), (7) and (9), respectively require good faith, fair and reasonable prices, and no discrimination between franchisees. Although the proof required to establish that potential class members are franchisees will mainly come from the defendant's contractual records, we acknowledge that proof may also be required from records of individual customers on their business models. Moreover, although the first two subdivisions at issue will require common proof, we acknowledge that the third, discrimination, will likely require individualized proof. Ultimately, we conclude that the trial court's implicit conclusion-that the individualized proof necessary to establish discrimination and to supplement the common proof to establish the franchise relationship would not predominate over the common proof required to prove this cause of action-was not an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   With regard to the count alleging misrepresentation, the defendant contends that this claim must be proved by individualized oral conversations between the defendant and each customer. The plaintiffs' claim, as we understand it, however, is not that the defendant made\n   oral misrepresentations regarding the federal and state tax charges at issue, but, rather, that the invoices reflecting those charges misrepresented the actual taxes imposed by law, causing the injury alleged. Even if we assume direct conversations occurred between the defendant and individual customers, nothing in the evidence presented thus far indicates that those customers were provided with different information on the taxes assessed in their invoices.\n   Instead, the uniformity in the charges recorded by the invoices presented to the trial court provides no basis to infer that discussions on these taxes would not have been substantially uniform as well. Thus, the trial court's conclusion as to this count was not an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In a more broadly applicable attack, the defendant also argues that damages calculations will require individualized proof, particularly for lost profit damages. The defendant disregards the fact, however, that the plaintiffs eliminated their request for lost profit damages when they amended their pleadings. Although the absence of a request for such relief may result in some class members exercising their right to opt out of the class and, in turn, impact the class' ability to satisfy numerosity, that issue is one that the trial court may revisit if, and when, it arises.

Its sole, marginally adequately briefed claim relates to its contention that the uniform charges invoiced to its customers were known and either negotiated, ratified, or waived by those customers and that, accordingly, proof as to what individual customers knew at what time would be required. However, although this defense may require some individualized evidence, some of the evidence necessary to evaluate this defense will come from common proof, namely, the defendant's invoices and records. For instance, the defendant's invoices, which apparently reflect identical charges for the federal and state taxes at issue, will presumably serve to demonstrate in part that the purported waiver or ratification occurred as they would reflect when information was known to customers at various points in time. Similarly relevant would be the written contracts for approximately one half of the proposed class, which apparently contain nearly identical provisions relating to taxes. Accordingly, there is no basis to conclude that the issues necessary to resolve such defenses would predominate over the overarching common issues in the action.
