In each instance, the Board denied the owners\u2019 application for removal permits and/or vested rights exemptions from such permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">The trial courts overturned all of the Board\u2019s decisions by issuing writs mandating the Board to grant the applications, or in Canon\u2019s case, prohibiting the Board\u2019s applying section 1803, subdivision (t).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">The local governments contend mere approval of tentative tract maps does not preclude enforcement of subsequently enacted independent land use regulations. The owners claim that upon receipt of tentative tract map approval, they have vested rights to proceed without the imposition of any subsequent conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">\n<em>Blue Chip/Regal, Wissner and Stoka.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">Sometime before April 10, 1979, the Santa Monica City Planning Commission approved tentative tract maps for the conversion into condominiums of the rental units existing on each of the subject properties.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The conversion contemplated by developers Blue Chip/Regal required the obtaining of building permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">On April 10, 1979, the citizens of Santa Monica adopted by initiative the Amendment to the City\u2019s charter. This Amendment mandates that no controlled rental units be removed, converted or demolished without a permit from the Board authorizing removal from the rental housing market. (\u00a7 1803, subd. (t).)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>The Amendment specifies the Board may issue a removal permit (a) if the rental units are uninhabitable and incapable of being made inhabitable economically or, (b) if the landlord both owns habitable property and does not wish to rebuild, upon findings that (1) the building is not occupied by persons of low or moderate income, (2) cannot be afforded by persons of low or moderate income, (3) removal will not adversely affect the housing supply, and (4) the owner cannot make a reasonable return on his investment. (\u00a7 1803, subd. (t).)</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">On June 29, 1979, the City adopted ordinance No. 1127 to clarify and implement the rent control law. This ordinance included recognition of the Board\u2019s authority to determine claims of vested rights, setting forth guidelines for such determinations,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and was later replaced by a revised ordinance No. 1153.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">After passage of the Amendment, the developers filed applications for vested rights exemptions to obtaining a removal permit. Following public hearings wherein evidence was taken, the Board denied the applications, making factual findings against Blue Chip/Regal, Wissner and Stoka.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Blue Chip/Regal, Wissner and Stoka, filed petitions for writs of mandate with the trial court. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5.) The trial courts granted the writs, finding the developers had acquired vested rights to convert their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>properties to condominiums based on financial liabilities incurred in good faith reliance on the approved tentative tract maps. The judgments of the trial courts ordered the Board to set aside its denial of the developers\u2019 applications for vested rights exceptions and find the developers exempt from the removal permit requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">\n<em>Canon.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">The facts in Canon differ slightly. Canon also received tentative tract map approval from the planning commission prior to adoption of the Amendment, and the Board denied Canon\u2019s application for a vested rights exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">Canon petitioned the trial court for both a writ of mandate and prohibition. The trial court issued a writ prohibiting Santa Monica from: exercising jurisdiction over condominium conversion by virtue of section 1803, subdivision (t); requiring a removal permit as a requirement for condominium conversion; applying section 1803, subdivision (t) to condominium conversion; and enforcing section 1803, subdivision (t) with respect to condominium conversions.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">The trial court also found section 1803, subdivision (t): unconstitutional as applied to the subdivision of real property into condominium units because of the state Subdivision Map Act (Map Act); constituted a restraint on alienation of property; and was an unconstitutional attempt to regulate the ownership and not use of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">Appellate review was stayed pending resolution by the California Supreme Court of two cases which were deemed dispositive of many pivotal issues. These cases are <em>Santa Monica Pines, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Rent Control Board </em>(1984) 35 Cal.3d 858 [201 Cal.Rptr. 593, 679 P.2d 27] and <em>Nash </em>v. <em>City of Santa Monica </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 97 [207 Cal.Rptr. 285, 688 P.2d 894].</p>\n<p id=\"b535-11\">Because common questions of law are involved in each appeal, the four separate appeals were consolidated, and the facts reviewed in light of the recently decided cases by which this court is bound. <em>(Auto Equity Sales, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 450, 455 [20 Cal.Rptr. 321, 369 P.2d 937].)</p>\n<p id=\"b535-12\">Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b535-13\">The City contends tentative tract map approval is not the point at which developers may acquire vested rights to be exempt from complying with section 1803, subdivision (t)\u2019s removal permit requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>Additionally, with respect to Canon, the City claims the trial court unnecessarily reached constitutional issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">1. <em>Section 1803, subdivision (t), the removal permit requirement, not preempted by the Map Act.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Initially, it has been determined the Map Act does not preempt application of the removal permit requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">The California Supreme Court specifically ruled on this issue in <em>Santa Monica Pines, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Rent Control Board, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at page 869. The court stated: \u201cThe restriction on removal from the rental housing market through condominium conversion, at issue here, with its evident, independent police power source and purpose, is therefore not preempted by the Subdivision Map Act.\u201d <em>(Santa Monica Pines, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Rent Control Board, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at p. 869, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">2. <em>Section 1803, subdivision (t) held partially constitutional.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">Likewise, the issue as to the constitutionality of section 1803, subdivision (t) was partially settled in <em>Nash. </em>The California Supreme Court recently addressed the constitutionality of section 1803, subdivision (t) in <em>Nash </em>v. <em>City of Santa Monica, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d 97, and of a similar Berkeley ordinance in <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>City of Berkeley </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 644 [209 Cal.Rptr. 682, 693 P.2d 261]. In <em>Fisher, </em>the court held that the prohibition against unreasonable restraints on alienation (Civ. Code, \u00a7 711) applies only to private restraints on alienation and not to municipal ordinances. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 692-693.)</p>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">In <em>Nash, </em>the court held section 1803, subdivision (t), did not constitute a \u201ctaking\u201d of property <em>(Nash </em>v. <em>City of Santa Monica, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d at p. 102), interfere with a landowner\u2019s liberty or property interests <em>(id., </em>at p. 103), or impinge on a landowner\u2019s right to retain or sell property. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 103-104.)</p>\n<p id=\"b536-11\">a. <em>Restriction on ownership is a constitutional issue still remaining.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b536-12\">A constitutional issue not yet specifically resolved is the developers\u2019 allegation that the restriction on removal is an unconstitutional restriction on ownership, while the City claims it is a legitimate regulation of land use. This precise issue is presently before the California Supreme Court in <em>Grif</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number><em>fin Development Co. </em>v. <em>City of Oxnard. </em> However, the court implicitly decided the issue in both <em>Santa Monica Pines </em>and <em>Nash.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">In <em>Santa Monica Pines, </em>the court noted local government\u2019s power to regulate condominium conversion. <em>(Santa Monica Pines, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Rent Control Board, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at pp. 861, 869.) In <em>Nash, </em>the court summarized its conclusion that section 1803, subdivision (t) was not constitutionally infirm, stating \u201cwhile the challenged provision may be said to implicate interests which are entitled to a high degree of constitutional protection\u2014 . . . \u2014the actual limitation upon those interests posed by the challenged provision is minimal and not significantly different from other, constitutionally permissible, limitations upon <em>the use </em>of private property imposed by government regulation.\u201d <em>(Nash </em>v. <em>City of Santa Monica, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d at p. 100, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">Reviewing the right of a developer to convert an apartment building to condominiums, the court in <em>Rasmussen </em>v. <em>City Council </em>(1983) 140 Cal.App.3d 842 [190 Cal.Rptr. 1], addressed the proposed change from apartments to condominiums as a change in <em>use </em>to be evaluated under local nonconforming use zoning standards. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 850.)</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">Restrictions on land use necessarily restrict land users. This does not make ordinances that regulate use by regulating users inherently invalid. (See <em>Taxpayers Association of Weymouth Township </em>v. <em>Weymouth Townships </em>(1976) 71 N.J. 249 [364 A.2d 1016, 1031, 83 A.L.R.3d 1051], cert, den., <em>sub nom.

Rights which have so completely and definitely accrued to a person that they are not subject to be defeated or canceled by the act of any other private person, and which it is right and equitable that the government should recognize and protect, as being lawful in themselves, and settled <em>according to the then current rules of law, </em>and of which the individual could not be deprived arbitrarily without injustice, <em>or of which he could not justly be deprived otherwise than by the established methods of procedure and for the public welfare. . . . </em>[Such interests as] cannot be interfered with by retrospective laws, . . .

Immediate or fixed right to present or future enjoyment and one that does not depend on an event that is uncertain. ...

State ex rel. Milligan v. Ritter\u2019s Estate, Ind.App., 46 N.E.2d 736, 743.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">It has long been the rule that if property owners perform substantial work and incur substantial liabilities in good faith reliance upon a permit issued by the government, they acquire a vested right to complete their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>project in accordance with the terms of the permit. <em>(Dobbins </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1904) 195 U.S. 223 [49 L.Ed. 169, 25 S.Ct. 18]; <em>Trans-Oceanic Oil Corp. </em>v. <em>Santa Barbara </em>(1948) 85 Cal.App.2d 776, 784 [194 P.2d 148]; <em>Avco Community Developers, Inc. </em>v. <em>South Coast Regional Com., supra, </em>17 Cal.3d at p. 791; <em>Santa Monica Pines, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Rent Control Board </em>(1984) 35 Cal.3d 858 [201 Cal.Rptr. 593, 679 P.2d 27].)</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">The most recent case attempting to explain the doctrine and its application stated \u201c[t]he vested rights doctrine is \u2018 \u201cpredicated upon estoppel of the governing body.\u201d \u2019 <em>(Avco Community Developers, Inc. </em>v. <em>South Coast Regional Com., supra, </em>17 Cal.3d at p. 793.) This is a principle of equitable estoppel which may be applied against the government where justice and fairness require it. <em>(Raley </em>v. <em>California Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, supra, </em>68 Cal.App.3d [965] at p. 975 [137 Cal.Rptr. 699].) [\u00b6] An equitable estoppel requiring the government to exempt a land use from a subsequently imposed regulation must include (1) a promise such as that implied by a <em>building permit </em>that the proposed use will not be prohibited by a class of restrictions that includes the regulation in question and (2) reasonable reliance on the promise by the promisee to the promisee\u2019s detriment. (See <em>Avco, supra, </em>17 Cal.3d at p. 793.)\u201d <em>(Santa Monica Pines Ltd. </em>v. <em>Rent Control Board, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at pages 866-867.) (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">Therefore, a developer relying on an <em>equitable estoppel </em>has a vested right to go forward without complying with such subsequently enacted regulations <em>only </em>when <em>both </em>of these elements against the government are established. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 867.)</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">However, leaving aside \u201creasonable reliance\u201d as a fact question, two issues remain. First, what constitutes a government \u201cpromise\u201d to allow a developer to rely and to begin measuring expenditures toward establishing a vested right. And second, assuming such a promise and reasonable reliance by a developer and a subsequent vested right, what does the vested right include, i.e. the developer has acquired a vested right, but a vested right to do what? <em>(Pardee Construction Co. </em>v. <em>California Coastal Com. </em>(1979) 95 Cal.App.3d 471, 481 [157 Cal.Rptr. 184].)</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">In <em>Avco Community Developers, Inc. </em>v. <em>South Coast Regional Com., supra, </em>17 Cal.3d 785, the court stated the granting of a building permit was a promise that the use set forth would not be interfered with by certain regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">However, as the <em>Avco </em>court recognized, there are some instances which cannot be measured from building permit approval. <em>(Avco, supra, </em>17 Cal.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>at pp. 793-794.) Here, in most situations, the developers were not required to obtain building permits in order to complete the conversion. But all had received tentative tract maps approval to convert their existing structures to condominiums before the enactment of the Amendment and its removal permit requirement, and argue such approval is akin to a building permit and establishes vested rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\"><em>Santa Monica Pines </em>raises unanswered questions concerning the developers\u2019 vested rights theories, i.e., even if developers have expended substantial sums, is tentative tract map approval the point from which to measure reliance expenditures toward establishing a vested right? Or, does the vested rights doctrine even apply to condominium conversions? (See <em>Santa Monica Pines, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Rent Control Board, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at pp. 861, 866-867.)</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Pines was a Santa Monica apartment building owner who planned to convert apartments into condominiums. He received tentative tract map approval prior to passage of the Amendment. The Board denied Pines\u2019 applications for both a removal permit and a vested rights exemption therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">The <em>Santa Monica Pines </em>court factually concluded Pines had not established a vested right to continue conversion without the removal permit because even if tentative tract map approval were considered akin to a building permit for vested rights determination, Pines had not spent sufficient sums in reliance thereon. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 867.) Therefore, whether making substantial expenditures in alleged reliance on an approved tentative tract map justifies a vested right to be free from subsequently enacted rent control laws remains to be decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">While the court in <em>Santa Monica Pines </em>specifically did not decide whether the vested rights doctrine generally applies to condominium conversions, it did provide some guidance. The court emphasized <em>\u201cthat the rights which may </em>\u2018vest\u2019 <em>through reliance on a government permit are no greater than those specifically granted by the permit itself. </em>\u201d <em>(Santa Monica Pines, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Rent Control Board, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at p. 866 [italics added]), and that approval of a tentative tract map did not imply removal of the units from the rental market was also approved. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 866-867, fn. 6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">The <em>Santa Monica Pines </em>court then compared the developers\u2019 situation to that of an owner selling a fee interest in a rented single family home, and pointed out that regardless of either the seller\u2019s or buyer\u2019s intent to remove the house from the rental market, or any substantial expenditures toward that end, as long as the house was a \u201ccontrolled rental unit\u201d on the date <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>the ordinance went into effect, the buyer would remain subject to the ordinance\u2019s requirements. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 866.) It further observed, \u201cWe see no material difference in appellants\u2019 [Pines\u2019] situation. For this reason alone, <em>we question whether the approval of a subdivision map for condominium conversion can ever lead to a vested exemption from subsequent rent control laws.\" (Ibid., </em>fn. omitted, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">A tentative tract map approval guarantees a developer who fulfills the conditions imposed upon it <em>final map approval. (El Patio </em>v. <em>Permanent Rent Bd. </em>(1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 915, 927 [168 Cal.Rptr. 276]; <em>Youngblood </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 644, 655-656; see also Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 66473, 66474.) Tentative tract map approval does <em>not </em>guarantee that a building permit, if required, will be issued, as the building permit has an independent reason for existence. <em>(Avco Community Developers, Inc. </em>v. <em>South Coast Regional Com., supra, </em>17 Cal.3d at p. 795; <em>Hazon-Iny Development, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Santa Monica </em>(1982) 128 Cal.App.3d 1, 10-11 [179 Cal.Rptr. 860].)</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Further, a developer must comply with the laws in existence <em>at the time a building permit is issued </em>in order to obtain said permit. <em>(Avco Community Developers, Inc. </em>v. <em>South Coast Regional Com., supra, </em>17 Cal.3d at p. <em>795.)</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">The removal permit requirement is separate and independent from the subdivision process. <em>(Santa Monica Pines, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at p. 869.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>A vested right to obtain a final map or to complete a building, as per those requirements imposed at the time of tentative tract map approval or building permit acquisition, does not necessarily include a vested right to be free of a removal permit requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Observing there is no dispute over the developers\u2019 authority to subdivide apartment buildings and sell fee interests in individual units as provided for in approved tentative tract maps, the <em>Santa Monica Pines </em>court explained this does not mean developers can sell units free of the rent control law\u2019s removal permit requirement. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 865-866.)</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">b. <em>Application here.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">The City is persuasive in arguing that the <em>Santa Monica Pines </em>opinion means developers can subdivide and sell units, but new owners must comply with existing rent control law and obtain removal permits before removing units from the rental market.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Without alternative, we follow the direction of <em>Santa Monica Pines </em>and hold approval of a tentative tract map for condominium conversion does not lead to a vested rights exemption from subsequent rent control laws.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">In the case before us, the removal permit requirement does not constitute an additional condition to the developers\u2019 right <em>to complete </em>the subdivision. As discussed in <em>Santa Monica Pines, </em>the developers are free to complete the subdivision, and to sell individual fee interests. Section 1803, subdivision (t) simply requires <em>whoever </em>owns the converted unit to comply with the removal permit requirement. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>H &amp; H Properties </em>(1984) 154 Cal.App.3d 894 [201 Cal.Rptr. 686].)</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">It would appear there is no reason to exempt developers in the process of condominium conversions from regulations that unquestionably apply to the rest of the class of residential landlords. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>H &amp; H Properties, supra, </em>154 Cal.App.3d 894, 902.)</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>Condominium conversions generally require no substantial construction. Moreover, if an owner is not permitted to remove a unit from the rental market, the owner still owns valuable rental income property. To the extent the owner and/or developer have enhanced the building, conversion expenses can be recouped through appreciation and rent increases. Further, the owner remains free to sell the property. (See <em>Nash </em>v. <em>City of Santa Monica, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d at pp. 103, 106.)</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">4. <em>Local ordinance not controlling.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">Section 4604 of Santa Monica Ordinance No. 1127 does not affect our holding. Section 4606 of Santa Monica Ordinance No. 1127 created a \u201cpresum[ption] \u201d of a vested right to convert based on tentative tract map approval and \u201csatisfactory evidence of good faith reliance\u201d thereon. (See fn. 5, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">Again, it is not a property owner\u2019s right to convert the apartment into a condominium that is disputed. Rather, it is the property owner\u2019s right to remove the unit from the rental housing market which is in question.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">Local governments, including the City herein, may regulate land use in their communities. The removal permit requirement of section 1803, subdivision (t) is a land use regulation with which all developers engaged in condominium conversions must comply, irrespective of tentative tract map approvals received prior to the enactment thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-11\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b543-12\">Because section 1803, subdivision (t) is not unconstitutional, the judgment in Canon is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>Because none of the developers herein acquired a vested right, the scope of which included freedom from the subsequently enacted rent control laws, the judgments in Blue Chip/Regal, Wissner and Stoka are reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">Lui, J., and Danielson, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b532-12\"><em>Blue Chip Properties </em>v. <em>Permanent Rent Control Board </em>and <em>Regal Properties </em>v. <em>Permanent Rent Control Board </em>were consolidated for trial and appeal as their facts are virtually identical.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b532-13\">The City of Santa Monica was not named as a defendant in the action <em>Wissner </em>v. <em>Permanent Rent Control Board.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b533-11\">Blue Chip/Regal received approval November 7, 1978; Stoka\u2019s was approved on June 19, 1978; Wissner\u2019s (by a prior owner) was approved on June 19, 1978; and Canon\u2019s was approved on January 15, 1979.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b533-12\">Section 1803, subdivision (t) provides as follows: \u201c(t) Removal of Controlled Rental Unit From Rental Housing Market: Any landlord who desires to remove a controlled rental unit from the rental housing market by demolition, conversion or other means is required to obtain a permit from the Board prior to such removal from the rental housing market in accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated by the Board. In order to approve such a permit, the Board is required to make each of the following findings; [1] (1) That the controlled rental unit is not occupied by a person or family of very low income, low income or moderate income. [H] (2) That the rent of the controlled rental unit is not at a level affordable by a person or family of very low income, low income, or moderate income. [H] (3) That the removal of the controlled rental unit will not adversely affect the supply of housing in the City of Santa Monica, [f] (4) That the landlord cannot make a fair return on investment by retaining the controlled rental unit. [1] Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subsection, the Board may approve such a permit: [1f] (1) If the Board finds that the controlled rental unit is uninhabitable and is incapable of being made habitable in an economically feasible manner, or [f] (2) If the permit is being sought so that the property may be developed with multifamily dwelling units and the permit applicant agrees as a condition of approval that the units will not be exempt from the provisions of this Article pursuant to Section 1801(c) and that at least fifteen (15) per cent of the controlled rental units to be built on the site will be at rents affordable by persons of low income.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-13\">The language in this section has since been slightly modified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b534-7\">The applicable portion of the rent control law is as follows: \u201cSection 4604.

Further, we need not consider the question as to whether vested interests are involved, as distinguished from the question of the extent of the rights if such interests are involved, requires an exercise of independent judgment by a trial court reviewing the administrative record, or a determination that there is substantial evidence supporting the administrative finding. Regardless of the standard of review, and even if we accept the trial court\u2019s findings as to substantial expenditures, tentative tract map approval does not lead to a vested right to be exempt from the removal permit requirement.
