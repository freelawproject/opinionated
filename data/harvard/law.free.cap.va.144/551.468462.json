Besides, highly incriminating evidence, admitted in the petition to have been before the jury, does not appear elsewhere in the record, which makes it certain that the evidence referred to in the skeleton bill of exceptions was not all the evidence in the ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">If the evidence referred to in the petition and that contained in the statement of the evidence were a part of the record, we would be forced to hold that it was sufficient to support the verdict of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">The evidence not appearing in the record, we must dismiss the writ as improvidently awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">\n<em>Writ dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
