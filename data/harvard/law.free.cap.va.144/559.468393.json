Without-waiving error set out in the other bills of exceptions we shall, in this petition, present for the consideration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>\u2022of the court those errors which are most apparent.\u201d Those not so presented are not assignments of error, and cannot be considered. The rule on this subject is so well settled and has been so often stated as not to need repetition. <em>Lorillard &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Clay, 127 </em>Va. 734, 104 S. E. 384; <em>Mechanics Bank </em>v. <em>Schmelz Natl. Bank, </em>136 Va. 33, 116 S. E. 380; <em>Thurston </em>v. <em>Woodward, </em>139 Va. 315, 123 S.

Leicester Watts, attorney for Miss Crump, was examined as a witness for the Commonwealth. On cross-examination by counsel for the accused in reference to the influence of Miss Crump over the accused, \u2022and after he had testified at great length as to his relations to these parties, and their conduct and relation to each other, testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-5\">\u201cQ. Don\u2019t you believe he was thoroughly under the \u2022domination and influence of Miss Crump?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Af5\">\u201cA. That is a point I don\u2019t know.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">He was then asked: \u201cIsn\u2019t it a fact, Mr. Watts, that from what you saw then, and what you have seen since, that you are perfectly satisfied that Father Denis is absolutely under the domination of Miss Crump?\u201d Upon objection the answer was excluded, and it is stated that the answer would have been: \u201cYes.\u201d Exception was taken to the ruling and is embraced in bill of exception No. 3. The cross-examination was then continued as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-8\">\u201cQ. During your whole intercourse with Father Denis, did you ever see him do anything which made .you question his honesty or truthfulness in these matters?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-9\">\u201cA. His conduct was always that of a gentleman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-10\">\u201cQ. I will go further than that. Wasn\u2019t his conduct .^hat of a Christian, too?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>\u201cA. Yes, sir: although I never did understand some \u00a1statements that were made which have already been recorded. I never have understood them to this day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-4\">\u201cQ. If he was under hypnotic influence of Miss Crump, wouldn\u2019t that explain why you didn\u2019t understand it?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Upon objection to the answer to the last question, it was excluded and exception taken by the accused. It is stated that the answer would have been: \u201cYes.\u201d This exception is embraced in bill of exception No. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">The refusal of. the trial court to permit answers to the last question set forth in each of bills of exception Nos. 3 and 4 is assigned as error.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">It is difficult to understand how the witness could have answered \u201cyes\u201d to the second question asked in exception No. 3 after having answered: \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d to the first question, without plainly contradicting himself. Furthermore, the second question in exception No. 3 asks for the present domination of Miss Crump over the accused, rather than for her influence over him at the time of the commission of the offense charged. Later on the accused, testifying in his own behalf, said his eyes had been opened and she no longer had influence over him. For these reasons alone, the answer might have been properly excluded. But we do not wish to base our conclusions on so narrow a ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">The real ground of the exclusion of the answer was ithat it was obnoxious to the opinion evidence rule. The books are filled with cases on the subject, and a number of them are cited in the petition for the writ of error. The rule has often come under discussion in this court, and there is not much further light to be thrown on it. In cases to which the instant case belongs, we adhere to the rule stated in <em>Shenandoah Valley R. Co. </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>120 Va. 563, 578-9, 91 S. E. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>740, 745, and upon the authorities therein cited. It is-there said: \u201cThe test of admissibility of a conclusion of fact of a nonexpert witness is this: Is it clear that the jurors would or could have been as fully and as exactly furnished with the data which formed the basis for the conclusion of the witness as the latter--was? If so, the conclusion is inadmissible in evidence; if not, it is admissible.\u201d The record in the instant case teems with the fullest details of everything that came under the observation of the witness as to the confidential relations of these parties. Not only so, but numerous other witnesses testify on the same subject, including the accused, who kept a diary of events relating to Miss Crump and her visitations or trances. The opinion of the witness would not have been helpful to the jury in making deductions from the data furnished. Indeed, after hearing all the evidence in the-case, they were in as good, if not better, position to draw conclusions than the witness merely from his-own observations. Even without seeing the witnesses or hearing them testify, we are satisfied that we have-before us all the data necessary to draw a correct conclusion, and that the opinion of the witness would have-added nothing of value. The jury were in a very much better position than the members of this court. The-admissibility of the testimony on cross-examination, in which great latitude is allowed, rested largely in the-discretion of the trial court, and we do not think its-discretion has been abused. If, however, we had been of a different opinion, and this were the only error assigned, we would not, for this cause only, reverse the-case, but treat it as harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">In speaking of the opinion evidence rule, it is well said in 3 Wigmore on Evidence (1st ed.), sec. 1929:-\u201cUnder this rule we accomplish little by enforcing it. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>and we should do no harm if we dispensed with it. We accomplish little, because, from the side on which the witness appears and from the form of the question his answer \u2014 that is, his opinion \u2014 may often be inferred. We should do no harm because, even when the final opinion or inference is admitted, the inference amounts in force usually to nothing unless it appears to be solidly based on satisfactory data, the existence \u2022and quality of which we can always bring out, if desirable, on cross-examination. Add to this that, under the present liberal application of the rule, and \u2022the practice as to new trials, a single erroneous ruling upon the single trifling answer of one witness out of a dozen or more in a trial occupying a day may overturn the whole result and cause a double expense of time, money and effort; and we perceive the absurdly unjust effects of the rule. And, finally, the utter impossibility of a consistent application of the rule, and \u2022 consequent uncertainty of the law, and we understand how much more it makes for injustice rather than .justice. \u2022 It has done more than any other rule of procedure to reduce our litigation to a state of legalized : gambling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The question mentioned in bill of exception No. 4, concerning the effect of hypnotism, related to a technical matter about which it was not shown that the witness had any technical knowledge or information. He was a mere lay witness, with no greater knowledge on the subject of hypnotism than members of the jury. They could draw inferences and make deductions as well as he, and probably more impartially. 22 Corpus Juris, 604; <em>Paine </em>v. <em>Aldrich, </em>133 N. Y. 544, 30 N. Y. 725.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">Moreover, the accused himself was unwilling to say that he had been hypnotized, though in the light of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>events he admitted that he had done \u201ca lot of foolish things.\u201d On this subject he testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-4\">\u201cBy a juror:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-5\">\u201cQ. Father Denis, do you believe in hypnotism?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-6\">\u201cA. I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-7\">\u201cQ. Do you believe that Miss Crump had the power to hypnotize people?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-8\">\u201cA. I do not know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-9\">\u201cQ. Did you ever feel you were under her influence to such extent you were hynotized?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-10\">\u201cA. I was under her influence to the extent that I did a lot of foolish things. Whether that is hypnotism, I cannot tell.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-11\">\u201cQ. You will not say you were hypnotized?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-12\">\u201cA. I cannot prove it; neither can.I prove the contrary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-13\">\u201cBy Mr. Satterfield:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-14\">\u201cQ. Have you been a student of hypnotism?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-15\">\u201cA. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-16\">\u201cQ. Do you know anything about it yourself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-17\">\u201cA. No, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-18\">Much of what is said in discussing bill of exception No. 3 applies also to bill of exception No. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-19\">Exceptions 6 and 7 relate to the testimony of Mr. Underwood, of the Colonial Stationery Company to' the effect that the blank forms afterwards filled out and converted into the certificates of deposits mentioned' in the indictment were printed by his company on. the personal order of Miss Crump, and charged to the-accused by her direction. The specific objection was. that it was not \u201cadmissible at this time to show in what name it stands on his books. That is not bidding on us.\u201d That the accused should be first connected with the printing before the evidence offered could be-in troduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>The accused was charged with forging and uttering as true two certificates of deposits purporting to have been issued by the First National Bank of New York, and th\u00e9 manifest object of this testimony was to show the guilty knowledge of the accused as to the certificate which he had negotiated. It was entirely competent to show this by circumstantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">Watts, the attorney for Miss Crump, saw her almost daily for several months, and nearly or quite always in the presence of the accused. The accused and Miss Crump had adjoining rooms in the same house, and she conferred with him on practically everything relating to her alleged large estate. Watts had already testified to these intimate business relations, and to the effect that the accused was, for the most part, a mouthpiece of Miss Crump. He further testified that when efforts to raise money on one of her numerous trust settlement's failed, it was suggested by one of the bankers that Miss Crump get a certificate of deposit on New York and use it as collateral for any loan she might desire to make; that when the suggestion was made the accused asked him, in the presence of Miss Crump, to get him a certificate of deposit from one of the local banks; that he otbained a typewritten copy of such certificate and \u201chanded it to either one or the other, they both present and both read the copy * * * I believe though I gave it to Father Denis and then he handed it to Mis,s Crump, and there was a little talk about it, but both were certainly there when I returned with <em>it\u201d </em>This took place on April 21. Watts further testified on the subject as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-6\">\u201cA. The copy was furnished by me to them on Saturday, the 21st of April. The printed certificates were exhibited to me for the first time on Wednesday, April 25th.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>\u201cQ. Do you mean blank or filled in?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-4\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Just like they are now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-5\">\u201cBy Mr. Satterfield:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-6\">\u201cQ. Like they are now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-7\">\u201cA. With the exception of the endorsements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-8\">\u201cQ. I mean those printed certificates?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-9\">\u201cA. Fully filled out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-10\">\u201cQ. In whose possession were they?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-11\">\u201cA. I would like to lead up to that a little bit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-12\">\u201cQ. All right; any explanation that is pertinent and proper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-13\">\u201cA. After this copy was furnished to them we were having a watchful waiting policy until these came.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-14\">\u201cQ. Did you know they were coming?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-15\">\u201cA. I was told that the certificates would come from New York.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-16\">\u201cQ. By whom?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-17\">\u201cA. By either one or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-18\">\u201cQ. In the presence of each other?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-19\">\u201cA. Oh, surely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-20\">\u201cQ. Don\u2019t you recall who said they were going to come from New York?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-21\">\u201cA. Well, I couldn\u2019t recall every little detail connected with it, but the statement was made in my presence by either qne ef them. Both of them heard the statement and both, as well as I remember, commented upon the certificates coming from New York and we must wait until they get here from New York. I know everybody was anxiously waiting for these certificates to come from New York, and on the morning of April 25 th, Wednesday, the same day that Father Kennedy was coming from New York \u2014 he is one of the beneficiaries in one of these trust papers for $25,000; he was coming here from New York and we were going down to the Main street station at twelve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>something to meet him \u2014 that morning sometime after nine o\u2019clock I received a telephone message at my offie telling me to come right up to 4 east Cary, that fthe certificates had arrived.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-4\">\u201cQ. Were you on the \u2019phone?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-5\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-6\">\u201cQ. Who was at the other end of the \u2019phone?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-7\">\u201cA. I think Father Denis may have called me; I think I talked to both of them on the \u2019phone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-8\">\u201cQ. They told you they had arrived?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-9\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-10\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>What did you do then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-11\">\u201cA. I immediately went up to 4 east Cary and we were all in the same room \u2014 in the back room again.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-12\">The forged certificates were copied from the certificate furnished by Watts, and the printing was done \u201cduring the week of April 21st.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-13\">We do not doubt the admissibility of the testimony for the purpose of showing the probability of the accused\u2019s knowledge of the forgery or participation therein, or both. The authorities relied on in the petition are not applicable to the instant ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-14\">The eighth exception was to the exclusion of a letter written by a half-brother of Miss Crump to some person named \u201cJack,\u201d January 14, 1924,.eight months after the offense alleged to have been committed by the accused. The connection in which the admissibility of this letter arose can be best gathered from some quotations from the testimony of the witness, who was then under cross-examination by counsel for the accused.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-15\">\u201cQ. Not only that, but after your sister was discharged from the asylum, she tried to get another priest into trouble, didn\u2019t she?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-16\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t know anything about that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-17\">\u201cQ. I am going to see if you don\u2019t know. I am sure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>you do know. Don\u2019t you know that she took up a priest \u2014 tried to get up a correspondence with a Catholic priest at Scranton, Pennsylvania, and began writing him about giving him a golden chalice and giving him vestments and all that sort of thing? I have got the letters here, and have got your letter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-4\">\u201cA. If you have them, all right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-5\">\u201cQ. Isn\u2019t that true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-6\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t know if she wrote. I don\u2019t know what was in the letters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-7\">\u201cQ. I will ask you this first, if you didn\u2019t write this man \u2014 whose name was Jack, wasn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-8\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-9\">\u201cQ. And he is a friend of yours?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-10\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-11\">\u201cQ. This friend she was writing to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-12\">\u201cA. Yes; I helped him out a great deal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-13\">\u201cQ. When you found your sister was writing to him he wrote to you and complained about it, didn\u2019t he?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-14\">\u201cA. He wrote to me and asked me who this party was and I wrote and told tim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-15\">\u201cQ. Here is the letter. I will ask you if that isn\u2019t the letter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-16\">\u201cA. I wrote and told him she was of unsound mind, to pay no attention to her; that she was of unsound mind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-17\">\u201cQ. What?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-18\">\u201cA. I wrote him to absolutely disregard her because she was of unsound mind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-19\">\u201cQ. That is your handwriting. Read it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-20\">The last question was objected to by the prosecuting attorney and the objection was sustained and the .accused excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-21\">The letter the accused asked to have read was' as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>\u201cRichmond, Va. 1/14.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-4\">\u201cDear Jack:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-5\">\u201cDelighted to hear from you. Will say I have not heard from you for a long time, regarding your question; boy that is my half-sister. She lost her mind sometime ago and has been in the insane sanatorium but is now home for a while.. I am at a loss to know why she wrote you, please ignore any and all letters she writes you. She has given me no end of trouble. I hope you are doing fine boy. When you write me write to the office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-6\">\u201cAs ever yours,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-7\">\u201cBenj. A. Leigers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">It is so plain that the accused could not have been injured by the exclusion of the letter that it is useless to discuss it.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">The ninth exception was to the exclusion of any answer by Dr. Moseley to the following question put to.him by counsel for the accused: \u201cWere they (visitations of Miss Crump) of such character as to impress Father Denis or Father Callery, or any one else?\u201d The anticipated answer of the witness is not given, and we do not know what it would have been. He might have answered that he did'not know. The bill of exception, therefore, points out no error committed by the trial court. <em>Faris </em>v. <em>Dupont De Nemours &amp; Co., </em>123 Va. 88, 92, 96 S. E. 164; <em>Lynchburg Cotton Mills </em>v. <em>Rives, </em>112 Va. 137, 142, 70 S. E. 542; <em>Douglas Land Co. </em>v. <em>Thayer, </em>107 Va. 292, 58 S. E. 1101.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">The tenth exception was to the refusal of the trial judge to permit Dr. Moseley to answer a question. Dr. Moseley was the attending physician of Miss Crump and had testified in chief that he had not called in a consulting physician because Miss Crump did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>wish it, or had forbidden it. On cross-examination he testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-4\">\u201cQ. Why did you say none of them would allow you to have any consulting physician at first?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-5\">\u201cA. I have just stated to' you that the girl refused.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-6\">\u201cQ. First you said that none of them would allow you to have any consulting physician. Now you say the girl was responsible. Just explain why you say that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-7\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t think it was the wish of Father Denis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-8\">\u201cQ. As a matter of fact, didn\u2019t he say it was his wish for you not to have any consulting physician?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-9\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t think he was consulting his wish at all; I think he was consulting the girl\u2019s wish.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-10\">\u201cQ. I am asking you to give a direct answer. Did he or not say he didn\u2019t want any consulting physician?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-11\">\u201cA. Yes; he said he didn\u2019t.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-12\">On re-direct examination he testified as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-13\">\u201cQ. But that was after Miss Crump had said positively she would not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-14\">\u201cA. Positively refused repeatedly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-15\">\u201cQ. So what he said was carrying out her wishes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-16\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-17\">\u201cQ. Is that true or not?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-18\">Exception was taken to the refusal to permit an answer to the last question.- In view of the answer to the next preceding question, there could have been but one answer, and that was \u201cyes,\u201d to the last question. If there was any error it was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-19\">Exceptions 12 and 15 relate to the production of Miss Crump in court and the remarks of the prosecuting attorney. She had been adjudged insane and sent to the hospital in Staunton, but was at her home in Richmond on parole. During the trial and after it had been shown by the accused that Miss Crump was a very frail, delicate little woman, about five feet, one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>inch tall, weighing from seventy to ninety pounds, and about twenty-eight to thirty years of age, and after much testimony had been given as to her influence over the accused, one of the jurors inquired: \u201cIn order that the jury might observe this woman, would it be in order to have her here? The object of the question was that we might observe her personality.\u201d The court then inquired of counsel on each side: \u201cDo you desire a summons issued for her?\u201d and each responded: \u201cI don\u2019t want her.\u201d Thereupon the court directed a subpoena to be issued for her with a view of probably putting her on the stand as a \u201ccourt witness.\u201d When Miss Crump appeared in court on a later date, the following proceeding was had:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-5\">\u201cThe court: There are two questions that arise in this case. In the first place, from the testimony in this case it would be involved in this alleged criminal transaction and she could not be compelled to testify if her testimony would tend to incriminate her; in the second place, there is an allegation of her insanity.

They had no right to draw any conclusion from her appearance. It was not an issue in the ease. It was not relevant to the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">\u201cHer appearance there in July, 1924, may have been and do'ubtless was entirely different from what it was in the winter and spring of 1923. The circumstances and environment under which she appeared to the jury, excited, frightened and humiliated, as she certainly was, .and then known to the jury as a trickster and a fraud were entirely different from those under which she. appeared to the accused with a halo of piety, and if you please a nimbus of wealth and charity, a person of high importance attended by her personal attorney, physician and nurse. The contrast was greatly to the prejudice of the accused. It was an unfair contrast as it was also an altogether unusual proceeding in a court room.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">It is also assigned as error that the trial court failed to take any action in reference to the statement of the prosecuting attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">When Miss Crump appeared in court and the court made the remark about the two questions that arose, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>a juror interposed the statement: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t my intention to have Miss Crump testify, but just to observe her personality,\u201d and counsel for the accused said: \u201cWe offer no objection at all. I don\u2019t know how far it is legal.\u201d This disposes of the objection to the mere appearance of Miss Crump before the jury. If no objection was offered then, it is too late to offer any now.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">It seems clear that the object of the judge in interrogating Miss Crump was to determine whether or not he would have her put on the stand as a witness. As soon as he ascertained that she was a lunatic on parole, he declined to put her on. The specific answer to the question objected to was stricken out, and the jury told to disregard it. There was nothing in this procedure which could have been prejudicial to the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">The remarks of the prosecuting attorney were equally harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\"> Exception was taken to instructions 1, 2 and 5, given by the court, and to the refusal of the court to give instructions A and B, tendered by the accused; and the ruling of the trial court thereon is assigned as error. Instructions 1 and 2 are copied in the margin, i</p>\n<p id=\"b613-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>The chief objection to instructions 1 and 2, in fact the only substantial objection, is that there is no evidence in the record on which to base them. The close intimacy of the parties and their daily conferences are important matters to be taken into consideration. The certificates of deposit, were not printed on safety paper, such as is used by banks, but the paper was sleazy, and one of the certificates bore interest at six per cent, a fact so improbable with a New York bank with $250,-000,000 of deposits as to render the paper suspicious. Hotchkiss called the attention of the accused to the unusual condition of the paper. Litehford also \u201ccalled his attention to the fact that I was rather unfavorably impressed with its appearance.\u201d P. B. Watts and Donald Register were also very unfavorably impressed with the appearance of the certificates. In fact, the certificates of deposits which were in evidence before the jury, carried on their faces such evidence of falseness as would impress any one of ordinary intelligence. Add to this the testimony of J. Leicester Watts that the accused asked him to obtain for him a certificate of deposit; that he obtained a typewritten copy and delivered it to the accused in the presence of Miss Crump; that they had \u201ca little talk about it;\u201d that \u201cafter this copy was furnished to them we were having a watchful waiting policy until these came;\u201d that he was told by Miss Crump, or the accused, or both of them, \u201cthat the certificates would . come from New York; that the copy was furnished by Watts on April 21; that the printing was done about this time; that the certificates in controversy were identical with the copy furnished by Watts, and that they were shown to Watts on April 25, by Miss Crump, in the presence of the accused, with the statement that they had been received that morning; that the accused had stated to Watts and also to Dr. Cosby that he knew the money <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>claimed by Miss Crump was in New York because he had seen it and could swear to it; that all of these things transpired before the accused negotiated the certificate upon which he obtained a loan of $1,000. When these facts, and others appearing in the record, are taken into consideration, they furnished ample support for the instructions complained of. The case could only be proved by circumstantial' evidence, but the fact that much of the evidence was circumstantial was no objection to it. <em>Walker </em>v. <em>State, </em>127 Ga. 48, 56 S. E. 113, 8 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1175, 119 Am. St. Rep. 314; <em>State </em>v. <em>Henderson, 29 </em>W. Va. 147, 1 S. E. 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">It was for the jury to determine whether it was sufficient to satisfy them beyond a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused. The accused was amply protected by the instructions of the court on the subject of reasonable doubt. The doctrine of reasonable doubt was ridden to exhaustion.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Instruction 5, given by the trial court, was as follows:. \u201cThe jury are instructed that if from the evidence they are satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt that the prisoner either actually and personally made the alleged forged instrument, or was actually present, aiding,, abetting and assisting some other person to do so, with the felonious intent as charged in the indictment when the alleged forged writing was made, they should find him guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">The objection made to the instruction was that, it makes it a crime to forge a paper with felonious intent, even though it never gets out of the forger\u2019s possession; that there is no evidence to support it, and that it was wrong as an abstract proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">We have already seen that there was abundant evidence to support the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">As to the forgery of the certificates: In 2 Bishop\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>New Criminal Law, see. 602, p. 343, it is said: \u201cForgery, though a substantive crime, partakes, as already observed, of the nature of attempt; therefore, the making alone of the false writing, with the evil intent, is sufficient. No fraud need be actually perpetrated, and there <em>need be no </em>uttering.\u201d (Italics supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">In 13 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. L. (2d ed.), p. 1102, it is said: \u201cThe forging of an instrument and the uttering thereof are distinct and separate offenses, and the offense of uttering is not a necessary element of forgery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">In 7 Cyc., p. 1390, it is said: \u201cA person may be convicted of forgery by having possession of a forged instrument with intent to defraud, although never uttered by him.\u201d To the same effect see <em>State </em>v. Hathorn, 166 Mo. 229, 65 S. W. 756; <em>Perkins </em>v. Commonwealth, 7 Gratt. (48 Va.) 651, 56 Am. Dec. 123.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Instruction 5 is manifestly taken from an instruction given in <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra, </em>and is nearly a copy of it. In a written opinion refusing a writ of error in the Perkins ease, it is said: \u201cThe matters of law stated by the court in that instruction are correctly stated.\u201d See also instructions approved in <em>Chahoon\u2019s Case, </em>20 Gratt. (61 Va.) 733, 744.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">The trial court committed no error in giving instruction No. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">It is assigned as error that the trial court refused to give instruction \u201cA,\u201d which is as follows: \u201cThe court instructs the jury that the fact that the defendant stated that he had seen the money in New York raised no presumption that he forged the certificate's of deposits, or that he used them, knowing the same to be forged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">The whole subject of presumption, as applied to the facts of the case, was fully covered by other instructions granted by the court, and the instruction is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>obnoxious to the further objection that it singled out and called attention to a part only of the evidence and the fact it tended to prove, and omitted all reference to a volume of evidence tending to raise a different presumption. <em>Norfolk, etc., Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna, etc., Co., </em>124 Va. 221, 98 S. E. 43; <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Comonwealth, </em>129 Va. 751, 105 S. E. 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">The refusal of the trial court to grant instruction \u201cB,\u201d tendered by the accused, is also assigned as error.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">That instruction was as follows: \u201cThe court instructs the jury \u2018that the fact that a forged certificate of deposit was found in the defendant\u2019s possession, and that he uttered'or used the same, raises no presumption of law in itself that he forged the same.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">The only argument advanced in support of the instruction is the following quotation from Underhill on Evidence (3d ed.), section 629: \u201cThe fact that a forged writing is found in the defendant\u2019s possession raises no presumption of law that he forged it or any other writing.\u201d Citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Miles, </em>22 Idaho 166, 124 P. 786; <em>Fox </em>v. <em>People, </em>95 Ill. 71; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>State, </em>51 Ind. 405; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>State, </em>71 Fla. 338, 71 So. 280.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">The eases cited do not support the <em>text </em>quoted. In <em>Miller </em>v. <em>State, </em>71 Fla. 338, there was no evidence that the defendant ever had possession of the forged instrument, or that he could write at all. In <em>Miller </em>v. <em>State, </em>51 Ind. 405, the distinction is drawn between possession of negotiable paper with forged endorsement in blank and which would pass from hand to hand by mere delivery, and the possession of such paper where the name of the maker was forged. <em>State </em>v. <em>Miles, </em>22 Idaho 166, 124 Pac. 786, makes the same distinction, and <em>Miller </em>v. <em>State, </em>51 Ind. 405, is relied on as its sole authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>In <em>State </em>v. <em>Miles, </em>it is said: \u201cThe State has sought to raise a legal presumption that he forged the endorsements by reason of the fact that he cashed the check and admits cashing the check at Hartdegan.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">\u201cThis presumption is claimed on the theory that one who passes a forged instrument vouches for and certifies to its genuineness. This is undoubtedly true as to the maker of the instrument, but the rule certainly cannot prevail to the extent here claimed with reference to an endorsement. This check was endorsed in blank, and, after a cheek is once endorsed in blank by the payee, it can lawfully pass from hand to hand without further endorsement. Section 3491, R. O,, It would be a dangerous rule of law to announce that anyone who cashes a cheek on which the name of the payee has been forged is himself presumed to have forged the name of the payee thereon. This is a very different presumption from that of passing an instrument forged in its inception and to which the maker\u2019s name has been forged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">In <em>Fox </em>v. <em>People, </em>95 Ill. 71, it was held that the mere possession of a forged instrument of itself and unsupported by proof of an intent to defraud, will not warrant a conviction of forgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">In none of these cases was' there an uttering of an instrument in which the name of the maker was forged.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">On the other hand there are a number of cases taking a different view from that expressed by Underhill. The possession of the forged instrument is likened to the possession of goods recently stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Britt, </em>14 N. C. 122, it is said: \u201cIt is next to impossible that the defendant could get possession, of such an. instrument as this, purporting to be for his own benefit, without having fabricated or aided in the fabrication of it. If the instrument be a forgery, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>who holds it under such circumstances is taken to be the forger, unless he shows the contrary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Peterson, </em>129 N. C. 556, 40 S. E. 9, 85 Am. St. Rep. 756, it was held that where one is found in the possession of a forged instrument, endeavoring to obtain money or advances upon it, this raises a presumption that he either forged it or consented to its forgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">To the same effect see <em>State </em>v. <em>Jestes </em>(N. C.), 117 S. E. 385, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>152 Mo. 115, 53 S. W. 424, 75 Am. St. Rep. 441, it was held that \u201cone who is recently in possession of and attempts to sell or obtain money on a forged note is presumed to have forged the same, and, unless such possession or forgery is satisfactorily explained, the presumption becomes conclusive.\u201d For reason of the rule see <em>State </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>116 Mo. 556, 22 S. W. 792.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Pyscher, </em>179 Mo. 140, 77 S. W. 836, it was held that the possession of the forged instrument by the defendant, and -the claim of title thereunder, raises a presumption that the defendant was the forger.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">In <em>Hobbs </em>v. <em>State, </em>75 Ala. 1, it is said: \u201cOne found in the possession of a forged instrument of which he purported to be the beneficiary, and applying it to his own use, must, in the absence of explanation, be presumed to have fabricated it, or to have been privy to its fabrication. It is difficult to conceive that he could have the possession unless he had fabricated it, or assented to its fabrication and the presumption grows stronger where he uses or attempts to use it.\u201d Other cases are to the same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">The trial court committed no error in refusing instruction \u201cB.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">The petition for the writ of error concludes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>thus: \u201cWe had intended to discuss the question as to whether there was sufficient evidence to support the. verdict, but this petition is already' too long, and without in any way waiving the importance and merit of this question, we are forced to forego presentation of this point.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">This, of course, is not an assignment of error, and cannot be treated as such, but we have been compelled to examine the whole record in order to pass upon \u2022questions properly raised, and hence are able to say that even if this matter had been properly assigned we could have afforded no relief. At the first trial of this ease there was a \u201chung jury,\u201d at the second, the verdict and judgment now under review were rendered, and whatever may be our views upon the weight of the evidence, we are unable to say that the verdict is either without evidence to support it, or that it is plainly contrary to the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Upon the whole case we are of opinion to affirm the ..judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b612-7\"> \u201cThe court instructs the jury that if they believe from the evidence and all the surrounding circumstances, beyond all reasonable doubt, that the accused had the blank certificate of deposit of the First National Bank of New York printed at the Colonial Printing Shop, and that he filled up said blank certificates and signed the names thereto, or was present and aided or assisted any other person in doing so, that he did utter or attempt to utter and employ it as a true and genuine certificate of deposit of the First National Bank of New York, with intent as charged in the indictment, then they should find the accused guilty.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b612-8\"> \u201cThe court instructs the jury that if they believe from the evidence and all the surrounding circumstances as shown-by the evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the accused had knowledge of the printing of the blank certificates of deposits of the First National Bank of New York, although he never actually gave the order personally to the printing company, and that he filled up said certificate, or was present and aided and assisted any other person in so doing, and that he afterwards uttered or attempted to utter and employ it as true and genuine, with intent to defraud as charged in the indictments, they should find the accused guilty.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
