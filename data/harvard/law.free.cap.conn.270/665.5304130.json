Ballard alleged racial discrimination by the defendants. The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint. The commission, acting through a presiding human rights referee (referee), granted the motion to dismiss. The commission, acting through its office of commission counsel, appealed to the Superior Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-183 (a)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and 46a-94a (a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court dismissed the appeal as to Ballard only, on the ground of mootness,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> sustained the commission\u2019s appeal on the jurisdictional issue, and remanded the case to the commission for further proceedings. These appeals followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">The defendants and the commission appealed separately from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeals to this court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1. The defendants\u2019 appeal challenges the trial court\u2019s determination that the commission has jurisdiction over the complaint before it. The commission\u2019s appeal challenges the trial court\u2019s determination that the appeal is moot as to Ballard. Although neither of these questions is free from difficulty, we conclude that: (1) the appeal is not moot as to Ballard; and (2) the commission has jurisdiction over Ballard\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">For purposes of these appeals, the following facts and procedural history are undisputed. In December, 1997, Ballard, an African-American senior student at the high school, filed a sworn complaint with the commission alleging racial discrimination. Specifically, Ballard alleged that on October 9, 1997, he and a friend were called \u201cnigger\u201d by a white student, and a fight among the three students ensued. As a result of the altercation, Ballard and his friend were suspended from school for three days, but the white student was not suspended, in violation of the provision in the school handbook requiring the suspension of all students involved in fights. The complaint alleged further that, upon returning to school on October 16,1997, the racial harassment against Ballard continued on a daily basis, with the white student calling Ballard names and threatening him, and that, when Ballard complained to Neagle, he told Ballard that he would document the information. According to the complaint, the harassment continued on a daily basis, and was reported to Neagle. On October 21, 1997, Ballard and his mother met with Neagle, who told them that it was one student\u2019s word against another\u2019s, and that nothing would be done about the harassment. At that point, Ballard \u201chad to withdraw from\u201d the high school. Ballard then withdrew from Cheshire High School, and later graduated from Hamden High School. In his complaint, Ballard also specifically requested that the commission \u201cinvestigate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>my complaint, secure for me my rights as guaranteed to me . . . and secure for me any remedy to which I may be entitled.\u201d In the prayer for relief portion of the complaint form, Ballard specifically requested \u201cmoney damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint, and in May, 2000, the referee granted the motion, on the ground that exclusive jurisdiction over complaints based on racial discrimination in the public schools is vested in the state board of education (state board). The commission appealed from the dismissal to the trial court, but Ballard, who had been served as a party to the appeal, neither filed his own appeal nor joined the commission\u2019s appeal. The trial court concluded that: (1) the appeal was moot as to Ballard; and (2) contrary to the referee\u2019s conclusion, the commission has jurisdiction over the complaint. Accordingly, the court dismissed the appeal as to Ballard, sustained the commission\u2019s appeal, and remanded the case to the commission for further proceedings on the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">Before reaching the substantive question of whether the commission has jurisdiction over the complaint in the present matter, we necessarily address two preliminary, subject matter jurisdictional questions, namely: (1) whether the trial court\u2019s remand to the commission was a final judgment for purposes of our appellate subject matter jurisdiction;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and (2) whether the appeal is moot as to Ballard. We conclude that: (1) the remand was a final judgment for purposes of appeal; and (2) the appeal is not moot as to Ballard.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">We first address the question of the finality of the trial court\u2019s remand. This question requires us to reexamine two of our recent cases, namely, <em>Lisee </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>258 Conn. 529, 782 A.2d 670 (2001), and <em>Morel </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Public Health, </em>262 Conn. 222, 811 A.2d 1256 (2002). Both cases involved remands by the trial court in administrative appeals pursuant to the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (UAPA), General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">In <em>Lisee </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>supra, 258 Conn. 533, the trial court had issued a remand pursuant to \u00a7 4-183 (h).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We were called upon to determine the meaning of the final sentence of \u00a7 4-183 (j),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> which provides: \u201cFor purposes of <em>this section, </em>a remand is a final judgment.\u201d (Emphasis added.) See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number><em>Lisee </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportuni</em>ties, supra, 534-35. That sentence had been added to the UAPA by virtue of No. 88-317, \u00a7\u00a7 23 and 107, of the 1988 Public Acts. <em>Lisee </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>supra, 534-35. We held that, despite the use of the word \u201csection,\u201d which would have rendered <em>all </em>remands pursuant to \u00a7 4-183 final judgments irrespective of the particular subsection of \u00a7 4-183 on which the trial court relied in issuing its remand order, the legislature intended that sentence to apply only to remands issued pursuant to <em>subsection </em>Q) of \u00a7 4-183. Id., 539.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">We also stated in <em>Lisee, </em>in dictum, that, when the legislature inserted the last sentence in \u00a7 4-183 (j), it intended to codify our prior decision in <em>Schieffelin &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Liquor Control, </em>202 Conn. 405, 521 A.2d 566 (1987), \u201cas it applies to remands after rulings on the merits of an administrative appeal.\u201d <em>Lisee </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>supra, 258 Conn. 541-42. <em>In Schieffelin &amp; Co., </em>we distinguished, for purposes of appellate finality, between two different types of such remands: (1) those in which the trial court had determined that the administrative ruling was in error and ordered further administrative proceedings on that very issue; and (2) those in which the trial court had concluded that the administrative ruling was in some way incomplete and therefore not ripe for final adjudication, for example, where the court required further administrative evidentiary findings \u201cas a precondition to final judicial resolution of all the issues between the parties.\u201d <em>Schieffelin &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Liquor Control, </em>supra, 410. In this regard, remands falling under the former category would constitute final judgments for purposes of appeal, but those falling under the latter category would not. Id. Thus, after <em>Lisee, </em>a trial court\u2019s remand, even if issued pursuant to subsection (j) of \u00a7 4-183; see footnote 10 of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>opinion; would constitute a final judgment for purposes of appeal only if it satisfied the test in <em>Schieffelin &amp; Co.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">In <em>Morel </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Public Health, </em>supra, 262 Conn. 230-31, we reaffirmed this reading of <em>Lisee, </em>as requiring the application of the <em>Schieffelin &amp; Co. </em>test to remands issued pursuant to \u00a7 4-183 (j). Furthermore, we expanded on that test by stating that it must be applied on a case-by-case basis, and that \u201can essential part of the test is the effect that the remand has on the rights of the party who seeks to appeal from it.\u201d Id., 232. Thus, under that test, in order to determine the finality of such a remand, a reviewing court would have to examine the nature of the remand, including the nature of the administrative proceedings, if any, that would be expected to follow it. Id., 232-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">If we were to apply <em>Lisee </em>and <em>Morel </em>to the trial court\u2019s remand in the present case, it is doubtful that it would constitute a final judgment for purposes of appeal. We conclude, however, that, to the extent that <em>Lisee </em>and <em>Morel </em>rest on the notion that, by enacting the last sentence of \u00a7 4-183 (j), namely, \u201c[f]or purposes of this section, a remand is a final judgment,\u201d the legislature intended to codify the <em>Schieffelin &amp; Co. </em>test for finality, those cases were wrongly decided, and we now disavow the dictum to that effect in <em>Lisee, </em>and we overrule the holding to that effect in <em>Morel.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Accordingly, we conclude that, where the court issues a remand pursuant to \u00a7 4-183 (j), the remand is a final judgment for purposes of appeal, irrespective of both the nature of the remand and the administrative proceedings that are expected to follow it. Thus, because the remand in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>present case was issued pursuant to \u00a7 4-183 (j), it was a final judgment for purposes of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">We recognize the power and importance of the doctrine of stare decisis, particularly when the precedent in question involved the interpretation of a statute. <em>Waterbury </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>260 Conn. 506, 538, 800 A.2d 1102 (2002) (\u201c[T]he doctrine of stare decisis counsels that a court should not overrule its earlier decisions unless the most cogent reasons and inescapable logic require it. . . . In assessing the force of stare decisis, our case law has emphasized that we should be especially cautious about overturning a case that concerns statutory construction.\u201d [Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.]). Nonetheless, we conclude that, for the reasons that follow, this is one of those exceptional cases where, having become aware of the clear error of our ways, it is wiser to correct our errors now, rather than wait for the legislature to do so. See <em>Conway </em>v. <em>Wilton, </em>238 Conn. 653, 662, 680 A.2d 242 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">First, as we have indicated, our statement in <em>Lisee </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>supra, 258 Conn. 541-42, that, by adding the final sentence to \u00a7 4-183 (j), the legislature intended to codify our earlier decision in <em>Schieffelin &amp; Co., </em>was dictum. Having already concluded that the reference in that final sentence of \u00a7 4-183 (j) to \u201cthis section\u201d really meant \u201cthis subsection (j),\u201d it was not necessary for us to address whether the language at issue was intended to codify <em>Schieffelin &amp; Co. </em>because the trial court\u2019s remand in <em>Lisee </em>had been issued pursuant to subsection (h) of \u00a7 4-183, and not pursuant to subsection (j) thereof. Indeed, both this court and the Appellate Court previously had stated that \u201cthe UAPA now provides that <em>any </em>remand to the administrative [agency] is a final judgment for purposes of an appeal. General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (j); see <em>Connecticut Resources Recovery </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection, </em>233 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>Conn. 486, 496, 659 A.2d 714 (1995).\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Jones </em>v. Crystal, 242 Conn. 599, 602 n.4, 699 A.2d 961 (1997); see also <em>Johnston </em>v. <em>Salinas, </em>56 Conn. App. 772, 774 n.4, 746 A.2d 202 (2000); <em>Dacey </em>v. <em>Commissioner on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>41 Conn. App. 1, 5, 673 A.2d 1177 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">Second, there was simply no basis, in either the language of \u00a7 4-183 (j) or its legislative history, for our statement that the legislature intended to codify our decision in <em>Schieffelin &amp; Co. </em>Indeed, in neither <em>Lisee </em>nor <em>Morel </em>did we cite to any such language or history. To the contrary, we are now persuaded, on the basis of both that language and its legislative history, that the legislature intended to eliminate the kind of case-by-case determination that had been required under the <em>Schieffelin &amp; Co. </em>rubric.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">The language of the last sentence of \u00a7 4-183 (j) is inconsistent with an intention to codify <em>Schieffelin &amp; Co. </em>Section 4-183 (j) provides in relevant part: \u201cFor purposes of this section, a remand is a final judgment.\u201d This is inclusive and categorical language. Under <em>Schieffelin &amp; Co., </em>however, some remands are final judgments and others <em>are </em>not, depending on their nature and the scope of the ensuing administrative proceedings that they contemplate. The inclusive and categorical nature of the legislative language is not suggestive of the kind of fact-specific inquiry that would be required by an application of the <em>Schieffelin &amp; Co. </em>test. Put another way, if the legislature had intended to codify that test, we would expect to see a legislative formulation cast in terms similar to those used in its judicial formulation. What we see, however, is quite different\u2014 a categorical statement that \u201ca remand is a final judgment,\u201d suggesting instead an intention to depart from the prior case-by-case, fact-specific jurisprudence represented by <em>Schieffelin &amp; Co.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b696-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>This conclusion is supported by the legislative history of \u00a7 4-183 (j), which we did not address in either <em>Lisee </em>or <em>Morel.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Section 4-183 (j) was enacted as part of Public Act 88-317. Thus, it was part of the legislative \u201ccomprehensive revision of the UAPA, based upon recommendations made after nearly three years of study and review by the Connecticut law revision commission. See 31 H.R. Proc., Pt. 21, 1988 Sess., p. 7320, remarks of Representative Martin Looney; Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 1, 1988 Sess., p. 185, remarks of David Biklen, executive director of the Connecticut law revision commission; 1987 Thirteenth Annual Report of the Connecticut Law Revision Commission to the General Assembly, March, 1988, p. 31 (Law Revision Commission Report).\u201d <em>Tolly </em>v. <em>Dept. of Human Resources, </em>225 Conn. 13, 26, 621 A.2d 719 (1993). The general purpose of that comprehensive revision was \u201cto modify the prior law so as to simplify and make more fair the process of appealing an agency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>decision under the UAPA.\u201d Id., 29-30; see <em>Glastonbury Volunteer Ambulance Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>227 Conn. 848, 853, 633 A.2d 305 (1993). In enacting this revision, the legislature was \u201cheed[ing] . . . pleas for greater simplicity and fairness in the administrative appeal process.\u201d <em>Tolly </em>v. <em>Dept, of Human Resources, </em>supra, 30-31 n.10. It is consistent with that general purpose of simplification to interpret the language of \u00a7 4-183 (j) to mean what it categorically says, namely, that a remand under that section is a final judgment, without resort to the complexities of the <em>Schieffelin &amp; Co. </em>test; and it would be inconsistent with that purpose to interpret it as codifying those complexities.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">Furthermore, the Law Revision Commission Report explaining the 1988 revisions addressed this very question in a way that suggests that our dictum in <em>Lisee </em>was incorrect. In discussing the scope of judicial review under the revised subsection (j) of \u00a7 4-183 where an agency action is required by law, the law revision commission stated: \u201cSubsections (j) and (k) rewrite former subsection (g) for clarity, but the standards for sustaining an appeal\u2014formerly in subsection (g)\u2014are not changed. A court must affirm the agency\u2019s decision unless substantial rights of the person appealing have been prejudiced in one of six circumstances. If the court finds such prejudice, it must sustain the appeal. Ordinarily, the court would take no other action. <em>The court may, however, remand the case to the agency for further proceedings (such a remand is a final judgment), or, if a particular action is required by law, modify Ihe agency decision or order a particular agency action. </em>(See <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>138 Conn. 464 [86 A.2d 67 (1952)].)\u201d (Emphasis added.) Law Revision Commission Report, supra, p. 40; see Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 2, 1988 Sess., p. 386. Two aspects of this statement of the law revision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>commission axe significant. First, the law revision commission itself used the categorical language that \u201ca remand is a final judgment,\u201d without reference to the noncategorical <em>Schieffelin &amp; Co. </em>test. Law Revision Commission Report, supra, p. 40. \u201cGiven the makeup of the advisory drafting committee of the commission, we must presume that, when the commission reported to the legislature that [a remand is a final judgment] . . . the commission was aware of the jurisdictional implications of that\u201d statement. (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Glastonbury Volunteer Ambulance Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 856-57. Second, the citation to <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>supra, 464, as an example of a remand being a final judgment, belies any intention to codify the <em>Schieffelin &amp; Co. </em>test, because <em>Watson </em>was a case in which the trial court\u2019s remand was held to be a final judgment, despite the fact that it most likely would not have satisfied the <em>Schieffelin &amp; Co. </em>test.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">In addition, policy considerations counsel that, having come to the conclusion that the last sentence of \u00a7 4-183 (j) does not codify <em>Schieffelin &amp; Co., </em>we should correct the error now. If we were to adhere to stare decisis and continue to follow <em>Lisee </em>and <em>Morel, </em>it would mean that many remands issued by the trial court would not be final judgments for purposes of appeal. That would mean, in turn, that, in any case in which the trial court improperly remanded the case for further administrative proceedings, but under circumstances that did not meet the <em>Schieffelin &amp; Co. </em>criteria for finality, the administrative agency would be required to undergo further proceedings that it would not otherwise have had to conduct. Such unnecessary proceedings would be a waste of administrative resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>Finally, \u201c[t]he arguments for adherence to precedent are least compelling . . . when the rule to be discarded may not be reasonably supposed to have determined the conduct of litigants . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Conway </em>v. <em>Wilton, </em>supra, 238 Conn. 661. Our prior decisions in <em>Lisee </em>and <em>Morel, </em>regarding the application of the <em>Schieffelin &amp; Co. </em>test, are not the type of decision that generates a significant reliance interest. It cannot be reasonably maintained that litigants have formed their conduct on the basis of whether a judicial remand constituted a final judgment for purposes of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">We next consider the question of mootness with respect to Ballard\u2019s appeal. The commission, in its appeal, claims that the trial court improperly dismissed the appeal as to Ballard individually on the ground of mootness. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">Before addressing the mootness issue, however, we consider, and ultimately reject, the defendants\u2019 preliminary claim that Ballard has waived any right that he may have had to obtain relief from the board. This claim is based on the fact that Ballard: (1) failed to file his own appeal from the decision of the commission; and (2) failed to participate in the commission\u2019s appeal.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Therefore, the defendants argue, Ballard \u201cignored his responsibility to protect his own rights and appeal the [presiding human rights] [r]eferee\u2019s decision . . . [and] he has waived his right to independently pursue any relief against the [defendants].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b700-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>There is no question that pursuant to \u00a7 46a-94a (a),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Ballard, as the original complainant, could have filed his own separate appeal from the commission\u2019s dismissal of his complaint. There is also no question that, having been served as a party to the commission\u2019s appeal, Ballard could have either filed his own appearance therein, or formally moved to be made a party thereto. These facts do not mean, however, as the defendants\u2019 argument suggests, that Ballard\u2019s failure to do so amounted to a waiver of any right to benefit personally from any relief that the commission may ultimately secure on his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">As the commission points out, under its statutory regime, the commission, and not the original complainant, carries the laboring oar in investigating, attempting to mediate, presenting, and ultimately administratively adjudicating, a claim of discrimination filed by an individual complainant. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46a-82, 46a-83, 46a-83b, 46a-84, 46a-86, 46a-89 and 46a-90. Indeed, it was not until 1989 that General Statutes \u00a7 46a-84 (d) authorized a complainant to \u201cbe represented by an attorney of his own choice\u201d; see Public Acts 1989, No. 89-332; and even in that event, the complainant\u2019s attorney may only present the case to the extent that \u201cthe Attorney General or the commission counsel, as the case may be, determines that the interests of the state will not be adversely affected . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 46a-84 (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">Our cases have recognized the primary role of the commission in enforcing our laws barring discrimination. For example, we have recognized the commission\u2019s institutional interest in the \u201cintegrity of [its] decision-making process and its ability to carry out its responsibilities . . . [which include] protecting the public interest as well as individual complainants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>. . . .\u201d <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>257 Conn. 258, 265-66, 777 A.2d 645 (2001). Thus, we recognize that, in enforcing the laws against discrimination, the commission acts in a dual role: it protects both the public interest and the private complainant. Id., 266; see <em>Groton </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>169 Conn. 89, 100, 362 A.2d 1359 (1975) (\u201ccommission clearly is empowered by statute to prosecute complaints on issues of public interest\u201d); see also General Statutes \u00a7 46a-103 (commission may intervene as matter of right in private action brought by previously released complainant). We have also specifically acknowledged that not all of the \u201cvictims of various forms of discrimination\u201d are represented by counsel. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>supra, 283. Indeed, in the present case, there is no indication that Ballard was ever represented by counsel. Finally, we have referred to the commission\u2019s \u201cfirst-order administrative oversight and enforcement [of claims of discrimination, and its] . . . initial responsibility for the investigation and adjudication\u201d of such claims. <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, </em>196 Conn. 208, 216, 491 A.2d 1096 (1985). The complaint form that Ballard filed with the commission further acknowledged this primary role. On that form, he requested that <em>the commission </em>investigate his complaint, and that <em>the commission </em>secure for him any rights or remedies to which he may have been entitled, including damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">On the basis of these considerations, we are not persuaded that, when the enforcement of our laws against discrimination shifts from the administrative level to the judicial level, by way of an appeal from a commission decision, the complainant forfeits his rights to future benefits from the commission\u2019s ultimate decision by not formally participating in the appeal, either by filing his own appeal or formally inteivening, or by filing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>his own appearance therein. To hold otherwise would mean, in practical terms, that a complainant who was not represented by counsel before the commission and thereby relied on the commission\u2019s primary role to protect his rights at the administrative level, must engage counsel in order to maintain that protection, at both the judicial level and, if the case were to return to the commission, at the ensuing administrative level. It would also mean that the failure of the individual complainant formally to participate in an appeal would strip the commission of that part of its mission dedicated to vindicating individual rights against discrimination. There is nothing in either the statutory scheme or in sound policy to justify such a conclusion. Put another way, the commission\u2019s role of protecting both the public interest and the interest of the complainant does not change simply because its decision has been appealed to the courts, irrespective of whether the complainant formally participates in the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">We turn, therefore, to the question of whether, under the circumstances of this case, the appeal is nonetheless moot as to Ballard. This question turns on whether the commission, assuming that it has jurisdiction to adjudicate Ballard\u2019s complaint, can afford him some practical remedy or form of relief, because the absence of such a remedy or relief would, nonetheless, render the case moot as to him. It is axiomatic that, when events have occurred that preclude a court from granting practical relief to a party through a disposition on the merits, the case is moot. <em>Blesso Fire Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Eastern Connecticut State University, </em>245 Conn. 252, 256, 713 A.2d 1283 (1998). The same is ordinarily true of an administrative agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">The commission claims that the present case is not moot as to Ballard because, if it finds that the defendants engaged in a discriminatory practice, it could award compensatory damages to him pursuant to Gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>eral Statutes \u00a7 46a-86 (c).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Specifically, the commission contends that, because it has jurisdiction to adjudicate Ballard\u2019s complaint pursuant to \u00a7 46a-58 (a);<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> see footnote 2 of this opinion; it may award compensatory damages, such as damages for emotional distress or loss of dignity, pursuant to \u00a7 46a-86 (c).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>argue, to the contrary, that the commission does not have the authority under \u00a7 46a-86 (c) to award Ballard personal compensatory damages of the sort claimed by the commission; rather, the defendants assert, that statute expressly limits the relief to monetary costs that are actually incurred by the complainant. Thus, the defendants contend, \u00a7 46a-86 does not authorize the award of any damages that would be applicable to Ballard\u2019s case. Although we need not specify the precise type of compensatory damages the commission may award to Ballard, we agree with the commission that \u00a7 46a-86 (c) authorizes it to award some appropriate form of compensatory damages to him upon a finding that the defendants engaged in a discriminatory practice pursuant to \u00a7 46a-58 (a).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">This presents a question of statutory interpretation, over which our scope of review is plenary. <em>Paul Dinto Electrical Contractors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>266 Conn. 706, 714-15, 835 A.2d 33 (2003). \u201cThe process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. In seeking to determine that meaning, we look to the words of the statute [s] [themselves], to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding [their] enactment, to the legislative policy [they were] designed to implement, and to [their] relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Courchesne, </em>262 Conn. 537, 577, 816 A.2d 562 (2003). \u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>(Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Paul Dinto Electrical Contractors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>supra, 715-16.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">We first note that the specific statutory section upon which the commission\u2019s authority to adjudicate Bal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>lard\u2019s claim of racial discrimination rests is \u00a7 46a-58 (a). Section 46a-58 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cIt shall be a discriminatory practice in violation of this section for any person to subject, or cause to be subjected, any other person to the deprivation of any rights, privileges or immunities, secured or protected by the Constitution or laws of this state or of the United States, on account of . . . race . . . .\u201d This is broad and inclusive language, and strongly suggests a reference to the broad and inclusive panoply of rights, privileges and immunities, derived from a broad and inclusive set of sources, namely, any federal or state laws, or either or both constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">With that backdrop in mind, we turn to the language of \u00a7 46a-86 (c), which relates to the damages that a complainant may suffer. We conclude that the language of that statute strongly suggests that compensatory personal damages may be awarded upon a finding of a discriminatory practice in violation of \u00a7 46a-58 (a). The pertinent language of \u00a7 46a-86 (c) provides: \u201cIn addition to any other action taken hereunder, upon a finding of a <em>discriminatory </em>practice prohibited by section 46a-58 . . . the presiding officer [of the commission] shall determine <em>the damage suffered by the complainant </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, the language of \u00a7 46a-86 (c) specifically refers back to \u00a7 46a-58 as one of the statutory bases for an award of \u201cdamage suffered by the complainant\u201d;<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and the broad and inclusive language of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>\u00a7 46a-58 (a), with its references to such a broad range of constitutional rights, suggests that an award of compensatory damages for a violation thereof need not necessarily be confined to easily quantifiable monetary losses.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">Furthermore, following the reference to \u00a7 46a-58 in \u00a7 46a-86 (c) are specific references to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46a-59, 46a-64, 46a-64c, 46a-81b, 46a-81d and 46a-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>81e. See footnote 16 of this opinion. Those sections deal generally with discrimination in certain professional or occupational organizations; General Statutes \u00a7 46a-59; in certain places of public accommodation; General Statutes \u00a7 46a-64; in housing; General Statutes \u00a7 46a-64c; in certain professional or occupational organizations on the basis of sexual orientation; General Statutes \u00a7 46a-81b; in certain places of public accommodation on the basis of sexual orientation; General Statutes \u00a7 46a-81d; and in housing on the basis of sexual orientation. General Statutes \u00a7 46a-81e. Many of these latter statutory references invoke types and loci of discrimination that might lend themselves, more readily than the general discrimination prohibited by \u00a7 46a-58 (a), to assessment of damages that would be calculable in terms of monetary loss. This combination of statutory cross-references helps to explain the language of \u00a7 46a-86 (c) that the \u201cdamage suffered by the complainant . . . shall <em>include, but not be limited to, </em>the expense suffered by the complainant for obtaining alternate housing or space, storage of goods and effects, moving costs and other costs actually incurred by him as a result of such discriminatory practice and shall allow reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">The legislative genealogy and history of \u00a7 46a-86 (c) further support the conclusion that it authorizes the commission to award compensatory damages upon a finding of a violation of \u00a7 46a-58 (a). The pertinent language at issue in \u00a7 46a-86 (c) derives originally from No. 756, \u00a7 1, of the 1967 Public Acts (P.A. 756),<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>amended General Statutes (Rev. to 1967) \u00a7 53-36. Public Act 756 expanded the authority of the commission, in cases in which it has found discrimination in public accommodations and housing practices; General Statutes (Rev. to 1967) \u00a7 53-35, now \u00a7 46a-64; and professional licensing; General Statutes (Rev. to 1967) \u00a7 53-35a, now \u00a7 46a-59; by giving the commission the specific authority, \u201cin addition to any other action which it may take . . . [to] determine the damage suffered by the complainant, which damage shall include but not be limited to the expense incurred by the complainant for obtaining alternative housing or space, storage of goods and effects, moving costs, attorney\u2019s fees and any other costs actually incurred by him as a result of such unlawful practice.\u201d P.A. 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">The legislative history of this 1967 legislation, although not determinative, is suggestive of a legislative intent that the commission\u2019s authority to determine the damages arising from the commissioner\u2019s finding of a discriminatory practice be broadly, rather than narrowly, construed. Representative William J. Laveiy, in presenting the bill to the floor of the House of Representatives, stated: \u201cTo be brief . . . this bill would give to a person whose rights have been violated the right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>ask civil damages in a court of equity, a Circuit Court. This will be brought after a hearing has been held by a hearing tribunal of the state civil rights commission and this civil rights commission will bring this action in the [Circuit [C]ourt representing the individual, this bill is a good bill and a bill that is protective of a human dignity and rights of every citizen of our state and I urge its adoption.\u201d 12 H.R. Proc., Pt. 11, 1967 Sess., p. 5366. The references to \u201cthe right to ask civil damages in a court of equity,\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and to the bill as \u201cprotective of [the] human dignity and rights of every citizen of our state\u201d; id.; suggest this legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">Subsequently, in 1975, the legislature amended General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 53-36 by adding General Statutes \u00a7 53-34, which is the statutory antecedent to \u00a7 46-58 (a),<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> to the list of specific civfi rights statutes for which the commission could award damages. See Public Acts 1975, No. 75-462.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Thus, as of 1975, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>commission had the authority to award damages in cases involving violations of what is now \u00a7 46a-58, namely, the broad and inclusive panoply of sources of civil rights enumerated therein; as well as for violations of persons\u2019 rights under the public accommodations and professional licensing statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Thereafter, in 1980, the legislature enacted No. 80-422 of the 1980 Public Acts (P.A. 80-422), which was a general codification and technical revision of the statutes governing the commission.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> This voluminous act contained fifty sections and consisted of twenty-five pages of codifications and revisions. Section 34 (c)<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> of P. A. 80-422 transformed what had been the last sentence of General Statutes (Rev. to 1979) \u00a7 53-36 into what is now \u00a7 46a-86 (c).<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>Thus, this legislative history and genealogy support our conclusion that \u00a7 46a-86 (c) authorizes an award of compensatory damages for a violation of \u00a7 46a-58. First, the legislative history embodied in Representative Lavery\u2019s comments indicate an intent to authorize a broad, rather than a limited, scope of damages, including damages protective of the \u201cdignity\u201d of an individual. 12 H.R. Proc., supra, p. 5366. Second, the genealogy suggests an ongoing legislative process of expanding the commission\u2019s authority to award damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">The general remedial purpose of the antidiscrimination statutes as enforced by the commission supports this interpretation of \u00a7 46a-86 (c). That purpose is, in general, to construct a remedy for discrimination \u201cthat will, so far as possible, eliminate the discriminatory effects of the past as well as bar like discrimination in the future. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>211 Conn. 464, 478, 559 A.2d 1120 (1989); see <em>Bridgeport Hospital </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>[232 Conn. 91, 111, 653 A.2d 782 (1995)]; <em>Civil Service Commission v. Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>195 Conn. 226, 230-31, 487 A.2d 201 (1985).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities v. Truelove &amp; Maclean, Inc., </em>238 Conn. 337, 350, 680 A.2d 1261 (1996). It would be consistent with that purpose to read the language of \u00a7 46a-86 (c) to mean that the commission has the authority to award personal compensatory damages. Indeed, the present case presents a powerful argument for reading that language in that fashion. According to his complaint, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>Ballard was the victim of racial discrimination, as a result of which he was treated differently from the white students and was suspended for three days. If his complaint is proven, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain what precise monetary losses he incurred. Nonetheless, an award of money damages, where statutorily authorized, does more than remedy the past discrimination; it also serves as an important social deterrent to future discriminatory conduct. See <em>Albemarle Paper Co. </em>v. <em>Moody, </em>422 U.S. 405, 418, 95 S. Ct. 2362, 45 L. Ed. 2d 280 (1975) (\u201c[w]here racial discrimination is concerned, the [district] court has not merely the power but the duty to render a decree which will so far as possible eliminate the discriminatory effects of the past as well as bar like discrimination in the future\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Thus, reading the language of the statute so as to afford the commission the authority to fashion some alternative personal award of damages for the alleged violation in the present case\u2014i.e., something beyond monetary costs actually incurred by the complainant\u2014would be consistent with the remedial purpose of remedying past discrimination, while also discouraging future discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">Finally, although we have not specifically decided whether \u00a7 46a-86 (c) permits an award of personal compensatory damages; see <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities </em>v. <em>Truelove &amp; Maclean, Inc., </em>supra, 238 Conn. 348 n.15; we do not write on a completely blank slate. In <em>Bridgeport Hospital </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 92-93, we concluded that the commission did not have the authority to award damages for emotional distress and attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 46a-86 (a).<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Our reasoning in that case is, nonetheless, highly instructive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>on whether personal compensatory damages may be awarded under \u00a7 46a-86 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\"><em>In Bridgeport Hospital, </em>the commission had ordered damages for emotional distress and attorney\u2019s fees upon a finding that the respondent hospital had engaged in discrimination prohibited by General Statutes \u00a7 46a-60 (a) (l),<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> which prohibits discrimination in employment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>Id., 96. The commission claimed that it could order such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>awards because \u00a7 46a-86 (a) vested the commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>with authority \u201cto issue an order requiring . . . the respondent to take such affirmative action as . . . will effectuate the purpose of . . . chapter [814c] . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 100. We rejected this claim, however, because we agreed with the respondent\u2019s argument that \u00a7 46a-86 (a) \u201ccannot include <em>an authorization to award compensatory damages, </em>other than what is expressly authorized in subsection (b), or attorney\u2019s fees <em>because of the express restriction on the availability of such awards to cases brought under the specific statutes enumerated in subsections (c) and (d)'</em><footnotemark><em>33</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Emphasis added.) Id. Throughout our opin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>ion, we emphasized the reasoning that compensatory damages <em>could </em>be sought for violations of the specific statutes listed in subsections (c) and (d) of \u00a7 46a-86. See, e.g., id., 103-104 (No. 91-58 of 1991 Public Acts amended \u00a7 46a-86 [c] to grant commission authority to award compensatory damages and attorney\u2019s fees for discrimination based on sexual orientation); id., 106 (compensatory damages and attorney\u2019s fees included within protective scope of \u00a7 46a-86 [c] and [d]); id., 113 (\u00a7 46a-86 [c] and [d] provide for compensatory damages and attorney\u2019s fees for specific forms of discrimination). Our reasoning, therefore, was that it would be inappropriate to interpret the general language, \u201ctake such affirmative action,\u201d which is contained in \u00a7 46a-86 (a), so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>as to include the power to award compensatoiy damages and attorney\u2019s fees, precisely <em>because </em>compensatory damages and attorney\u2019s fees <em>were </em>awardable for the violations of those statutes listed under \u00a7 46a-86 (c) and (d). Thus, on the basis of our reasoning in <em>Bridgeport Hospital, </em>because \u00a7 46a-58 <em>is </em>specifically listed in \u00a7 46a-86 (c), upon a finding of a violation thereof by the commission in the present case, it is authorized to award compensatory damages to Ballard.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">The defendants contend, to the contrary, that the commission is not authorized to award compensatory personal damages to Ballard pursuant to \u00a7 46a-86 (c). This contention has four bases, and we disagree with all of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">The defendants first argue that the \u201cdamages that are specifically enumerated within ... \u00a7 46a-86 (c) do not apply\u201d to Ballard. Specifically, the defendants assert that: (1) subsection (c) of \u00a7 46a-86 explicitly authorizes damages for only \u201cthe expense incurred by the complainant for obtaining alternate housing or space, storage of goods and effects, moving costs and other costs actually incurred by him\u201d; (2) these expenses are authorized for violating \u00a7 46a-59 (discrimination in professional license associations), \u00a7 46a-64 (discriminatory public accommodation practices prohibited), \u00a7 46a-64c (discriminatory housing practices prohibited), \u00a7 46a-81d (sexual orientation discrimination in public accommodations prohibited) and \u00a7 46a-81e (sexual orientation discrimination in housing prohibited); and (3) these specifically enumerated remedies are applicable only to these claims and not to \u201cvictims of discrimination in the public schools.\u201d There are several flaws in this analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">First, it ignores the specific reference in \u00a7 46a-86 (c) to a violation of \u00a7 46a-58. We fail to see how this is any less a specific reference than are the references to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>other statutes in the same sentence of \u00a7 46a-86 (c). Indeed, by its reference to \u201cthe Constitution or laws of this state or of the United States,\u201d \u00a7 46a-58 (a) necessarily encompasses other constitutional or statutory provisions, as the case may be, that may lend themselves more readily to damages <em>other than </em>expenses actually incurred by the complainant, such as moving expenses. Second, the defendants\u2019 assertion disregards the language of \u00a7 46a-86 (c) that describes the types of damages that may be recovered, namely, that \u201cthe presiding officer shall determine the damage suffered by the complainant, which damage shall include, <em>but not be limited </em>to\u201d the enumerated expenses that follow. (Emphasis added.) See <em>Hatt v. Burlington Coat Factory, </em>263 Conn. 279, 309-10, 819 A.2d 260 (2003) (\u201c[statutes must be construed, if possible, such that no clause, sentence or word shall be superfluous, void or insignificant\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). The practical effect of the defendants\u2019 interpretation would be that the \u201cdamage suffered by the complainant\u201d <em>would </em>be <em>limited to </em>those enumerated expenses, contrary to the express language of \u00a7 46a-86 (c). Third, as previously discussed, this contention of the defendants ignores our reasoning in <em>Bridgeport Hospital </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 98, that \u00a7 46a-86 (c) authorizes the award of personal compensatory damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">The defendants next argue that, under the doctrine of ejusdem generis, the listing of the specific types of monetary losses in \u00a7 46a-86 (c) means that the legislature intended to limit the remedies under \u00a7 46a-86 (c) to out-of-pocket expenses, which do not include such personal compensatory damages as the commission seeks in the present case. Although in certain instances the doctrine of ejusdem generis may accurately express a legislative intent to narrow the meaning of otherwise more inclusive legislative language, we disagree that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>does so here.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> First, it would unduly narrow the types of remedies available for a violation of \u00a7 46a-58, which, as we previously have indicated, contemplates a wide range of misconduct. Second, it would be inconsistent with the broad remedial purpose of the statute. Third, like the defendants\u2019 first contention, it renders superfluous the \u201cinclud[ing], but not be limited to\u201d language contained in \u00a7 46a-86 (c). Fourth, and also like the defendants\u2019 first contention, it would ignore our reasoning in <em>Bridgeport Hospital </em>that the specific language of \u00a7 46a-86 (a), which does not include compensatory damages, is to be contrasted with the language of \u00a7 46a-86 (c), which does. Finally, as we have noted, the legislative history of P.A. 756, which added the language on which both the defendants and the dissent rely for the application of ejusdem generis, is devoid of any intent to adopt that doctrine, and, instead, suggests, by its references to the statute as being \u201cprotective of [the] human dignity and rights of every citizen of our state\u201d; 12 H.R. Proc., supra, p. 5366, remarks of Representative Lavery; a broad interpretation, as opposed to the cramped interpretation offered by the dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">In this regard, we disagree with the defendants\u2019 reliance on our decision in <em>Chestnut Realty, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>201 Conn. 350, 364-66, 514 A.2d 749 (1986). In that case, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>respondent realty company had discriminated against the complainant on the basis of race in 1977, in violation of the Public Accommodation Act; General Statutes \u00a7 46a-64; by refusing to permit him to purchase a subdivision lot that was for sale. <em>Chestnut Realty, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>supra, 354. The commission, in 1983, ordered the respondent to give the complainant an option to purchase a similar lot for the 1977 sale price. Id. We affirmed the trial court\u2019s reversal of the commission\u2019s order because \u201cthe purpose of actual damages <em>in a fair housing case </em>is to put the plaintiff in the same position, so far as money can do it, as he would have been had there been no injury or breach of duty, that is, to compensate him for the injury actually sustained.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 365. Thus, we stated that \u201cmeasuring damages by the appreciation in land from the time of an alleged act of discrimination to the time of trial goes well beyond injuries actually sustained . . . [would result] in creating a windfall profit to the complainant . . . [and would be] punitive in nature . . . .\u201d Id., 366. <em>Chestnut Realty, Inc., </em>cannot support the defendants\u2019 position in the present case, however. First, this is not a fair housing case. Second, the discrimination in that case was under \u00a7 46a-64, the specific public accommodation law, not \u00a7 46a-58, the general and broadly inclusive civil rights statute. Third, the commission in <em>Chestnut Realty, Inc., </em>did not make a general compensatory damage award under \u00a7 46a-86 (c); rather, the award was simply economic in nature, and the court was undoubtedly correct that an economic award cannot properly be punitive or result in a windfall to the complainant. Thus, the proper inquiry in <em>Chestnut Realty, Inc., </em>was not <em>if </em>the complainant was entitled to damages, but rather, <em>how to measure </em>those damages\u2014and measuring damages by the appreciation in land went beyond \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>damage suffered by the complainant\u201d in that case. General Statutes \u00a7 46a-86 (c). That does not mean, however, that, in a case such as this, where there may be no economic harm, the commission may not award appropriate noneconomic damages, such as emotional distress. Indeed, as we have indicated, our reasoning in <em>Bridgeport Hospital </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 98, is plainly to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">The defendants\u2019 third contention is that there is nothing in the legislative history indicating a legislative intent to authorize general compensatory damages, such as emotional distress damages, under \u00a7 46a-86 (c). In this regard, the defendants focus, not on the legislative history of \u00a7 46a-86 (c), which, as we have indicated, does suggest such an intent, but, instead, on the legislative history of \u00a7 46a-58, and its statutory predecessor, General Statutes \u00a7 53-34. The short answer to this contention is that the absence of an expression in the legislative history of \u00a7 46a-58 to permit personal compensatory damages cannot survive that statute\u2019s specific inclusion, beginning in 1975, and continuing with its inclusion in the technical revision of 1980, to the list of statutory violations that will specifically permit the award of compensatory damages under \u00a7 46a-86 (c). Public Act 75-462; P.A. 80-422, \u00a7 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">The defendants\u2019 final argument is that Ballard did not include a claim for compensatory damages, such as those for emotional distress, in his original complaint. This argument fails because a complaint to the commission is not like a complaint in a civil action filed in court. A complaint to the commission simply triggers the commission\u2019s evaluative, investigative and adjudicative functions. Thus, the formal requirements of pleading in civil actions filed in court do not apply to complaints filed with the commission. Indeed, as we have noted, the complainant need not have, and often <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>will not have, an attorney, as was the case here. Once the complaint is filed, it is the primary responsibility of the commission to evaluate it for sufficiency, investigate it, and, if mediation fails and probable cause is found, prosecute it. Moreover, in the present case, Ballard specifically requested \u201cmoney damages\u201d in his complaint. There is nothing in the applicable statutory scheme, or its purpose, that requires that the complaint spell out any particular form of relief that may be awarded, let alone any particular form of money damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">We now turn to the underlying jurisdictional issue in the present case, namely, whether the commission has jurisdiction over Ballard\u2019s complaint. The defendants claim, in their appeal, that the commission has no jurisdiction over a complaint alleging discrimination against a student in the public schools, and that the trial court\u2019s conclusion to the contrary was improper. Specifically, the defendants argue that exclusive administrative jurisdiction over such complaints lies with the state board pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 10-4b and 10-15c; see footnotes 3 and 4, respectively, of this opinion for the text of those statutes; and that, therefore, the commission has no jurisdiction over such a complaint pursuant to \u00a7 46a-58 (a). The commission contends, to the contrary, that \u00a7 46a-58 (a) gives the commission the authority to vindicate students\u2019 rights against discrimination in the public schools that are protected by \u00a7 10-15c. We conclude that the commission has authority, under \u00a7 46a-86 (c), to vindicate public school students\u2019 rights in the case of the type of racial discrimination alleged in the present case, namely, a discrete course of allegedly discriminatory conduct by school personnel and the local board of education, pursuant to \u00a7 46a-58 (a), on the basis of the protection of those rights by \u00a7 10-15c.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>We begin with the language of \u00a7 46a-58 (a), which provides: \u201cIt shall be a discriminatoiy practice in violation of this section for any person to subject, or cause to be subjected, any other person to the deprivation of any rights, privileges or immunities, secured or protected by the Constitution or laws of this state or of the United States, on account of religion, national origin, alienage, color, <em>race, </em>sex, blindness or physical disability.\u201d (Emphasis added.) As we previously discussed, the statute uses broad and inclusive language. The repeated use in \u00a7 46a-58 (a) of the word \u201cany\u201d\u2014\u201cany person,\u201d \u201cany other person,\u201d and \u201cany rights, privileges or immunities, secured or protected by the Constitution or laws of this state or of the United States\u201d\u2014indicates an intention to protect a broad and inclusive range of persons from broadly specified forms of discrimination by a broad and inclusive range of actors. Although the word \u201cany\u201d sometimes may, because of its context, mean \u201csome\u201d or \u201cone\u201d rather than \u201call,\u201d \u201c[i]ts meaning in a given statute depends on the context and subject matter of the law.\u201d <em>Duguay </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>191 Conn. 222, 229, 464 A.2d 45 (1983); see also <em>King </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>203 Conn. 324, 334, 524 A.2d 1131 (1987) (as used, \u201c \u2018any\u2019 \u201d means \u201c \u2018all\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018every\u2019 \u201d). We think that its repeated use here in the context of a remedial statute counsels abroad, rather than a narrow, meaning. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities </em>v. <em>Sullivan Associates, </em>250 Conn. 763, 782, 739 A.2d 238 (1999) (remedial statutes to be construed liberally to effectuate legislative intent). Thus, the language strongly suggests that it applies to the alleged discrimination in the present case, namely, discriminatory conduct against a student on the basis of race in the public schools by a principal and local board of education in violation of \u00a7 10-15c. There is nothing in the statute\u2019s language to suggest an implied exception that would relate to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>Furthermore, the broadly defined subject matter of the statute\u2019s protection, namely, the deprivation of all of the rights, privileges or immunities secured by both the state and federal laws and constitutions, strongly suggests that it applies to a discrete course of conduct constituting racial dfecrimination against a student in a public school by educational officials, in violation of \u00a7 10-15c. It is difficult to maintain that the language of this statute does not reach, and as the defendants and the dissent maintain, has <em>never </em>reached, any form of racial discrimination against a student by educational officials in a public school, when the legal source of that protection is a particular state statute, such as \u00a7 10-15c.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">The genealogy of \u00a7 46a-58 (a), which we already have discussed in part I B of this opinion, points strongly in the same direction, because it indicates a consistent history of the statute\u2019s retaining its core protection\u2014 the rights, privileges or immunities secured by the state or federal laws or constitutions\u2014while expanding both the ways in which its core protection may be enforced and the types of discrimination to which it applies. The origin of \u00a7 46a-58 (a) lies in chapter LXXXVI of the 1884 Public Acts, which was entitled \u201cAn Act relating to Civil Rights,\u201d and provided: \u201cEvery person<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> who subjects or causes to be subjected any other person to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>protected by the constitution or laws of this state, or of the United States, on account of such person being an alien, or by reason of his color or race, shall be punished by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars, or by imprisonment not more than one year, or both.\u201d The act was codified almost verbatim as General Statutes (1887 Rev.) \u00a7 1418, with only stylistic changes.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">In 1967, as previously discussed in part I B of this opinion, the legislature amended General Statutes (Rev. to 1967) \u00a7 53-36 to give the commission the additional authority to award damages for violations of our statutes prohibiting discrimination with regard to public accommodations and professional licensing. See P.A. 756. This legislation was preceded by legislative history indicating that it have broad remedial consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Then, in 1974, discrimination on the basis of sex was added to the list of prohibitions enumerated in General Statutes (Rev. to 1973) \u00a7 53-34, now \u00a7 46a-58. Public Acts 1974, No. 74-80.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">In 1975, Public Acts 1975, No. 75-462 was enacted. That enactment specifically amended General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 53-36, which was the precursor to \u00a7 46a-86 (c), to authorize the commission to exercise its powers upon a complaint of a violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 53-34, which was the specific statutory predecessor of \u00a7 46a-58 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">The legislative history of this 1975 legislation is instructive. In explaining it to the House of Representa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>fives, Representative Thomas C. Clark described \u00a7 53-34, now \u00a7 46a-58, as \u201cthe Civil Rights Statute of the State of Connecticut,\u201d and explained that the act \u201cwould extend . . . the powers of the [commission] to enforce\u201d violations of \u00a7 53-34. 18 H.R. Proc., Pt. 10, 1975 Sess., pp. 4808-4809. Representative Clark further explained that, \u201cunder the current [s]tatute, the [commission has a right to receive complaints ... for [a] violation of [\u00a7] 53-34, but it does not have the right to prosecute those to completion under its own laws. This Bill will enable [the commission] to do so.\u201d Id., p. 4809.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">Thus, after this 1975 legislation, there can be no doubt that the legislature intended the commission to have its full panoply of powers to enforce the broad civil rights protections afforded by what is now \u00a7 46a-58. Furthermore, given the breadth of the language of that statute, the fact that it was legislatively regarded as our state\u2019s civil rights statute, and the fact that the history of the development of the battle against racial discrimination in this nation was so deeply rooted in constitutional litigation over public schools, we cannot impute an intention to the legislature that the broad language and the specific enforcement power in the commission would, nonetheless, not apply to a discrete course of conduct amounting to racial discrimination by educational officials in our own public schools. Accordingly, we conclude that since 1975, the commission has had the statutory authority to investigate and adjudicate such claims of racial discrimination against students by such officials in the public schools of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">In 1977, blindness and physical disability were added to \u00a7 46a-58 (a) as specifically protected conditions; Public Acts 1977, No. 77-278; and in 1980, religion and national origin were added as specifically protected classes. Public Acts 1980, No. 80-54. In 1980, the statute was transferred from title 53 of the General Statutes to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>its current location in title 46a.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> See P.A. 80-422, \u00a7 7; General Statutes (Rev. to 1981) \u00a7 46a-58 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">Two things stand out from this histoiy. First, from the beginning, the language and purpose of \u00a7 46a-58 (a) have been consistently broad and inclusive. The statute has long been this state\u2019s fundamental civil rights statute, with a purpose to cast a broad net of protection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>for all persons from discrimination. Second, whenever the statute has been amended substantively, the effects of the amendments have been to give the commission the power to enforce the statute and to broaden its coverage so as to reach additional forms of discrimination. This history supports the interpretation that \u00a7 46a-58 (a) applies to racial discrimination against a public school student by his principal and board of education. Indeed, given the history of the civil rights movement in this nation, it would be anomalous to construe our state\u2019s fundamental civil rights statute to have had an implied exception for the type of racial discrimination involved in the present case, particularly when neither the language, the purpose nor the history of the statute suggests any such implied exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">The defendants maintain, however, that the commission has no administrative jurisdiction over complaints regarding racial discrimination in the public schools because such jurisdiction lies exclusively with the state board pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 10-4b and 10-15c. See footnotes 3 and 4, respectively, of this opinion for the text of those statutes. More specifically, the defendants argue that: (1) the legislative histories of \u00a7\u00a7 10-15c, 10-4b and 46a-58 indicate a legislative intent for \u00a7\u00a7 10-15c and 10-4b, on the one hand, and \u00a7 46a-58 (a), on the other hand, to apply to different types of discrimination, with only \u00a7\u00a7 10-15c and 10-4b specifically applying to public schools; (2) the specific provisions of \u00a7 10-15c prevail over the general provisions of \u00a7 46a-58; (3) legislative silence following the commission\u2019s rulings that it lacked such jurisdiction indicates a legislative approval thereof; and (4) the fact that the state board has the special expertise to resolve issues involving the public schools indicates a legislative intent to locate in the state board the exclusive jurisdiction over such complaints. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>Before addressing the defendants\u2019 arguments specifically, we note two factors that, in our view, cut across and undermine all of those arguments. The first factor involves the relative histories and genealogies of \u00a7 46a-58 (a), on the one hand, and \u00a7\u00a7 10-15c and 10-4b, on the other hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">As previously discussed, \u00a7 46a-58 (a) enjoys a long and distinguished pedigree as the fundamental civil rights statute of our state. In addition, in 1975, the legislature specifically gave the commission the authority to use its full powers to enforce the statute\u2019s prohibitions against discrimination, and that enactment carried with it the authority to investigate and, if necessary, adjudicate complaints of a specific course of conduct amounting to racial discrimination against students by educational officials in the public schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">It is true, as the defendants point out, that \u00a7 10-15c has an equally long and distinguished pedigree establishing that, as a substantive matter, our public schools must be free of racial and other forms of discrimination. Chapter CVIII of the 1868 Public Acts provided in relevant part: \u201cThe public schools . . . shall be open to all persons . . . and no person shall be denied admittance to an instruction in any public school ... on account of race or color . . . .\u201d This act was first codified in 1875 as chapter II of the General Statutes, entitled \u201cDuties of Towns.\u201d General Statutes (1875 Rev.) c. II, pp. 128-29. This commitment against discrimination in the public schools continued in the following genealogy: Public Acts 1877, c. LXIV; Public Acts 1884, c. LXVII; General Statutes (1887 Rev.) \u00a7 2118; Public Acts 1895, c. CXIX; Public Acts 1897, c. Cl; Public Acts 1899, c. 54; General Statutes (1902 Rev.) \u00a7 2130; General Statutes (1918 Rev.) \u00a7 851; Public Acts 1921, c. 45; General Statutes (1930 Rev.) \u00a7 833; General Statutes (1931 Rev.) \u00a7 82a; General Statutes (1933 Rev.) \u00a7 157b; General Statutes (1935 Rev.) \u00a7 185c; General Statutes (1949 Rev.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>\u00a7 1349. Following the renumbering of the General Statutes in 1958, General Statutes (1958 Rev.) \u00a7 10-15 first appeared, which provided in relevant part that the \u201cpublic schools shall be open to all children over six years of age without discrimination on account of race or color . ...\u201d In 1975, with the enactment of No. 75-284 of the 1975 Public Acts, the legislature amended \u00a7 10-15 by adding \u201csex, religion or national origin\u201d to race or color as protected classes.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">In 1978, the legislature, by virtue of No. 78-218, \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 10, of the 1978 Public Acts, transferred the prohibition against discrimination from \u00a7 10-15 to the newly created General Statutes (Rev. to 1979) \u00a7 10-15c, which provided in relevant part: \u201cThe public schools shall be open to all children five years of age and over without discrimination on account of race, color, sex, religion or national origin . . . .\u2019\u2019In 1979, the legislature amended \u00a7 10-15c by adding the provision that \u201ceach such child shall have an equal opportunity to participate in the activities, programs and courses of study in . . . public schools\u201d without discrimination. Public Acts 1979, No. 79-128, \u00a7 12; General Statutes (Rev. to 1980) \u00a7 10-15c. In 1980, \u00a7 10-15c was again amended to require public school authorities to advise students of their rights to receive an equal educational opportunity without discrimination; Public Acts 1980, No. 80-405, \u00a7 1; General Statutes (Rev. to 1981) \u00a7 10-15c; and in 1997, the legislature added sexual orientation to the classes of students protected from discrimination. Public Acts 1997, No. 97-247, \u00a7 6; General Statutes \u00a7 10-15c.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">Section 10-15c, however, whether in its original form or in its current form, has never contained a specific remedy or set of remedies for a violation of its proscriptions against discrimination. For that, as the defendants acknowledge, we must turn to \u00a7 10-4b. That statute\u2019s pedigree, however, is less lengthy and distinguished than that of \u00a7 10-15c.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>The statutory predecessor to \u00a7 10-4b was derived from No. 690 of the 1969 Public Acts. Section 1 of Public Act 690 provided that \u201cthe educational interests of the state shall include, but not be limited to, the concern of the state (1) that each child shall have . . . equal opportunity to receive a suitable program of educational experiences; (2) that each school district shall [maintain a suitable level of finances for] this end; and (3) that the mandates in the general statutes pertaining to education within the jurisdiction of the state board of education be implemented.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Section 5 of Public Act 690 provided that, whenever the state board found that a local board of education had failed to make reasonable provisions \u201cto implement the educational interests of the state as defined in section 1 of this act, [the] state board shall conduct an inquiry to identify the cause of [the] failure and shall determine what recommendations should be made as to the necessary remedies to be pursued by the responsible local or state agencies. ...\u201d Section 5 of Public Act 690 also provided that the local board would have the opportunity to be heard, and that the state board would have the power of subpoena for persons and records \u201cpertinent to the inquiry . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>Two things are noteworthy about these two provisions. First, the generality of the definition of the state\u2019s educational interests, although certainly broad enough to encompass and certainly intended to encompass, substantive prohibitions against discrimination, by their very generality, lacked any focus on individual claims of discrimination. Second, and more important, \u00a7 5 of Public Act 690, which was the only specific remedial section, limited the state board\u2019s functions to (1) investigating a possible failure of a local school district to make reasonable provisions to implement those generally defined interests, and (2) making a <em>recommendation </em>to the local board of education \u201cas to the necessary remedies to be pursued by the responsible local\u201d board of education. Thus, the state board had no enforcement power of its own; rather, that power was solely to recommend remedial action to the local board.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">In 1979, however, the legislature enacted No. 79-128 of the 1979 Public Acts. Section 14 of Public Act 79-128 amended General Statutes (Rev. to 1979) \u00a7 10-4b to a form essentially the same as it is today. See footnote 3 of this opinion for the text of \u00a7 10-4b. In general terms, subsection (a) of \u00a7 10-4b provides that any resident, or parent or guardian of a student, of a local school district, who has failed to resolve his complaint with his local board of education, may file a complaint with the state board<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> alleging a failure of the local board to comply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>with the state\u2019s educational interests as defined in General Statutes \u00a7 10-4a. If the state board finds the complaint to be substantial, it then initiates an investigation by an agent of the state board, who has subpoena power. If the agent finds reasonable cause, the state board, which also has subpoena power, then conducts an inquiry, at which the local board has the power to be heard, under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-176e through 4-184 of the UAPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Subsection (b) of \u00a7 10-4b then provides, in general terms, insofar as this case is concerned, that if the state board finds that the local board has failed to provide educational opportunities to meet the requirements of law, specifically including \u00a7 10-15c, the state board shall require the local board \u201cto engage in a remedial process . . . [to] develop and implement a plan of action through which compliance may be attained . . . .\u2019\u2019If the state board finds that the local board \u201cis responsible for [the] failure,\u201d it may order the local board \u201cto take reasonable steps to comply with the requirements of section 10-4a. . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 10-4b (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">Under subsection (c) of \u00a7 10-4b, the state board may seek an order from the Superior Court if the local board fails to carry out the order of the state board. Under subsection (d), the state board is charged with the duty to adopt procedural regulations for the purposes of \u00a7 10-4b, which it has done.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">A comparison of these two sets of legislative histories, namely, that of \u00a7 46a-58 (a), on the one hand, and that of \u00a7\u00a7 10-15c and 10-4b, on the other hand, discloses two factors that buttress our conclusion that \u00a7\u00a7 10-15c and 10-4b do not provide the exclusive administrative route for remedying specific acts of racial discrimination against a student in a public school by his principal and local board of education, to the exclusion of the commission operating under \u00a7\u00a7 46a-58 and 46a-86 (c). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>First, the generality and lack of focus on individual claims of discrimination disclosed by the state board\u2019s statutory authority, and the lack of genuine enforcement power in the state board, from 1969 to 1979, suggest that it is unlikely that the legislature intended it to be the exclusive remedial administrative agency for a claim of racial discrimination in the public schools. This is to be contrasted with the legislative grant of authority to the commission in 1975 of its full powers to enforce \u00a7 46a-58, pursuant to \u00a7 46a-86 (c), with its specific references to racial and other forms of discrimination. This contrast, moreover, reinforces our conclusion, stated previously, that the grant in 1975 to the commission was intended to carry with it the authority to investigate and adjudicate such claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">Second, having concluded that the 1975 legislation afforded the commission the authority to adjudicate claims of racial discrimination against students in the public schools, in order for us to conclude that, nonetheless, \u00a7\u00a7 10-15c and 10-4b provide the exclusive administrative remedy for such claims, we would be required to conclude also that, when the legislature amended \u00a7 10-4b in 1979, as previously discussed, it also intended to amend \u00a7\u00a7 46a-58 and 46a-86 (c) by implication, thus implicitly exempting from those sections the very authority to adjudicate such claims that it had granted four years earlier, in 1975. Our ordinary presumptions are strongly against amendment by implication; we do not interpret statutes to do so, except where there are very strong indications of legislative intent to do so. <em>Rivera </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>254 Conn. 214, 242, 756 A.2d 1264 (2000). The legislative history of Public Act 79-128 indicates that its main impetus was as part of the legislative response to this court\u2019s decision in <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>172 Conn. 615, 648-49, 376 A.2d 359 (1977), in which we held the state\u2019s educational funding formula unconstitutional under our state con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>stitution. See generally 22 H.R. Proc., Pts. 11 and 12, 1979 Sess., pp. 3678-3944; 22 S. Proc., Pts. 11 and 12, 1980 Sess., pp. 1636-1801; Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Education, Pts. 1 and 2, 1980 Sess., pp. 3-11, 65-67, 70-72, 82, 163-65, 181, 195, 243-90, 302,497-506,530-36. There is nothing in the public act\u2019s language or voluminous legislative debate indicating an intention to amend \u00a7\u00a7 46a-58 or 46a-86 (c), or to make \u00a7 10-4b the exclusive remedy for individual claims of racial discrimination. Given that \u00a7 46a-58 is our state\u2019s fundamental civil rights statute, given its long pedigree as such, and given that there is no indication, in either the language of \u00a7 10-4b or the legislative debate preceding the 1979 legislation regarding \u00a7 10-4b, we see no basis for such a conclusion of implicit amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">The second factor cutting across all of the defendants\u2019 arguments is the absence from the text of either \u00a7\u00a7 10-15c or 10-4b of any linguistic indication that the state board is intended to be the exclusive remedial administrative agency for claims of racial discrimination in the public schools. Although there is no talismanic phrase that is necessary to establish exclusive statutory jurisdiction over a particular subject matter, we are ordinarily reluctant to infer exclusivity of remedy from an ambiguous remedial statute. See <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Mansfield Training School, </em>220 Conn. 721, 729-30, 601 A. 2d 507 (1992). A fortiori, we should be reluctant to infer exclusivity by way of implicit amendment of a remedial statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">Indeed, the commission brings to our attention numerous instances in which the legislature has made clear by explicit legislative language its intention to confer exclusive jurisdiction in various contexts. See General Statutes \u00a7 10-153e (g) (3) (\u201c[t]he jurisdiction of the Superior Court shall be exclusive\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 13b-26 (b) (\u201c[commissioner of transportation] shall exercise exclusive jurisdiction over all such high<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>ways\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 15-121 (a) (\u201cCommissioner of Environmental Protection shall . . . have exclusive jurisdiction of all waters of the state\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 16-50x(a) (\u201cthe [Connecticut siting] council shall have exclusive jurisdiction over the location and type of facilities\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 16-243 (\u201c[t]he Department of Public Utility Control shall have exclusive jurisdiction . . . over the method of construction\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 22a-124 (a) (\u201cthe [Connecticut siting] council shall have exclusive jurisdiction over the siting of facilities\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 22a-163n (a) (same); General Statutes \u00a7 22a-348 (a) (\u201cthe [commissioner of environmental protection] shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any encroachments\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 26-103 (\u201cwildlife habitats and shall be under the exclusive jurisdiction and control of the Commissioner of Environmental Protection\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 26-192 (statute governing shellfisheries titled: \u201cExclusive jurisdiction of state\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 26-194 (a) (\u201call shellfish areas . . . within the exclusive jurisdiction of the state\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 26-195 (\u201cshellfish grounds within the exclusive jurisdiction of the state\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 26-196 (\u201cshellfish grounds . . . within the exclusive jurisdiction of the state\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 26-203 (\u201coyster beds in the exclusive jurisdiction of this state\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 26-207 (\u201cshellfish . . . franchises lying within the exclusive jurisdiction of the state\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 26-211 (\u201coyster grounds within the exclusive jurisdiction of the state\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 26-246 (\u201coyster grounds within the exclusive jurisdiction of the state\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 26-257 (various towns granted \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d over certain shellfish beds); General Statutes \u00a7 29-349 (a) (\u201c[t]he Commissioner of Public Safety shall have exclusive jurisdiction in the preparation of . . . explosives and blasting agents\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 31-63 (\u201cjurisdiction of the court shall be exclusive\u201d); General Stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>utes \u00a7 31-109 (c) (\u201cjurisdiction of the Superior Court shall be exclusive\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 33-871 (d) (\u201cjurisdiction of the court . . . is . . . exclusive\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 33-898 (a) (\u201ccourt appointing a receiver or custodian has exclusive jurisdiction\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 33-1189 (a) (same); General Statutes \u00a7 36a-187 (b) (\u201csuperior court for the judicial district of Hartford . . . vested with exclusive jurisdiction\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 38a-907 (a) (4) (\u201c[a]ll matters . . . within the exclusive jurisdiction of the domiciliary receivership court\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 46a-95 (i) (\u201cjurisdiction of the court shall be exclusive\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 46b-42 (\u201cSuperior Court shall have exclusive jurisdiction of all complaints seeking a decree of annulment, dissolution of a marriage or legal separation\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 46b-115\u00a3 (a) (\u201ccourt . . . which has made a child custody determination . . . has exclusive, continuing jurisdiction\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 46b-212h (a) (\u201cFamily Support Magistrate Division or the Superior Court . . . has continuing exclusive jurisdiction over a child support order\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 46b-212j (d) (\u201ctribunal that issued an order ... is the tribunal having continuing, exclusive jurisdiction\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 46b-213q (d) (\u201cFamily Support Magistrate Division becomes the tribunal of continuing exclusive jurisdiction\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 47a-55 (a) (\u201ctown, city or borough may . . . designate another authority or authorities to exercise concurrent or exclusive jurisdiction\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 48-1 (a) (\u201c[exclusive jurisdiction in and over any land . . . ceded to the United States\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 51-352c (b) (\u201ctown or judicial district . . . shall have exclusive jurisdiction to charge, present, indict, try, convict and sentence\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 52-12 (a) (\u201cSuperior Court shall have exclusive jurisdiction of all matters relating to the sale of real property\u201d). In view of this compelling evidence of an obvious legislative ability to use appro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>priate <em>explicit </em>language to confer exclusive jurisdiction, and in view of the fundamental and remedial nature of the protections afforded by \u00a7 46a-58, we decline to interpret \u00a7\u00a7 10-15c and 10-4b as <em>implicitly </em>granting exclusive jurisdiction to the state board over claims of racial discrimination against students in the public schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">In addition, there is nothing legislatively unusual about there being separate and independent remedies for racial and other types of discrimination, concurrent with those afforded by the commission under its statutory scheme. For example, in the area of employment discrimination, both General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 5-227<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> and 46a-60<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> cover similar situations, yet may be brought to different fora. Similarly, General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 10-153<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> and 46a-60, both cover discrimination against teachers on the basis of sex or marital status.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">In light of these considerations, we are not persuaded by the defendants\u2019 argument that the specific provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 10-15c and 10-4b should prevail over the more general provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 46a-58 and 46a-86 (c). In this connection, the defendants\u2019 and the dissent\u2019s reliance on <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities </em>v. <em>Truelove &amp; Maclean, Inc., </em>supra, 238 Conn. 337, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>misplaced. The question in that case was whether the specific claims of employment discrimination covered by \u00a7 46a-60 were also covered by the general terms of \u00a7 46a-58 (a). Id., 340. We held that the separate sets of remedies provided by \u00a7 46a-86 (b) and (c) indicated that \u201cthe specific, narrowly tailored cause of action embodied in \u00a7 46a-60 supersedes the general cause of action embodied in \u00a7 46a-58 (a).\u201d Id., 346. Both of those types of claims, however, were within the jurisdiction of the commission, and the question was which set of remedies the commission could employ. That decision does not inform the question in the present case, in which the debate is over whether the commission has concurrent jurisdiction with the state board or whether the state board has exclusive jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">Furthermore, the provisions of \u00a7 46a-60; see footnote 32 of this opinion; governing discriminatory employment practices, cover no less than two subsections containing eleven and four subdivisions, respectively. In <em>Truelove &amp; Maclean, Inc., </em>we determined that the \u201cnarrowly tailored\u201d provisions of \u00a7 46a-60 tramp the \u201cgeneral cause of action embodied in \u00a7 46a-58 (a).\u201d <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities </em>v. <em>Truelove &amp; Maclean, Inc., </em>supra, 238 Conn. 346. By contrast, <em>both </em>\u00a7\u00a7 46a-58 (a) and 10-15c are general in their terms, and the only specific subject matter in \u00a7 10-15c that does not appear in \u00a7 46a-58 is its application to public school students. Section 10-15c, therefore, is not \u201cnarrowly tailored\u201d as is \u00a7 46a-60. Id. In addition, the axiom that a specific statutory provision will ordinarily tramp a general statutory provision cannot, by itself, displace the process of thoughtful and complete statutory interpretation. <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>240 Conn. 422, 460, 692 A.2d 742 (1997). Thus, that axiom does not appropriately apply in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>We are also not persuaded by the defendants\u2019 and the dissent\u2019s contention that legislative silence in the wake of the commission\u2019s rulings that it had no jurisdiction over claims like Ballard\u2019s indicates legislative approval thereof. This contention rests on the following brief history. In 1980, a commission hearing examiner concluded that, as between \u00a7 10-15c and General Statutes (Rev. to 1980) \u00a7 53-35, now \u00a7 46a-64, the public accommodations statute, \u00a7 10-15c was \u201c \u2018the operative antidiscrimination statute,\u2019 \u201d that \u201c[njothing suggests that the legislature intended to vest any enforcement authority for \u00a7 10-15cinthe [commission] or to incorporate or to utilize the mechanism of chapter 563 [now \u00a7 46a-58] in such enforcement,\u201d and that the \u201ccommission [has] no jurisdiction in or responsibilities over discrimination in access to public school activities and programs . . . .\u201d <em>Atlas </em>v. <em>Hamden High School, </em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, Opinion No. 7930381 (August 20, 1980). The next pronouncement by the commission was the decision of the referee in the present case, twenty years later, and a similar decision decided contemporaneously with this case. See <em>Alston </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, Opinion No. 9830205 (May 3, 2000). This history is unpersuasive. First, there is no evidence in the record of any intervening actions by the commission on such complaints. Second, there is nothing in any of the intervening legislation or its history indicating any legislative awareness or approval of these decisions, either explicit or implicit. Third, just as the legislature was silent after the commission decision twenty years ago, it has been silent after the trial court\u2019s decision in the present case more than two years ago. Thus, this legislative silence is, as it often is, ambiguous, and an unreliable indicator of legislative intent.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number><em>Reynolds, </em>264 Conn. 1, 79, 836 A.2d 224 (2003) (\u201c[R]eliance on legislative silence is misplaced. It is a basic tenet of statutory construction that we rely on the intent of the legislature as that intent has been expressed.\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]); <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Driscoll, </em>262 Conn. 312, 327, 813 A.2d 1003 (2003) (legislative silence is no more likely to reflect implied adoption of one rationale over another).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">We are similarly unpersuaded by the defendants\u2019 contention that the state board\u2019s expertise regarding the public schools indicates a legislative intent to confer exclusive jurisdiction on it in the present case. Although we do not deny the state board\u2019s expertise over matters involving the public schools, and that such expertise would certainly cover claims of various forms of discrimination, we also recognize the commission\u2019s expertise over such claims. Indeed, we have implicitly recognized that expertise in the closely related area of claims of racial discrimination against a teacher. See, e.g., <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>266 Conn. 492, 510-17, 832 A.2d 660 (2003). The point here is not that the state board does not have such expertise; the point is that its expertise is not exclusive of that of the commission so as to warrant an inference of a legislative intent to vest exclusive jurisdiction in the state board.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Finally, we do not agree with the defendants that interpreting our entire statutory scheme, regarding the type of claimed racial discrimination against a public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>school student in the present case, so as to vest concurrent jurisdiction in both the state board and the commission, will render the state board\u2019s jurisdiction superfluous. An individual complainant may prefer to take the state board route, rather than the commission complaint route, for various reasons. First, the availability of remedies may differ depending on whether the commission or the state board pursues the claim. Whereas the tenor of \u00a7 10-4b (b) is concerned with corrective or prospective measures, namely, \u201crequir[ing] the local or regional board of education to engage in a remedial process . . . [and] implementing] a plan of action through which compliance may be attained,\u201d \u00a7 46a-86 (c) is more concerned with compensatory measures to remedy past discrimination, namely, \u201cthe damage suffered by the complainant . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> In this regard, the state board under \u00a7 \u00a7 10-4b and 10-15c may be better suited to address, say, a large-scale systemic problem that plagues a school system generally, and the commission under \u00a7 46a-86 (c) may be better suited to address, say, a discrete course of discriminatory conduct aimed at a particular individual. In addition, a complainant may choose not to seek any compensatory damages at all, and would prefer, for whatever reason, the more prospective measures available under \u00a7 10-4b. That will be his or her choice, however; but the fact of a choice does not render the alternate route superfluous. Furthermore, as we noted previously, the state board does not have to await such a complaint by an individual complainant; it may initiate such a complaint on its own under \u00a7 10-4b. Moreover, contrary to the defendants\u2019 suggestion, giving an individual such a choice will not necessarily mean that he or she could concurrently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>pursue both simultaneously, thus requiring the local board or its personnel to defend themselves in two different fora. The judicial doctrine of election of remedies would always be available to forestall such an inconvenient and wasteful result. See, e.g., <em>Audubon Parking Associates Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Barclay &amp; Stubbs, </em>225 Conn. 804, 809 n.6, 626 A.2d 729 (1993); <em>Grant </em>v. <em>Bassman, </em>221 Conn. 465, 472 n.7, 604 A.2d 814 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">Finally, we address the dissent\u2019s contention that, under our \u201c \u2018broad and inclusive\u2019 reading of \u00a7\u00a7 46a-58 and 46a-86 (c) in the present case, each student in the Hartford public schools would have a claim for damages against the state for the emotional distress caused by his or her racial isolation and perhaps for the costs of obtaining an alternate education up to the time that the discriminatory conditions are remedied . . . .\u201d We do not suggest any such thing, and nothing in this opinion should be taken as doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">First, as we have indicated, this case involves only a discrete course of allegedly discriminatory conduct by an identified school official against the complainant, in violation of specific state statutes, namely, \u00a7\u00a7 10-15c and 46a-58 (a). It does not present the type of systemic racial isolation that this court found unconstitutional, under our state constitution, in <em>Sheff </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>238 Conn. 1, 678 A.2d 1267 (1996). Our holding that the type of discriminatory conduct alleged in the present case is within the commission\u2019s authority to remedy under \u00a7 46a-86 (c) does not imply that the commission would also, ipso facto, have the same authority to order damages for any Hartford public school student under the authority of <em>Sheff. </em>Indeed, precisely because of the factors identified by the dissent, namely, that claims of systemic racial isolation in the public schools involve highly complex, sensitive and controversial social and political questions involving multiple governmental par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>ties and large numbers of students, we are highly dubious that the language of \u00a7\u00a7 46a-58 and 46a-86 (c), when read together with all other sources of its meaning such as its history, purposes and statutory context, as we are required to do, would be broad and inclusive enough to permit such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">Second, and even more important, and contributing heavily to our serious doubt about the reality of the dissent\u2019s fears, we note that, in <em>Sheff, </em>this court specifically left to the legislature and the executive branch the initial task of fashioning the remedies for the state constitutional violation identified therein; see <em>Sheff </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>supra, 238 Conn. 45-46; and we also note that both branches of our government have been attempting ever since to accomplish that very difficult task. In March, 1999, the Superior Court described the various efforts made as of that date, which included the following: Executive Order No. 10, creating the educational improvement panel; Public Acts 1997, No. 97-290; increased funding by the state of interdistrict cooperative programs; increased funding by the state of interdistrict magnet schools; amendment of the statutes regarding charter schools; increased recruitment of minority staff members in the public schools; establishment of and funding for a school choice program; and the establishment of intradistrict \u201clighthouse schools,\u201d viewed as potential predecessors of magnet schools. <em>Sheff </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>45 Conn. Sup. 630, 634-49, 733 A.2d 925 (1999). Since then, these executive and legislative efforts have continued, and, as the dissent notes, the parties have now entered into some form of judicially approved settlement of the outstanding remedial issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">What is significant about this historical aftermath of <em>Sheff </em>is the total absence of any legislative, executive or judicial indication that the commission would have any role, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 46a-58 or 46-86 (c), or other<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>wise, in that remedial scheme.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> To say the least, we would be hard pressed, if faced with the type of claim that the dissent posits, to ignore this history and hold, despite it, that nonetheless our conclusion in this very different case, on a different set of facts and a different legal basis, implies or even suggests that a public school child could use this decision as a springboard for emotional distress and other damages based upon a violation of his rights under the ruling in <em>Sheff. </em>In fact, that very histoiy would counsel strongly, perhaps even conclusively, to the contrary. The dissent\u2019s contention, therefore, is simply without basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">The judgment of dismissal regarding Ballard\u2019s complaint is reversed; the judgment is affirmed in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">In this opinion NORCOTT, KATZ, PALMER and VERTEFEUILLE, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b685-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 46a-58 (a) provides: \u201cIt shall be a discriminatory practice in violation of this section for any person to subject, or cause to be subjected, any other person to the deprivation of any rights, privileges or immunities, secured or protected by the Constitution or laws of this state or of the United States, on account of religion, national origin, alienage, color, race, sex, blindness or physical disability.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b686-4\"> General Statutes \u00a7 10-4b provides: \u201c(a) Any resident of a local or regional school district, or parent or guardian of a student enrolled in the public schools of such school district who has been unable to resolve a complaint with the board of education of such local or regional school district may file with the State Board of Education a complaint in writing, or the state board may initiate a complaint, alleging the failure or inability of the board of education of such local or regional school district to implement the educational interests of the state in accordance with section 10-4a.

The last sentence of \u00a7 4-183 (j) provides no such thing; instead, it provides: \u201cFor purposes <em>of this section, </em>a remand is a final judgment.\u201d (Emphasis added.) As we indicated in both <em>Lisee </em>and <em>Morel, </em>the reference to \u201cthis section\u201d would, if read literally, apply to all remands under <em>\u00a7 </em>4-183, not just to remands under <em>subsection </em>Q) of \u00a7 4-183. <em>See Lisee v.

That conclusion is <em>not </em>compelled by the plain language of the statute, and, therefore, the dissent\u2019s objection to our consultation of the legislative history of \u00a7 4-183 (j) is baseless. Thus, considering that the dissent agrees that the language \u201cthis section\u201d as used in subsection (j) of \u00a7 4-183 refers only to <em>subsection </em>(j), it is difficult to conclude that the statutory text at issue is plain and unambiguous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b698-5\"> In <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>supra, 138 Conn. 467, the remand by the trial court was for a new evidentiary hearing.

Indeed, the dissent\u2019s conclusion runs counter to the well established notion that the meaning of the statutory language is to be determined, in part, by its relationship to other statutes involving the same subject matter. <em>Paul Dinto Electrical Contractors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>supra, 266 Conn. 715; Public Acts 2003, No. 03-154, \u00a7 1 (\u201c[t]he meaning of a statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>shall, in the first instance, be ascertained from the text of the statute itself <em>and its relationship to other statutes\u201d </em>[emphasis added]). Moreover, this conclusion of the dissent is curious, given its statement; see footnote 11 of the dissenting opinion; that \u201c\u00a7 46a-58 must be read in coiqunction with \u00a7 46a-86 (c) to determine the scope of damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">In this regard, the dissent asserts; see footnote 11 of the dissenting opinion; that \u201cthe majority presumably would <em>assume . . . </em>that ... \u00a7 46a-58 . . . gives rise to an unconditional private right of action.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) We neither assume nor imply any such thing. We deal in the present case only with the scope of the statutory powers and authority of the commission as an administrative agency. Nothing in this opinion is intended to indicate\u2014 or reasonably could be read as indicating\u2014any view regarding private rights of action, unconditional or otherwise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b707-7\"> The dissent states that, assuming that \u201c\u00a7 46a-86 (c) created a broad right\u201d it is \u201cat least plausible, as a general matter, that the legislature might seek to balance the creation of a broad right by providing only a limited range of damages,\u201d support for which it cites, by analogy, to our workers\u2019 compensation statutes. Although what the legislature <em>\u201cmight </em>seek to\u201d do could always be \u201cplausible\u201d; (emphasis added); the dissent presents no persuasive reason, rooted in either the language, legislative history or purposes of our civil rights statutory scheme\u2014as opposed to our workers\u2019 compensation statutory scheme\u2014to indicate that the legislature, in the context of civil rights legislation, <em>did </em>seek to \u201cbalance\u201d the recognition of broad civil rights with \u201climited\u201d damages. Indeed, we do not ordinarily read remedial legislation in this limited fashion, in the absence of some clear indication of legislative intent that a broadly stated substantive remedial right is intended to have only limited remedial consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">We do not suggest by this response to the dissent, however, that every asserted violation of every civil right considered by the commission will always yield a broad range of damages. We have held that not to be the case. See, e.g., <em>Bridgeport Hospital </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>232 Conn. 91, 110, 653 A.2d 782 (1995).

This reading is untenable. As we already stated, it is the <em>reasoning of Bridgeport Hospital </em>that is instructive . on the question of whether \u00a7 46a-86 (c) authorizes an award of personal compensatory damages. Despite the dissent\u2019s revisionist understanding of that reasoning, nowhere in that opinion did we say\u2014or even intimate\u2014\u25a0 that compensatory damages were awardable under \u00a7 46a-86 (c) only <em>\u201cif compensable at all.. . </em>.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Instead, we stated repeatedly that compensatory damages and attorney\u2019s fees were precluded from \u00a7 46a-86 (a) \u201cbecause of the express restriction on the availability of such awards to cases brought under the specific statutes enumerated in subsections (c) and (d)\u201d; <em>Bridgeport Hospital </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; </em>Opportunities, supra, 100; and that in 1991 the legislature had amended \u00a7 46a-86 (c) \u201cto grant [the commission] the authority to make awards of compensatory damages and attorney\u2019s fees to persons discriminated against based on sexual orientation in the areas of associations of licensed persons, public accommodations and housing. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46a-81b, 46a-81d and 46a-81e.\u201d Id., 103. Needless to say, \u00a7 46a-58 is included in the statutory phrase at issue, as are the references to \u00a7\u00a7 46a-81b, 46a-81d and 46a-81e. See footnote 16 of this opinion for the text of \u00a7 46a-86 (c); see also <em>Bridgeport Hospital </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>supra, 113 (\u201cin 1991 ... \u00a7 46a-86 [c] and [d] were amended to provide for compensatory damages, and attorney\u2019s fees for certain specific forms of discrimination\u201d). Thus, just as the legislature amended \u00a7 46a-86 (c) in 1991 to provide compensatory damages for \u201cspecific forms of discrimination\u201d; <em>Bridgeport Hospital </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>supra, 113; so too did the legislature in 1975, when it amended \u00a7 46a-86 (c) to include a specific reference to \u00a7 46a-58. See Public Act 75462.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b721-5\"> The dissent, like the defendants, places heavy reliance on the doctrine of ejusdem generis, asserting that \u201cit could not be clearer, under the doctrine of ejusdem generis, that the legislature intended to limit recoverable damages to \u2018costs actually incurred\u2019 ... by a complainant.\u201d (Citation omitted.) We agree that, if the doctrine applied in this instance, it could yield the conclusion that the dissent reaches. Ejusdem generis, however, is merely an axiom of statutory construction, not an inviolate rule of law; and, like all such axioms, it provides a \u201cguideline to legislative meaning, but it cannot displace the result of careful and thoughtful interpretation.\u201d <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>240 Conn. 422, 460, 692 A.2d 742 (1997); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Courehesne, </em>supra 262 Conn. 555. Although we present several reasons why the doctrine should not be applied in the present case, the dissent has presented no reasons why it must be applied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b726-5\"> Indeed, the dissent ignores the express reference in \u00a7 46a-58 (a) that makes it a discriminatory practice to cause any person to be subjected to the deprivation of any rights secured by, among other things, the \u201claws of this state . . . .\u201d Section 10-15c is a law of this state.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b726-6\"> The fact that the original version of \u00a7 46a-58 (a) began with \u201c[e]very person\u201d further supports our conclusion that the language of the statute should be interpreted broadly, rather than narrowly. \u201cEvery\u201d is a common synonym for \u201cany,\u201d as used in the sense of \u201call.\u201d <em>King </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 203 Conn. 334. Our research indicates that this was changed to \u201c[a]ny person\u201d in the 1930 revision of the General Statutes, but there is no indication that a substantive change was intended.

See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-26 and 53a-42 (defining misdemeanors and setting penalties).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b729-5\"> The dissent infers from this 1980 legislation a legislative intent to exclude from the ambit of \u00a7 46a-86 (c) the authority to adjudicate complaints for a violation of \u00a7 10-15c. The dissent states that \u201cif the legislature had understood \u00a7 46a-58 to include discrimination prohibited by other state statutes in 1975, then there would have been no need for it expressly to include \u00a7\u00a7 46a-59 and 46a-64 in \u00a7 46a-86 (c) in 1980. . . . Section 10-15c is not listed in \u00a7 46a-86 (c) and was not among the discrimination statutes incoiporated into title 46a in 1980.\u201d We reject this inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">First, it is evident that the 1980 legislation was nothing more than a general codification and technical revision of the laws governing the commission, and that, therefore, it was not intended to make any substantive changes with regards to the commission\u2019s authority, either by inclusion or exclusion. See <em>Pollio </em>v. <em>Planning Commission, </em>232 Conn. 44, 55, 652 A.2d 1026 (1995) (\u201c[tjechnical amendments are not generally intended to effect substantive changes in the law\u201d). Indeed the title of P.A. 80-422, \u201cAn Act Concerning a Technical Revision of the Statutes Concerning Human Rights and Opportunities,\u201d could not be more innocuous.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">Second, the dissent\u2019s view that, by not including \u00a7 10-15c in the 1980 codification and technical revision, the legislature signaled an intent to exclude it from the authority of \u00a7\u00a7 46a-58 and 46a-86 (c) is flawed because one could just as easily infer that, by <em>not </em>expressly <em>excluding </em>\u00a7 10-15c from \u00a7 46a-86 (c), the legislature intended \u00a7 10-15c, along with <em>other </em>state and federal statutes providing for specified protections against discrimination, including, but not limited to, \u00a7\u00a7 46a-59 and 46a-64, to be included within the <em>general </em>language of \u00a7 46a-58, with its specific incorporation in 1975 into \u00a7 46a-86 (c). The fact is, in our view, that no legitimate inference of legislative intent\u2014either to include or exclude \u00a7 10-15c\u2014can be drawn from the 1980 legislation, and 1hat all of the specific statutory references transferred from \u00a7 53-36 into \u00a7 46a-86 (c), by virtue of the technical revision, were transferred simply so that the statutes governing the commission could be located together.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">Finally, the dissent\u2019s argument proves too much. If, as the dissent suggests, only those sections specifically referred to in \u00a7 46a-86 (c), such as \u00a7\u00a7 46a-59 and 46a-64, can serve as the basis for relief under \u00a7 46a-86 (c), then the general terms of \u00a7 46a-58 would <em>always </em>be superfluous, and we do not ordinarily read statutes so as to render any part superfluous\u2014particularly a broad civil rights statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b733-4\"> Public Act 690, \u00a7 1, is now codified, as amended, at General Statutes \u00a7 10^a, which provides: \u201cFor purposes of sections 10-4, 10-4b and 10-220, the educational interests of the state shall include, but not be limited to, the concern of the state that (1) each child shall have for the period prescribed in the general statutes equal opportunity to receive a suitable program of educational experiences; (2) each school district shall finance at a reasonable level at least equal to the minimum expenditure requirement pursuant to the provisions of section 10-262y an educational program designed to achieve this end; (3) in order to reduce racial, ethnic and economic isolation, each school district shall provide educational opportunities for its students to interact with students and teachers from other racial, ethnic, and economic backgrounds and may provide such opportunities with students from other communities; and (4) the mandates in the general statutes pertaining to education within the jurisdiction of the State Board of Education be implemented.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"41\">\n<p id=\"b733-5\"> Public Act 690, \u00a7 5, provided: \u201cWhenever said state board finds that a board of education of any school district has failed to make reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>provision to implement the educational interests of the state as defined in section 1 of this act, said state board shall conduct an inquiry to identify the cause of such failure and shall determine what recommendations should be made as to the necessary remedies to be pursued by the responsible local or state agencies.

See <em>Atlas </em>v. <em>Hamden High School, </em>supra, Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, Opinion No. 7930381. Without discounting the importance of the rulings issued by the commission, it suffices to say that an unpublished administrative ruling ordinarily does not gamer the same sort of legislal ive awareness as does a decision by this court declaring unconstitutional the educational system of the Hartford school district. In this regard, whereas there is no evidence that the legislature was aware of the commission\u2019s decision in <em>Atlas, </em>the legislature undoubtedly was aware of, and has responded to, our decision in <em>Sheff. </em>Thus, the legislative silence following <em>Atlas </em>is not analogous to the legislative silence with respect to the commission following <em>Sheff.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b747-8\">SULLIVAN, C.

I am not entirely convinced by the majority\u2019s interpretation of <em>Lisee </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>258 Conn. 529, 782 A.2d 670 (2001), and <em>Morel </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Public Health, </em>262 Conn. 222, 811 A.2d 1256 (2002), as holding that remands after rulings on the merits of an administrative appeal pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (j)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> are subject on a case-by-case basis to the final judgment test set forth in <em>Schieffelin &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Liquor Control, </em>202 Conn. 405, 521 A.2d 566 (1987). I recognize that, in <em>Lisee, </em>this court stated, in what the majority now characterizes as dicta, that \u201cthe legislature intended to codify <em>[Schieffelin &amp; Co.] </em>as it applies to remands after rulings on the merits of an administrative appeal.\u201d <em>Lisee </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>supra, 541-42. I believe, however, that, in the context of the entire opinion, that language in <em>Lisee </em>reasonably can be read to mean that \u00a7 4-183 (j) implemented our general holding in <em>Schieffelin &amp; Co. </em>that some administrative rulings involving remand orders are final judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>ments, namely, those arising under \u00a7 4-183 (j), and some are not, namely those arising under \u00a7 4-183 (h).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>Schieffelin &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Liquor Control, </em>supra, 410. I am not convinced that we intended to suggest that remand orders under \u00a7 4-183 (j) are subject to the <em>Schieffelin &amp; Co. </em>final judgment test despite the plain language of that subsection that \u201c[f]or purposes of this section, a remand is a final judgment.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (j). I also believe that there are inconsistencies between <em>Morel </em>and <em>Schieffelin &amp; Co. </em>that would suggest that, in light of the broad language of \u00a7 4-183 (j), this court in <em>Morel </em>applied the <em>Schieffelin &amp; Co. </em>final judgment test far more leniently than had the court in <em>Schieffelin &amp; </em>Co.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nevertheless, because I agree with the majority that, regardless of this court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 4-183 (j) in <em>Lisee </em>and <em>Morel, </em>all remand orders after the trial court has found prejudice and sustained the appeal are final judgments, I see no need to engage in a lengthy analysis of those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">I object, however, to the majority\u2019s use of the legislative history of \u00a7 4-183 (j). Although, as we recognized in <em>Lisee, </em>the last sentence of \u00a7 4-183 (j) is ambiguous as to whether it refers to any and all rulings under other subsections of \u00a7 4-183 that can fairly be characterized as remands, it unambiguously provides that all remands arising under \u00a7 4-183 (j) are final judgments.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>ingly, I believe that we are barred by No. 03-154, \u00a7 1, of the 2003 Public Acts<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> from consulting the legislative history of the statute.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">I next turn to the majority\u2019s analysis of the question of mootness as to Ballard. The defendants argue that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>if this court determines that the commission has jurisdiction over the claim, the commission\u2019s appeal is moot as to Ballard because General Statutes \u00a7 46a-86 (c)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> does not provide for the recovery of damages for emotional distress. Because I would conclude that the commission does not have jurisdiction over claims arising under \u00a7 10-15c, I would not reach this issue. I address the majority\u2019s analysis of the mootness claim, however, because I believe that that analysis is flawed and leads to an erroneous conclusion that will have adverse consequences far beyond this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">The majority begins its analysis of this claim not with the language of \u00a7 46a-86 (c), but with the language of General Statutes \u00a7 46a-58 (a).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It notes that \u00a7 46a-58 (a) has \u201cbroad and inclusive language, and strongly suggests a reference to the broad and inclusive panoply of rights, privileges and immunities, derived from a broad and inclusive set of sources . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The major<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>ity infers from this fact that the phrase \u201cthe damage suffered by the complainant,\u201d as used in \u00a7 46a-86 (c), \u201cneed not necessarily be confined to easily quantifiable monetary losses.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The language that is now codified at \u00a7 46a-86 (c), however, was first enacted in 1967. See Public Acts 1967, No. 756, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Section 46a-58, then codified at General Statutes \u00a7 53-34, was not incorporated into the statute until 1975. See Public Acts 1975, No. 75-462. Accordingly, I do not believe that the language of \u00a7 46a-58 sheds any light on the scope of the remedy provided by \u00a7 46a-86 (c).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">Moreover, even if it is assumed that the discrimination statutes originally included within the scope of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>what is now \u00a7 46a-86 (c) created a broad right, the majority cites no authority in support of its assumption that the legislature\u2019s creation of a broad right that may be exercised in a variety of contexts implies a legislative intent to provide for a wide variety of damages. It seems to me at least plausible, as a general matter, that the legislature might seek to balance the creation of a broad right by providing only a limited range of damages.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">The majority then concludes that the fact that \u00a7 46a-86 (c) lists only certain out-of-pocket expenses can be explained by the fact that several of the specific discrimination statutes referenced therein \u201cmight lend themselves, more readily than the general discrimination prohibited by \u00a7 46a-58 (a), to assessment of damages that would be calculable in terms of monetary loss.\u201d I do not understand, however, how the fact that the specific types of damages listed in \u00a7 46a-86 (c) may be incurred under the specific statutes listed therein gives rise to an inference that the legislature intended to provide for a broader range of damages. A violation of any of the specific discrimination statutes referred to in \u00a7 46a-86 (c) could give rise to a broad range of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>damages, including emotional distress. If the legislature had desired to provide for the recovery of such damages, it easily could have done so expressly.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">The majority then turns to the legislative genealogy and history of \u00a7 46a-86 (c). It points to general statements made by Representative William J. Lavery that the statute was intended to provide a right to seek civil damages and to protect the human dignity of citizens of the state as \u201csuggestive of a legislative intent that the commission\u2019s authority to determine the damages arising from the commissioner\u2019s finding of a discriminatory practice be broadly, rather than narrowly, construed.\u201d I do not agree that these general comments support the specific conclusion reached by the majority that the compensatory damages provided by \u00a7 46a-86 (c) include damages for emotional distress. I also do not agree, for reasons that I have stated previously in this dissenting opinion, that the genealogy of the statute, which shows that the legislature has periodically increased the number of discrimination statutes for which the remedy provided by \u00a7 46a-86 (c) is available, sheds any light on the scope of the remedy itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">The majority next determines that \u201c[i]t would be consistent with [the general remedial purpose of the antidiscrimination statutes] to read the language of \u00a7 46a-86 (c) to mean that the commission has the authority to award personal compensatory damages. \u201d As I have indicated, however, the fact that the legislature has created a broad statutory right does not necessarily imply that it intended to provide for a broad range of damages. This court previously has recognized that in construing a statute, our task is not to determine whether the legislature rationally <em>could have </em>enacted a statutory provision, but to determine whether the legislature actually intended to do so. See <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>266 Conn. 108, 119, 830 A.2d 1121 (2003). I see no independent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>evidence that the legislature had the intention ascribed to it by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">Finally, the majority relies on this court\u2019s decision in <em>Bridgeport Hospital </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; </em>Opportunities, 232 Conn. 91, 653 A.2d 782 (1995), in support of its conclusion that \u00a7 46a-86 (c) contemplates an award of damages for emotional distress. In that case, we determined that damages for emotional distress and attorney\u2019s fees are not available under \u00a7 46a-86 (a), which provides the remedy for discriminatory employment practices that violate General Statutes \u00a7 46a-60. Id., 93, 101. We reasoned that if compensatory damages were available under \u00a7 46a-86 (a), then \u00a7 46a-86 (c) would be superfluous. Id., 101. We also determined that the legislative history of \u00a7 46a-86 (a) indicated that the term \u201caffirmative action\u201d as used therein contemplated a narrower remedy than the remedy of compensatory damages provided in \u00a7 46a-86 (c). Id., 102-103. The majority concludes that this shows that damages for emotional distress are compensable under \u00a7 46a-86 (c). I disagree. I would conclude that <em>Bridgeport Hospital </em>merely held that the term \u201caffirmative action\u201d as used in \u00a7 46a-86 (a) was not intended to include the compensatory damages contemplated by \u00a7 46a-86 (c) and that damages for emotional distress, <em>if compensable at </em>all, would be compensable in connection with the discriminatory conduct listed in that subsection.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> If \u00a7 46a-86 (c) had expressly excluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>damages for emotional distress, I do not believe that we would have concluded in <em>Bridgeport Hospital </em>that damages for emotional distress were contemplated in the term \u201caffirmative action\u201d as used in \u00a7 46a-86 (a). Accordingly, any suggestion in that case that \u00a7 46a-86 (c) contemplated damages for emotional distress was dicta, at best.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">On the basis of the foregoing analysis, the majority concludes that \u00a7 46a-86 (c) authorizes the commission to award Ballard damages for emotional distress. The majority then turns, as an afterthought,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> to the defendants\u2019 arguments that are based on the plain language of the statute and rejects those arguments. I would agree with the defendants that the plain language of the statute clearly precludes recovery of damages for emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Section 46a-86 (c) provides that \u201cthe presiding officer shall determine the damage suffered by the complainant, which damage shall include, but not be limited to, the expense incurred by the complainant for obtaining alternate housing or space, storage of goods and effects, moving costs and <em>other costs actually incurred by him </em>as a result of such discriininatory practice and shall allow reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In my view, it could not be clearer, under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>doctrine of ejusdem generis,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> that the legislature intended to limit recoverable damages to \u201ccosts actually incurred\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 46a-86 (c); by a complainant.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The \u201cbut not . . . limited to\u201d language of \u00a7 46a-86 (c) merely indicates that the statute\u2019s list of out-of-pocket costs is not exclusive;<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> it does not indicate that other <em>kinds </em>of damages may be recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">The majority rejects this obvious conclusion, however, because \u201cit would unduly narrow the types of remedies available for a violation of \u00a7 46a-58, which . . . contemplates a wide range of misconduct.\u201d This argument is valid, however, only if it is assumed that a statute that contemplates a wide range of misconduct <em>necessarily </em>contemplates a broad range of remedies for that misconduct. As I have noted, it is the <em>majority, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>not the <em>legislature, </em>that has reached that conclusion.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In other words, the majority assumes the answer to the question before us and then rejects the contrary answer as inconsistent with its assumption, <em>even though the plain language of the statute compels the contrary answer. </em>This is legislating, not interpreting legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">I would conclude that, even if the majority is correct that this case falls within the ambit of \u00a7 46a-86 (c), the plain language of the statute clearly limits recoverable damages to \u201ccosts actually incurred.\u201d I therefore see no need to address the other arguments made by the defendants in support of that interpretation.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>1 am compelled to state, however, that, in analyzing and ultimately rejecting those arguments, the majority in several instances applies the same question begging technique that I have already described.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">I next address the defendants\u2019 claim that the trial court improperly concluded that \u00a7 46a-58 gives the commission jurisdiction over claims arising under \u00a7 10-15c. I agree with the defendants that the commission does not have jurisdiction over such claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">In <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities </em>v. <em>Truelove &amp; Maclean, Inc., </em>238 Conn. 337, 344, 680 A.2d 1261 (1996), the commission argued that \u201c\u00a7 46a-58 (a) encompasses claims of discriminatory employment practices [in violation of \u00a7 46a-60] and that violations of \u00a7 46a-58 (a) entitle a claimant to damages for emotional distress pursuant to \u00a7 46a-86 (c).\u201d We disagreed. Id. Applying the \u201cwell-settled principle of [statutory] construction that specific terms covering the given subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>matter will prevail over general language of the same or another statute which might otherwise prove controlling\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) id., 346; we concluded that \u201cthe specific, narrowly tailored cause of action embodied in \u00a7 46a-60 supersedes the general cause of action embodied in \u00a7 46a-58 (a).\u201d Id. We also concluded that, despite the broad language of \u00a7 46a-58 (a), the existence of distinct remedies for violations of \u00a7\u00a7 46a-60 and 46a-58 reflected \u201ca clear intention by the legislature to restrict the scope of both subsections to only certain types of discrimination.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 347. Thus, in my view, <em>Truelove &amp; Maclean, Inc., </em>clearly stands for the proposition that, if a specific discrimination statute with specific remedies exists, and if that statute is not among those listed in \u00a7 46a-86 (c), the remedies provided by \u00a7 46a-86 (c) are not available by virtue of that statute\u2019s reference to \u00a7 46a-58. Accordingly, although I agree with the majority that the language of \u00a7 46a-58 is broad and inclusive, I would conclude that it does not apply to claims arising under more specific <em>discrimination </em>laws.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Indeed, that is the only plausible reading of <em>Truelove &amp; Maclean, Inc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b760-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>The majority concludes that any reliance on <em>Truelove &amp; Maclean, Inc., </em>is misplaced because, in that case, the jurisdiction of the commission over claims arising under \u00a7 46a-60 was not in issue. The only question was what remedies were available to the complainant. This court\u2019s holding that the remedies of \u00a7 46a-86 (c) are not available if a distinct statute provides a remedy for the specific type of discrimination claimed necessarily implies, however, that \u00a7 46a-58 does not apply if such a statute exists. In <em>Truelove &amp; Maclean, Inc., </em>the fact that \u00a7 46a-58 did not apply did not have jurisdictional implications because the commission still had jurisdiction over the complainant\u2019s claims under \u00a7 46a-60. In this case, however, \u00a7 46a-58 is the only claimed source of jurisdiction. Chapter 814c of the General Statutes, entitled \u201cHuman Rights and Opportunities,\u201d contains no specific provision prohibiting discrimination against a student in a public school setting.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Because \u00a7 46a-58 does not give the commission jurisdiction over claims arising under \u00a7 10-15c, there is <em>no </em>basis for its jurisdiction over such claims.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b761-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>This conclusion is supported by the commission\u2019s own decisions. In <em>Atlas </em>v. <em>Hamden High School, </em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, Opinion No. 7930381 (August 20, 1980), the complainant raised a claim before the commission that the public school that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>she attended had discriminated against her on the basis of her age in violation of a statute prohibiting discrimination in places of public accommodation. The respondents argued that claims of discrimination in the public schools must be brought under \u00a7 10-15c. The commission hearing examiner agreed. He also stated that \u201c[n]othing suggests that the legislature intended to vest any enforcement authority for \u00a7 10-15c in the commission on human rights and opportunities or to incorporate or to utilize the mechanism of chapter 563 [now chapter 814c] in such enforcement. The commission having no jurisdiction in or responsibilities over discrimination in access to public school activities and programs, the complaint must therefore be and hereby is, dismissed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">In <em>Alston </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, Opinion No. 9830205 (May 3, 2000), the complainant again raised before the commission a claim under \u00a7 10-15c. The presiding human rights referee concluded that granting the commission \u201cunlimited authority to pursue any statute enumerated in the . . . General Statutes under the auspices of \u00a7 46a-58 (a) . . . would eviscerate the definition of a \u2018discriminatory practice\u2019 in [General Statutes] \u00a7 46a-51 (8).\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The referee, citing the commission\u2019s ruling on the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss in the present case, also noted that the legislature had consolidated a number of discrimination laws under title 46a of the General Statutes in 1980, but had not included \u00a7 10-15c in the consolidation.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> She concluded that this evinced a legislative intent that claims pertaining to discrimination in the public schools would be handled by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>department of education.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Accordingly, the referee determined that the commission did not have jurisdiction over claims arising under \u00a7 10-15c.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">It is well settled that we may make an \u201cinference of legislative concurrence with the agency\u2019s interpretation . . . from legislative silence concerning that interpretation . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gil </em>v. <em>Courthouse One, </em>239 Conn. 676, 705, 687 A.2d 146 (1997) <em>(Berdon, J., </em>concurring and dissenting). Where an agency\u2019s long-standing interpretation of a statute is reasonable, it should control. <em>Discuillo </em>v. <em>Stone &amp; Webster, </em>242 Conn. 570, 594, 698 A.2d 873 (1997). Accordingly, I believe that the commission\u2019s decisions provide powerful support for the defendants\u2019 position. The majority, however, concludes that the principle of legislative acquiescence does not apply. It reasons in part that, although the legislature has been silent since the commission\u2019s <em>Atlas </em>decision in 1980, it also has been silent since the trial court\u2019s decision in the present case more than two years ago and, therefore, its silence is ambiguous. The pendency of this appeal is one plausible explanation for the legislature\u2019s silence following the trial court\u2019s decision in the present case. There is no such explanation for the more than twenty years of silence that followed the <em>Atlas </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">Moreover, I am persuaded by the commission\u2019s reasoning in these cases. As the commission suggested in <em>Alston, </em>if there was any question as to whether the legislature had intended to make the remedy provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>by \u00a7 46a-86 (c) available for all forms of discrimination in any and all contexts, including racial discrimination in the public schools, when it enacted Public Acts 1975, No. 75-462, and added the reference to \u00a7 53-34, now codified as \u00a7 46a-58, to the last sentence of General Statutes \u00a7 53-36, now codified as \u00a7 46a-86 (c); see footnote 27 of the majority opinion; any such question was answered in the negative in 1980. In that year, the legislature consolidated several discrimination statutes into title 46a. See Public Acts 1980, No. 80-422.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The remedy provided by \u00a7 46a-86 (c) continued, however, to be available only for violations of \u00a7 46a-58 (formerly \u00a7 53-34), General Statutes \u00a7 46a-59 (formerly General Statutes \u00a7 53-35a), and General Statutes \u00a7 46a-64 (formerly General Statutes \u00a7 53-35). As we recognized in <em>Truelove &amp; Maclean, Inc., </em>the reading given by the majority to \u00a7 46a-58, that the statute includes discrimination prohibited by distinct discrimination statutes, simply cannot be reconciled with the legislature\u2019s choice to continue to restrict the application of \u00a7 46a-86 (c) to certain specific statutorily prohibited discriminatory practices. In other words, if the legislature had understood \u00a7 46a-58 to include discrimination prohibited by other state statutes in 1975, then there would have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>no need for it expressly to include \u00a7\u00a7 46a-59 and 46a-64 in \u00a7 46a-86 (c) in 1980.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Conversely, if <em>Truelove &amp; Maclean, Inc., </em>was correctly decided and the legislature\u2019s choice to list certain specific statutes in \u00a7 46a-86 (c) implied a legislative desire to exclude other statutes within the commission\u2019s jurisdiction from the scope of \u00a7 46a-58, then, a fortiori, that choice evinced an intent to exclude statutes outside of title 46a.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Section 10-15c is not listed in \u00a7 46a-86 (c) and was not among the discrimination statutes incorporated into title 46a in 1980. In my view, this establishes conclusively that the legislature never intended for the commission to have jurisdiction over claims arising under \u00a7 10-15c.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> More<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>over, as the majority notes, the legislature has amended \u00a7 46a-86 (c) several times since 1980; see Public Acts 1990, No. 90-246, \u00a7 11; Public Acts 1991, No. 91-58, \u00a7 30; and, despite the commission\u2019s decision in <em>Atlas </em>v. <em>Hamden High School, </em>supra, No. 7930381, has not seen fit to list \u00a7 10-15c in the statute. \u201cLegislative concurrence is particularly strong where the legislature makes unrelated amendments in the same statute.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Discuillo </em>v. <em>Stone &amp; Webster, </em>supra, 242 Conn. 594.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">I am also persuaded by the defendants\u2019 argument that vesting concurrent jurisdiction over claims of racial discrimination arising in the public schools in the state board of education and in the commission will render General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 10-15c and 10-4b superfluous. The majority rejects this argument because \u201cthe availability of remedies may differ depending on whether the commission or the state board pursues the claim. Whereas the tenor of \u00a7 10-4b (b) is concerned with corrective or prospective measures, namely, \u2018requir[ing] the local or regional board of education to engage in a remedial process . . . [and] implementing] a plan of action through which compliance may be attained,\u2019 \u00a7 46a-86 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>(c) is more concerned with compensatory measures to remedy past discrimination, namely, \u2018the damage suffered by the complainant ....\u2019\u201d The majority fails to recognize, however, that \u00a7 46a-86 (a) authorizes the commission to \u201cissue ... an order requiring the respondent to cease and desist from the discriminatory practice and further requiring the respondent to take such affirmative action as in the judgment of the presiding officer will effectuate the purpose of this chapter.\u201d Thus, the commission has the authority <em>both </em>to take corrective or prospective measures <em>and </em>to award compensatory damages. Under these circumstances, I cannot perceive why any person would choose to proceed under \u00a7 10-4b rather than \u00a7 46a-86 (c). This effective removal of claims of racial discrimination in the public schools from the jurisdiction of the state board of education means that the agency with special expertise over issues involving the public schools will have no voice in the remediation of such discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\">Finally, I believe that our state and national history of litigation involving claims of racial discrimination in the public schools compels the conclusion that legislature did not intend to give jurisdiction over such claims to the commission. Such claims frequently involve highly complex, sensitive and controversial societal and political questions involving multiple parties, including government bodies at all levels of state government and large numbers of students. Our national history demonstrates that remedying such discrimination can require years, even decades, of political struggle and compromise. See, e.g., <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>347 U.S. 483, 74 S. Ct. 686, 98 L. Ed. 873 (1954). A review of this state\u2019s history of litigation involving state constitutional claims of racial discrimination in the public schools reveals a similar pattern. In <em>Sheff v. O\u2019Neill, </em>238 Conn. 1, 678 A.2d 1267 (1996), this court concluded that the racial and ethnic isolation of Hartford\u2019s public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>school students was caused by state action and was unconstitutional under the state constitution. Id., 39-40, 43. We also concluded that \u201c[p]rudence and sensitivity to the constitutional authority of coordinate branches of government\u201d counseled against ordering a specific remedy. Id., 46. <em>Sheff was </em>originally filed in 1989; this court\u2019s decision was issued in 1996; and, as of the date of this opinion, the conditions that this court found to be unconstitutional still have not been fully remedied. See Office of Legislative Research Report No. 2003-R-0112 (January 27, 2003), www.cga.state.ct.us/2003/ olrdata/ed/rpt/2003-R-0112.htm (explaining January 22, 2003 settlement agreement in <em>Sheff case </em>and noting that agreement allows plaintiffs to seek further enforcement of this court\u2019s <em>Sheff </em>decision after June 30, 2007). Under the majority\u2019s \u201cbroad and inclusive\u201d reading of \u00a7\u00a7 46a-58 and 46a-86 (c) in the present case, each student in the Hartford public schools would have a claim for damages against the state for the emotional distress caused by his or her racial isolation and perhaps for the costs of obtaining an alternate education up to the time that the discriminatory conditions are remedied, potentially exposing the state and its political subdivisions to damage awards in the millions of dollars.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>is inconceivable to me that the legislature intended to provide such a remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">I would conclude that the commission does not have jurisdiction over claims arising under \u00a7 10-15c.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b748-6\"> See footnote 4 of the majority opinion for the text of \u00a7 10-15c.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b748-7\"> See footnote 10 of the majority opinion for the text of \u00a7 4-183 Q).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b749-5\"> See footnote 9 of the majority opinion for the text of \u00a7 4-183 (h).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b749-6\"> In <em>Schieffelin &amp; Co., </em>this court determined that the trial court\u2019s ruling sustaining the plaintiffs claim on appeal that certain termination notices issued to the defendants met the statutory requirement and remanding the case to the agency for a ruling on the merits was not a final judgment. <em>Schieffelin &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Liquor Control, </em>supra, 202 Conn. 407, 412. In <em>Morel, </em>this court determined that the trial court\u2019s ruling sustaining the plaintiffs claim on appeal that the agency had applied an improper standard and remanding the case to the agency so that it could apply the proper standard was a final judgment. <em>Morel </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Public Health, </em>supra, 262 Conn. 227, 232. If there is a difference between these trial court rulings justifying these disparate results, it is beyond my powers of discernment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b749-7\"> We recognized in <em>Lisee </em>that the word \u201cremand\u201d as used in the last sentence of \u00a7 4-183 (j) was ambiguous as it applied to orders issued under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>other subsections of \u00a7 4-183 that fairly could be characterized as remands but which were not issued after the court had found prejudice and sustained the appeal. We concluded that the word \u201cremand\u201d did not refer to such orders, but referred only to the remands described in \u00a7 4-183 (j). <em>Lisee </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>supra, 258 Conn. 539 (\u201cthe remand referred to in the last sentence is the remand referred to in the preceding sentence, namely, a remand upon <em>sustaining the appeal\u201d </em>[emphasis in original]).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-10\">The majority states that my statement that the last sentence of \u00a7 4-183 (j) is plain and unambiguous as it applies to remands under that subsection is \u201cplainly wrong,\u201d because if the phrase \u201cthis section\u201d were read literally, it would apply to all remands under \u00a7 4-183, not just to remands under subsection (j). It is the majority\u2019s logic, however, that is plainly wrong. First, as I have noted, the ambiguity in \u00a7 4-183 (j) is in the word \u201cremand,\u201d not the word \u201csection.\u201d Second, the fact that the statute is ambiguous in some applications does not mean that it is ambiguous in all applications. For example, the fact that a statute that requires the leashing of dogs is ambiguous as it applies to dingos does not mean that it is ambiguous as it applies to cocker spaniels. Thus, the question is not whether the <em>literal meaning </em>of the last sentence of \u00a7 4-183 (j) is plain and unambiguous in some absolute sense; the question is whether the sentence plainly and unambiguously applies to remand orders arising under subsection (j). I believe that it does and nothing in <em>Usee </em>or <em>Morel </em>suggests otherwise. At most, those cases suggest that the <em>Schieffelin &amp; Co. </em>test applies to remands arising under \u00a7 4-183 (j) <em>despite </em>the plain meaning of the statute. In my view, that is why those cases should be overruled.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b750-11\"> See footnote 20 of the majority opinion for the text of Public Acts 2003, No. 03-154.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b750-12\"> Even if I did not believe that we are barred from consulting the statute\u2019s legislative history, I would not agree with the majority\u2019s analysis of that history. With respect to the majority\u2019s reliance on the Law Revision Commission Report, in my view, the portion of the report cited by the majority merely recites the language of the statute that a remand for further proceedings after sustaining the appeal is a final judgment. See 1987 Thirteenth Annual Report of the Connecticut Law Revision Commission to the General Assembly, March, 1988, p. 40. It provides no additional insight into the meaning of that provision. The majority also states that the report\u2019s reference to <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>138 Conn. 464, 86 A.2d 67 (1952), \u201cbelies any intention to codify the <em>Schieffelin &amp; Co. </em>test, because <em>Watson </em>was a case in which the trial court\u2019s remand was held to be a final judgment, despite the fact that it most likely would not have satisfied the <em>Schieffelin &amp; Co. </em>test.\u201d <em>Schieffelin &amp; Co., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>however, expressly cited the trial court\u2019s ruling in <em>Watson </em>as the paradigm of an administrative ruling that constitutes a final judgment. <em>Schieffelin &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Liquor Control, </em>supra, 202 Conn. 410. Accordingly, it appears to me that, not only does the report offer no support for the conclusion that \u00a7 4-183 (j) was not intended to codify <em>Schieffelin &amp; Co., </em>it arguably undermines that conclusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b751-6\"> See footnote 16 of the majority opinion for the text of \u00a7 46a-86 (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b751-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 46a~58 (a) provides: \u201cIt shall be a discriminatory practice in violation of tlris section for any person to subject, or cause to be subjected, any other person to the deprivation of any rights, privileges or immunities, secured or protected by the Constitution or laws of this state or of the United States, on account of religion, national origin, alienage, color, race, sex, blindness or physical disability.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b751-8\">I am somewhat perplexed by this statement.

Second, as I discuss later in this dissenting opinion, the plain language of \u00a7 46a-86 (c) does in fact provide a compelling reason to adopt this alternative interpretation.

We stated in that case that, in contrast to \u00a7 46a-58, \u201cwhich generally forbids \u2018any person to subject, or cause to be subjected, any other person to the deprivation of any rights, privileges or immunities, secured or protected by the constitution or laws of this state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>or the United States, on account of religion, national origin, alienage, color, race, sex, blindness or physical disability, \u00a7 46a-60 specifically prohibits discriminatory <em>employment </em>practices. Accordingly, the specific, narrowly tailored cause of action embodied in \u00a7 46a-60 supersedes the general cause of action embodied in \u00a7 46a-58 (a).\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities </em>v. <em>Truelove &amp; Maclean, Inc., </em>supra, 238 Conn. 346. Similarly, \u00a7 10-15c, which is narrowly tailored to prohibit discriminatory practices <em>in the public schools, </em>supersedes \u00a7 46a-58 (a). I simply do not see the relevance of the fact that, unlike \u00a7 46a-60, \u00a7 10-15c does not contain \u201ctwo subsections containing eleven and four subdivisions, respectively.\u201d Regardless of whether \u00a7 10-15c is as <em>elaborately </em>tailored as \u00a7 46a-60, it is clearly more <em>narrowly </em>tailored than \u00a7 46a-58. Accordingly, the reasoning of <em>Truelove &amp; Maclean, Inc., </em>applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">In any event, our comparison of the relative specificity of \u00a7\u00a7 46a-60 and 46a-58 in <em>Truelove &amp; Maclean, Inc., </em>was only the first step of our analysis in that case. We went on to note that \u00a7 46a-86 (c) did not provide a remedy for a violation of \u00a7 46a-60 by virtue of its incorporation of \u00a7 46a-58 because a violation of \u00a7 46a-60 had its own specific remedy. Likewise, a violation of \u00a7 10-15c has a specific remedy, namely, that provided by General Statutes \u00a7 10-4b. The majority argues, however, that \u00a7 46a-86 (c) <em>must </em>apply to \u00a7 10-15c because, from 1969 through 1979, the state board lacked any \u201cgenuine . . . power\u201d to enforce \u00a7 10-15c under \u00a7 10-4b. In other words, the majority believes that the <em>narrowness </em>of the remedy provided by the original version of \u00a7 10-4b \u201csuggests] that it is unlikely that the legislature intended it to be the exclusive remedial administrative agency for a claim of racial discrimination in the public schools.\u201d As the majority acknowledges, however, under the reasoning of <em>Truelove &amp; Maclean, </em>Inc., the fact that the remedy provided by the original version of \u00a7 10-4b was \u201c \u2018narrowly tailored\u2019 \u201d suggests that the broader remedy of \u00a7 46a-86 (c), made applicable to \u00a7 46a-58 by the legislature in 1975, does <em>not </em>apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">Finally, I note that \u00a7 10-15c applies to discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, which \u00a7 46a-58 does not, and that \u00a7 46a-58 applies to discrimination on the basis of alienage, blindness or physical disability, which \u00a7 10-15c does not. Under the majority\u2019s view, a student presumably would be able to bring a claim under \u00a7 46a-86 (c) for discrimination in the public schools on the basis of alienage, but would not be able to bring a claim for discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. I find it unlikely that the legislature intended either: (1) to prohibit types of discrimination in the public schools that are not listed in \u00a7 10-15c; or (2) to provide different remedies for the different types of discrimination that are listed in that statute. I assume that the legislature had good reasons for including discrimination on the basis of alienage, blindness and physical disability in \u00a7 46a-58 but not in \u00a7 10-15c.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b762-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 46a-51 (8) provides: \u201c \u2018Discriminatory practice\u2019 means a violation of section 4a-60, 4a-60a, 46a-58, 46a-59, 46a-60, 46a-64, 46a-64c, 46a-66,46a-68, sections 46a-70 to 46a-78, inclusive, subsection (a) of section 46a-80, or sections 46a-81b to 46a-81o, inclusive . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b762-6\"> I discuss this 1980 legislation in greater depth later in this dissenting opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b763-6\"> The referee also noted that both the Superior Court and the United States District Court have held that \u00a7 10-15c \u201cis to be enforced specifically by the state board of education pursuant to \u00a7 10-4b.\u201d <em>McPhail </em>v. <em>Milford, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Ansonia-Milford, Docket No. 054506S (February 25, 1999), citing <em>Price </em>v. <em>Wilton Public School District, </em>United States District Court, Docket No. 97 CV 02218 (D.

See General Statutes (Rev. to 1981) \u00a7 46a-58 (prohibiting discrimination on basis of \u201creligion, national origin, alienage, color, race, sex, blindness or physical disability\u201d). Thus, it cannot be argued that the legislature\u2019s inclusion of specific discrimination statutes in \u00a7 46a-86 (c) was intended to provide a remedy for specific classes of persons who otherwise would not have the remedy. Rather, the legislature\u2019s focus was on providing that remedy for discriminatory practices occurring in specific contexts. Conversely, the <em>exclusion </em>from \u00a7 46a-86 (c) of certain distinct discrimination statutes evinces an intent <em>not </em>to provide the remedy for discriminatory practices arising in certain contexts. This view is consistent with our analysis in <em>Truelove &amp; Maclean, Inc., </em>in which we focused on the existence of a specific statute prohibiting discriminatory employment practices\u2014not on the exclusion from \u00a7 46a-58 of the class of pregnant women\u2014in concluding that \u00a7 46a-86 (c) did not provide a remedy for a violation of \u00a7 46a-60.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b765-5\"> The trial court concluded that <em>Truelove &amp; Maclean, Inc., </em>did not govern this case because, unlike the statute at issue in that case, namely, \u00a7 46a-60, claims arising under \u00a7 10-15c would not be within the commission\u2019s jurisdiction in the absence of \u00a7 46a-58 and, therefore, the commission was not faced with conflicting remedial statutes under its jurisdiction. In my view, however, the reasoning of <em>Truelove &amp; Maclean, Inc., </em>applies all the more <em>strongly </em>because \u00a7 10-15c falls within a completely separate title of the statutes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b765-6\"> The majority argues that \u201cno legitimate inference of legislative intent\u2014 either to include or exclude \u00a7 10-15c\u2014can be drawn from the 1980 legislation, and that all of the specific statutory references transferred from \u00a7 53-36 into \u00a7 46a-86 (c), by virtue of the technical revision, were transferred simply so that the statutes governing the commission could be located <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>together.\u201d Thus, the majority believes that the legislature\u2019s choice <em>not </em>to list certain specific discrimination statutes\u2014such as those prohibiting discriminatory practices by state agencies; see General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46a-69 through 46a-76 and \u00a7\u00a7 46a-81g through 46a-81n; in \u00a7 46a-86 (c) provides <em>no </em>guidance to this court as to whether the remedy provided by that statute is available through \u00a7 46a-58 when the specific discrimination statute has been violated. I can only reiterate that this analysis renders completely meaningless the legislature\u2019s choice to include certain discrimination statutes in \u00a7 46a-86 (c) and to exclude others.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">The majority also argues that, if \u00a7 46a-86 (c) applies only to the discrimination statutes that are listed therein, the reference to \u00a7 46a-58 would be superfluous. I do not suggest that \u00a7 46a-86 (c) does not apply to \u00a7 46a-58, however. I contend that \u00a7 46a-58 does not apply to forms of discrimination that are prohibited by distinct statutes. Section 46a-58 would be superfluous only if there is a distinct discrimination statute for every conceivable form of discrimination covered by that statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b768-4\"> The majority is \u201chighly dubious\u201d that its opinion in this case would lead to such a result and disclaims any suggestion that the commission would have jurisdiction over \u201cclaims of <em>systemic </em>racial isolation in the public schools . .. (Emphasis added.) I cannot perceive any basis for the majority\u2019s doubt. If, as the majority has concluded, violations of \u00a7 10-15c\u2014which does not distinguish between \u201ca discrete course of . . . discriminatory conduct by an identified school official\u201d and \u201csystemic\u201d discrimination\u2014fall within \u00a7 46a-58,1 simply do not understand what authority this court could invoke to avoid enforcing the remedy provided by \u00a7 46a-86 (c). In <em>Sheff, </em>we left the fashioning of the remedy for the state <em>constitutional </em>violation to the legislature and the executive branch in deference to the constitutional authority of those branches. The legislature, in the exercise of its constitutional authority, already has fashioned a specific statutory remedy for the violation of \u00a7 46a-58, however. Does the majority believe that the enforcement of that remedy in a case involving systemic discrimination would violate the state or federal constitution? If not, then what principle would justify its refusal to enforce the remedy?</p>\n<p id=\"b769-12\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>Moreover, the distinction that the majority attempts to draw between \u201ca discrete course of . . . discriminatory conduct by an identified school official\u201d and \u201csystemic\u201d discrimination is illusory. Discrimination claims, by their very nature, involve classes of persons. If a single teacher discriminates against 400 members of a protected class over the course of ten years, is that a compensable \u201cdiscrete course of . . . discriminatory conduct\u201d or is it noncompensable \u201csystemic\u201d discrimination? What is the result if an entire school district discriminates over the course of ten years against a single member of a protected class who is within its jurisdiction? Will the success of a claim for damages brought under \u00a7 10-15c, through \u00a7 46a-58, depend on the number of persons who can bring a similar claim? The majority may believe that the commission and our courts will be able to provide principled answers to these questions. I have serious doubts. More importantly, I do not believe that the legislature intended to give them the authority to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-13\">Finally, the majority relies on the \u201ctotal absence of any legislative, executive or judicial indication that the commission would have any role, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 46a-58 or 46-86 (c), or otherwise, in that remedial scheme\u201d in support of its position. Once again, the majority assumes what it should prove\u2014 that the silence of the legislature, the executive branch and the judiciary shows that they believed that the commission had no jurisdiction over claims of <em>systemic </em>discrimination. That silence may just as easily be interpreted as establishing that the legislature, the executive branch and the judiciary believed that the commission had no jurisdiction over <em>any </em>claims of racial discrimination arising in the public schools, systemic or otherwise.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
