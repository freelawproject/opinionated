Sinvil, of his federal due process right to a fair trial. We agree with the state. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following relevant facts, as set forth in the opinion of the Appellate Court. \u201cThe defendant and the victim\u2019s husband, B,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> had been friends for several years. The defendant came to know the victim, A, through his relationship with B. All three were originally from Haiti. After having known each other for several years, the defendant and A\u2019s family moved to Norwich at approximately the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>time. The friendship between the defendant and B was such that B gave the defendant a key to his family\u2019s apartment. The defendant would visit B almost every day. The defendant and B would play cards together at B\u2019s apartment, and the defendant frequently had meals there. Using the key given to him, the defendant also would spend time at his friend\u2019s apartment even when B and A were not there.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">\u201cIn time, both the defendant and B obtained jobs at Foxwoods Casino. The defendant worked as a bus driver, and his scheduled working hours were generally from 4 p.m. until approximately midnight.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> B worked in a different department and usually was scheduled to work until 2 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">\u201cA and the defendant were the two principal witnesses at trial. A testified that at approximately 12:30 a.m. on September 28, 1999, she was sleeping alone in the bedroom she shared with B, while her two sons were sleeping in an adjacent bedroom. A testified that she awoke to find somebody behind her in bed. At first, she believed it to be B, but she turned and discovered that it was the defendant. According to her, she and the defendant struggled, during which time the defendant told her that he loved her and he wanted to have sex with her. She related that the defendant held her hands down as he touched her under her nightgown. At some point, A could feel the defendant becoming aroused. A managed to calm the defendant, and she was able to get to her bathroom and lock herself inside. The defendant stayed for a short time, calling to A from outside of the bathroom, but he eventually left. When B got home from work at approximately 2:30 a.m., A did not tell him what had happened that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">\u201cApproximately two days later, after speaking about the incident with two coworkers and B, A did contact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>the police. The defendant was arrested and charged with sexual assault in the fourth degree and unlawful restraint in the second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">\u201cThe defendant testified on his own behalf at trial. According to the defendant, he and A had engaged in a continuing consensual extramarital sexual affair over several months. The defendant testified that A and B argued frequently, and that she had turned to their mutual friend, the defendant, for comfort. He claimed that the incident of September 28 was actually a consensual sexual encounter which began in A\u2019s kitchen, where she met the defendant that night, and proceeded to the bedroom. At trial, the defendant maintained that A had accused him of attacking her to protect her reputation in the community.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Sinvil, </em>76 Conn. App. 761, 763-64, 821 A.2d 813 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">The jury thereafter convicted the defendant of one count of sexual assault in the fourth degree and one count of unlawful restraint in the second degree. After the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal notwithstanding the verdict was denied, the trial court rendered judgment in accordance with the jury verdict. The trial court then sentenced the defendant to a term of two years imprisonment, execution suspended after eight months, as well as a term of ten years probation and mandatory sex offender registration. Subsequently, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion for sentence modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">On appeal to the Appellate Court, the defendant claimed, in part, that the prosecutor had committed misconduct by improperly commenting on facts that were not in evidence during the rebuttal phase of his closing argument. Id., 769. Specifically, the defendant contended that the prosecutor improperly had made statements regarding his own physical condition and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>questions that he should have asked A during the trial,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that the improper statements adversely had impacted the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. Id. The Appellate Court agreed with the defendant both that the statements were improper; id., 771; and that the improprieties violated his due process right to a fair trial such that a reversal of his judgment of conviction was warranted. Id., 774. We subsequently granted the state\u2019s petition for certification to appeal limited to the following issue: \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>reverse the defendant\u2019s conviction on the basis of prosecutorial misconduct?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Sinvil, </em>264 Conn. 916, 826 A.2d 1160 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">The state first claims that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the defendant\u2019s due process right to a fair trial had been violated by the acts of prosecutorial misconduct. More specifically, the state contends that the statements at issue, although improper, did not rise to the level of depriving the defendant of a fair trial. The state maintains that, pursuant to the standard articulated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>204 Conn. 523, 540, 529 A.2d 653 (1987),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the improper statements did not constitute a due process violation because they were: (1) invited by defense counsel\u2019s closing argument; (2) not severe; (3) an isolated instance of preserved misconduct;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (4) not directed toward the central issue in the case; (5) cured by the trial court\u2019s general but detailed jury instructions; and (6) outweighed by the strength of the state\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">\u201c[I]n analyzing claims of prosecutorial misconduct, we engage in a two step analytical process. The two steps are separate and distinct: (1) whether misconduct occurred in the first instance; and (2) whether that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>misconduct deprived a defendant of his due process right to a fair trial. Put differently, misconduct is misconduct, regardless of its ultimate effect on the fairness of the trial; whether that misconduct caused or contributed to a due process violation is a separate and distinct question that may only be resolved in the context of the entire trial . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Coney, </em>266 Conn. 787, 808, 835 A.2d 977 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">The first step in the analysis is whether the prosecutor\u2019s comments during closing argument constituted misconduct. We need not reach a decision on this issue because the state has conceded<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that the prosecutor\u2019s challenged remarks were improper.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordingly, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>only issue for our consideration is whether the admitted misconduct deprived the defendant of his due process right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">The second stage of the analysis focuses on the overall fairness of the trial and whether the misconduct, in its totality, amounted to a due process violation. It is the state\u2019s position that the prosecutor\u2019s improper statements during closing argument did not rise to such a level. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">\u201c[T]he touchstone of due process analysis in cases of alleged prosecutorial misconduct is the fairness of the trial, and not the culpability of the prosecutor.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>266 Conn. 440, 457, 832 A.2d 626 (2003). \u201cTo prove prosecutorial misconduct [rising to the level of a due process violation], the defendant must demonstrate substantial prejudice. ... In order to demonstrate this, the defendant must establish that the trial as a whole was fundamentally unfair and that the misconduct so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the conviction a denial of due process. . . . [Prosecutorial misconduct of constitutional proportions may arise during the course of closing argument, thereby implicating the fundamental fairness of the trial itself . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ceballos, </em>266 Conn. 364, 376, 832 A.2d 14 (2003). \u201c[I]t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>is not the prosecutor\u2019s conduct alone [however] that guides our inquiry, but, rather, the fairness of the trial as a whole.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Coney, supra, 266 Conn. 807.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">\u201c[I]n determining whether prosecutorial misconduct was so serious as to amount to a denial of due process, this court, in conformity with courts in other jurisdictions, has focused on several factors. . . . Included among those factors are the extent to which the misconduct was invited by defense conduct or argument . . . the severity of the misconduct . . . the frequency of the misconduct . . . the centrality of the misconduct to the critical issues in the case . . . the strength of the curative measures adopted . . . and the strength of the state\u2019s case.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>supra, 266 Conn. 478. We will address each of these issues in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">Whether the Misconduct Was Invited</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">We conclude that the challenged statements of the prosecutor were invited by the defense. During his closing, defense counsel made the following remarks: \u201cBut, if there was some sort of ruckus going on in the bedroom when the kids were sleeping in the other room, I think the kids would wake up in the middle of the night. Common sense dictates that they would have woken up if there was a real problem going on there. It makes more sense that the extramarital affair continued on that evening. . . . And that [A and B] have to stay here and save their reputations in the community . . . .\u201d This was an inference favoring the defendant based on A\u2019s failure to scream. Therefore, it invited the prosecutor to address the comments and offer an alternative explanation for the evidence. He did so with the challenged remarks, \u201ca large portion of this trial I was kind of burnt out . . . having a hard time focusing.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>... I probably should have asked her why she didn\u2019t scream,\u201d which served as a reminder to the jury that defense counsel's argument was merely an inference because A had never actually been questioned about her failure to scream. The prosecutor then proceeded to offer an alternative, equally valid inference\u2014that A\u2019s failure to act was motivated by a fear for her children\u2019s safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">Whether the Prosecutorial Misconduct Was Frequent and Severe</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">The misconduct in this matter was not frequent because it was limited to an isolated<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> series of remarks made during closing arguments. Although even \u201ca single instance of improper argument, properly preserved for . . . review, [can be] sufficient to warrant a reversal [of conviction],\u201d the degree of misconduct in this case does not rise to this level.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">Nor was the misconduct severe. First, it is very possible that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks regarding his negligence in questioning reflected negatively upon the state in the minds of the jurors by giving the impression of ill preparedness, and perhaps even incompetence. Second, we consider it significant that while defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>counsel objected to the inappropriate remarks at trial, he failed to request curative instructions or move for a mistrial. Presumably, defense counsel may \u201cnot [have] view[ed] the . . . impropriety as prejudicial enough to seriously jeopardize the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>supra, 266 Conn. 479. Finally, the prosecutor\u2019s remarks never insinuated that the jury should do anything other than decide the case based on all of the facts presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Whether the Misconduct Was Central to the Critical Issues in the Case and Whether Sufficient Curative Instructions Were Given</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Next, the misconduct in this matter was unrelated to the central issue at trial, namely, the credibility of A and the defendant, who offered competing testimony at trial about the alleged assault. As in <em>State </em>v. <em>Ceballos, </em>supra, 266 Conn. 416, this matter is characterized by a lack of physical evidence and conflicting testimony, making it a \u201ccredibility contest\u201d of sorts between A and the defendant. Unlike in <em>Ceballos, </em>however, we are not persuaded that the prosecutor\u2019s statements were designed to bolster or denigrate the credibility of either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">In <em>Ceballos, </em>the prosecutor improperly questioned the defendant directly about the veracity of the victim and made the following comments about him to the jury: \u201cI would submit that the defendant is not concerned about what God is going to do to him, not now anyways. He\u2019s worried about what you people are going to do, and that\u2019s why he had to say what he said yesterday.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 382. By these remarks, the prosecutor implied that the defendant had lied, which directly implicated the credibility of the victim. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>By contrast, in the present case, the prosecutor remarked that \u201ca large portion of this trial I was kind of burnt out on what was going on. I was having a hard time focusing. ... I probably should have asked her why she didn\u2019t scream. . . . There was no testimony from her or from the defendant . . . .\u201d This statement did not implicate the veracity of A or the defendant. It simply drew attention to the fundamental lack of evidence regarding why A did not call out. We cannot conclude, based on the facts of the record, that the prosecutor\u2019s comments in this matter improperly bolstered A\u2019s credibility, as they had in <em>Ceballos.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Likewise, we believe that the trial court\u2019s general jury instructions went a long way toward curing any harm resulting from the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct. In its final charge, the trial court stated to the jury: \u201c[I]t\u2019s 100 percent your duty to decide the facts in this case. You should not be influenced by whether you like me, the lawyers, or anybody.\u201d Also the trial court gave lengthy, detailed instructions about the central issue in the case, which was credibility.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201c[I]n the absence of an indication to the contrary, the jury is presumed to have followed [the trial court\u2019s] curative instructions.\u201d (Internal</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ceballos, </em>supra, 266 Conn. 413. Furthermore, we note that the defendant never requested any specific instructions from the trial judge. Accordingly, we conclude that the instructions were sufficiently thorough to mitigate any prejudice that the prosecutor\u2019s closing remarks may have caused.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Whether the Strength of the State\u2019s Case Outweighed the Prejudice of the Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">Finally, we conclude that the state\u2019s case against the defendant was sufficiently strong to sustain a conviction notwithstanding the improper statements from the prosecutor. There was ample trial testimony, both from A and the defendant, from which the jury could have made reasonable credibility determinations. Furthermore, while the lack of evidence may have increased the significance of the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct, we find the defendant\u2019s contention that it had a \u201cdirect impact\u201d on the \u201cotherwise tenuous\u201d outcome unpersuasive, particularly in light of the fact that the jury rendered its verdict within twenty minutes of beginning deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">On the basis of these six factors, we conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct did not deprive the defendant of his due process right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY</p>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">As an alternative ground for affirming the Appellate Court\u2019s decision, the defendant claims that we should invoke our supervisory authority to uphold the judgment reversing his conviction.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Specifically, the defendant requests that we exercise our supervisory powers to balance the interests of the parties in light of \u201cthe extent of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>prejudice endured [by the defendant] as a result of the [prosecutor\u2019s] damaging improper comments during the rebuttal portion of closing argument . . . .\u201d We decline to do so in this case. It is true that \u201c [e] ven when prosecutorial misconduct is not so egregious as to implicate the defendant\u2019s [due process] right to a fair trial, an appellate court may invoke its supervisory authority [over the administration of justice] to reverse a criminal conviction when the prosecutor deliberately engages in conduct that he or she knows, or ought to know, is improper. . . . Such a sanction generally is appropriate, however, only when the [prosecutor\u2019s] conduct is so offensive to the sound administration of justice that only a new trial can effectively prevent such assaults on the integrity of the tribunal.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Thompson, supra, 266 Conn. 485. In concluding that the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct in this matter was not patently \u201coffensive to the sound administration of justice\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) id.; we decline to exercise supervisory authority to affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed with respect to the claim of prosecutorial misconduct and the case is remanded to that court for consideration of the defendant\u2019s remaining claims on appeal.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">In this opinion VERTEFEUILLE and ZARELLA, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b536-7\"> The briefs fail to indicate whether, at the Appellate Court, the defendant relied upon the due process clause of the federal constitution, the state constitution, or both. To the extent that the defendant relied upon his state constitutional right to due process of law; Conn. Const., art. I, \u00a7 8; we decline to review the claim because there has been no independent analysis of the state constitutional issue, either before this court or before the Appellate Court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Coney, </em>266 Conn. 787, 791 n.5, 835 A.2d 977 (2003). \u201cWe have repeatedly apprised litigants that we will not entertain a state constitutional claim unless the defendant has provided an independent analysis under the particular provisions of the state constitution at issue. . . . Without a separately briefed and analyzed state constitutional claim, we deem abandoned the defendant\u2019s claim . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>255 Conn. 830, 835 n.12, 769 A.2d 698 (2001). We therefore regard the defendant\u2019s claim as arising under the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution, \u00a7 1, which provides in relevant part: \u201cNo State shall. . . deprive any person of life, liberty or property, without due process of law . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b536-8\"> In accordance with our policy of protecting the privacy interests of the victims of sexual abuse, we decline to identify the victim by name, or others through whom the victim\u2019s identify may be ascertained.

I think she said she was afraid something more was going to happen. That\u2019s a pretty major incident. That\u2019s pretty, pretty horrendous, actually, if you think about what\u2019s happening; even more horrendous if the kids were in the other room.

The state thereafter explicitly conceded prosecutorial misconduct during oral argument before this court in the following colloquy: \u201cThe state would agree that in this case the deputy assistant state\u2019s attorney should not have stated during his rebuttal argument that he was \u2018kind of burnt out\u2019 and 'had a hard time focusing on the trial\u2019 and [should have] directly asked [A] why she didn\u2019t scream during the assault.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b541-6\"> Both parties\u2019 briefs focus a majority of their discussion on misconduct on the following comments by the prosecutor: \u201c[A] large portion of this trial I was kind of burnt out on what was going on. I was having a hard time focusing,\u201d and \u201cI probably should have asked her why she didn\u2019t scream.\u201d They also identify another remark by the prosecutor, however, from the preserved excerpt that the defendant finds objectionable, namely: \u201c[I]f a man comes into the apartment while you\u2019re sleeping . . . that\u2019s not a minor incident. I think she said she was afraid something more was going to happen. That\u2019s a pretty major incident. That\u2019s pretty, pretty horrendous, actually, if you think about what\u2019s happening; even more horrendous if the kids were in the other room. She doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen to the kids.\u201d It is unclear whether the state intended to concede the impropriety of this statement along with the other remarks in this footnote; in any event, we do not find it to be improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">\u201cA prosecutor may invite the jury to draw reasonable inferences from the evidence; however, he or she may not invite sheer speculation unconnected to evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ceballos, </em>266 Conn. 364, 400, 832 A.2d 14 (2003). The remark in question was a response to defense counsel\u2019s characterization of the alleged assault as an illogical minor incident. \u201cCommon sense and logic just doesn\u2019t seem to tell you that [the defendant], after this long term relationship of ten years, all of a sudden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>decided this was the time to unlawfully restrain, in a minor type of alleged sexual assault fourth degree charge . . . .\u201d Moreover, the prosecutor\u2019s comment finds support in the record. In response to a question about how she was feeling during the incident A stated \u201cI feel like\u2014I was scared. I don\u2019t know. I feel\u2014It was awful.\u201d Additionally, \u201c[t]he mere use of phrases such as \u2018I would think,\u2019 \u2018I would submit,\u2019 and \u2018I really don\u2019t think,\u2019 does not transform a closing into the improper assertions of personal opinion by the state\u2019s attorney.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Coney, </em>supra, 266 Conn. 814. If it did, defense counsel would be guilty of the same misconduct. Defense counsel stated: \u201cI feel the state has not come close to meeting their burden of proof. I think [the defendant] is innocent and I don\u2019t think the state .... In fact, I believe that . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b544-10\"> In his brief, the defendant suggests that the court should consider nonpreserved claims for the narrow purpose of determining frequency, but not misconduct as a whole. We decline to do so pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 60-5, which indicates that the court on appeal is not bound to consider any claims that were not distinctly raised at trial. To do otherwise could prejudice unfairly the state on appeal because there has been no legal determination as to whether the challenged comments actually constituted misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-11\">Additionally, we disagree with the defendant\u2019s claim that the Appellate Court concluded that certain nonpreserved allegations of misconduct showed \u201ca pattern of improper comments throughout the trial.\u201d The Appellate Court simply remarked that \u201cthe improper remarks . . . were not isolated <em>occurrences.\u201dStates. Sinvil, </em>supra, 76 Conn. App. 773 n.7. To conclude therefrom that misconduct tainted the whole of the trial is an exaggerated reading of this remark.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b546-7\"> We do not find it necessary to transcribe the trial court\u2019s entire jury charge here. The following is a representative excerpt: \u201c[T]his is a case of credibility. In deciding what the facts are, you must consider all the evidence. In doing this, you must consider which testimony to believe and which testimony not to believe. You may believe all, none, or any part of a witness\u2019 testimony. In making that decision, you may take into account a number of factors, including the following. ... (1) Was the witness able to see or hear or know things about which the witness testified? (2) How well was the witness able to recall and describe those things? (3) What was the witness\u2019 manner while testifying? (4) Did the witness have an interest in the outcome of this case or any bias or prejudice concerning any party or any matter involved in the case? (5) How reasonable was the witness\u2019 testimony in considering in light of all the testimony in the case? (6) Was the witness\u2019 testimony contradicted by what the witness has said or done at another time or by the testimony of other witnesses or other evidence?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b547-12\"> Practice Book \u00a7 84-11 requires a party raising such alternative grounds to file paperwork for special permission before filing the brief. Section 84-11 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cIf such alternative grounds for affirmation or adverse rulings or decisions to be considered in the event of a new trial were not raised in the appellate court, the party seeking to raise them in the supreme court must move for special permission to do so prior to the filing of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>party\u2019s brief. Such permission will be granted only in exceptional cases where the interests of justice so require.\u201d Although the defendant failed to do so, \u201cwe have refused to consider an issue not contained in a preliminary statement of issues only in cases in which the opposing party would be prejudiced by consideration of the issue. \u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>269 Conn. 97, 99 n.2, 848 A.2d 445 (2004). Since the state did not contest this issue as prejudicial in a reply brief, we do not find it inappropriate to consider the defendant\u2019s alternative ground here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b548-9\"> The defendant raised three claims in the Appellate Court. In addition to the claim of prosecutorial misconduct, the defendant claimed that his right to a fair trial was violated by the failure of a court interpreter to interpret testimony completely for the jury and by certain juror misconduct. Although the Appellate Court reversed the judgment of the trial court and ordered anew trial on the claim of prosecutorial misconduct, the Appellate Court declined to address the other two claims raised by the defendant, stating that the issues were not likely to recur at the new trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Sinvil, </em>supra, 76 Conn.

I agree with the conclusion of the majority and with most of its reasoning. I concur separately only because I disagree with that portion of the majority\u2019s opinion in which the majority concludes that the improper remarks of the state\u2019s attorney were invited by defense counsel's comments during closing arguments. As the Appellate Court observed, \u201c[t]he prosecutor\u2019s [improper] remarks that he was \u2018burnt out\u2019 during the trial and \u2018having a hard time focusing\u2019 were made in response to defense counsel\u2019s argument that \u2018if there was some sort of ruckus going on in the bedroom when the kids were sleeping in the other room, I think the kids would wake up in the middle of the night.\u2019 In essence, defense counsel was arguing that the fact that [the victim] did not scream upon finding the defendant in her bed with her supported an inference that the encounter was consensual. . . . [Defense counsel thus] was arguing one possible permissible inference <em>from the evidence. </em>This was proper argument and . . . it did not invite a response in rebuttal which referred to irrelevant matters <em>not in </em>evidence.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Sinvil, </em>76 Conn. App. 761, 771-72, 821 A.2d 813 (2003). Although defense counsel\u2019s comments <em>did </em>invite the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s <em>proper </em>rebuttal argument that there had been no screaming or, alternatively, that the victim\u2019s children might not have heard any such screaming because they frequently slept with the television on, defense counsel\u2019s comments cannot fairly be characterized as inviting the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s <em>improper </em>rebuttal argument that, during trial, he was \u201cburnt out,\u201d \u201chaving a hard time focusing,\u201d and that he \u201cshould have asked [the victim] why she didn\u2019t scream.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">In my view, even though the improper comments of the state\u2019s attorney about his physical condition and his failure to ask the victim why she did not scream were not invited, I nevertheless do not believe that, under all the circumstances, those comments rise to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>the level of a due process violation. I therefore agree with the conclusion of the majority that, contrary to the determination of the Appellate Court, the improper remarks of the state\u2019s attorney do not warrant a new trial. Accordingly, I concur in the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b550-6\">SULLIVAN, C.

I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion because I agree with the Appellate Court\u2019s conclusion that the defendant was deprived of his due process right to a fair trial, as protected by the federal constitution, as a result of the prosecutor\u2019s improper \u201cattempt to affect the jury\u2019s decision by arguing facts not in evidence, namely, his own physical condition or the questions that he should have asked [and did not].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Sinvil, </em>76 Conn.
