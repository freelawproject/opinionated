We agree with the defendant and, accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for a new trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">The defendant, Luis DeJesus, Jr., was charged with sexual assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (1), and kidnapping in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-92 (a) (2) (A). The jury found the defendant guilty of both charges and the trial court rendered judgment of conviction on the verdict. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On the morning of March 21,2001, the victim, Tina C.,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> went to the defendant\u2019s residence in New Britain seeking employment as a day laborer. The defendant operated a roofing business and, approximately one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>and one-half to two years earlier, he had employed the victim as a day laborer for a period of one day when he first met her. Since that time, the victim had interacted socially with the defendant several times, including visiting his home. On at least one occasion, the victim had engaged in consensual sexual activity with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">Upon her arrival at approximately 7:30 a.m., the victim encountered the defendant in the parking lot of the apartment complex where he lived. The defendant was returning home from a bar, which was located about four blocks from the apartment complex, where he had consumed six or seven beers and then slept in his truck from approximately 3 a.m. until just before returning home that morning. The victim asked the defendant if he had any work for her that day. After the defendant told her that he had to make a telephone call to find out if any work was available, the victim accompanied the defendant into his apartment, where he went upstairs, while the victim sat on the couch in the living room. When the defendant joined the victim in the living room, he informed her that he was not sure if any work was available. During the conversation that followed, the defendant and the victim began to discuss the topic of sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">When the defendant expressed an interest in engaging in sexual activity with the victim, she indicated that she wanted to go home. Thereafter, the defendant and the victim engaged in a struggle, during which he held her by her arms to prevent her from leaving the apartment. The defendant then forced the victim to submit to vaginal intercourse, which culminated in the defendant ejaculating onto the victim\u2019s stomach. After the defendant used a cloth towel and the victim used a paper towel to wipe the semen from her stomach, the victim used the defendant\u2019s bathroom. When the victim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>returned from the bathroom, the defendant gave her $30, and she left the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">After leaving the apartment, the victim stopped to put gas in her car, went to a shopping mall and subsequently returned home.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Later that day, the victim telephoned her mother to tell her that she possibly had been raped. After her mother advised her to report the incident to the police, the victim went to the New Britain police department between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m., where Officer John Gonzalez took her written statement about the incident and filed a report.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">The following procedural history and the defendant\u2019s account of the incident<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> are also relevant to the resolution of this claim. At the beginning of the trial, the state filed a motion in limine requesting that the trial court prohibit the defendant from presenting evidence that the victim had engaged in or had claimed that she had engaged in prostitution, without a prior judicial ruling on the admissibility of such evidence. The state claimed that this evidence was irrelevant and prejudicial to the state\u2019s case. During argument on the motion, the state also claimed that the introduction of that evidence would violate General Statutes \u00a7 54-86f,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which is com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>monly known as the rape shield statute. The defendant responded that he intended to inquire of the victim whether she had engaged in prostitution, whether she had told an investigating officer that she had engaged in prostitution, and whether the defendant was aware that she had engaged in prostitution. The defendant argued that the evidence was admissible under subdivision (4) of \u00a7 54-86f because it was relevant to a critical issue in the case, namely, whether the sexual intercourse was consensual, and the exclusion of the evidence would violate the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights to present a defense and confront the complaining witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">The defendant\u2019s consent defense was predicated on the following account of the incident as set forth in evidence presented to the jury from the defendant\u2019s testimony at his violation of probation hearing and the statement that he gave to the police. When the defendant encountered the victim in the parking lot of the apartment complex, on the morning of March 21, 2001, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>he told her that he did not have any work at that time, but that if any work became available, he would call her. When the victim continued to ask the defendant about work, he invited her into his apartment to continue the discussion. The defendant had an expectation that the victim wanted to engage in sexual activity when he invited her into the apartment because of past experience with her. The victim followed the defendant into the apartment where the ensuing conversation eventually turned to the topic of sex. When the victim asked him whether he had a condom, the defendant went upstairs to search for a condom.but was unable to find one. The defendant returned to the living room, told the victim that he could not find a condom, and they continued to talk. During the discussion, the victim indicated that she could not have sexual intercourse with the defendant without a condom because she had genital herpes. After the defendant informed the victim that he also had genital herpes, she began to act in a provocative manner and engaged in consensual foreplay, culminating in the victim removing her clothes and engaging in consensual vaginal intercourse with him. The defendant ejaculated onto the victim\u2019s stomach because she requested that he not ejaculate into her vagina. After the defendant wiped the victim and himself off with the cloth towel, the victim wiped herself off with the paper towel and went into the bathroom. The victim returned and started another conversation with the defendant. When the defendant indicated that he was tired and asked the victim to leave, she requested $50. The defendant expressed surprise because he had not paid the victim for previous sexual activity, but she insisted on receiving the $50. The defendant told the victim that he had only $30, which he gave to her. The victim then counted the money and suggested that she would return for the balance of the $50 that she had requested. The defendant told the victim not to do so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>because his wife would be home. The victim stated, \u201c 1 warned you,\u2019 \u201d which the defendant understood to be a warning about the herpes, and then she left.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">The trial court postponed a ruling on the state\u2019s motion to prohibit the defendant from introducing evidence regarding the victim\u2019s prior history of prostitution until after the victim had given her direct testimony. Following the victim\u2019s direct testimony, the trial court permitted the defendant to make an offer of proof outside the presence of the jury. The defendant, in preparing his defense, had obtained a copy of Gonzalez\u2019 report,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> which included the victim\u2019s statements to Gonzalez that she had engaged in prostitution and that the defendant knew that she had engaged in prostitution. During his offer of proof, the defendant attempted to educe the victim\u2019s agreement that she had made the statements to Gonzalez.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The state objected to the evidence about the defendant\u2019s knowledge as being irrelevant, requiring speculation on the part of the victim, and being more prejudicial than probative. The defendant responded that the testimony was relevant and critical to the issue of consent, required no speculation on the victim\u2019s part, and helped establish a motive for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>victim to make false allegations of rape. The defendant also stated that precluding the inquiries would prejudice his defense. The trial court ruled that inquiries into whether the victim had asked for money, had accepted money or had been given money on the morning of March 21, 2001, were relevant, but that inquiries into \u201cprostitution on prior occasions and the defendant\u2019s knowledge of [the victim\u2019s] prostitution or alleged prostitution on prior occasions [were] not relevant and any probative value [was] outweighed by the prejudicial effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">The defendant claims that the trial court\u2019s ruling on the state\u2019s motion in limine deprived him of his constitutional rights to confront the witnesses against him and to present a defense under the sixth amendment to the United States constitution<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> as applied to the states through the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> by excluding evidence that the victim was a prostitute and that the defendant knew that the victim was a prostitute.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Specifically, the defendant contends that the trial court improperly excluded the evidence pursuant to \u00a7 54-86f as irrelevant and as having insufficient probative value to outweigh the prejudicial effect on the victim.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The defendant argues that the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>was admissible pursuant to \u00a7 54-86f (4) because it was relevant to his defense of consent in that the jury could have inferred both that the sexual intercourse was an act of prostitution on the part of the victim because she accepted money from the defendant afterward, and that the victim had a motive to fabricate her testimony because she received less money than she had requested. Further, the defendant argues that the exclusion of the evidence was harmful and warrants a new trial because the victim\u2019s credibility was crucial to the case against him. We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">\u201cThe primary interest secured by confrontation is the right to cross-examination . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Stale </em>v. <em>Lubesky, </em>195 Conn. 475, 481-82, 488 A.2d 1239 (1985). As an appropriate and potentially vital function of cross-examination, exposure of a witness\u2019 motive, interest, bias or prejudice may not be unduly restricted. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 316, 94 S. Ct. 1105, 39 L. Ed. 2d 347 (1974); <em>State </em>v. <em>Christian, </em>267 Conn. 710, 748, 841 A.2d 1158 (2004). Compliance with the constitutionally guaranteed right to cross-examination requires that the defendant be allowed to present the jury with facts from which it could appropriately draw inferences relating to the witness\u2019 reliability. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska, </em>supra, 318; <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>264 Conn. 1, 59, 836 A.2d 224 (2003), cert. denied, 541 U.S. 908, 124 S. Ct. 1614, 158 L. Ed. 2d 254 (2004). \u201c[Preclusion of sufficient inquiry into a particular matter tending to show motive, bias and interest may result in a violation of the constitutional requirements of the sixth amendment.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Colton, </em>227 Conn. 231, 249, 630 A.2d 577 (1993), on appeal after remand, 234 Conn. 683, 663 A.2d 339 (1995), cert, denied, 516 U.S. 1140, 116 S. Ct. 972, 133 L. Ed. 2d 892 (1996). Further, the exclusion of defense evidence may deprive the defendant of his constitutional right to present a defense. See, e.g., <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>410 U.S. 284, 289-90, 93 S. Ct. 1038, 35 L. Ed. 2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>297 (1973) (exclusion of testimony implicating uncharged individual in murder deprived defendant of right to present defense); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cerreta, </em>260 Conn. 251, 264, 796 A.2d 1176 (2002) (exclusion of hair and fingerprint evidence directly connecting third party to murder deprived defendant of right to present defense).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">Not every ruling that prevents the defendant from introducing evidence, however, rises to the level of a violation of his constitutional rights. <em>State </em>v. <em>Kulmac, </em>230 Conn. 43, 54, 644 A.2d 887 (1994) (evidence of prior sexual abuse of victims by other men properly excluded under rape shield statute where no indication existed victims were confused about different events or other events implicated motive to make false allegations against defendant). \u201cThe defendant\u2019s right to confront witnesses against him is not absolute, but must bow to other legitimate interests in the criminal trial process.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Mastropetre, </em>175 Conn. 512, 521, 400 A.2d 276 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">In a prosecution for sexual assault, \u00a7 54-86f sets forth the appropriate factors for consideration in determining the admissibility of evidence of the victim\u2019s sexual conduct. See footnote 9 of this opinion. The rape shield statute excludes evidence of an alleged victim\u2019s prior sexual conduct, with limited exceptions, for policy reasons. <em>State </em>v. <em>Christiano, </em>228 Conn. 456, 469, 637 A.2d 382, cert. denied, 513 U.S. 821, 115 S. Ct. 83, 130 L. Ed. 2d 36 (1994). Such policies \u201cinclude protecting the victim\u2019s sexual privacy and shielding her from undue harassment, encouraging reports of sexual assault . . . enabling the victim to testify in court with less fear of embarrassment . . . [and] avoiding prejudice to the victim, jury confusion and waste of time on collateral matters.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 469-70. Although the state has a substantial interest in promoting these goals, subdivision (4) of \u00a7 54-86f codifies the constitutional mandate that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>state\u2019s interest must yield to that of the defendant where the proffered evidence is \u201cso relevant and material to a critical issue in the case that excluding it would violate the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights.\u201d Because the primary issue in the present case was whether the sexual intercourse was consensual, any evidence that was so relevant and material to the issue of consent that excluding it would have violated the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights was admissible under \u00a7 54-86f (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">Determining whether evidence is relevant and material to critical issues in a case is an inherently fact-bound inquiry. \u201cRelevance depends on the issues that must be resolved at trial, not on the particular crime charged.\u201d J. Tanford &amp; A. Bocchino, \u201cRape Victim Shield Laws and the Sixth Amendment,\u201d 128 U. Pa. L. Rev. 544, 588 (1980). Consequently, the determination of whether the state\u2019s interest in excluding evidence under the rape shield statute must yield to the defendant\u2019s sixth amendment rights to confront the witnesses against him and to present a defense depends on the facts and circumstances of the particular case. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Christiano, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">Therefore, we first must determine whether the trial court\u2019s ruling preventing the defendant from questioning the victim about \u201c \u2018prostitution on prior occasions and the defendant\u2019s knowledge of her prostitution or alleged prostitution on prior occasions\u2019 \u201d resulted in the exclusion of evidence that was so relevant to a critical issue in the case, namely, whether the sexual intercourse was consensual, that, subject to a determination of the materiality of the evidence, it could have violated the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. We conclude that the evidence was sufficiently relevant to the issue of consent so as to result in such a violation, in that it supported the defendant\u2019s claim that the victim consented to the sexual intercourse and it suggested a motive for the victim to testify falsely.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>\u201cAs a general principle, evidence is relevant if it has a tendency to establish the existence of a material fact. One fact is relevant to another fact whenever, according to the common course of events, the existence of the one, taken alone or in connection with other facts, renders the existence of the other either certain or more probable.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Christiano, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 474. \u201cIf the proffered evidence is not relevant, the defendant\u2019s right to confrontation is not affected, and the evidence was properly excluded.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">The victim admitted telling an investigating officer that the defendant was aware that she had engaged in prostitution. Prostitution is commonly understood as engaging in sexual activity for money. In the present case, both parties agreed that sexual intercoruse occurred, and the victim admitted that she accepted money from the defendant following the sexual intercourse. Although the victim claimed that she had accepted the money to hasten her departure from the defendant\u2019s apartment, he claimed that she had, in fact, demanded the money as payment for the sexual intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">In <em>Demers </em>v. State, 209 Conn. 143, 159, 547 A.2d 28 (1988), we concluded that the victim\u2019s prior arrest for prostitution \u201ccould lead to a reasonable conclusion that the victim had agreed on at least one occasion in the past to perform sexual acts for money and that . . . [such a] conclusion would have been relevant to the issue of consent in the [defendants\u2019] criminal trial.\u201d We also noted that \u201cnumerous courts of other jurisdictions [had] recognized the relevancy and admissibility of evidence tending to establish that the alleged victim of a sexual assault was a prostitute in cases where, as here, consent was a defense to the sexual acts.\u201d Id. Although <em>Demers </em>involved a challenge to the trial court\u2019s finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>of a Brady-Agurs<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> violation, we concluded that the suppressed evidence of the victim\u2019s prior prostitution would have been admissible under subdivision (4) of \u00a7 54-86f because it implicated the defendants\u2019 sixth amendment rights to confront the witnesses against them. Id., 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">In the present case, as in <em>Demers, </em>the excluded evidence of the victim\u2019s prior prostitution deprived the jury of the necessary contextual framework to evaluate properly the defendant\u2019s version of events. Without such evidence, the jury was left to speculate as to why the defendant provided, and the victim accepted, the money that both agreed had been exchanged. Because the jury could have inferred, from the evidence presented, that the victim needed money from the fact that she had gone to the defendant\u2019s residence looking for work, it reasonably could have concluded that she accepted the money when it was offered because she needed money. Had the jury been allowed to consider the excluded evidence, however, it reasonably could have concluded, contrary to this explanation for why she accepted the money, that the victim accepted the money because she had performed an act of prostitution for which she expected payment. The evidence, therefore, was relevant to establish the victim\u2019s consent to the sexual intercourse, rather than her general unchaste character as prohibited by the rape shield statute. See Ii. Galvin, \u201cShielding Rape Victims in the State and Federal Courts: A Proposal for the Second Decade,\u201d 70 Minn. L. Rev. 763, 807 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>Also, without evidence of the victim\u2019s prior history of prostitution, the jury heard no evidence to explain why she would have had a reason to fabricate a sexual assault allegation against the defendant. \u201c[A]ny limitation on the impeachment of a key government witness is subject to the most rigorous appellate review.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Colton, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 250. If the jury had been allowed to consider the excluded evidence, it reasonably could have found, contrary to the implication that she simply needed money, that the victim demanded a fee for her services as she had done in the past. Further, it could have found that, when the defendant paid only part of the fee, the victim insisted that he pay the balance, and that, when he refused to do so and indicated that he would not do so in the future, she decided to fabricate a charge of sexual assault. In this context, the jury could have inferred that when the victim stated, \u201cI warned you,\u201d as she was leaving the apartment, she was warning the defendant about the consequences of failing to pay the additional $20, as opposed to his interpretation that she was warning him about the herpes.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">Evidence suggesting a motive for a false allegation was relevant to the jury\u2019s assessment of the victim\u2019s credibility. Indeed, the prosecutor admitted as much in closing argument when he encouraged the jurors to ask themselves what motive the defendant and the victim would have to give false information. The prosecutor then went on to ask the jury, \u201cWhat reason is there for [the victim] to give false information about what happened that morning?\u201d The excluded evidence could have provided a reasonable answer to that question, but without it, the jury was left without any basis to impute to the victim a motive to testify falsely.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">Having established that the excluded evidence was sufficiently relevant to the issue of consent, because it implicated both the victim\u2019s consent to the sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>intercourse and her motive to testify falsely, that its exclusion could have violated the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights, we next must determine whether the evidence was so material to that issue that its exclusion did violate his constitutional rights. Subdivision (4) of \u00a7 54-86f requires that, to be admissible, evidence must be \u201cso relevant and material to a critical issue in the case that excluding it would violate the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights.\u201d We conclude that evidence of the victim\u2019s prior history of prostitution and the defendant\u2019s knowledge of that history was sufficiently material to the issue of consent that its exclusion violated the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. As a result, the evidence was admissible under \u00a7 54-86f (4). The trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling was both improper and of constitutional magnitude, and that ruling requires reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">Although we have yet to define the term \u201cmaterial\u201d in the context of \u00a7 54-86f (4), we are guided by the standard of materiality developed in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 96 S. Ct. 2392, 49 L. Ed. 2d 342 (1976), and its progeny, including our own cases, in the context of prosecutorial suppression of evidence favorable to the defendant because those cases implicate the same constitutional rights contemplated by subdivision (4) of the statute. <em>Agurs </em>characterized material evidence as \u201ccreating] a reasonable doubt [of guilt] that did not otherwise exist . . . .\u201d Id., 112. The United States Supreme Court reformulated the standard in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 682, 105 S. Ct. 3375, 87 L. Ed. 2d 481 (1985). \u201c[E]vidence is material only if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A \u2018reasonable probability\u2019 is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d Id. Because we have consistently used the <em>Bagley </em>formulation as the standard for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>materiality in its constitutional sense; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilcox, </em>254 Conn. 441, 453-54, 758 A.2d 824 (2000); <em>State </em>v. <em>Tomasko, </em>242 Conn. 505, 518, 700 A.2d 28 (1997); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rasmussen, </em>225 Conn. 55, 92, 621 A.2d 728 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Shannon, </em>212 Conn. 387, 399, 563 A.2d 646, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 980, 110 S. Ct. 510, 107 L. Ed. 2d 512 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Pollitt, </em>205 Conn. 132, 142-43, 531 A.2d 125 (1987); and because we conclude that \u00a7 54-86f (4) refers to materiality in its constitutional sense, evidence is material for purposes of \u00a7 54-86f (4) if, considering the case without the excluded evidence, there is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the guilty verdict.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We conclude that this standard is met in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">First, the victim\u2019s testimony was the sine qua non of the state\u2019s case. Had the jury known of the victim\u2019s prior history of prostitution and the defendant\u2019s knowledge of that history, a reasonable probability exists that its verdict would have been affected. The state called no other witnesses to the incident at trial and introduced no physical evidence. In effect, the trial came down to a credibility contest between the victim and the defendant. Although the defendant was allowed to question the victim about whether she demanded money from him following sexual intercourse, the exclusion of the evidence that the victim had previously engaged in prostitution and that the defendant knew that she had previously engaged in prostitution prevented him from effectively presenting the defense of consent and developing her motive to make a false accusation, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>it denied the jury an opportunity to put the defendant\u2019s claims into context. The prosecutor conceded, at the close of the state\u2019s case and again during his closing argument, that the jury would have to credit the victim\u2019s testimony to convict the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">Second, the state\u2019s case, which was wholly dependent on the victim\u2019s testimony, was very weak. The victim displayed an extraordinary lack of memory concerning important aspects of the incident. The victim could not remember whether she or the defendant removed her clothes, how long the defendant\u2019s penis was inside her vagina, whether she asked the defendant for money before the sexual assault, how much money the defendant gave her, whether she discussed the defendant giving her money, whether she asked the defendant for money after the sexual assault, or whether she went home or to the mall after the assault. The victim claimed that she could not remember these details because her aversion to alcohol was so strong that the alcohol on the defendant\u2019s breath caused her to \u201cblackout.\u201d Yet, she was able to recall that the defendant helped her clean the semen off her stomach and that she went to the bathroom between the time of the sexual assault and the exchange of money. The victim also claimed that she could not remember prior testimony that she had given about the incident, indicating that even a review of the transcript of that testimony would not refresh her recollection. Permitting the introduction of evidence that could have provided the jury with additional reasons to question the victim\u2019s credibility may well have tipped the scales in the defendant\u2019s favor. Given the victim\u2019s anemic testimony and the centrality of her credibility to the state\u2019s case, there is a reasonable probability that, had the excluded evidence been admitted, the outcome of the case would have been different.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">To be admissible under the rape shield statute, evidence must meet not only the requirements of one or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>more of the individual subdivisions (1) through (4) of \u00a7 54-86f, but also must have probative value that outweighs its prejudicial effect on the victim. See footnote 9 of this opinion. We conclude that a trial court ruling that excludes evidence that was properly admissible under \u00a7 54-86f (4), however, requires reversal without the need for additional analysis of whether its probative value outweighs its prejudicial effect on the victim. This conclusion satisfies the objectives of the rape shield statute. \u201c [R] ape-shield laws were meant to exclude irrelevant and prejudicial evidence that does nothing but taint the fact-finding process. Because the defendant has no constitutional right to introduce irrelevant, prejudicial evidence, and because the policies underlying rape-shield legislation will be served by rejecting only the irrelevant and outdated uses of sexual conduct evidence, the interests of both \u2018sides\u2019 are symmetrical and need not be \u2018balanced\u2019 in the constitutional sense.\u201d H. Galvin, supra, 70 Minn. L. Rev. 887. In other words, evidence cannot be excluded as more prejudicial to the victim than probative when that exclusion has already been determined to violate the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b863-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>Accordingly, the evidence that the victim had engaged in prostitution and that the defendant knew that she had engaged in prostitution was so relevant and material to whether the sexual intercourse was consensual that it was admissible under \u00a7 54-86f (4), and the trial court\u2019s ruling excluding that evidence was improper. The improper exclusion of evidence admissible under \u00a7 54-86f (4) is, necessarily, of constitutional magnitude because the statutory subdivision defines the standard of admissibility in terms of the exclusion of the evidence resulting in a violation of the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">Normally, even when an evidentiary ruling has been determined to be both improper and of constitutional magnitude, the ruling will be reversed only if the state fails to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the ruling was harmless to the defendant. <em>State </em>v. <em>Colton, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 253; <em>State </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>224 Conn. 325, 333, 618 A.2d 32 (1992). We conclude, however, that an evidentiary ruling that excludes evidence properly admissible under \u00a7 54-86f (4), contrary to evidence admissible under the other subdivisions of the statute, requires reversal with no additional evaluation of harm, because the establishment of materiality, in a constitutional sense, also establishes harm to the defendant. Thus, analysis of whether the state has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the ruling was harmless to the defendant would only replicate the analysis already completed under the statute. Put another way, where a trial court ruling excludes evidence properly admissible under \u00a7 54-86f (4), implicit in the determination that the ruling was improper is the necessary conclusion that the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b845-10\"> The defendant appealed directly to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (b), which provides in relevant part: \u201cThe following matters shall be taken directly to the Supreme Court ...

Such evidence shall be admissible only after a hearing on a motion to offer such evidence containing an offer of proof.
