McNamara and Brian P. McNamara, appeal<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from the judgment of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>trial court rendered in favor of the named defendant, the Tournament Players Club of Connecticut, Inc.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly: (1) granted summary judgment for the defendant without affording the plaintiffs a fair opportunity to respond; (2) granted summary judgment for the defendant on the plaintiffs\u2019 claims of negligent infliction of emotional distress; and (3) granted summary judgment for the defendant on the statutory claims of Susan Z. McNamara. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">The following somewhat complicated procedural history is necessary to an understanding of this case. Certain facts are undisputed and are as follows: The plaintiffs are husband and wife. On July 17,1999, Brian P. McNamara was a member of a golf club, owned by the defendant, known as the Tournament Players Club at River Highlands (club). On that date, he and another male member became involved in a verbal dispute in or near the club\u2019s locker room. As a result, the defendant cancelled both men\u2019s memberships and refunded their initiation fees to them on a prorated basis. In October, 1999, Susan Z. McNamara applied for membership in the club. The club denied her application in writing, according to the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, \u201cbecause, and only because, she is a woman who is married to the plaintiff Brian McNamara.\u201d If she had been admitted to the club, her spouse would have had the use of the club\u2019s facilities from which he previously had been banned.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Thereafter, the plaintiffs brought this action. After various preliminary rulings, none of which is at issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>in this appeal,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint containing six counts, four on behalf of Susan Z. McNamara and two on behalf of Brian P. McNamara. The four counts on behalf of Susan Z. McNamara alleged: (1) negligent infliction of emotional distress; (2) discrimination by a golf country club in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 52-571d;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (3) discrimination in violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>of General Statutes \u00a7 46a-58 (a);<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and (4) discrimination in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 46a-64.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>counts on behalf of Brian P. McNamara alleged: (1) negligent infliction of emotional distress; and (2) dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>crimination on the basis of ethnicity in violation of \u00a7 52-571d.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">On February 3,2003, after the case had been assigned for trial, the defendant moved for permission to file a motion for summary judgment, alleging that it just recently had completed discovery after efforts to obtain documents and to depose the plaintiffs had been delayed by the plaintiffs. In its proposed motion and supporting papers, the defendant asserted that both plaintiffs, in deposition testimony, had admitted \u201cfacts which are dispositive of every cause of action they have asserted . . . .\u201d The defendant argued as follows regarding the claims of Susan Z. McNamara. As to her marital status discrimination claim, her allegations were based, not on her marital status, namely, being single, married, separated, divorced or widowed, but on the identity of her spouse, and, therefore, were not within the contemplation of the various discrimination statutes on which she relied. Further in this regard, the defendant brought forth evidence that, as a factual matter, the plaintiffs had admitted in their depositions that Susan Z. McNamara had been denied membership only because of the identity of her spouse, namely, Brian P. McNamara, and not because of her gender or her marital status, and that she would have been granted membership if she had been married to someone else. Finally, the defendant brought forth evidence that the plaintiffs also had admitted in their depositions that the club never had refused an application from a woman, that many of its members were women, that many of those women were married, and that there was no discriminatory atmosphere toward women at the club. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>Regarding the plaintiffs\u2019 emotional distress claims, the defendant argued that: the plaintiffs had failed to allege or establish any negligent conduct by the club; there was no breach of duty by the club to Susan Z. McNamara because the only act complained of was the written notification of the rejection of her application, which did not meet the legal requirement that the club\u2019s conduct be so egregious that it should have realized that it was creating a risk of causing emotional distress; and, based on the plaintiffs\u2019 deposition testimony, answers to interrogatories, and discovery responses, the plaintiffs had failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact that they had suffered any emotional distress as a result of the club\u2019s rejection letter. On February 4, 2003, the trial court, <em>Gordon, J., </em>denied the defendant\u2019s motion for permission to file the summary judgment motion because of its lateness and because jury selection was scheduled to begin on the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">Jury selection began on March 4, 2003. After the third venireperson had been excused, the trial court, <em>Gordon, J., </em>reconsidered its decision regarding the defendant\u2019s filing of the motion for summary judgment. At that point, a lengthy and, at times, somewhat confusing colloquy took place among the court and counsel<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> regarding the motion for summary judgment. The court noted that it \u201chad just read through\u201d the summary judgment motion, and asked the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel if he had read it. He responded in the negative, but asked the court for the opportunity to review it. The court then stated that it would recess at noon to \u201cgive everybody a chance to get ready . . . .\u201d The court then asked the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, \u201chow much time do you need to prepare to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>argue the motion?\u201d The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel replied that he would need \u201cfifteen, twenty minutes to go through the briefs and then take another, say that amount of time to look through the depositions . . . .\u201d The court then stated: \u201cWell, I\u2019d give you more time than that. Why don\u2019t we do this. . . . Rather than continue with this? . . . Why don\u2019t we take [until], is 12:15 enough time?\u201d The plaintiffs counsel replied: \u201cI think it should be . . . .\u201d The court then stated: \u201cAll right. If it\u2019s not, at 12:15 . . . we\u2019ll argue it, and that way, if the case is going to get bounced on the law, if [the plaintiffs] don\u2019t have a discrimination claim, if they don\u2019t have a marital discrimination claim . . . then we may as well let the jury go . . . [and] your client[s] [do not] have to come and then they can just go straight to their appeal if they want to take an appeal . . . .\u201d The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel replied: \u201cWell... if it looks like it\u2019s going to get bounced on a directed verdict anyway, then we might as well save it and litigate the issue [in the] Appellate Court.\u201d The court then recessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">Upon resuming after the recess, the court asked the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel: \u201cDo you need some more time?\u201d The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel replied, \u201cJust a couple [of] seconds . . . Your Honor.\u201d The court then heard the arguments of the defendant\u2019s counsel on the merits of the summary judgment motion. Those arguments addressed all of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims, including: Susan Z. McNamara\u2019s gender and marital status discrimination claims; Brian P. McNamara\u2019s ethnicity discrimination claim; and both plaintiffs\u2019 negligent infliction of emotional distress claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel then stated: \u201cBefore, I . . . review some of the facts, I feel almost a little at a loss; I didn\u2019t call the office to see if we\u2019d ever prepared a response to the summary judgment, proposed summary judgment motion.\u201d The court replied: \u201c[WJould you like to?\u201d The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel replied that \u201cI do understand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>the . . . disputes in this case . . . .\u201d The court then stated: \u201c[I]f you want to write something, I\u2019ll be glad to hold this over [until] tomorrow ... if you want to put something together, that\u2019s fine.\u201d The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel replied that he \u201cwould actually feel a little more comfortable doing so only because there are a few issues in here that I want to make sure I have thoroughly prepared . . . the negligent infliction law I\u2019m well acquainted with. I am well acquainted with [\u00a7 52-571d] .... The general law on marital status, I know; I\u2019d just feel a little more comfortable if I had [something] in writing I can present to Your Honor . . . .\u201d When the court asked the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel whether the facts were in dispute, he replied that \u201cI do have a couple [of] distinctions in fact ... to opposing counsel.\u201d When the court asked, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you let me know what those are,\u201d the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel replied with a detailed discussion related solely to the claim of Brian P. McNamara of discrimination based on ethnicity. This was followed by a very brief reference by the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel on the law regarding negligent infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">The court then asked the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel to \u201ctell me about the . . . marital status [discrimination] issue . . . .\u201d The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel replied that \u201cthe claim here that we made was that [Susan Z.] McNamara applies and is denied because she\u2019s married to [Brian P.] McNamara. . . . And so that was . . . how . . . the complaint was drafted.\u201d When the court responded that \u201cthat\u2019s just . . . who her partner is,\u201d the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel replied that, according to his understanding of the law of marital status discrimination, \u201cthe general law on marital status . . . taik[s] about ... if someone\u2019s discriminated because they\u2019re married . . . it\u2019s not because of who you\u2019re married to, is what I understand . . . the general law on that to be.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>The court then stated: <footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> [I]t seems that </em>[Susan Z.] McNamara\u2019s claims are out, because I don\u2019t think marital status or gender are covered. <em>I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any intentional infliction of emotional distress, </em>and I don\u2019t think he has a separate action for negligent infliction of emotional distress.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The court then stated that Brian P. McNamara \u201cmight . . . still have, a case for . . . discrimination based on ethnicity . . . .\u201d The court indicated that Brian P. McNamara had \u201cmore counts in that,\u201d whereupon the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel acknowledged that \u201c[t]here were more, but I think those are what it boiled down to,\u201d and the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel then agreed with the court that the other counts of Brian P. McNamara were \u201crepetitive\u201d of his ethnicity discrimination claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">The court then stated: \u201cSo we can go through them; but <em>it seems to me </em>that everything else is going to go except for [Brian P. McNamara\u2019s ethnicity discrimination claim], and I\u2019m not even sure about that; but what I\u2019d like to do is give you the opportunity until tomorrow morning at 10 to just come back on that issue.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel replied: \u201cOkay, Your Honor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">The court then stated: <em>\u201cSo let\u2019s make the preliminary ruling that the rest of the case, let me go through them, just.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The defendant\u2019s counsel then offered further argument on Brian P. McNamara\u2019s ethnicity discrimination claim, and the court asked the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel: \u201cDo you want until tomorrow to actually write something on this?\u201d The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel responded that, \u201cto protect my Ghent\u2019s interests . . . I would ask for 10 o\u2019clock tomorrow morning ... to have something in writing before you.\u201d The court responded: \u201cRight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">The court then revisited the defendant\u2019s summary judgment motion. The court stated as follows: \u201cCount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>two is Susan McNamara\u2019s claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress. The court does not find that there . . . was actionable behavior. This being a private club they can accept or reject membership without fear of a negligent infliction of emotional distress claim unless you\u2019re protected under one of the other classes which is statutorily carved out . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court then addressed Susan Z. McNamara\u2019s three statutory claims and rejected them as insufficient because they were based solely on \u201cher choice of . . . marital partner</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">This left only Brian P. McNamara\u2019s two claims, namely, his claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress, and his claim for discrimination based on ethnicity. The court rejected the first claim \u201cfor the same reasons that\u201d Susan Z. McNamara\u2019s claims were rejected, namely, that there was no actionable behavior by the defendant. Regarding the second claim, on which Brian P. McNamara claimed only the equitable remedy of reinstatement to the club, the court stated that \u201cwe\u2019ll take this up at 10 o\u2019clock tomorrow morning,\u201d without the necessity of a jury. The court stated to the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel that he could present his written response at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">The court convened the next morning on March 5, 2003. A lengthy hearing ensued on Brian P. McNamara\u2019s remaining claim of discrimination based upon ethnicity, including both oral argument and testimony. Ultimately, on March 10, 2003, Brian P. McNamara withdrew that claim.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The court subsequently rendered judgment in favor of the defendant \u201cas to all counts claimed to the jury.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>The plaintiffs first claim that the trial court improperly granted the defendant\u2019s summary judgment motion \u201cwithout affording the plaintiffs a fair opportunity to respond.\u201d This claim challenges the summary judgment on the following counts: (1) Susan Z. McNamara\u2019s claims of negligent infliction of emotional distress, discrimination by a golf country club in violation of \u00a7 52-571d, discrimination in violation of \u00a7 46a-58 (a), and discrimination in violation of \u00a7 46a-64; and (2) Brian P. McNamara\u2019s claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">The plaintiffs\u2019 claim comes to us in two parts. The first is a legal claim, namely, that, based upon the decision of the Appellate Court in <em>Krevis </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>64 Conn. App. 176, 779 A.2d 838 (2001), rev\u2019d, 262 Conn. 813, 817 A.2d 628 (2003), the trial court may not, sua sponte, raise and decide a motion for summary judgment because Practice Book (2003 Rev.) \u00a7 17-45<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cprovides that no motion for summary judgment may be placed on a short calendar to be heard less than [fifteen] day[s] after the motion has been filed and that the opposing party must file opposition papers at least five days before the short calendar date.\u201d The second is a factual claim, namely, that as a matter of fact, the trial court, having sua sponte raised the motion for summary judgment, did not give the plaintiffs a fair opportunity to respond to it. We disagree with both propositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>The plaintiffs\u2019 first proposition is simply wrong on the law because we subsequently reversed the Appellate Court\u2019s judgment in <em>Krevis </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>supra, 64 Conn. App. 176. In <em>Krevis </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>supra, 262 Conn. 818, we held that, despite the provisions of Practice Book \u00a7 17-45, the trial court, in the exercise of its case management authority, has the discretion, as a trial is about to begin, \u201cto decide a dispositive question of law that the parties to the case submit to the court orally, without a written motion <em>or compliance with certain applicable provisions of the Practice Book.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Emphasis added.) A fortiori, the trial court in the present case had such discretion to decide, without compliance with the applicable scheduling provisions of the rules of practice regarding summary judgment motions, dispositive questions of law that had been presented in writing previously to the court but had not been ruled on because of untimeliness.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">We also disagree with the plaintiffs that, as a factual matter, the procedure followed by the court in taking up and deciding the summary judgment motion deprived the plaintiffs of a fair opportunity to respond to it. This claim invokes the question, under <em>Krevis, </em>of whether the trial court abused its discretion in considering the motion for summary judgment out of the ordinary course. We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">We first note what the plaintiffs, through their counsel, did not do. They did not, at any time during the two days of hearings, claim to the trial court that it was depriving them of a fair opportunity to respond to the defendant\u2019s summary judgment motion. They did not, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>moreover, at any time after the court decided the motion, move for the court to reconsider its rulings. Indeed, at no time during the entire process of this appeal have the plaintiffs suggested anything, by way of testimony, documentation, or otherwise, that they would or could have adduced in response to the motion for summary judgment to undermine the propriety of any of the court\u2019s rulings on it. Although we do not suggest that a counsel, who complains on appeal of having been treated unfairly by a trial court\u2019s sua sponte consideration of a legal question, has an inviolate obligation to move for reconsideration or to supplement the appellate record, the counsel\u2019s failure to make such a supplemental effort or to voice any specific objection to the fairness of the court\u2019s procedure, either during or after that procedure, is indicative that the counsel did not regard the procedure as unfair at the time and, consequently, undermines any appellate claim to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">We next focus on what the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel did do. When first asked by the court how much time he needed to review the motion, he asked for fifteen or twenty minutes and, when the court stated that it would give him more time than that, he agreed that until 12:15 p.m. would be sufficient. He also agreed with the court that, if the case were destined to be subject to a directed verdict for the defendant, \u201cthen we might as well save it and litigate the issue\u201d on appeal. After the recess, he affirmatively stated that he needed only a few more seconds. He also stated that he understood the case, was well acquainted with the law on negligent infliction of emotional distress, on discrimination by a golf country club, and on discrimination on the basis of marital status. When asked what facts were in dispute, the only ones that he identified related to the claim of Brian P. McNamara regarding discrimination on the basis of ethnicity, which was ultimately withdrawn and is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>before us in this appeal. Further, he acknowledged that Susan Z. McNamara\u2019s claim for marital status discrimination was based solely, not on the fact that she was a married <em>woman, </em>but solely on the fact that she was married to Brian P. McNamara.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">We acknowledge that the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel did, at the court\u2019s invitation, say that he would like to have the opportunity to present something in writing to the court the next morning. The court acknowledged and agreed to that request. Nonetheless, on the next morning, the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel did not file any such written response.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 claim of unfair treatment, therefore, distills into the contention that, despite their counsel\u2019s request to file a written response to the motion the next morning, which the court granted, the court went ahead and decided the motion without honoring that request. We conclude, however, that a fair reading of the record discloses that the court, rather than actually deciding the motion on that day, instead issued what it regarded as a preliminary ruling on the motion that the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel was free to dispute the next day but did not. Therefore, the plaintiffs were not deprived by the trial court of a fair opportunity to respond to the summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">First, the trial court, when initially discussing the merits of Susan Z. McNamara\u2019s claims, did so in quite tentative terms. The court stated: that <em>\u201cit </em>seems\u201d that her claims of gender and marital status discrimination were \u201cnot covered\u201d by the statutes on which she relied; that <em>\u201cI don\u2019t think </em>[she had established] any intentional infliction of emotional distress\u201d; and that <em>\u201cit seems to me </em>that everything else is going to go except for\u201d Brian P. McNamara\u2019s ethnicity discrimination claim. (Emphasis added.) The court then stated, with regard to her claims: \u201cSo, let\u2019s make <em>the preliminary ruling\" </em>on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>them. (Emphasis added.) It was not until after this preface, indicating that its rulings were to be regarded as preliminary and not final, that the court turned to those claims again and, although not repeating that tentative phraseology, rendered its preliminary rulings on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">Second, we note, again, that at no time during this colloquy, or the next morning when the case resumed on the remaining claim of Brian P. McNamara, or at any time while the case was still in the trial court, did the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel claim that he had been deprived of a fair opportunity to respond to the summary judgment motion. This is powerful evidence that he, too, understood the court\u2019s initial rulings to be preliminary and remaining subject to challenge by him the next day. Furthermore, as we have indicated, to this day the plaintiffs have not suggested any supplemental factual material that might have been offered the next day, or thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">The plaintiffs next claim that, even if its procedure were permissible, the trial court improperly granted summary judgment for the defendant on the plaintiffs\u2019 claims of negligent infliction of emotional distress. The plaintiffs read the trial court\u2019s ruling on these claims as \u201cboil[ing] down to two points: (1) the defendant is a private club and a private club can do anything it likes to people without being sued for the negligent infliction of emotional distress; [and] (2) a negligent infliction of emotional distress claim will not lie absent expert medical testimony and the plaintiffs had not disclosed an expert physician in the case.\u201d We do not read the bases of the court\u2019s decision in such a cramped manner, especially considering the summary judgment papers that the court had before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">With respect to the claims of negligent infliction of emotional distress, we agree with the defendant that the only act of negligence by the defendant on which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>the plaintiffs have relied was the club\u2019s act in sending Susan Z. McNamara the letter of rejection of her application for membership.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u201cIn order to recover on a claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant should have realized that its conduct involved an unreasonable risk of causing emotional distress and that that distress, if it were caused, might result in illness or bodily harm.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gomes </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>258 Conn. 603, 619, 783 A.2d 462 (2001). There was no basis for a rational inference that the sending of the rejection letter under these circumstances conceivably could have met this standard. The trial court\u2019s granting of the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment on these claims, therefore, was justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">The plaintiffs\u2019 final claim is that the trial court improperly granted summary judgment for the defendant on Susan Z. McNamara\u2019s gender discrimination claims because the trial court considered the counts containing those claims solely as marital status claims. We note first, however, that Susan Z. McNamara never asked the trial court to rule specifically on her gender discrimination claim, separately from her marital status claim. We regard its ruling, therefore, as implicitly rejecting her gender discrimination claim as well. Furthermore, contrary to her wholly conclusory assertion that \u201c[t]he evidence, construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, as it should have been . . . was sufficient to permit a jury determination that (a) the defendant was not really a private club at all and (b) [Susan Z. McNa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>mara] would not have been denied membership had she been a man,\u201d we conclude that there was no such evidence, and that the only evidence adduced on the motion for summary judgment showed convincingly that there was no gender discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">The plaintiffs alleged that Susan Z. McNamara\u2019s application had been denied solely because she was married to Brian P. McNamara. Susan Z. McNamara testified in her deposition that there was no discriminatory atmosphere toward women at the club, that the club had denied her application because she was married to Brian P. McNamara, and that she would have been admitted had she been married to someone else. Brian P. McNamara testified that she would have been admitted had she been married to someone else because the club had \u201cnever refused\u201d an application by a woman. It is clear, therefore, that the denial of her application was based on her status as Brian P. McNamara\u2019s spouse, and had nothing to do with her gender.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b199-10\"> The plaintiffs appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b200-6\"> Originally, the PGA Tour Construction Services, Inc., was named as a defendant in this case. The trial court, <em>Gilardi, J., </em>granted that defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the claims against it on the basis of lack of personal jurisdiction. The plaintiffs do not challenge that ruling in this appeal. We refer herein to the Tournament Players Club of Connecticut, Inc., as the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b201-4\"> Although these preliminary rulings are not challenged in the present appeal, we note them briefly because they bear on the propriety of the later rulings by the trial court that are involved in this appeal. In September, 2001, the trial court, <em>Gilardi, J., </em>ruled on the defendant\u2019s multipart motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, to strike certain counts in the plaintiffs\u2019 original complaint. In that motion, the defendant had moved to strike three of the counts on behalf of Susan Z. McNamara, in which she had alleged that the defendant had denied her application \u201c \u2018because, and only because, she is a woman who is married to the plaintiff Brian McNamara.\u2019 \u201d Construing those counts as alleging gender discrimination in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46a-58, 46a-64 and 52-57M, and construing them favorably to the plaintiffs, as the court was required to do on a motion to strike, the court ruled that they \u201cma[d]e out a sufficient claim of gender discrimination.\u201d At the same time, however, the court expressed doubt that Susan Z. McNamara had sufficiently alleged a claim of marital status discrimination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b201-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-57M provides: \u201c(a) For the purposes of this section, \u2018golf country club\u2019 means an association of persons consisting of not less than twenty members who pay membership fees or dues and which maintains a golf course of not less than nine holes and (1) receives payment for dues, fees, use of space, facilities, services, meals or beverages, directly or indirectly, from or on behalf of nonmembers or (2) holds a permit to sell alcoholic liquor under chapter 545.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-6\">\u201c(b) No golf country club may deny membership in such club to any person on account of race, religion, color, national origin, ancestry, sex, marital status or sexual orientation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-7\">\u201c(c) All classes of membership in a golf country club shall be available without regard to race, religion, color, national origin, ancestry, sex, marital status or sexual orientation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-8\">\u201c(d) A golf country club that allows the use of its facilities or services by two or more adults per membership, including the use of such facilities or services during restricted times, shall make such use equally available to all adults entitled to use such facilities or services under that membership.
