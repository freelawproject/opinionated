Because Tele Tech has failed to demonstrate that its substantial rights were prejudiced, however, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">We first set forth the facts relevant to this case. In December, 1997, Tele Tech applied for, and was granted, a certificate of public convenience and necessity for the operation of pay telephone services in Connecticut<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 16-247g (a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>Subsequently, in response to numerous consumer complaints, the department initiated an investigation of Tele Tech\u2019s \u201cmanagerial, financial, and technical ability . . . to operate as a provider of customer owned coin operated telephone . . . service in Connecticut.\u201d In a decision issued on November 8, 2000, the department concluded that \u201cTele Tech [was] suitable to continue providing [customer owned coin operated telephone] service in Connecticut . . . [but that Tele Tech was] liable for fines pursuant to [General Statutes] \u00a7 16-41 (a)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> ... for its unresponsiveness to Department letters, its lack of financial responsibility to its customers, and its ineffective management.\u201d The department also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>stated in its decision that, \u201c[a]t this time, the Department will not revoke [Tele Tech\u2019s] Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity\u201d but admonished that \u201cTele Tech must realize that its failure to properly respond to the Department and its customers in the future will result in [the] revocation of its [certificate of public convenience and necessity].\u201d In accordance with its November 8, 2000 decision, the department ordered Tele Tech to pay a $20,000 fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">Tele Tech requested a hearing before the department to determine the propriety of the department\u2019s assessment of the $20,000 fine pursuant to \u00a7 16-41. After a hearing on this matter, the department issued a decision on June 13, 2001, \u201creaffirm[ing] its November 8, 2000 [decision that the fine [was] appropriate and ... in accordance with ...[\u00a7\u00a7 16-247g] and . . . 16-41.\u201d The department set a payment due date of June 29, 2001, but Tele Tech did not pay the fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">Subsequently, upon learning that Tele Tech had failed to pay the fine, the department initiated another investigation of Tele Tech. In an August 17, 2001 letter to Tele Tech, the department advised Tele Tech that, pursuant to \u00a7 16-247g, it was initiating an investigation into whether it should revoke Tele Tech\u2019s certificate of public convenience and necessity. The department noted in this letter that it designated Tele Tech \u201cas a party to this proceeding.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Although the department informed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>Tele Tech of such matters as the statutory prohibition on ex parte communications in a contested case and Tele Tech\u2019s duties pertaining to the submission of briefs and written exceptions to draft decisions, it did not articulate the factual basis underlying the initiation of the new investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\">In response to the department\u2019s August 17, 2001 letter, Tele Tech requested clarification of the basis for the department\u2019s investigation in a letter dated September 6,2001. The department responded, in a letter dated September 17, 2001, that the latest investigation was initiated because \u201cTele Tech ha[d] failed to pay the $20,000 fine that was ordered in [June, 2001],\u201d and because the department \u201calso [had] received a Notice of Cancellation on July 27, 2001, from Utica Mutual Insurance Company [Utica Mutual] for Tele Tech\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>surety bond.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> According to the department, the notice of cancellation indicated that the surety bond that Utica Mutual had issued would have been cancelled on August 27, 2001, on the basis of Tele Tech\u2019s nonpayment of premiums. The department explained that, on the basis of the foregoing information, \u201cTele Tech\u2019s financial and managerial capability [was] called into question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">The department scheduled a hearing for December 18, 2001. Tele Tech, however, requested and received a continuance due to a scheduling conflict. Subsequently, on January 15, 2002, the hearing proceeded,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and, thereafter, on March 12, 2002, the department issued a draft decision reflecting its initial determination to revoke Tele Tech\u2019s certificate of public convenience and necessity.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Tele Tech took exception to the department\u2019s draft decision and submitted written exceptions in which it claimed, inter alia, that \u201c[t]he [department\u2019s] decision resulted] from a process that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>is constitutionally and statutorily flawed in that Tele Tech\u2019s due process rights were violated by the [department].\u201d On May 1, 2002, the department issued its final decision, in which it expressly rejected Tele Tech\u2019s exceptions and approved the revocation of Tele Tech\u2019s certificate of public convenience and necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\">Tele Tech appealed from the department\u2019s adverse decision to the Superior Court, which sustained the appeal and remanded the case to the department with direction to afford Tele Tech a compliance hearing within thirty days. The department appealed to the Appellate Court from the judgment of the trial court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1. We will set forth additional facts as needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">Our standard of review of administrative agency rulings is well established. E.g., <em>Levinson </em>v. <em>Board of Chiropractic Examiners, </em>211 Conn. 508, 520, 560 A.2d 403 (1989). \u201cJudicial review of an administrative decision is a creature of statute\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>PARCC, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>235 Conn. 128, 138, 663 A.2d 992 (1995); and \u201c[General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (j)] permits modification or reversal of an agency\u2019s decision if substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions are: (1) [i]n violation of constitutional or statutory provisions; (2) in excess of the statutory authority of the agency; (3) made upon unlawful procedure; (4) affected by other error or law; (5) clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record; or (6) arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Levinson </em>v. <em>Board of Chiropractic Examiners, </em>supra, 520-21; accord General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (j). We have stated that \u201cnot all procedural irregularities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>require a reviewing court to set aside an administrative decision . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Jutkowitz </em>v. <em>Dept. of Health Services, </em>220 Conn. 86, 97, 596 A.2d 374 (1991). The complaining party has the burden of demonstrating that its substantial rights were prejudiced by the error. See id.; <em>Levinson </em>v. <em>Board of Chiropractic Examiners, </em>supra, 536.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">In addition, although we have noted that \u201c[a]n agency\u2019s factual and discretionary determinations are to be accorded considerable weight by the courts\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Secretary of the Office of Policy &amp; Management </em>v. <em>Employees\u2019 Review Board, </em>267 Conn. 255, 262,837 A.2d 770 (2004); we have maintained that \u201c[c]ases that present pure questions of law . . . invoke a broader standard of review than is ordinarily involved in deciding whether, in light of the evidence, the agency has acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally or in abuse of its discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Thus, \u201c[w]e have determined . . . that the traditional deference accorded to an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statutory term is unwarranted when the construction of a statute . . . has not previously been subjected to judicial scrutiny [or to] ... a governmental agency\u2019s time-tested inteipretation . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">We first address Tele Tech\u2019s claim that the department lacked jurisdiction to revoke Tele Tech\u2019s certificate of public convenience and necessity because the department allegedly had failed to comport with the provisions of \u00a7 4-182 (c) in not giving Tele Tech notice and an opportunity to show compliance. Tele Tech contends that \u201c[t]he [department\u2019s] failure to minimally comply with the requirements of ... \u00a7 4-182 (c) deprived it of jurisdiction to revoke [Tele Tech\u2019s certificate of public convenience and necessity].\u201d According <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>to Tele Tech, \u201c[t]he statutoiy requirements of \u00a7 4-182 (c) are a necessary precondition to formal licensure revocation proceedings.\u201d Tele Tech thus implicitly equates a revocation that is not in compliance with \u00a7 4-182 (c) with a revocation that has occurred without jurisdiction. We ar e not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\">We agree with Tele Tech that administrative agencies possess limited jurisdiction. E.g., <em>Southern New England Telephone Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>261 Conn. 1, 21, 803 A.2d 879 (2002). As we have stated, \u201c[t]he principles of subject matter jurisdiction are well established. Jurisdiction of the subject-matter is the power [of the court] to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in question belong. ... A court has subject matter jurisdiction if it has the authority to adjudicate a particular type of legal controversy. ... It is a familiar principle that a court which exercises a limited and statutory jurisdiction is without jurisdiction to act unless it does so under the precise circumstances and in the manner particularly prescribed by the enabling legislation. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">\u201cThis concept, however, is not limited to courts. Administrative agencies [such as the department] are tribunals of limited jurisdiction and their jurisdiction is dependent entirely upon the validity of the statutes vesting them with power and they cannot confer jurisdiction upon themselves. . . . We have recognized that [i]t is clear that an administrative body must act strictly within its statutory authority, within constitutional limitations and in a lawful manner. ... It cannot modify, abridge or otherwise change the statutoiy provisions . . . under which it acquires authority unless the statutes expressly grant it that power.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 21-22; accord <em>Figueroa </em>v. <em>C &amp; S Ball Bearing, </em>237 Conn. 1, 4, 675 A.2d 845 (1996); see also <em>Nizzardo </em>v. <em>State Traffic Commission, </em>259 Conn. 131, 156, 788 A.2d 1158 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>In addition, we often have recognized a distinction between \u201csubject matter jurisdiction\u201d and the proper exercise of \u201cauthority to act under a particular statute.\u201d <em>Southern New England Telephone Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>supra, 261 Conn. 3 n.2; \u201cAlthough related, the court\u2019s authority to act pursuant to a statute is different from its subject matter jurisdiction. The power of the court to hear and determine, which is implicit in jurisdiction, is not to be confused with the way in which that power must be exercised in order to comply with the terms of the statute. \u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.; cf. <em>Cantoni </em>v. <em>Xerox Corp., </em>251 Conn. 153, 162, 740 A.2d 796 (1999). Whereas \u201c[s]ubject matter jurisdiction involves the authority of a court to adjudicate the type of controversy presented by the action before it\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Southern New England Telephone Co. </em>v. <em>Dept, of Public Utility Control, </em>supra, 3 n.2; the authority to act refers to \u201cthe way in which that power [to hear and to determine the controversy] must be exercised in order to comply with the terms of the statute.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.; accord <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Mars, </em>138 Conn. 593, 601, 87 A.2d 388 (1952). We have maintained that \u201c[a] court does not truly lack subject matter jurisdiction if it has competence to entertain the action before it\u201d; <em>Southern New England Telephone Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>supra, 3 n.2; and, \u201c[o]nce it is determined that a tribunal has authority or competence to decide the class of cases to which the action belongs, the issue of subject matter jurisdiction is resolved in favor of entertaining the action.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Connor </em>v. <em>Statewide Grievance Committee, </em>260 Conn. 435, 443, 797 A.2d 1081 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">Jurisdiction thus is the \u201cpower ... to hear and determine cases\u201d; <em>Southern New England Telephone Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>supra, 261 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>21; and, in the present case, \u00a7 16-247g (g)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> provides the department with the power to revoke a certif\u00edcate of public convenience and necessity. General Statutes \u00a7 16-247g (g) provides in relevant part that the department, under certain circumstances, \u201cmay suspend or revoke the authorization to provide said telecommunications service or take any other action it deems appropriate. . . .\u201d Section 4-182 (c) of the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (UAPA), on the other hand, does not vest the department with authority to revoke a certificate of public convenience and necessity but, instead, declares that \u201c[n]o revocation ... of any license is <em>lawful </em>unless\u201d the agency follows certain procedures. (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 4-182 (c). Thus, the mere fact that the procedures employed by the department in revoking a license do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>not satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 4-182 (c) does not mean that the department lacks jurisdiction to revoke the license, as the department\u2019s power to revoke emanates from \u00a7 16-247g (g). Therefore, it cannot be said that the department acted without jurisdiction merely because it failed to comply with \u00a7 4-182 (c); instead, any failure to comply with \u00a7 4-182 (c) suggests that the department, in exercising its proper jurisdiction, failed to abide by the dictates of the law. See, e.g., <em>Terry\u2019s Appeal from Probate, </em>67 Conn. 181, 185, 34 A. 1032 (1896) (\u201cin exercising its jurisdiction [the court] must obey the law, or its determination will be at least erroneous\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">Moreover, the cases on which Tele Tech relies do not strengthen its claim that an agency\u2019s failure to comply with \u00a7 4-182 (c) deprives the agency of jurisdiction. Rather, those cases support our conclusion that the failure of an agency to comply with the provisions of \u00a7 4-182 (c) renders the agency\u2019s action unlawful. See <em>Blackwell College of Business </em>v. <em>Attorney General, </em>454 F.2d 928,933-35 (D.C. Cir. 1971); <em>Valley View Convalescent Home </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social &amp; Health Services, </em>24 Wash. App. 192, 199-200, 599 P.2d 1313 (1979), review denied, 93 Wash. 2d 1004 (1980). In the two cases on which Tele Tech relies, each court determined that the agency had failed to comply with the provision of the applicable administrative procedure act requiring notice and an opportunity to show compliance prior to the institution of agency proceedings, and, therefore, that the agency had acted unlawfully. See <em>Blackwell College of Business </em>v. <em>Attorney General, </em>supra, 933, 935 (noting that 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 558 [c]<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> of federal Administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>Procedure Act provides that \u201c \u2018revocation ... of a license is lawful only if \u201d agency follows outlined procedures, and concluding that agency\u2019s action fell \u201cshort of meeting the requirements of due process of law\u201d); <em>Valley View Convalescent Home </em>v. <em>Dept, of Social &amp; Health Services, </em>supra, 200 (\u201c[b]y not granting the licensee a reasonable amount of time to comply [in accordance with the applicable provision of the state administrative procedure act], the procedure the [agency] invoked was . . . unlawful . . . and the proceeding must be dismissed\u201d). In neither case did the court hold that a violation of the applicable administrative procedure act deprived the agency of jurisdiction to revoke the license. Accordingly, Tele Tech\u2019s contention that the department\u2019s noncompliance with the provisions of \u00a7 4-182 (c) deprived the department of jurisdiction is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">Having resolved Tele Tech\u2019s jurisdictional claim, we now turn to the merits of the claims of the department and the defendant office of consumer counsel<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> in this appeal. The department and the office of consumer counsel claim that the trial court improperly concluded that the department had failed to comply with \u00a7 4-182 (c) by not providing Tele Tech, prior to the institution of agency proceedings, with adequate notice and an opportunity to show compliance with the applicable legal requirements for the retention of its certificate of public convenience and necessity.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>In its memorandum of decision, the trial court found that \u201c[Tele Tech] should have been afforded an opportunity to demonstrate compliance with all lawful requirements as a condition precedent to a license revocation hearing under ... \u00a7 4-182 (c).\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Accordingly, the trial court sustained Tele Tech\u2019s appeal and remanded the matter to the department with direction to \u201cafford [Tele Tech] a compliance hearing within thirty days . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">Thereafter, the department moved for an articulation of the trial court\u2019s decision. The trial court responded to the motion by articulating that, \u201c[o]ut of an excess of caution and because [\u00a7] 4-182 (c) affords the licensee the opportunity to comply as a condition precedent to revocation, this court ordered the [department] to provide [Tele Tech with] an opportunity to show compliance as it relates to this action. The [department] has never claimed an emergency so an additional thirty days was not prejudicial to actions involving [Tele Tech] that ha[ve] lingered so long.\u201d As a result, the trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>order that the department conduct a compliance hearing remained in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\">The procedures that an administrative agency must follow for the lawful revocation of a license<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> pursuant to UAPA are set forth in subsection (c) of \u00a7 4-182. General Statutes \u00a7 4-182 (c) provides in relevant part: \u201cNo revocation ... of any license is lawful unless, prior to the institution of agency proceedings, the agency gave notice by mail to the licensee of facts or conduct which warrant the intended action, and the licensee was given an opportunity to show compliance with all lawful requirements for the retention of the license. \u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b814-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>The department claims that the plain meaning of the term \u201cproceedings,\u201d as used in \u00a7 4-182 (c), does not encompass the initiation of the investigation against Tele Tech in August, 2001; rather, \u201cby implication, the term \u2018proceeding\u2019 means the agency hearing\u201d that occurred on January 15, 2002. Alternatively, the office of consumer counsel contends that \u201cthe use of the word \u2018proceeding\u2019 in [\u00a7 4-182 (c)] most logically refers to the final decision,\u201d that is, the department\u2019s final decision to revoke Tele Tech\u2019s certificate of public convenience and necessity, which was rendered on May 1, 2002. Under either construction, therefore, the department and the office of consumer counsel claim that the department provided Tele Tech with adequate notice and an opportunity to show compliance with the statutory requirements when it issued the September 17, 2001 letter to Tele Tech prior to the institution of the \u201cproceedings\u201d against it. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">In order to resolve the claims of the department and the office of consumer counsel, we must construe the meaning of the phrase, \u201cinstitution of agency proceedings\u201d as used in \u00a7 4-182 (c). More specifically, we must determine whether the term \u201cproceedings\u201d means the agency \u201chearing\u201d or \u201cfinal decision,\u201d as the department and the office of consumer counsel respectively contend, or whether it has a broader meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">When construing a statute, we first look to its text, as directed by Public Acts 2003, No. 03-154, \u00a7 1 (P.A. 03-154). Public Act 03-154, \u00a7 1, provides: \u201cThe meaning of a statute shall, in the first instance, be ascertained from the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\">UAPA does not expressly define the term \u201cproceedings.\u201d As we often have observed, however, \u201c[w]hen construing a statute, we may look for guidance to other statutes relating to the same general subject matter, as the legislature is presumed to have created a consistent body of law.\u201d <em>Cagiva North America, Inc. v. Schenk, </em>239 Conn. 1, 12, 680 A.2d 964 (1996); see also P.A. 03-154, \u00a7 1 (\u201c[t]he meaning of a statute shall, in the first instance, be ascertained from the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes\u201d); <em>Petco Insulation Co. v. Crystal, </em>231 Conn. 315, 323-24, 649 A.2d 790 (1994) (\u201c[i]t is settled that statutes must be construed consistently with other relevant statutes because the legislature is presumed to have created a coherent body of law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">With this principle in mind, we conclude that the statutory scheme strongly suggests that the term \u201cproceedings,\u201d and the terms \u201chearing\u201d and \u201cfinal decision,\u201d as used in other related statutory provisions in UAPA, namely, General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-176e<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and 4-179 (a),<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>denote different events. We begin with an examination of \u00a7 4-176e, which governs agency hearings. General Statutes \u00a7 4-176e provides that \u201ca <em>hearing </em>in an agency <em>proceeding </em>may be held before\u201d certain hearing officers or members of the agency. (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 4-179 (a) similarly reflects a distinction between \u201cproceeding\u201d and \u201cfinal decision,\u201d as it provides that, \u201c[w]hen, in an <em>agency proceeding, </em>a majority of the members of the agency who are to render the <em>final decision </em>have not heard the matter or read the record, the decision, if adverse to a party, shall not be rendered until a proposed final decision is served upon the parties . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) It is evident from the use of these terms in \u00a7 \u00a7 4-176e and 4-179 (a), respectively, that the legislature has recognized a distinction between a \u201cproceeding,\u201d on the one hand, and a \u201chearing\u201d or a \u201cfinal decision,\u201d on the other hand. If the legislature had intended the term \u201cproceedings\u201d in \u00a7 4-182 (c) to mean a \u201chearing\u201d or a \u201cfinal decision,\u201d it would not have distinguished between those terms in the foregoing statutory provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">Furthermore, when a statute does not define a term, such as the term \u201cproceedings\u201d in \u00a7 4-182 (c), \u201c[w]e . . . look to the common understanding of the term as expressed in the dictionary.\u201d <em>Bock &amp; Clark Corp. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Consumer Protection, </em>265 Conn. 400, 411, 828 A.2d 601 (2003); see also General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a) (\u201c[i]n the construction of the statutes, words and phrases shall be construed according to the commonly approved usage of the language\u201d); <em>Secretary of the Office of Policy &amp; Management </em>v. <em>Employees\u2019 Review Board, </em>supra, 267 Conn. 265 (\u201c[i]n the absence of a statutory definition, words and phrases in a statute are to be construed according to their common usage\u201d). Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary defines a \u201cproceeding\u201d as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>\u201ca particular action at law or case in litigation . . . .\u201d A \u201chearing,\u201d on the other hand, encompasses something narrower and more specific, namely, \u201ca session . . . in which witnesses are heard and testimony is taken\u201d or an \u201copportunity to be heard or to present one\u2019s side of a case\u201d; Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary; as does a \u201cfinal decision,\u201d which General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 (3) (A) defines as \u201cthe agency determination in a contested case . . . .\u201d Although the department maintains that \u201cagency proceedings,\u201d as used in \u00a7 4-182 (c), means \u201cagency hearings,\u201d and the office of consumer counsel claims that the term means the \u201cagency\u2019s final decision,\u201d the definitions of these terms suggest that they are not analogous and that a proceeding encompasses a broader category of events than that encompassed by a hearing or a final decision. We therefore reject any claim that, for purposes of \u00a7 4-182 (c), the department initiated proceedings at the time of the department\u2019s January 15, 2002 hearing or when the department rendered its final decision on May 1, 2002. We conclude that the department instituted the proceedings against Tele Tech when it issued the August 17, 2001 letter to Tele Tech informing it of its initiation of the new investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\">The department nonetheless claims that a literal reading of \u00a7 4-182 (c) would lead to absurd results. The department argues that, if the initiation of the \u201cproceeding\u201d occurs \u201cthe moment the agency opens a file or docket with an eye [toward] the possible revocation of a license, then a license could never be revoked or suspended . . . [because] the agency always has initiated a proceeding without first informing the licensee of the specific facts supporting such an action.\u201d Thus, the department argues that it would be impossible to issue a warning letter to a licensee without already having initiated proceedings against the licensee. We do not understand why a warning letter with notice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>the problems that might lead to the revocation of Tele Tech\u2019s certificate of public convenience and necessity and an opportunity to show compliance or to cure those problems that have resulted in noncompliance could not be sent prior to the commencement of formal revocation proceedings. We therefore reject the department\u2019s claim that a plain reading of \u00a7 4-182 (c) would yield absurd results.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Having determined that the department instituted agency proceedings against Tele Tech on August 17, 2001, we next address whether the trial court properly concluded that the department did not provide, prior to the institution of these proceedings, \u201cnotice ... of [the] facts or conduct\u201d deemed to be improper and \u201can opportunity to show compliance with all lawful requirements for the retention of the license.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 4-182 (c). We conclude that the trial court properly determined that the department did not satisfy either of these requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">The department\u2019s August 17, 2001 letter did not satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 4-182 (c) because the letter commenced the revocation proceedings and, thus, could not have provided Tele Tech with notice and an opportunity to show compliance \u201cprior to the institution of . . . [the proceeding] . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 4-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>182 (c). The August 17, 2001 letter<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> merely advised Tele Tech that the department had initiated an investigation into whether it should revoke Tele Tech\u2019s certificate of public convenience and necessity, informed Tele Tech of certain departmental procedural practices and indicated that it had designated Tele Tech as a party to the proceeding without reference to the basis underlying the initiation of the proceeding.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\">The office of consumer counsel nevertheless contends that \u201cit is clear that the grounds [for the initiation of the new investigation in August, 2001] were self-evident,\u201d and that that investigation \u201cwas in fact simply the next logical phase of a continuing investigation, one replete with repeated references to the underlying problems created by Tele Tech\u2019s service and regulatory failures.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">The grounds for revocation of a license must be more than <em>self-evident. </em>Section \u00a7 4-182 (c) requires an agency to give a licensee, prior to the institution of agency proceedings, written notice of conduct warranting the revocation of its license and an opportunity to show compliance with all of the legal requirements for the retention of the license. The department failed to satisfy these requirements under the facts of the present case. Indeed, the record reveals that, because Tele Tech did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>not understand the factual basis for the department\u2019s initiation of the investigation against Tele Tech on August 17,2001, it requested clarification in its September 6, 2001 letter to the department. Furthermore, this is not a situation in which numerous letters from the department, warning the licensee of deficiencies in its conduct, would satisfy the provisions of \u00a7 4-182 (c). Under \u00a7 4-182 (c), the licensee also must be afforded an opportunity to show compliance with the legal requirements for the retention of its license.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">Even though the department previously had warned Tele Tech, in its November 8, 2000 decision, that its noncompliance with that decision would result in the future revocation of its certificate of public convenience and necessity and that Tele Tech was required to maintain a surety bond in order to retain the certificate, the department was obliged to follow the procedures set forth in \u00a7 4-182 (c) in its subsequent revocation proceeding. The department can neither evade nor discharge its duty of providing Tele Tech with proper notice and an opportunity to show compliance by claiming that it notified Tele Tech of its \u201cintended action\u201d during a previous proceeding that already had been concluded. We note further that, to accept the department\u2019s warning in an earlier proceeding as sufficient notice in a subsequent proceeding would set a dangerous precedent because it would encourage other agencies to claim proper notice of any issue discussed in a prior decision that had been released months or even years in advance of the subsequent, and entirely separate, proceeding. Section 4-182 (c) neither provides for, nor contemplates, such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">We believe that the \u201copportunity to show compliance\u201d provision represents a \u201csecond chance\u201d doctrine, which allows a licensee the opportunity to \u201cput its house in lawful order before more formal agency proceedings are undertaken.\u201d <em>Gallagher &amp; Ascher Co. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number><em>Simon, </em>687 F.2d 1067,1074 (7th Cir. 1982), citing <em>Blackwell College of Business </em>v. <em>Attorney General, </em>supra, 454 F.2d 933-34; see also <em>George Steinberg &amp; Son, Inc. </em>v. <em>Butz, </em>491 F.2d 988, 993-94 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 830, 95 S. Ct. 53, 42 L. Ed. 2d 55 (1974). Carlos de la Torres, who testified on behalf of Tele Tech during the January 15, 2002 hearing, stated that, if Tele Tech had known that a payment plan could have been implemented for the $20,000 fine, Tele Tech would have agreed to such a plan. The substance of de la Torres\u2019 testimony reveals that the \u201csecond chance\u201d doctrine was intended to cover precisely this type of situation.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Yet, the department\u2019s August 17, 2001 letter to Tele Tech set the revocation proceedings in motion, thereby precluding Tele Tech from attaining its statutorily granted \u201csecond chance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">The department also claims that it complied with the requirements of \u00a7 4-182 (c) by providing Tele Tech with a hearing on January 15, 2002, because prior constructions of \u00a7 4-182 (c) have \u201csuggested that the meaning of this provision was for the agency to provide a hearing before the revocation of a license\u201d in order to satisfy the statute\u2019s requirements, rather than to provide a second chance prior to the institution of revocation proceedings. To the extent that our prior cases have suggested such a construction, we disavow such suggestions.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">We have not had many occasions to construe \u00a7 4-182 (c) since its passage in 1971; see Public Acts 1971, No. 854, \u00a7 17; and we, therefore, take this opportunity to clarify the statute\u2019s scope and requirements with respect to hearings. We acknowledge that language in our earlier cases would suggest that \u00a7 4-182 (c) requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>a hearing or an opportunity for a hearing prior to license revocation. E.g., <em>PARCC, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health </em>Care, supra, 235 Conn. 142 (\u201c[t]he defendant [commission] . . . was required by . . . UAPA to afford the plaintiff notice and <em>an opportunity for a hearing </em>before such license was revoked\u201d [emphasis added]); <em>Easter House, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Children &amp; Youth Services, </em>214 Conn. 560, 566, 573 A.2d 304 (1990) (\u201c[i]f the plaintiff has a license to conduct the activities that the [defendant department] letter prohibited it from engaging in ... \u00a7 4-182 [c] entitled the plaintiff to notice and an <em>opportunity for a hearing </em>prior to such a license revocation\u201d [emphasis added]); <em>Levinson </em>v. <em>Board of Chiropractic Examiners, </em>supra, 211 Conn. 534 (\u00a7 4-182 [c] \u201crequires notice and <em>hearing for the revocation </em>... of any license\u201d [emphasis added]); <em>Hickey </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>170 Conn. 136, 145 n.2, 365 A.2d 403 (1976) (\u201c[s]o that \u00a7 4-182 [c] shall be consistent with [the] provisions of the state and federal constitutions and the explication of those provisions by this court and the United States Supreme Court, the \u2018opportunity to show compliance\u2019 must be afforded <em>in the form of a hearing, </em>complying with other provisions of . . . UAPA as may be relevant\u201d [emphasis added]); <em>Hart Twin Volvo Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>165 Conn. 42, 47 n.2, 327 A.2d 588 (1973) (\u00a7 4-182 [c] \u201crequires notice <em>and hearing </em>for the revocation ... of any license\u201d [emphasis added]). In <em>Dadiskos </em>v. <em>Connecticut Real Estate Commission, </em>37 Conn. App. 777, 782-83, 657 A.2d 717 (1995), however, the Appellate Court determined that \u00a7 4-182 (c) did not require such a hearing. In order to resolve this inconsistency and the department\u2019s claim, we will review the text of \u00a7 4-182 (c), the relevant federal precedent relating to the analogous provision of the federal Administrative Procedure Act, namely, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 558 (c),<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>manner in which our prior cases have dealt with \u00a7 4-182 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\">Looking first to the text of \u00a7 4-182 (c), we note that the statute contains no explicit reference to a hearing requirement, but mandates only that the agency provide \u201cnotice by mail to the licensee of facts or conduct which warrant the intended action, and ... an opportunity to show compliance with all lawful requirements for the retention of the license.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 4-182 (c). The lack of a hearing requirement is not unusual in a procedural statute such as \u00a7 4-182 because requirements for hearings for license revocations generally are contained in the substantive statutes dealing with licenses. See General Statutes \u00a7 16-247g (g) (authorization to provide telecommunications service may be suspended or revoked after notice to all interested parties and hearing); see also, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 12-574 (m) (license issued by state gaming policy board may be suspended or revoked after \u201ca reasonable opportunity for a hearing\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 14-100a (d) (commissioner of motor vehicles may suspend license to operate motor vehicle \u201cafter notice and an opportunity for a hearing\u201d if licensee who violates provisions of \u00a7 14-100a fails to complete child car seat safety course); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 19a-80 (b) (commissioner of public health may suspend or revoke license required to operate child day care center \u201cafter notice and an opportunity for a hearing\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">Furthermore, even if a statutory scheme does not require a hearing prior to the revocation of a license, federal and state concepts of due process may require such a hearing, depending upon the nature and extent of the licensee\u2019s interest in the license. See, e.g., <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Burson, </em>402 U.S. 535, 539, 91 S. Ct. 1586, 29 L. Ed. 2d 90 (1971) (\u201cOnce licenses are issued . . . their continued possession may become essential in the pursuit of a livelihood. Suspension of issued licenses thus involves state action that adjudicates important interests of the licensees. In such cases the licenses are not to be taken away without . . . procedural due process required by the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Finally, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>there may be instances in which a licensee\u2019s interest may be so de minimus that no revocation hearing is required. See, e.g., <em>Gallagher &amp; Ascher Co. </em>v. <em>Simon, </em>supra, 687 F.2d 1077-79 (customs brokers not deprived of right to procedural due process when Customs Service temporarily suspended their permits without hearing because brokers\u2019 protectible property interests were not so significant as to require full adjudicatory hearing). Consequently, we do not interpret \u00a7 4-182 (c) as requiring a hearing or an opportunity for a hearing prior to the revocation of a license or as a component of the requisite \u201copportunity to show compliance\u201d provision contained therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\">Our determination that \u00a7 4-182 (c) does not require a hearing is supported by the weight of federal authority relating to the analogous provision of the federal Administrative Procedure Act, namely, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 558 (c), which likewise has been interpreted as not requiring an adjudicatory hearing. See, e.g., <em>West Chicago </em>v. <em>United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, </em>701 F.2d 632, 644 (7th Cir. 1983) (\u201c[w]e now agree with the First, Fifth and Ninth [Circuit Courts of Appeals] that [5 U.S.C. \u00a7] 558 [c] does not independently provide that formal adjudicatory hearings must be held\u201d); <em>Gallagher &amp; Ascher Co. </em>v. <em>Simon, </em>supra, 687 F.2d 1074 (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 558 [c] \u201cdoes not itself create a right to a full adjudicatory hearing before a license may be suspended or revoked, but simply imposes separate procedural requirements in addition to those procedures that may otherwise be required under . . . the [federal Administrative Procedure Act]\u201d); <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>District Engineer, United States Army Corps of Engineers, </em>567 F.2d 1332, 1337 (5th Cir. 1978) (\u201cwe do not read [5 U.S.C.] \u00a7 558 as requiring a [5 U.S.C.] \u00a7 556 hearing\u201d); <em>Marathon Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Environmental Protection Agency, </em>564 F.2d 1253, 1260-61 n.25 (9th Cir. 1977) (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 558 [c] \u201cdoes not independently provide that full adjudicatory hearings must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>held\u201d). But cf. <em>Air North America </em>v. <em>Dept. of Transportation, </em>937 F.2d 1427, 1437 n.9 (9th Cir. 1991) (noting existence of \u201csplit among the [federal circuit courts] as to whether [\u00a7] 558 [c]\u2019s requirements of notice and opportunity to correct create an obligation that the agency conduct a full adjudicatory hearing\u201d); <em>New York Pathological &amp; X-Ray Laboratories, Inc. </em>v. <em>Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service, </em>523 F.2d 79, 82 (2d Cir. 1975) (stating that \u201cthe designation of approved facilities constituted a license required by law, within the reach of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 558 [c] . . . which requires an agency to conduct proceedings in accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 556 and 557,\u201d which, in turn, require notice and opportunity to be heard).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">In light of our conclusion that the text of \u00a7 4-182 (c) does not contain a hearing requirement, and our conclusion that this determination is consistent with procedural due process considerations pertaining to license revocations and the weight of federal authority, we next examine our previous decisions to resolve any inconsistencies with these conclusions. We conclude that, to the extent that such inconsistencies exist, they are limited to dicta<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> or are based on an incorrect interpretation of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">We begin with the cases in which this court has construed \u00a7 4-182 (c) to include a hearing requirement in dicta. In <em>Hart Twin Volvo Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number><em>Motor Vehicles, </em>supra, 165 Conn. 42, the commissioner of motor vehicles (commissioner) temporarily suspended the license of the plaintiff, Hart Twin Volvo Corporation (Hart Twin), to operate a car dealership after giving Hart Twin notice that it had violated a state statute pertaining to the operation of car dealerships. Id., 42 -43. On appeal, Hart Twin claimed that the commissioner had not provided it with sufficient notice of the charges prior to the suspension hearing and that the commissioner improperly had suspended its license on the basis of charges not contained in the notice. See id., 44. In concluding that Hart Twin had the right to fair notice and a hearing before the suspension of its license, we stated in a footnote that the requirements of due process vary depending on the nature of the case under consideration and that \u00a7 4-182 (c) distinguishes between the notice requirements for proceedings involving the issuance of licenses and proceedings involving the revocation of licenses. Id., 47 n.2. We noted that, although notice and a hearing are required in either circumstance, the notice requirements for proceedings involving revocation are stricter than those for proceedings involving the issuance of licenses.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>id. In <em>Levinson </em>v. <em>Board of Chiropractic Examiners, </em>supra, 211 Conn. 508, in which the plaintiff chiropractors, whose licenses had been suspended due to allegedly improper conduct, had raised similar claims regarding inadequate notice prior to their suspension hearings', we employed the language that we used in <em>Hart Twin Volvo Corp. </em>to explain the distinction between the notice requirements for the issuance and revocation of licenses. Id., 533-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">The relevant issues in <em>Hart Twin Volvo Corp. </em>and <em>Levinson </em>involved requirements of notice rather than hearings. In those cases, we sought to emphasize the difference between the notice requirements pertaining to the issuance of a license, which mandate only \u201ca short and plain statement of the matters asserted\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 4-177 (b) (4); and the notice requirements relating to the revocation of a license, which mandate \u201cnotice ... of facts or conduct\u201d warranting revocation of the license. General Statutes \u00a7 4-182 (c). Our references in <em>Hart Twin Volvo Corp. </em>and in <em>Levinson </em>to a hearing requirement in \u00a7 4-182 (c) thus were not essential to our recitation of that principle and may be regarded as dicta and, thus, not binding. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Hafford, </em>252 Conn. 274, 314 n.21, 746 A.2d 150 (\u201c[t]he language . . . was dict[um] and is not binding on us now\u201d), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 855, 121 S. Ct. 136, 148 L. Ed. 2d 89 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">Similarly, in <em>Easter House, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Children &amp; Youth Services, </em>supra, 214 Conn. 560, we stated that \u201c[i]f the plaintiff [Easter House, Inc.] has a license to conduct the activities that the letter [of the department of children and youth services] prohibited it from engaging in ... \u00a7 4-182 (c) entitled [Easter House, Inc.] to notice and an opportunity for a hearing prior to such a license revocation.\u201d Id., 566. In <em>Easter House, Inc., </em>however, we determined that Easter House, Inc., never possessed a license within the meaning of General Stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>utes \u00a7 4-166 (6), and, therefore, that the provisions of \u00a7 4-182 (c) were not applicable. Id., 572. Accordingly, our reference in <em>Easter House, Inc. </em>to a hearing requirement in \u00a7 4-182 (c) also constitutes dictum and, therefore, cannot be considered binding. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Hafford, </em>supra, 252 Conn. 314 n.21.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\">In two other cases, however, namely, <em>Hickey </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>supra, 170 Conn. 145 n.2, and <em>PARCC, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 142, we directly construed the language of \u00a7 4-182 (c) as containing a hearing requirement. <em>In Hickey, </em>we concluded that the defendant commissioner of motor vehicles improperly had suspended the driver\u2019s license of the plaintiff, Robert B. Hickey, without a hearing for a motor vehicle violation that had occurred in another state. See <em>Hickey </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>supra, 137, 144. We concluded that the suspension of Hickey\u2019s license without a hearing was in violation of Hickey\u2019s right to procedural due process and that, \u201c[i]n Connecticut, these considerations of due process are set out in [UAPA] . . . which provides for uniform standards by which all non-exempted agency action is to be judged.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 144-45. In a footnote, we also observed: \u201cSo that \u00a7 4-182 (c) shall be consistent with [the] provisions of the state and federal constitutions and the explication of those provisions by this court and the United States Supreme Court, the \u2018opportunity to show compliance\u2019 <em>must be afforded in the form of a hearing, </em>complying with other provisions of . . . UAPA as may be relevant.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 145 n.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">In <em>PARCC, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 142, we similarly interpreted \u00a7 4-182 (c) to require a hearing. The plaintiff, PARCC, Inc., a licensed nursing facility, appealed from the judgment of the trial court dismissing its appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>from the decision of the defendant, the commission on hospitals and health care (commission), to deny its request for reauthorization to expand its nursing facility. Id., 129-35. We concluded that the commission\u2019s decision constituted the revocation of a license for purposes of UAPA because PARCC, Inc., was required to obtain and previously had obtained the commission\u2019s permission to proceed with the expansion. See id., 142. We concluded that \u201c[t]he [commission], therefore, was required by . . . UAPA [specifically, \u00a7 4-182 (c)] to afford [PARCC, Inc.] notice and an opportunity for a hearing before such license was revoked.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">To the extent that the language in <em>Hickey </em>and <em>PARCC, Inc. </em>stands for the proposition that a hearing is required as part of the \u201copportunity to show compliance\u201d provision of \u00a7 4-182 (c) or as a component of \u00a7 4-182 (c) generally, we reject that interpretation because it runs counter to the plain language of the statute. We will not import such meaning to a statute when the text of the statute is clear and unambiguous. We therefore conclude that, although \u00a7 4-182 (c) does not mandate a hearing, it does require the agency to give the licensee notice of the claimed conduct or conditions deemed by the agency to warrant potential revocation of the license as well as an opportunity to show compliance with all the legal requirements for retention of the license. If the licensee cannot show compliance and the licensing statute itself or requirements of due process mandate a hearing, the agency must give the licensee notice of a formal revocation proceeding pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-177 (a), which provides that, \u201c[i]n a contested case, all parties shall be afforded an opportunity for hearing after reasonable notice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">The department and the office of consumer counsel finally claim that Tele Tech did not demonstrate that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>its substantial rights were prejudiced, as required by \u00a7 4-183 Q), as a result of any procedural inadequacy stemming from the August 17, 2001 letter because the September 17, 2001 letter that the department sent to Tele Tech constituted adequate notice to Tele Tech of the facts giving rise to the proceedings and, further, the department afforded Tele Tech an opportunity to demonstrate compliance at the hearing conducted four months later, on January 15, 2002. We agree that Tele Tech has failed to sustain its burden of demonstrating that its substantial rights were prejudiced by the department\u2019s violation of \u00a7 4-182 (c).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\">As we previously have noted in this opinion, the complaining party bears the burden of demonstrating that its substantial rights were prejudiced by the administrative agency\u2019s error. See General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (j); <em>Jutkowitz </em>v. <em>Dept. of Health Services, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 97; <em>Levinson </em>v. <em>Board of Chiropractic Examiners, </em>supra, 211 Conn. 536. When a procedural error has occurred, but a licensee has had an opportunity to offer evidence at a hearing militating against an agency\u2019s adverse action, and has had an opportunity to show compliance \u201cwell in advance\u201d of an agency\u2019s final determination, no such prejudice results. <em>Holt Hauling &amp; Warehousing System, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States Customs Service, </em>650 F. Sup. 1013, 1018-19 (Ct. Inti. Trade 1986) (no prejudice to licensee on basis of agency\u2019s violation of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 558 [c] when licensee \u201csubmitted a response to the . . . charges . . . [and] had the opportunity to bring forth evidence at the hearing to militate against a recom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>mendation of suspension . . . [because the licensee] was afforded the opportunity to demonstrate compliance and present any mitigating evidence well in advance of the final decision\u201d resulting in suspension).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">In the present case, Tele Tech had ample opportunity at the January 15, 2002 administrative hearing to offer evidence that would demonstrate compliance or its initiative to bring itself into compliance with all the legal requirements for the retention of its certificate of public convenience and necessity, and this opportunity occurred well in advance of the department\u2019s final decision, which was rendered on May 1, 2002. Instead of conveying an eagerness to comply, however, de la Torres, who testified on behalf of Tele Tech, candidly admitted that Tele Tech\u2019s own negligence had caused the delay in requesting reinstatement of the surety bond that Utica Mutual had cancelled on the basis of Tele Tech\u2019s nonpayment of premiums. Moreover, although de la Torres represented that Tele Tech would have paid the $20,000 f\u00edne if it had known that it could pay in installments, de la Torres did not indicate that Tele Tech was willing at that time to enter into a payment plan to ensure satisfaction of the fine. Instead, de la Torres conveyed a rather bleak forecast for Tele Tech, declaring in relevant part: \u201cIt\u2019s difficult for [Tele Tech] to stay in business. We [are] planning to go out of business . . . and we [are] . . . trying to get out of state.\u201d Furthermore, in response to a question by the hearing examiner as to whether it was his \u201ctestimony [that Tele Tech] simply [did not] have the money to pay the $20,000 [fine],\u201d de la Torres testified in the affirmative. In sum, Tele Tech submitted no evidence that would militate against the department\u2019s revocation of Tele Tech\u2019s certificate of public convenience and necessity. Furthermore, Tele Tech failed to take advantage of the lengthy time period before the agency\u2019s final decision in May, 2002, to demonstrate compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>Thus, although we conclude that the department violated the procedures set forth in \u00a7 4-182 (c) by failing to provide Tele Tech with a \u201csecond chance\u201d to show compliance prior to the institution of agency proceedings on August 17, 2001, Tele Tech has not shown that this error prejudiced its substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment dismissing Tele Tech\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b799-9\"> Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 16-2a (a), the office of consumer counsel appeared as a codefendant in the administrative appeal of the plaintiff, Tele Tech of Connecticut Corporation (Tele Tech), on behalf of residential and business consumers of telecommunications services in Connecticut.

The department\u2019s claim is without merit, however, as the record reveals that Tele Tech raised these challenges in its March 19, 2002 statement of exceptions to the department\u2019s March 12,2002 draft decision. In its statement of exceptions, Tele Tech challenged the department\u2019s draft decision, claiming that it \u201cresult[ed] from a process that is constitutionally and statutorily flawed in that Tele Tech\u2019s due process rights were violated by the [department],\u201d and that \u201c[t]he [August 17, 2001] letter did not identify the reasons for the initiation of such action by the [department] or [the] nature of the charges that led to this action.\u201d Furthermore, the department responded to Tele Tech\u2019s statement of exceptions and addressed Tele Tech\u2019s challenges in its final decision of May 1, 2002. In its final decision, the department stated: \u201cIn its brief and at oral argument, [Tele Tech] maintains that the department\u2019s notice to show cause in the instant proceeding lacked sufficient specificity to satisfy the due process rights fundamentally guaranteed to it in the United States constitution and . . .

E.g., <em>Carpenteri-Waddington, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number><em>Services, </em>231 Conn. 355, 364, 650 A.2d 147 (1994) (\u201c[w]hen . . . the language used in the federal tax statutes is nearly identical to that before us, we may look to federal law to guide our interpretation of the state statute\u201d); O <em>&amp; G Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>New Milford, </em>229 Conn. 303, 309, 640 A.2d 110 (1994) (noting that when Connecticut legislation is \u201cpatterned after and operate [s] in general conformity with the federal statutes ... we look to federal judicial interpretations . . . for guidance\u201d [citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>189 Conn. 518, 535, 457 A.2d 656 (1983) (\u201c[b]ecause [the state] statute is modeled after [federal statutes], we may look to decisions under the federal law for guidance\u201d); see also <em>King County </em>v. <em>Central Puget Sound Growth Management Hearings Board, </em>138 Wash. 2d 161, 179, 979 P.2d 374 (1999) (\u201c[w]here there is no [state] case law construing provisions of the [state administrative procedure act], federal precedent may serve as persuasive authority\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b824-5\"> \u201cTo formulate a claim under the [due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution], a plaintiff must demonstrate that he or she possesses a constitutionally protected interest in life, liberty, or property, and that state action has deprived him or her of that interest. . . . [Procedural due process questions [are examined] in two steps: the first asks whether there exists a liberty or property interest which has been interfered with by the State; the second examines whether the procedures attendant upon that deprivation were constitutionally sufficient.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Valmonte </em>v. <em>Bane, </em>18 F.3d 992, 998 (2d Cir. 1994), quoting <em>Kentucky Dept. of Corrections </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>490 U.S. 454, 460, 109 S. Ct. 1904, 104 L. Ed. 2d 506 (1989). Moreover, \u201c[o]nce it is determined that due process applies, the question remains what process is due. . . . [D]ue process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands. [Consideration of what procedures due process may require under any given set of circumstances must begin with a determination of the precise nature of the government function involved as well as of the private interest that has been affected by governmental action. ... To say that the concept of due process is flexible does not mean that judges are at large to apply it to any and all relationships. Its flexibility is in its scope once it has been determined that some process is due; it is a recognition that not all situations calling for procedural safeguards call for the same kind of procedure.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Morrissey </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 481, 92 S.

This principle is reflected in [UAPA] .... Section 4-182 of [UAPA] draws a distinction between the notice requirements of proceedings involving the issuing of licenses and of proceedings involving the taking away of licenses. Under \u00a7 4-182 (a), when the grant, denial or renewal of a license is required to be preceded by notice and a hearing, the notice . . . under [General Statutes (Rev. to 1972)] \u00a7 4-177 (b) (4) [must] contain \u2018a short and plain statement of the matters asserted.\u2019 Section 4-182 (c), however, requires notice <em>and hearing </em>for the revocation, suspension, annulment or withdrawal of any license, and the nolice must inform the licensee \u2018of facts or conduct which warrant the intended action.\u2019 The stricter notice requirements for the latter type of proceeding are a function of the more compelling private interest involved; because of this interest, the demands of due process are greater than they are in the former <em>type of </em>proceeding.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added.) <em>Hart Twin Volvo Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>supra, 165 Conn. 47 n.2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b831-5\"> We note that the trial court made no finding, either in its memorandum of decision or subsequent articulation, as to whether Tele Tech had demonstrated that its substantial rights were prejudiced as a result of the department\u2019s actions. On numerous occasions during oral argument before the court, however, the court attempted to ascertain from the attorney representing Tele Tech how the department\u2019s conduct had prejudiced Tele Tech\u2019s rights.
