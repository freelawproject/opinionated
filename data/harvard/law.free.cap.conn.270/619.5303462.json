We concluded therein that the plaintiff had not appealed from a final judgment because the trial court had not yet resolved the plaintiffs remaining claim for permanent injunctive relief. The case thereafter was reclaimed to the trial list and, following additional hearings and briefing from the parties, the trial court denied the plaintiffs request for a mandatory injunction. Thereafter, the plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">In the present appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly: (1) set aside the jury\u2019s verdict on its antitrust claim on the ground that, under our decision in <em>Lawrence Brunoli, Inc. </em>v. <em>Branford, </em>247 Conn. 407, 722 A.2d 271 (1999), the plaintiff, an unsuccessful lowest bidder in a municipal bidding process, lacked standing to bring an antitrust claim against the defendant; (2) determined that it could effectively repeal Connecticut\u2019s antitrust statute in cases involving municipal bidding; (3) set aside the jury\u2019s verdict on the plaintiff\u2019s antitrust claim on the ground that the plaintiff had failed to present sufficient proof of damages; (4) directed a verdict for the defendant on the plaintiff\u2019s equal protection claims; and (5) failed to award the plaintiff mandatory injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">We conclude that the trial court improperly set aside the verdict on the ground that the plaintiff lacked standing to bring an antitrust claim for damages against a municipality arising out of the municipal bidding process. We conclude further that the trial court improperly set aside the verdict on the ground that the plaintiff had not proved its damages to a reasonable certainty. In light of that conclusion, we need not address the plaintiff\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly granted the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on its equal protection claims. Finally, we conclude that the trial court properly denied the plaintiff\u2019s request for injunctive relief. Accordingly, we reverse in part the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">The relevant facts and procedural history are set forth in our opinion in <em>Cheryl Terry Enterprises, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>supra, 262 Conn. 240. \u201cThe plaintiff is a school bus company based in Hartford. The president of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>company, Cheryl Terry, has worked in the school transportation business for more than thirty years. The plaintiff was one of three vendors who had submitted sealed bids to the defendant in response to an invitation to bid for a proposed five year contract to provide bus transportation services for the Hartford public schools, commencing with the 1998-1999 school year. The plaintiffs bid was lower than either of the other vendors, Laidlaw Transit, Inc. (Laidlaw), and Dattco, Inc. (Dattco). Despite being the highest bidder, Laidlaw was awarded the five year contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">\u201cAfter Laidlaw was awarded the contract, the plaintiff brought the action underlying this appeal, claiming violations of its equal protection rights and state antitrust law<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> .... The plaintiff also claimed that, by awarding the contract to an entity other than the lowest responsible bidder, the defendant violated \u00a7 2-548 of the Hartford municipal code.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiffs complaint alleged a violation of the Connecticut Antitrust Act (act); General Statutes \u00a7 35-24 et seq.; in that it was not awarded the contract due to a conspiratorial agreement between a [labor] union and the defendant, with the purpose of obtaining a union contract.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiff sought tempo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>rary and permanent injunctive relief relating to the contract, monetary damages and equitable relief. At trial, the defendant acknowledged that the plaintiffs bid was the lowest submitted, but it maintained that the plaintiff was not awarded the contract because the defendant had been informed that the plaintiff had a pending labor case with the National Labor Relations Board, and because its bid did not conform to the specifications of the bid request. Terry testified, however, that the plaintiff had \u2018fully complied with each and every material term of [the] defendant\u2019s bid specifications . . . .\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">\u201cThereafter, the trial court held a hearing on the plaintiffs motion for a temporary restraining order. On August 4, 1998, subsequent to the completion of the hearing, but prior to the issuance of the trial court\u2019s decision, the defendant executed its contract with Laid-law. The trial court issued a decision denying the plaintiffs motion for a temporary restraining order on August 7, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">\u201cAfter a trial on the plaintiffs equal protection and state antitrust claims, the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict as to the plaintiffs equal protection claims, and submitted to the jury only the claim alleging an antitrust violation. Ultimately, the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the amount of $500,000 on that claim. The defendant then filed a motion to set aside the verdict. The trial court granted this motion and, thereafter, set aside the verdict for the plaintiff. The trial court reserved the question as to whether Laidlaw was a necessary party on the injunction portion of the claim and noted that it would hold a hearing on the plaintiffs request for permanent injunctive relief ab initio if it were to decide that Laidlaw was indeed a necessary party. The court ultimately determined that Laidlaw was a necessary party and that it should be joined as a party within thirty days of that order. Prior to a resolution of the claim for permanent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>injunctive relief, [however] the plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the trial court setting aside the verdict on its antitrust claim.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Cheryl Terry Enterprises, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>supra, 262 Conn. 243-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">As we noted previously, we dismissed the plaintiffs first appeal, concluding that the plaintiff had not appealed from a final judgment because the claim for injunctive relief had not been determined. Id., 242. Due to the trial court\u2019s subsequent resolution of the plaintiffs remaining claim for injunctive relief, we now address the merits of the plaintiffs claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">We address the plaintiffs first two claims together because they are interrelated. The plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly granted the defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict on the ground that <em>Lawrence Brunoli, Inc. </em>v. <em>Branford, </em>supra, 247 Conn. 407, precludes a plaintiff from pursuing a statutory antitrust claim for damages against a municipality arising out of a municipal bidding process. The defendant contends that the trial court properly found that, under <em>Lawrence Brunoli, Inc., </em>the plaintiff lacked standing to pursue its antitrust claim, and, therefore, that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. We agree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">The following additional facts are relevant to our resolution of this claim. Prior to trial, the plaintiff was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>warned by the trial court that it would allow the antitrust claim to go to the jury because the court was unprepared to rule on its ultimate viability, but that the court would \u201cclosely examine that issue if the jury were to return a verdict in the plaintiffs favor.\u201d Ultimately, the jury did return a verdict in the plaintiffs favor, and awarded the plaintiff $500,000 in damages. The defendant filed a motion to set aside the verdict, claiming, inter alia, that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to award damages on the antitrust claim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trial court agreed, and granted the defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">\u201cThe trial court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction is a matter of law and, therefore, our review is plenary. If a party is found to lack standing, the court is without subject matter jurisdiction to determine the cause. . . . A determination regarding a trial court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law.\u201d <em>Cadle Co. </em>v. <em>D\u2019Addario, </em>268 Conn. 441, 446, 844 A.2d 836 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">In its memorandum of decision on the defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict, the trial court analyzed the act and determined that \u201cit seems clear that a municipality can be sued under [the] act.\u201d We agree. The act provides, inter aha, that \u201c[e]very contract, combination, or conspiracy in restraint of any part of trade or commerce is unlawful.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 35-26. For pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>poses of the act, \u201c \u2018[p]erson\u2019 \u201d is defined broadly as \u201cany individual, proprietorship, corporation, limited liability company, firm, partnership, incorporated and unincorporated association, or any other legal or commercial entity . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 35-25 (b). We consistently have stated that a municipality is a legal entity that can sue and be sued. See, e.g., <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>151 Conn. 259, 264, 196 A.2d 596 (1963) (\u201c[t]owns have no sovereign immunity, and ar e capable of suing and being sued ... in any action\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Therefore, the plain language of the statutory definition of \u201cperson\u201d is broad enough to include municipalities, such as the defendant in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">This broad definition of \u201cperson\u201d is then utilized by the legislature to define both who may be liable for anticompetitive behavior, and who has standing to recover damages for such behavior. In regard to standing, General Statutes \u00a7 35-35 provides in relevant part that \u201cany person . . . injured in its business or property by any violation of the provisions of this chapter shall recover treble damages, together with a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee and costs.\u201d See also General Statutes \u00a7 35-34 (\u201cany person . . . may sue for injunctive relief, both temporary or permanent, against threatened loss or damage to its property or business by any violation of this chapter\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">Conversely, the legislature also has used that same broad definition of \u201cperson\u201d to define any individual or entity that may be liable under the act for anticompetitive behavior. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 35-38 (\u201c[a]ny . . . person who has been held to have violated any of the provisions of this chapter shall forfeit and pay to the state a civil penalty of not more than two hundred fifty thousand dollars\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 35-39 (\u201c[a] corporation, association, firm, partnership, proprietorship, or any other legal or commercial entity is liable under this chapter for the acts of its . . . agents\u201d). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>Indeed, the only express limitation on the act\u2019s applicability is set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 35-31,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which contains four classes of exceptions from liability under the act. None of these exceptions is applicable to the facts of the present case. See also <em>Mazzola </em>v. <em>Southern New England Telephone Co., </em>169 Conn. 344, 355, 363 A.2d 170 (1975) (\u201c[\u00a7 35-31] exceptions are to be strictly construed\u201d). Thus, although the legislature has excluded certain organizations and activities from liability under the act, it has not excluded municipalities, or the municipal bidding process, from its provisions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>See <em>Doucette </em>v. <em>Pomes, </em>247 Conn. 442, 457, 724 A. 2d 481 (1999) (\u201cjujnless there is evidence to the contrary, statutory itemization indicates that the legislature intended [a] list to be exclusive\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Although the defendant may be correct that there are significant public policy reasons to exclude the municipal bidding process from the act, that is a change that must be made by the legislature, not this court. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hanson, </em>210 Conn. 519, 529, 556 A.2d 1007 (1989) (\u201cIt is axiomatic that the court itself cannot rewrite a statute to accomplish a particular result. That is the function of the legislature.\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Luurtsema, </em>262 Conn. 179, 202, 811 A.2d 223 (2002) (rejecting argument imputing temporal requirement to restraint element of kidnapping statute). In sum, we conclude that the trial court properly determined that a municipality can be sued for violations of the act.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Despite having reached this conclusion, however, the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to set aside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>the judgment, determining that in light of our decision in <em>Lawrence Brunoli, Inc. </em>v. <em>Branford, </em>supra, 247 Conn. 416, the act was \u201ceffectively repealed\u201d in actions arising from the municipal bidding process because \u201c[t]o allow antitrust damages here would be repugnant to the public benefit purposes of the municipal competitive bidding laws and would not therefore comport with the similar objectives of the antitrust laws to benefit the public, not competitors, and lead to results the legislature could not have intended.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">To begin with, we already have concluded that the trial court properly determined that the definition of \u201cpersons\u201d subject to liability under the act is broad enough to include municipalities. Once the trial court made this determination, it should have denied the defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict, and declined to apply the policy reasons set forth in <em>Lawrence Brunoli, Inc., </em>in order to alter the plain language of the act. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hanson, </em>supra, 210 Conn. 529.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">Moreover, <em>Lawrence Brunoli, Inc., </em>readily is distinguishable from the present case. In <em>Lawrence Brunoli, Inc., </em>the plaintiff, an unsuccessful bidder in a municipal bidding contest, alleged impropriety in the contract awarding process and brought a breach of contract action for money damages against the town of Branford. <em>Lawrence Brunoli, Inc. </em>v. <em>Branford, </em>supra, 247 Conn. 408. Specifically, the plaintiff alleged fraud, corruption or favoritism on the part of the defendant in awarding the contract. Id., 410. The trial court dismissed the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the ground that the plaintiff lacked standing to assert a claim for money damages and was, therefore, limited to an action for injunctive relief. Id. The issue on appeal to this court was \u201cwhether the [trial] court [had] subject matter jurisdiction over a claim for damages, rather than for injunctive relief, allegedly resulting from fraud, corruption or favoritism in the award of a contract that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>is subject to competitive municipal bidding requirements.\u201d Id., 408. We answered that question in the negative, concluding that, \u201cas a matter of law, an unsuccessful bidder to a municipal contract has no standing to assert a cause of action for money damages for failure of the municipality to follow its competitive bidding laws, regardless of whether the plaintiff alleges fraud, corruption or favoritism\u201d in the bidding process. Id., 411. We began our analysis by noting that because the plaintiff only had bid on the contract, and was not awarded the contract, it lacked standing to bring a common-law breach of contract action. Id., 411-12. Accordingly, we concluded that \u201c[i]f an unsuccessful bidder has standing to bring a claim against a municipality . . . such standing must be derived from a source other than its bid submitted in response to an invitation to bid. That source is the municipal bidding statutes themselves.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Id., 412. Because the statutes expressly did not confer standing for money damages, and our prior case law had limited relief in such actions to injunctive relief, we considered whether the policy considerations underlying the bidding statutes were best served by continuing to limit the remedy to injunctive relief. Id., 412-16. We concluded that they were, and, accordingly, affirmed the judgment of the trial court. Id., 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">Our decision in <em>Lawrence Brunoli, Inc., </em>was limited to actions based on common-law breach of contract claims or the municipal bidding statutes. In the present case, the plaintiff did not assert a common-law breach of contract action, nor an action for injunctive relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>under the municipal bidding statutes, but, rather, sought relief under the act. We simply were not called upon in <em>Lawrence Brunoli, Inc., </em>to address whether an unsuccessful lowest bidder had standing to bring an action under the act. Furthermore, as we stated in that case, \u201c[i]f an unsuccessful bidder has standing to bring a claim against a municipality . . . such standing must be derived from a source other than its bid submitted in response to the invitation to bid.\u201d Id., 412. As we noted previously, the legislature expressly has conferred standing on a broad range of individuals under the act, including unsuccessful bidders in a municipal bidding process. Thus, an independent source of standing, which was absent in <em>Lawrence Brunoli, Inc., </em>exists in the present case. Put another way, in <em>Lawrence Brunoli, Inc., </em>we were attempting to discern whether, in the absence of a direct conferral of standing by the legislature in the municipal bidding statutes, this court should recognize a right to standing for money damages. See id., 412-16. To the contrary, in the present case the legislature has conferred standing to a broad class of persons that includes a municipality, and this court cannot now limit that standing in a manner contrary to the plain language of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">Finally, we note that the policy considerations supporting our decision in <em>Lawrence Brunoli, Inc., </em>are rendered inapplicable to the present case due to the legislature\u2019s broad conferral of standing under the act, which is based on several important principles, including, the protection of the public from anticompetitive behavior and the promotion of competition in the marketplace. See, e.g., <em>Shea </em>v. <em>First Federal Savings </em>&amp; <em>Loan Assn. of New Haven, </em>184 Conn. 285, 294, 439 A.2d 997 (1981) (\u201c[b]oth federal and Connecticut antitrust law attempt to promote competition in the marketplace\u201d). Put another way, although this court was hesitant to expose taxpayers to the additional costs of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>money damages in <em>Lawrence Brunoli, Inc., </em>the legislature has not expressed a similar hesitation within the language of the act. Indeed, as the plaintiff correctly contends, it would be incongruous to allow a municipality to bring an action against contractors under the act for anticompetitive behavior, yet preclude those same contractors from bringing an action against a municipality that has engaged in anticompetitive behavior.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The trial court\u2019s reliance on <em>Lawrence Brunoli, Inc., </em>therefore, was misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">We turn next to the plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly granted the defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict on the ground that the plaintiff had failed to prove its claim of lost profits to a reasonable degree of certainty. The defendant contends that the trial court properly determined that the plaintiff had introduced no evidence of lost profits. We agree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this claim. At trial, the evidence concerning the plaintiffs lost profits consisted of the bid on the Hartford school transportation contract (bid) and the testimony of Terry, the plaintiffs president. The bid was for a five year contract, with busing services to commence on July 1, 1998, and to terminate on June 30, 2003. On the bid forms, bidders had to specify the price of five items for each of the five years. Specifically, the bid forms requested prices for three \u201cruns\u201d consisting of morning, midday and afternoon service, whereby bidders had to specify the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>annual unit price per school bus, and then multiply that price by the number of buses to arrive at an annual price per run.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The bid forms also requested an annual price for 180 half hours of \u201cadditional service.\u201d Finally, the bid forms requested the annual price of bus monitors, to be calculated by multiplying a monitor\u2019s hourly salary by 15,120 hours. Each of these prices were added together to arrive at the total annual price of the busing service. The bidder was then required to add together the annual prices for each of the five years, adjusted for present value, to arrive at the net present value, or total price, of the bid.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">The net present value of the plaintiffs bid was $5,862,997.93. Terry testified that this figure included all of the plaintiffs costs, as well as its usual anticipated profit of 8 to 10 percent. Specifically, Terry testified that, in preparing the bid, she had calculated the following costs: the cost of purchasing new or used school buses, including the cost of financing those purchases; payroll, including taxes and workers\u2019 compensation insurance; facility costs, including the cost of gasoline for the school buses; property costs; and the cost of liability insurance. Terry further testified that she had calculated each of these costs on the basis of the individual specifications of the bid. She then testified that, after calculating the plaintiffs costs, she had added its anticipated profit. Terry stated that her usual practice was to add between 8 and 10 percent profit to her bids.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">In addition, Terry testified at length concerning her approximately thirty years of experience in the school transportation business. She stated that she had started as a school bus driver in the 1960s, and soon thereafter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>was managing school transportation contracts for a number of cities and towns throughout the state, encompassing \u201cwell over 200\u201d school buses at one time and \u201c[forty-eight school buses] in Norwich alone.\u201d In 1984, Teriy incorporated the plaintiff, which has provided school transportation services since that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">On cross-examination by the defendant, Terry acknowledged that she was unable to produce the exact figures that she had used in calculating the bid. She stated, however, that, although she had prepared the bid two and one-half years before the trial and could not remember the actual figures she had used, she could explain how she had calculated the bid. Terry explained that she had calculated the bid the same way that she calculates all of her bids: \u201cI took my costs, as I always do, and add[ed] a profit, and that is all I can tell you because that is the way you do it.\u201d Although Terry acknowledged that it was \u201cpossible\u201d that she could have miscalculated the bid, she stated: \u201cI have been doing this for a long time, and I have been pretty much on target. ... I am not infallible, no one is infallible, but I have a record.\u201d When the defendant\u2019s attorney asked Terry, a second time, if she could have miscalculated her expenses, she replied: \u201cI have a record, that is why I am in business. ... I am confident of my past experience which has been many many years in the business, or I wouldn\u2019t have been in the business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">At the end of Terry\u2019s testimony, the defendant moved to strike her testimony concerning anticipated profits as irrelevant because \u201cshe does not have the knowledge upon which to base an estimate of the profits.\u201d The trial court denied the motion to strike, but indicated that, \u201cunless there is more offered in the way of facts and figures that [Terry] relied on, I may be in a position <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>where I grant a motion for a directed verdict . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The plaintiff presented no further evidence concerning Terry\u2019s preparation of the bid or the plaintiffs anticipated profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">The jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff on its antitrust claim, and awarded damages in the amount of $500,000.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The defendant thereafter filed a motion to set aside the verdict, claiming, inter alia, that \u201c[t]he verdict bears no relationship to [the] damages proved in the case.\u201d The trial court agreed, and concluded that the plaintiff had \u201cfail[ed] to prove damages to a reasonable certainty [and] that the jury verdict was based on sheer speculation.\u201d Specifically, the court stated that, \u201cthe plaintiff, through . . . Terry, presented no experts, statistics, financial records as to costs or any information from which a reasonable calculation of lost profits could be made for this contract. [Terry] simply testified that she had been in the school <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>transportation business for thirty years and her rate of profit was between 8 and 10 percent. . . . Terry was a very candid witness . . . [and] repeatedly said that she had done the calculation on cost for this bid over two years ago and did not have her records nor any present memory of any of the cost items that went into determining the expenses of completing the contractual obligations she was bidding for .... In the court\u2019s opinion, that will not do. Profits are determined by subtracting expenses from anticipated revenue. Although expenses for a five year contract cannot be calculated precisely in every category, some credible and concrete figures must be provided\u2014[Terry] admitted at one time she had those very figures, she just did not bring them to court or no longer had them.\u201d The trial court further stated that, even if the plaintiff could have established lost profits \u201cby proving the amount of the bid and the rate of profit it traditionally received by running this business for over thirty years,\u201d there was \u201cno evidence that the school transportation contracts it had performed in the past were anything comparable to the prospective Hartford five year contract.\u201d Consequently, the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">We begin with a brief discussion of the appropriate standard of review. \u201cThe trial court possesses inherent power to set aside a jury verdict which, in the court\u2019s opinion, is against the law or the evidence. . . . The supervision which a judge has over the verdict is an essential part of the jury system. . . . [The trial court] should not set aside a verdict where it is apparent that there was some evidence upon which the jury might reasonably reach their conclusion, and should not refuse to set it aside where the manifest injustice of the verdict is so plain and palpable as clearly to denote that some mistake was made by the jury in the application of legal principles, or as to justify the suspicion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>that they or some of them were influenced by prejudice, corruption or partiality. . . . The court has a duty to set aside the verdict where the jury\u2019s action is so unreasonable as to suggest that it was the product of such improper influences. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">\u201cWe recognize that, [i]n determining whether to set aside the verdict, the trial court walks a thin line. . . . Ultimately, [t]he decision to set aside a verdict entails the exercise of a broad legal discretion . . . that, in the absence of clear abuse, we shall not disturb. Our review of the trial court\u2019s action on a motion to set aside the verdict involves a determination of whether the trial court abused its discretion, according great weight to the action of the trial court and indulging every reasonable presumption in favor of its correctness . . . since the trial judge has had the same opportunity as the jury to view the witnesses, to assess their credibility and to determine the weight that should be given to their evidence. . . . Moreover, the trial judge can gauge the tenor of the trial, as we, on the written record, cannot, and can detect those factors, if any, that could improperly have influenced the jury. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">\u201cFinally, in evaluating the exercise of the trial court\u2019s discretion, we are mindful that litigants have a constitutional right to have juries decide issues of fact. The right to a jury trial is fundamental in our judicial system, and this court has said that the right is one obviously immovable limitation on the legal discretion of the court to set aside a verdict, since the constitutional right of trial by jury includes the right to have issues of fact as to which there is room for a reasonable difference of opinion among fair-minded men passed upon by the jury and not by the court. . . . Since, in setting aside the verdict, the trial court has deprived the party in whose favor the verdict was rendered of his constitutional right to have factual issues resolved by the jury, we must examine the evidential basis of the verdict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>itself to determine whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Howard </em>v. <em>MacDonald, </em>270 Conn. 111, 126-28, 851 A.2d 1142 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">In the present case, the trial court set aside the jury\u2019s verdict because it concluded that the plaintiff had not proved its damages to a reasonable certainty. \u201cThe amount of a damage award is a matter peculiarly within the province of the trier of fact, in this case, the jury. ... In considering a motion to set aside the verdict, the [trial] court must determine whether the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, reasonably supports the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Carrol </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>262 Conn. 433, 449, 815 A.2d 119 (2003). Accordingly, we must determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in making its determination that the evidence reasonably did not support the jury\u2019s award of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">\u201cIn deciding whether damages properly have been awarded . . . we are guided by the well established principle that such damages must be proved with reasonable certainty. . . . Although we recognize that damages for lost profits may be difficult to prove with exactitude . . . such damages are recoverable only to the extent that the evidence affords a sufficient basis for estimating their amount with reasonable certainty. . . . Consequently, we have permitted lost profits to be calculated by extrapolating from past profits.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Beverly Hills Concepts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Schalz &amp; Schatz, Ribicoff &amp; Kotkin, </em>247 Conn. 48, 69, 717 A.2d 724 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">\u201cThis court and courts of other jurisdictions have looked to a number of factors in evaluating whether the plaintiff has proved lost profits to a reasonable certainty. A plaintiff\u2019s prior experience in the same business has been held to be probative ... as has a plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>tiffs experience in the same enterprise subsequent to the interference. . . . [T]he experience of the plaintiff ... in a similar business [has] been admitted to prove lost profits. ... In addition, the average experience of participants in the same line of business as the injured party has been approved as a method of proving lost profits. . . . Similarly, prelitigation projections, particularly when prepared by the defendant, have also been approved. . . . The underlying requirement for each of these types of evidence is a substantial similarity between the facts forming the basis of the profit projections and the business opportunity that was destroyed.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 72-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Finally, this court has recognized that, \u201c[t]he vagaries of the marketplace usually deny us sure knowledge of what [the] plaintiffs situation would have been in the absence of the defendant\u2019s antitrust violation. This fact and the general belief that it would be inequitable to allow a wrongdoer to defeat recovery by insisting on rigorous proof of damages have resulted in a lesser burden of proving the amount of damages in antitrust suits than in other contexts.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Westport Taxi Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Westport Transit District, </em>235 Conn. 1, 28, 664 A.2d 719 (1995), quoting 1 A.B.A. Antitrust Section, Antitrust Law Developments (3d Ed. 1992) p. 668. Accordingly, \u201c[a] damage theory may be based on assumptions so long as the assumptions are reasonable in light of the record evidence. . . . The reasonableness of the assumptions underlying the plaintiffs damage theory is determined by the trier of fact. . . . Federal appellate courts have refused to find damage evidence insufficient unless there was <em>no basis </em>for critical assumptions made by the [trier of fact].\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Westport Taxi Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Westport Transit District, </em>supra, 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>Our review of the record reveals that the jury\u2019s award of damages was reasonably supported by the evidence, which proved those damages to a reasonable certainty. First, the plaintiffs bid on the Hartford school transportation contract stated a net present value of $5,862,997.93. This figure reflects the net present value of the requested three daily runs of school bus service, additional service and bus monitors over the course of five years. On the basis of this evidence and any assumptions reasonably drawn therefrom, the jury reasonably could have concluded that, in the absence of the defendant\u2019s antitrust violation, the plaintiff would have performed the Hartford school transportation contract at a price of $5,862,997.93.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Second, Terry testified at length concerning her substantial experience in preparing bids for school transportation contracts. Specifically, Terry testified that she had approximately thirty years of experience in preparing such bids, and that she had run her own school transportation company since 1984. She also stated, several times, that she prepared her bids by first calculating her costs, and then adding in an anticipated profit, which was usually between 8 and 10 percent of the price of the bid. Although Terry could not produce the exact figures she had used in calculating the costs for the bid, she discussed, in detail, the nature of those costs. On cross-examination, Terry candidly acknowledged the possibility that she could have miscalculated the bid. She stated, however, that \u201cI have been doing this for a long time, and I have been pretty much on target.\u201d Terry also stated: \u201cI am confident of my past experience which has been many many years in the business, or I wouldn\u2019t have been in the business.\u201d On the basis of this testimony, the jury reasonably could have inferred that Terry accurately had predicted the plaintiffs profits on previous bids. Moreover, her testimony was consistent with our well settled principle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>that \u201cthe owner of property is competent to testify to its value. . . . Furthermore, we have determined that a franchise owner is competent to testify as to the value of a franchise. . . . This is based in part on the common experience that an owner is familiar with her property .... The weight to be accorded such testimony is for the trier to decide.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Westport Taxi Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Westport Transit District, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">In <em>Westport Taxi Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Westport Transit District, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 32-36, in which the plaintiff had alleged antitrust violations, this court upheld an award of damages for lost profits and lost business value. In that case, the plaintiff, a private taxi company, claimed that the defendant municipality had committed an antitrust violation by operating a government subsidized, below cost taxi service for the purpose of monopolizing the town\u2019s taxi business, thereby forcing the plaintiff out of business. After a court trial, the trial court agreed with the plaintiff and awarded it damages for lost profits and lost business value. With regard to lost profits, the trial court found that the plaintiff had not sought a fare increase with the state public utilities commission, because it \u201clegitimately [had] feared that it would have trouble enough competing with [the defendant\u2019s] service at present rates, without adding to the problem by increasing its fares.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 30. Accordingly, the court awarded damages of $12,144 in lost profits based upon the difference in what the plaintiff had been charging and what it could have charged but for the defendant\u2019s conduct.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Id., 30-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>The trial court in <em>Westport Taxi Service, Inc., </em>then determined that the plaintiff also was entitled to $150,000 in damages for lost business value. In arriving at this figure, the trial court noted its reliance on the testimony of the plaintiffs vice president, who stated that a fair return on a taxi business would be between 10 and 12 percent. Specifically, \u201c[t]he trial court determined that [the witness\u2019] valuation of the business was based on his own experience in the taxi business for more than twenty years, his knowledge of how a taxi business was valued by the industry, his discussions with other owners, his knowledge of other sales, his membership in the Connecticut Taxi Cab Association, his membership in the International Taxi Cab Association, and finally, his own personal experience and practice . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 34. In accordance with the testimony of the plaintiffs vice president, the trial court applied a 10 to 12 percent rate of return to its own calculation of the plaintiffs projected profits to arrive at its ultimate determination in lost business value. Id., 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">The defendant appealed to this court, which affirmed the award of damages for lost profits and lost business value. Id., 45. With respect to lost profits, this court concluded that \u201cthe trial court based its calculation of the plaintiffs damages due to lost profits on sufficient evidence and reasonable assumptions . . . .\u201d Id., 32. In addition, this court concluded that the trial court properly had relied on the testimony of the plaintiffs vice president to establish the lost value of the plaintiff s business. In so concluding, we noted \u201cthat the trial court has broad discretion to admit the testimony of anyone who is involved with a business or property and may have personal knowledge of its value.\u201d Id., 35. Because the plaintiffs vice president was competent to testify to the methods he had employed in valuing the business, the weight given his testimony was for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>the trial court, as the trier of fact, to decide. Id. Just as the plaintiffs vice president in <em>Westport Taxi Service, Inc., </em>was competent to testify as to the plaintiffs lost anticipated profits and to his reliance on those figures in valuing his business, Terry was competent to testify in the present case as to the methods she had used in predicting a profit in the plaintiffs bid for the Hartford school transportation contract, and, therefore, the jury was entitled to credit her testimony as it did.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See <em>Capitol City Personnel Services, Inc. </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>52 Conn. App. 783, 787, 727 A.2d 1284 (1999) (plaintiff proved damages with reasonable certainty when principal shareholder estimated profits as 25 percent of adjusted gross receipts, and testified that 25 percent was \u201caccurate\u201d for both industry and this particular plaintiff).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>Moreover, in <em>Bead Chain Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Saxton Products, Inc., </em>183 Conn. 266, 439 A.2d 314 (1981), this court concluded that, under the Uniform Commercial Code; General Statutes \u00a7 42a-l-101 et seq.; lost profits on a breached contract for the sale of goods may be established through the opinion testimony of the seller. Specifically, this court stated: \u201cWith regard to the loss of profits, [the plaintiff\u2019s] president testified, without objection, about the elements he considered in pricing the job for [the defendant]. Under the [Uniform Commercial] Code, it is not fatal that his cost and price estimates about the actual production run were necessarily theoretical, since [the defendant\u2019s] breach made it impossible to go forward with the production that would have made historically accurate figures available.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">. . . [The plaintiffs] president based his estimates on his experienced view of the equipment that would be required, the difficulty of maintaining production, and the time required for the job. Having taken account of these and related factors, he built a 20 percent profit into the contract price of $13.95 per thousand units. The award of $3000 lost profits on a contract for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>5,000,000 units at a total contract price of approximately $70,000 was therefore well within the supporting evidence.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Bead Chain Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Saxton Products, Inc., </em>supra, 279-80. Although <em>Bead Chain Mfg. Co. </em>was decided under the Uniform Commercial Code, \u201c[w]e have often drawn upon provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code as a source of analogy for the emergent common law.\u201d <em>Normand Josef Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Connecticut National Bank, </em>230 Conn. 486, 501, 646 A.2d 1289 (1994). Therefore, as in <em>Bead Chain Mfg. Co., </em>it is not fatal in the present case that Terry\u2019s estimated profits under the Hartford school transportation contract were necessarily theoretical, since it was the defendant\u2019s antitrust violation, in the first instance, that rendered the historically accurate figures unavailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">The defendant, relying on <em>Beverly Hills Concepts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Schatz &amp; Schatz, Ribicoff &amp; Kotkin, </em>supra, 247 Conn. 70, and <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Indusco Management Corp., </em>164 Conn. 262, 320 A.2d 811 (1973), contends that this court previously has set aside damage awards that were \u201csupported by far more evidence than the verdict here.\u201d A review of those cases, however, reveals that they do not support the defendant\u2019s characterization. In <em>Beverly Hills Concepts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Schatz &amp; Schatz, Ribicoff &amp; Kotkin, </em>supra, 50-52, the plaintiff, a corporation that sold exercise equipment, brought an action against the defendant law firm and certain individual attorneys for malpractice in connection with the plaintiffs failed attempt to establish a new business that would franchise fitness clubs. After a court trial, the trial court rendered a verdict for the plaintiff, and awarded the plaintiff approximately $15.9 million in lost profits. Id., 51. On appeal, this court reversed the damages award, because \u201cthe trial court improperly concluded that the plaintiff had established its damages to a reasonable certainty.\u201d Id., 59. Specifically, the plaintiff in that case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>had not sold any fitness franchises; id., 72; therefore, there was no record of such sales from which to extrapolate anticipated future profits. Accordingly, the plaintiff attempted to establish lost profits through the expert testimony of a certified public accountant, who estimated the plaintiffs lost profits on the basis of its prior sales of fitness equipment. Id., 70-72. As this court noted, however, this testimony was based on the faulty assumption that, because the plaintiff previously had sold fitness <em>equipment, </em>it would have been able to sell fitness <em>franchises </em>with a similar rate of success. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">The lost profits of a new business also was an issue in <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Indusco Management Corp., </em>supra, 164 Conn. 262, the other case relied on by the defendant. In <em>Gordon, </em>the plaintiff, who had acquired an area distributorship franchise in a fast-food restaurant operation, entered into a contract with the defendant for the construction and lease of a building in Danbury in which the plaintiff would operate an outlet of the restaurant chain. Id., 264. After the defendant had failed to construct the outlet, as it had promised to in the contract, the plaintiff brought an action against the defendant for breach of contract. Id., 263. In an effort to establish lost profits, the plaintiff presented the testimony of the operator an outlet of the fast-food chain located in Orange. That witness testified that his outlet\u2019s gross receipts were $175,000, and that his net profit was 12 percent of the gross receipts. Id., 275. As this court noted, however, the operator of the outlet in Orange had managed that outlet himself, and his stated figure of a 12 percent profit had <em>included </em>the value of his own services to the operation in that capacity. Id., 276. The plaintiff, by contrast, had intended to hire a manager to run his outlet for him. Id. Accordingly, the court in <em>Gordon </em>concluded that the plaintiff had not proved his damages, because, \u201c[s]ince the plaintiff would not have given his services but would have employed a manager <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>for Ms outlet, it is not clear that he would have enjoyed a similar profit margin.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Unlike the businesses in both <em>Beverly Hills Concepts, Inc., </em>and <em>Gordon, </em>the plaintiff m the present case is not a new busmess.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> As we previously have stated, Terry testified that she had approximately thirty years of experience in the school transportation industry and had been running her own school transportation company since 1984. She also testified that, prior to incorporating her own company, she had managed a school transportation company that had \u201cwell over 200\u201d school buses and \u201c[forty-eight school buses] in Norwich alone.\u201d The bid form in the present case indicates that only thirty-four school buses would have been required for performance of the Hartford school transportation contract. See footnote 12 of tMs opimon. Frnally, Terry discussed the specific types of expenses that she had considered in preparing the bid, and she testified that she always had prepared her bids by first calculating the costs, and then adding in the anticipated profit. Accordingly, Terry\u2019s testimony established that she previously had managed school transportation contracts that were similar to the contract at issue in the present case, and on the basis of this testimony, the jury reasonably could have concluded that Terry\u2019s anticipated profit of between 8 and 10 percent was appropriate. Because the jury\u2019s damage award of $500,000, or approximately 8.5 percent in lost profits, was well within tMs range; see footnote 14 of this opimon; the trial court abused its discretion in setting aside the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">The plaintiff next claims that the trial court improperly granted the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on its equal protection claims on the ground that the plaintiff had an adequate remedy at law in its antitrust claim, because the trial court subsequently deprived the plaintiff of that adequate remedy when it set aside the jury\u2019s verdict on the antitrust claim. The defendant contends that the trial court properly directed the verdict on the plaintiffs constitutional claims because the plaintiff had the remedy of a permanent injunction available to her. Because we have concluded that the trial court\u2019s judgment setting aside the verdict was improper, we need not decide this issue because a litigant may recover just damages only once.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">The plaintiffs final claim is that the trial court improperly failed to grant it a mandatory injunction requiring that the defendant enter into a prospective, five year contract with the plaintiff on a cost plus 10 percent profit basis.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The defendant contends that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>court was within its discretion to deny the relief requested by the plaintiff. Laidlaw<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> claims that, because the 1998 contract has terminated, and it already is performing work under a new five year contract awarded in 2003, issuance of the mandatory injunctive relief sought by the plaintiff would severely harm Laidlaw. We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">\u201cA mandatory injunction ... is a court order commanding a party to perform an act.\u201d <em>Tomasso Bros., Inc. </em>v. <em>October Twenty-Four, Inc., </em>230 Conn. 641, 652, 646 A.2d 133 (1994). \u201cRelief by way of mandatory injunction is an extraordinary remedy granted in the sound discretion of the court and only under compelling circumstances. . . . Ordinarily, an injunction will not lie where there is an adequate remedy at law.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Monroe </em>v. <em>Middlebury Conservation Commission, </em>187 Conn. 476, 480, 447 A.2d 1 (1982); accord <em>Harvey </em>v. <em>Daddona, </em>29 Conn.

Moreover, \u201c[w]here the granting of the injunction would cause damage to the defendant greatly disproportionate to the injury of which the plaintiff complains, it may be held inequitable to grant a mandatory injunction and the plaintiff may be remitted to her remedy by way of damages.\u201d <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Serafin, </em>163 Conn. 1, 6-7, 301 A.2d 238 (1972).

The plaintiff had an adequate remedy under the act, namely, an action for damages against the defendant, on which she prevailed. Moreover, even if the plaintiff had not had the ability to collect damages, we would conclude that the trial court properly exercised its discretion in denying the relief requested. See id. (\u201cmandatory injunction is an extraordinary remedy granted in the sound discretion of the court\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). The plaintiff was requesting that the trial court award a new contract to the plaintiff, for a term of five years, and for a total value of cost plus a <em>guaranteed profit </em>of 10 percent. The plaintiff has failed to cite, before both the trial court and this court, any authority for such a broad use of the extraordinary remedy of a mandatory injunction. Indeed, the contract underlying the present case has expired, and the defendant already has entered into a new five year contract with Laidlaw. Thus, if that contract, which is not challenged in the present case, remained in effect, and the plaintiffs request for a new contract was granted, the result would be that two contracts would be in effect for the same project.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> This court previously has rejected such a bizarre result. See <em>Blesso Fire Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Eastern Connecticut State University, </em>245 Conn. 252, 257, 713 A.2d 1283 (1998).

As we noted previously, however, when the case was reclaimed to the trial list, Laidlaw subsequently was a defendant in the plaintiffs action. In the current appeal, Laidlaw is involved as an appellee only as to the plaintiffs final claim\u2014whether the trial court properly denied the plaintiff\u2019s request for ipjunctive relief.

Because the trial court found that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction in the present case, it declined to address the defendant\u2019s claim that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that the defendant had conspired to restrain trade. Therefore, that claim is not before us in the present appeal. The defendant\u2019s remaining claim, that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that the plaintiff had suffered damages for an antitrust injury, is addressed in part II of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b646-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 35-31 provides: \u201c(a) Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to forbid the existence or operation of labor, agricultural, or horticultural organizations instituted for the purpose of mutual help, and not having capital stock and not conducted for profit, or to forbid or restrain individual members of such organizations from lawfully carrying out the legitimate objects thereof.

In that case, the defendant, a transit district established by the town of Westport, provided bus and taxi services in direct competition with the plaintiff. After the plaintiff was forced out of business, it brought an action against the defendant, alleging violations of the act Id., 11-12. The trial court found that the defendant had engaged in attempted monopolization and actual monopolization in violation of the act, and awarded the plaintiff damages for lost profits, the value of the business, and prejudgment interest. In addition, the trial court awarded the plaintiff treble damages under \u00a7 35-35. Id., 12-13. On appeal to this court, the defendant claimed, inter alia, that it was entitled to \u201cgovernmental immunity applicable to municipalities and their agencies because it is a transit district established by the town of Westport.\u201d Id., 26. We declined to review this claim, concluding that the record was insufficient to analyze the defendant\u2019s claim properly. Id., 27.

App. 787, because in that case, \u201cthe plaintiffs witness testified that [the] plaintiff had earned a 25 percent profit markup on its billings for the same type of business in the same locality over the past three years. [The] [pjlaintiff also presented testimony that other businesses in the same industry and area also earned about the same percentage profit at the time.\u201d This is a distinction without a difference. In the present case, Terry testified that she always anticipates a profit of between 8 and 10 percent, and that she usually is accurate. Therefore, Terry\u2019s estimate of lost profits was not a \u201cpure guess [that] was wholly unsupported as to either the amount of business lost or the profit to be expected.\u201d <em>Doeltz </em>v. <em>Longshore, Inc., </em>126 Conn. 597, 602, 13 A.2d 505 (1940). Moreover, the fact that the plaintiff had submitted the lowest bid on the Hartford school transportation contract, is evidence that the plaintiffs bid was competitive in the industry. Therefore, the jury reasonably could have inferred that Terry\u2019s stated anticipated profit of 8 to 10 percent was accurate as to the state\u2019s school transportation industry, as well as to this particular plaintiff. Finally, the fact that the plaintiffs anticipated profit had ranged from 8 to 10 percent is not fatal to its claim for lost profits; that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>range of anticipated profit was sufficiently restrictive to permit the jury to determine the damages with reasonable certainty. See <em>Westport Taxi Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Westport Transit District, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 33-34 (trial court\u2019s reliance on fair rate of return of between 10 to 12 percent in valuing plaintiffs business was proper).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Similarly, the dissent\u2019s reliance on <em>Doeltz </em>is misplaced. In that case, this court determined that lost profits had been improperly awarded for the plaintiffs new business when profits had actually increased after the defendant\u2019s interference and the plaintiff had presented no evidence of costs oilier than rent. <em>Doeltz </em>v. <em>Longshore, Inc., </em>supra, 126 Conn. 601. In addition, the plaintiffs testimony that \u201c[w]e usually figure on the liquor 100 [percent profit] and food 50 [percent profit]\u201d; id., 599; in an attempt to establish lost profits was deficient. Id., 601. This court concluded in <em>Doeltz </em>that, without more evidence, simply averaging the two figures to arrive at a claim for 75 percent lost profit, was insufficient, because \u201c[n]o attempt was made to show what relative proportion of [the plaintiffs] total sales fell within one class or the other.

As the trial court noted, the plaintiff \u201cpresented no experts, statistics, financial records as to costs or any information from which a reasonable calculation of lost profits could be made for this contract.\u201d To the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>contrary, as the majority recognizes, the only evidence offered by the plaintiff in support of its claim for lost profits was the testimony of its president, Cheryl Terry. Before evaluating whether the trial court properly determined that Terry\u2019s testimony, standing alone, failed to prove damages to a reasonable certainty, it is important to first identify what information was <em>not </em>testified to by Terry.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">First, Terry failed to testify about <em>any profits </em>the plaintiff actually had made under prior busing contracts. See <em>Beverly Hills Concepts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Schatz &amp; Schatz, Ribicoff &amp; Kotkin, </em>supra, 247 Conn. 72-73 (experience of plaintiff in same business probative on issue of lost profits); <em>Kay Petroleum Corp. </em>v. <em>Piergrossi, </em>137 Conn. 620, 624-25, 79 A.2d 829 (1951) (profits earned by plaintiff in year prior to breach may be extrapolated to time remaining on contract breached by defendant); <em>Tull </em>v. <em>Gundersons, Inc., </em>709 P.2d 940, 945 (Colo. 1985) (trial court improperly excluded evidence of plaintiffs \u201cpast profit experience on other projects\u201d); <em>Van Hooijdonk </em>v. <em>Langley, </em>111 N.H. 32, 34, 274 A.2d 798 (1971) (\u201c[a]n established business can usually provide data from which future prospects [of profitability] can reasonably be projected\u201d); <em>White </em>v. <em>Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., </em>651 S.W.2d 260, 263 (Tex. 1983) (profits earned by plaintiffs florist shop prior to defendant\u2019s breach of contract relevant to determination of lost profits caused by defendant\u2019s failure to list plaintiffs business properly in telephone directory).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">Second, Terry failed to testify about any profits that the plaintiff actually had made under subsequent busing contracts. See <em>Beverly Hills Concepts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Schatz &amp; Schatz, Ribicoff &amp; Kotkin, </em>supra, 247 Conn. 73 (plaintiffs experience in same enterprise subsequent to interference probative on issue of lost profits); <em>El Fredo Pizza, Inc. </em>v. <em>Roto-Flex Oven Co., </em>199 Neb. 697, 698, 261 N.W.2d 358 (1978) (increased profits earned after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>faulty pizza oven replaced indicative of profits lost as result of defendant\u2019s breach of warranty of merchantability); <em>Cook Associates </em>v. <em>Warnick, </em>664 P.2d 1161, 1165-66 (Utah 1983) (plaintiffs experience at unaffected plant relevant to lost profits projected for affected plant).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Third, Terry failed to testify about profits other participants in the busing industry had made under a contract with the defendant, or, more generally, under contracts with other towns. See <em>Beverly Hills Concepts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Schatz &amp; Schatz, Ribicoff &amp; Kotkin, </em>supra, 247 Conn. 73 (experience of third parties in similar business probative on issue of lost profits); <em>Chung </em>v. <em>Kaonohi Center Co., </em>62 Haw. 594, 611, 618 P.2d 283 (1980) (proper to base future profit calculation on experience of third party conducting virtually identical business at same location), overruled in part on other grounds, <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Lee Enterprises, Inc., </em>89 Haw. 234, 237, 971 P.2d 707 (1999); <em>Vickers </em>v. <em>Wichita State University, </em>213 Kan. 614, 618, 518 P.2d 512 (1974) (approving of reliance on experience of others in same line of business). While the lack of this evidence is not, by itself, fatal, it would have \u201cremove[d] the assessment of damages from the realm of speculation [by providing] . . . objective verifiable facts that bear a logical relationship to projected future profitability.\u201d <em>Beverly Hills Concepts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Schatz &amp; Schatz, Ribicoff &amp; Kotkin, </em>supra, 76.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Rather than testify about past profits the plaintiff or other companies actually had made under prior contracts, Terry merely testified that she always added 8 to 10 percent profit to her expenses to determine <em>the bid amount, </em>and that she \u201cwould have hoped for\u201d the same amount for the contract with the defendant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>testimony is speculative on a number of different levels. First, Terry failed to present any evidence as to what profit expectation she in fact had added to prior bids, and merely claimed that she usually added a profit of 8 to 10 percent. Second, Terry failed to testify about profits the plaintiff <em>actually had earned </em>on those prior contracts, and limited her testimony to what she had included in the bid. While the former would have \u201cremove [d] the assessment of damages from the realm of speculation\u201d; <em>Beverly Hills Concepts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Schatz &amp; Schatz, Ribicoff &amp; Kotkin, </em>supra, 247 Conn. 76; the latter attempts to prove speculative future profit levels through mere speculation about past bid calculations. Third, the speculative nature of Terry\u2019s testimony was compounded by the fact that she was unable to testify accurately as to whether she added in an 8 percent profit projection, a 10 percent profit projection, or some other number to the bid submitted to the defendant. Instead, Terry merely testified that it was her normal practice to add an 8 to 10 percent profit level to bids. Given that the total bid amount was almost $6 million, that is a difference between a $480,000 profit at 8 percent, and a $600,000 profit at 10 percent, being factored into the bid. Put another way, the plaintiffs bid price of $5,862,097 was arrived at either by: (1) adding up the total costs for providing the services under the contract and adding an 8 percent profit; or (2) adding up the total costs for providing the services under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>contract and adding a 10 percent profit.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It simply cannot be true, as the majority seems to accept, that Terry added up her costs and added in an expected profit of 8 to 10 percent. To reach the fixed price eventually submitted with the bid, Terry had to add in one or the other, not both.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">The majority places great emphasis on the fact that Terry \u201chad approximately thirty years of experience in the school transportation industry and had been running her own school transportation company since 1984.\u201d On the basis of this experience, the majority states that \u201cthe jury reasonably could have concluded that Terry\u2019s anticipated profit of between 8 and 10 percent was appropriate.\u201d Although I agree that Terry, as well as the plaintiff, had substantial experience in the busing industry, I would conclude that this counsels <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>strongly in favor of upholding the trial court\u2019s determination that the plaintiff had not proved lost profits to a reasonable certainty. Put another way, despite having over thirty years of experience in the busing industry, having calculated and submitted numerous bids for busing contracts, having performed busing services pursuant to contracts with several cities and towns, and presumably having earned a sufficient profit to remain in business for thirty years, Terry failed to testify about any profits the plaintiff actually had made over that time. To the contrary, she testified only that she normally added an 8 to 10 percent profit level <em>to the bid. </em>I cannot conclude, given her extensive experience in the business and all of the past financial information at the plaintiffs disposal, that the trial court abused its discretion by determining that Terry\u2019s testimony failed to prove damages to a reasonable certainty.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">As the majority notes, \u201cthis court has recognized that, \u2018[t]he vagaries of the marketplace usually deny us sure knowledge of what [the] plaintiffs situation would have been in the absence of the defendant\u2019s antitrust violation,\u2019 \u201d and therefore a plaintiff in a typical antitrust case is subject to a \u201c \u2018lesser burden of [proof] . . . .\u2019\u201d This case is not a typical antitrust case, however, as the plaintiffs situation was necessarily limited to an identifiable amount based on the figures set forth in the bid submitted to the defendant. As the trial court stated: \u201c[T]his is not a case where the requirements of proof of lost profits should be relaxed because of the intricacies of proof presented by a complex antitrust case. The contract price was known, all that was needed was information about expenses which Terry at one time admitted she had calculated. This rather is a situation where evidence that could have been preserved and presented was not offered in court and, without that evidence, there can be no reasonable basis for the jury\u2019s determination of lost profits.\u201d See also <em>Doeltz </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number><em>Longshore, Inc., </em>126 Conn. 597, 601, 13 A.2d 505 (1940) (\u201c[w]hile the modem tendency is toward greater liberality in the requirements [for demonstrating lost profits] ... it is the unvarying rule that evidence of such certainty as the nature of the case permits should be produced\u201d [citation omitted]). The present case does not involve a scenario where the defendant\u2019s actions prevented an opportunity for limitless business growth, and the concomitant opportunity for the limitless accumulation of profits. To the contrary, the business activity of the plaintiff in the present case, and the concomitant opportunity to accumulate profits, was limited to the terms specified in the bid. The nature of the present case therefore required the plaintiff to present more certain evidence of lost profits than that provided by Terry\u2019s testimony. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">At the completion of Terry\u2019s testimony, the defendant moved to strike her testimony on the ground that she did not have the knowledge upon which to base an estimate of the profit built into the bid. Although the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion, it nevertheless warned counsel for the plaintiff that, \u201cunless there is more offered in the way of facts and figures that [Terry] relied on, I may be in a position where I grant a motion for a directed verdict . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Despite this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>cautionary statement from the trial court, the plaintiff failed to present any additional evidence concerning the preparation of the bid and Terry\u2019s profit estimates. Accordingly, the trial court found that Terry\u2019s testimony that, in her experience, she normally factored an 8 to 10 percent profit into a bid, without more, did not prove the plaintiffs lost profits under the proposed contract to a reasonable certainty. See <em>Beverly Hills Concepts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Schatz &amp; Schatz, Ribicoff &amp; Kotkin, </em>supra, 247 Conn. 72 (trial court abused discretion in awarding damages for lost profits where plaintiff did not prove lost profit damages to reasonable certainty). On the record before us, considering the factors this court outlined in <em>Beverly Hills Concepts, Inc.,</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and indulging every reasonable presumption in favor of the trial court\u2019s action; <em>Howard </em>v. <em>MacDonald, </em>supra, 270 Conn. 127; I would conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting the defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">In reaching this conclusion, I am guided by this court\u2019s decision in <em>Doeltz </em>v. <em>Longshore, Inc., </em>supra, 126 Conn. 597. In <em>Doeltz, </em>the plaintiff had leased a refreshment concession from the defendant for $500 plus 5 percent of the gross receipts for the summer season. Id., 598. Under the terms of the lease, the defendant was to equip the bar and permit the plaintiff to have the exclusive sales of beverages and food on the defendant\u2019s premises. Id. Despite the terms of the lease, the plaintiff alleged that the bar was not equipped and ready for him on the agreed date, and that the defendant subsequently interfered with the operation of the plaintiffs business. Id., 598-99. The plaintiff brought an action against the defendant seeking, inter alia, an award of lost profits. Id., 599. In support of his claim for lost profits, the plaintiff testified that he \u201cusually figure[d] on the liquor 100 percent [profit] and [on the] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>food 50 percent [profit].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. On the basis of those usual profit margins, the plaintiff testified that he averaged a 75 percent profit, and, therefore, if he lost $3750 in business due to the defendant\u2019s interference, then his lost profits were $2500.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Id. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the amount $2500, and the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s subsequent motion to set aside the verdict. Id. On appeal, this court reversed the judgment of the trial court, concluding that the \u201cunsatisfactory and conjectural character [of the plaintiffs evidence] is plain.\u201d Id., 601. In so concluding, this court noted, inter alia, that \u201cno data whatever as to his costs, other than rent, were shown nor was there any testimony to the effect that such data were not available.\u201d Id. Moreover, the court noted that the plaintiffs estimation of a 75 percent profit level \u201cwas a pure guess and was wholly unsupported as to either the amount of business lost or the profit to be expected.\u201d Id., 602.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">The facts of <em>Doeltz </em>and the present case are similar in several important respects. First, both the plaintiffs testimony in <em>Doeltz </em>and Terry\u2019s testimony in the present case were predicated upon unsupported claims of \u201cusual\u201d profit margins. Just as there was no evidence in <em>Doeltz </em>to support the claimed average of 75 percent profits, there was no evidence in the present case to support the claimed level of 8 to 10 percent profit. Moreover, the plaintiffs testimony in <em>Doeltz </em>contained speculation about usual profits <em>earned </em>in his business. Terry\u2019s testimony in the present case, however, concerned speculative profit levels set forth in a bid, rather than speculation over past profits actually earned. If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>the testimony in <em>Doeltz </em>was insufficient because it was speculative, then surely Terry\u2019s testimony was insufficient as well. Second, in both cases, no data whatsoever was presented by the plaintiff as to relevant costs, nor was there testimony in either case that this data was unavailable. Therefore, I would conclude in the present case, just as this court concluded in <em>Doeltz, </em>that the \u201cunsatisfactory and conjectural character [of Terry\u2019s testimony] is plain.\u201d Id., 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">This conclusion is buttressed by an examination of other cases in which this court has addressed awards for lost profits. In those cases where the award was affirmed, the plaintiff had presented specific evidence, beyond mere speculation, which supported the award. See, e.g., <em>Westport Taxi Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Westport Transit District, </em>235 Conn. 1, 29, 664 A.2d 719 (1995) (affirming award of lost profits where \u201ctrial court made meticulous findings of fact and clearly detailed its calculations regarding the plaintiffs damages\u201d based on, inter alia, specific figures in evidence regarding average taxi fares, yearly rides and commissioner\u2019s guidelines for fair rate of return);<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Burr v. Lichtenheim, </em>190 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>351, 361, 460 A.2d 1290 (1983) (affirming award of lost profits where plaintiff \u201cintroduced, as an exhibit, a contract for sale of that property for $25,000 [that was lost by the plaintiff] . . . [and] expert testimony that he might reasonably have expected to make a profit of $23,000 to $25,000 had he been able to build [on a separate piece of land] in 1976\u201d); <em>Humphrys </em>v. <em>Beach, </em>149 Conn. 14, 20, 175 A.2d 363 (1961) (award of $3500 for lost profits over one year and three months had sufficient support in record, namely, \u201cevidence that the [plaintiffs] profit in 1955 was $3500, and that it was about half of that amount during the first half of 1956\u201d); <em>Kay Petroleum Corp. </em>v. <em>Piergrossi, </em>supra, 137 Conn. 624 (award of $3025 for lost profits over three years and nine months had sufficient support in record, namely, evidence that plaintiff had profit of $806.57 in prior year); <em>Kastner </em>v. <em>Beacon Oil Co., </em>114 Conn. 190, 194, 158 A. 214 (1932) (award for lost profits reasonably supported by testimony from owner that, inter alia, in 1928, net profit was about $3400, and in 1929, gross profit was $3200, and net profit was something less due to family illness).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Moreover, in other cases this court has found that awards for lost profits were not proved to a reasonable certainty, despite the fact that the plaintiff had presented more significant evidence than was presented by the plaintiff in the present case. See, e.g., <em>Beverly Hills Concepts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Schatz &amp; Schatz, Ribicoff &amp; Kotkin, </em>supra, 247 Conn. 68 (vacating trial court\u2019s award of $15.9 million in lost profits for prospective period of twelve years because not proved to reasonable certainty where testimony from plaintiffs expert on future sales <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>of franchises too speculative to support award); <em>Gargano </em>v. <em>Heyman, </em>203 Conn. 616, 620, 525 A.2d 1343 (1987) (despite fact that \u201c[t]o support his claim for damages, the plaintiff offered his 1983 and 1984 federal income tax returns and testimony concerning an offer to purchase his business,\u201d this court affirmed state trial referee\u2019s finding that plaintiff had failed to prove lost profits to reasonable certainty); <em>West Haven Sound Development Corp. </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>201 Conn. 305, 324-27, 514 A.2d 734 (1986) (despite fact that expert was certified public accountant, university professor and had coauthored college textbook on securities analysis and business valuation, award based on present value of future profits vacated because expert used faulty calculations and assumptions;); <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Indusco Management Corp., </em>164 Conn. 262, 275-76, 320 A.2d 811 (1973) (evidence that similar business had grossed \u201c$175,000 and had net profit of 12 percent of gross receipts\u201d insufficient to support $21,000 award for lost profits because plaintiff had more expenses to subtract from gross revenue than other business had).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">This court has stated that \u201c[a] damage theory may be based on assumptions so long as the assumptions are reasonable in light of the record evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Beverly Hills Concepts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Schatz &amp; Schatz, Ribicoff &amp; Kotkin, </em>supra, 247 Conn. 70.1 continue to adhere to the sentiments expressed in that statement. As the foregoing discussion illustrates, however, this court consistently has required a higher level of \u201crecord evidence\u201d to support an award for lost profits than that which was submitted in the present case. The majority\u2019s conclusion therefore represents a significant departure from our prior cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">I recognize that my conclusion would mean that the defendant, whose antitrust violations caused the plaintiffs harm, would escape virtually unscathed. Although troubling, \u201c[t]his outcome is a direct result of the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>tiff\u2019s choice of evidence.\u201d Id., 78. As the trial court aptly noted, \u201c[i]f the expense figures had been preserved and presented at trial, it would have been possible for the jury to have a nonspeculative basis to determine lost profits. . . . [Wjithout that evidence, there can be no reasonable basis for the jury\u2019s determination of lost profits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">I therefore respectfully dissent, and would affirm the judgment of the trial court granting the defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict on the ground that the plaintiff failed to prove lost profits to a reasonable certainty.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b670-8\"> I join fully in the reasoning and conclusion set forth in part I of the majority opinion. I agree with the outcome in part III of the majority opinion, yet I would reach that result based on my conclusion that the plaintiff, Cheryl Terry Enterprises, Ltd., had failed to present an adequate record for review. With regard to part IV of the majority opinion, I agree that \u201cthe trial court properly exercised its discretion in denying the relief requested.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b671-6\"> This court has articulated a number of factors to be taken into account when evaluating whether a plaintiff has proved lost profits to a reasonable certainty. Those factors include: a plaintiffs prior experience in the same business; the plaintiffs experience in the same enterprise subsequent to the interference; the experience of the plaintiff and that of third parties in a similar business when dealing with a new business; the average experience of participants in the same line of business as the injured party; and prelitigation projections. <em>Beverly Hills Concepts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Schatz &amp; Schatz, Ribicoff &amp; Kotkin, </em>supra, 247 Conn. 72-74. We have emphasized, however, that \u201c[t]he underlying requirement for each of these types of evidence is a substantial similarity between the facts forming the basis of the profit projections and the business opportunity that was destroyed.\u201d Id., 74.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b673-7\"> In testifying generally about the bid preparation process, Terry stated: \u201cYou can\u2019t determine your price per bus until you have all [of your] costs factored in. This is how you come out with your cost per bus or cost per van when you have your driver pay scale and all of the above that I just <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>mentioned. And then you come out with the total price. <em>Then you add your profit, which is usually between\u2014I usually add 8 to 10 percent, hoping for the higher, </em>but I don\u2019t know until after that first year.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">With regard to the bid submitted to the defendant, the following colloquy occurred during the plaintiffs direct examination of Terry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-7\">\u201cQ. And what was the net present value of the five years in the [bid submitted to the defendant]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-8\">\u201cA. $5,862,097.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-9\">\u201cQ. And of that, what was your anticipated profit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-10\">\u201cA. It would have been about 8 to 10 percent that I would have hoped for.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b675-6\"><em> </em>With regard to how she calculated the bid submitted to the defendant, Terry testified: \u201cI took my costs, as I always do, and add[ed] a profit, and that is all I can tell you because that is the way you do it.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b675-9\"> The majority claims that \u201cthe fact that the plaintiffs anticipated profit had ranged from 8 to 10 percent is not fatal to its claim for lost profits; that range of anticipated profit was sufficiently restrictive to permit the jury to determine the damages with reasonable certainty.\u201d This statement misses the point. The fact that the plaintiff may have acjjusted its anticipated profit between 8 and 10 percent for varying bids it had made in the past is not relevant. What is relevant to the present case, however, is the profit level the plaintiff factored into the <em>specific bid </em>submitted to the defendant. Terry was unable to testily to that amount, and could only testily that in the past it had ranged from 8 to 10 percent. Indeed, the fact that Terry testified that it ranged from 8 to 10 percent indicates that it was always a firm number, and not a range, that she factored into a particular contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-10\">The record further reveals that the plaintiff had never provided busing services to the defendant before, and its prior contracts were with towns in the southeastern portion of Connecticut. The majority concludes that the fact that the plaintiff submitted the lowest bid indicates that \u201cthe plaintiffs bid was competitive in the industry.\u201d Although that may be true, it also may be true that the fact that the plaintiff submitted the lowest bid is evidence that the plaintiff reduced its normal profit level in order to win this contract, and expand its business into the central portion of the state. In sum, the fact that the plaintiff submitted the lowest bid has no bearing on a determination as to what the plaintiffs profit would have been if it had been awarded the contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b677-6\"> Specifically, the trial court stated: \u201cMy difficulty now is in [granting] a motion to strike if the trial isn\u2019t over, so I can\u2019t say that the testimony is not relevant, you know, as such. But I am telling you, counsel, in fairness to you, that unless it is tied up, I am going to have a problem, because one of the aspects of this case is a request for an injunction, and the other aspect of this case is a request for damages. . . . The law permits speculation, but in certain respects on future earnings, and the cases are pretty liberal. Like a claim for future earnings, but there has to be some foundational requirement. And [Terry] didn\u2019t remember any costs of this contract, she didn\u2019t remember maintenance, facilities, she had no access to these figures. And yet she says that she relies on these figures in determining what her bid price was and what her rate of profit is. . . . I can\u2019t say that her testimony was completely irrelevant, but I am telling you, counsel, unless there is more offered in the way of facts and figures that [Terry] relied on, I may be in a position where I grant a motion for a directed verdict .... And in fairness to you, I will allow you to recall her if she has figures.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b678-6\"> See footnote 2 of this concurring and dissenting opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b679-5\"> Although $2500 is slightly less than 75 percent profit of $3750 in sales, the plaintiff stated that the lower amount was applicable because \u201c[s]ometimes you give something away free of charge, and so forth, you know, the kids come in for ice cream cones and sometimes you give a drink away on the house.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Doeltz </em>v. <em>Longshore, Inc., </em>supra, 126 Conn. 599.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b680-6\"> The majority\u2019s reliance on <em>Westport Taxi Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Westport Transit District, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 1, in support of its conclusion is misplaced. To begin with, much of the discussion the majority cites to from <em>Westport Taxi Service, Inc., </em>is contained in the part of that opinion addressing the defendant\u2019s challenge to the trial court\u2019s award of $150,000 for the loss of the business, and not the part of that opinion addressing the defendant\u2019s challenge to an award of $12,144 in lost profits. See id., 32-35. Second, within that part of <em>Westport Taxi Service, Inc., </em>addressing the award for lost profits, this court noted that the trial court, as the trier of fact in that case, had \u201csufficient evidence\u201d from which to make \u201creasonable assumptions\u201d concerning lost profits. Id., 32. That sufficient evidence included, inter alia, evidence that the plaintiff collected a $1.80 average fare, that the state commission would have approved a fare increase to the rate of $2.70, that surrounding communities were charging an average fare of $2.70, and that the commission considered a reasonable rate of return to be a ratio of operating costs to gross revenue of between 85 and 95 percent. Id., 30-31. That level of evidence simply was not presented by Terry in the present case. Thus, while the majority is correct that the owner in <em>Westport Taxi Service, Inc., </em>properly was allowed to testily that a fair rate of return on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>taxi business would be 10 to 12 percent, the trial court \u201capplied this rate of return to <em>its own calcMlations of the plaintiffs lost profits </em>and concluded that the plaintiffs value was $150,000.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 34. Put another way, the award for lost value of business was based on calculations made from the \u201csufficient evidence\u201d of lost profits presented by the plaintiff; id., 32; evidence that is completely absent in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
