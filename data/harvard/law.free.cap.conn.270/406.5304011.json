On February 15,2002, the trial court granted the commissioner\u2019s petition to terminate the respondent\u2019s parental rights with respect to her minor child, Jeisean M. On March 14, 2002, the respondent filed an application for a waiver of fees, costs, security and expenses of appeal pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 63-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>6.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In addition, she sought, at the state\u2019s expense, the appointment of counsel to prosecute her appeal. On May 3, 2003, the court found that the respondent was indigent but denied her application because her proposed appeal lacked merit. She then filed with the Appellate Court a motion for review of that denial. The Appellate Court, en banc, granted the respondent\u2019s motion for review, reversed the trial court\u2019s denial of her application for a waiver of fees, costs and expenses and remanded the matter to the trial court with direction to grant the respondent\u2019s application for a waiver of fees, costs and expenses to appeal. The trial court granted the respondent\u2019s waiver application, and she filed an appeal from the trial court\u2019s judgment terminat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>ing her parental rights. The commissioner filed a cross appeal challenging the trial court\u2019s granting of the respondent\u2019s waiver application. Thereafter, the Appellate Court, suo motu, dismissed the commissioner\u2019s cross appeal. We then granted the commissioner\u2019s petition for certification, limited to the following issue: \u201cWhether in dismissing the cross appeal of the commissioner of children and families, the Appellate Court properly construed Practice Book \u00a7 63-6 to preclude a trial court from considering the merits of a proposed appeal in ruling on an application for waiver of the fees, costs and expenses of an appeal?\u201d <em>In re Jeisean M., </em>263 Conn. 925,823 A.2d 1215 (2003). We also transferred the respondent\u2019s appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">After reviewing the record on appeal and considering the briefs and oral arguments of the parties, we have determined that the appeal in this case should be dismissed on the ground that certification was granted improvidently.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">The commissioner\u2019s appeal to this court is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b425-11\"> A judgment of default was rendered against tire respondent father, and he has not appealed.

The application must be under oath and recite, or it must be accompanied by an affidavit reciting, the grounds upon which the applicant proposes to appeal and the facts concerning the applicant\u2019s financial status.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-7\">\u201cThe judicial authority shall assign the request for waiver of fees, costs and expenses for a hearing within twenty days of its filing and shall act promptly on the application following the hearing. Where a request arises out of a habeas corpus proceeding, the request shall be handled pursuant to Section 63-7.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-8\">\u201cIf the court is satisfied that the applicant is indigent and entitled to an appeal because of a statutory or constitutional right to court appointed counsel or allowing an indigent party to appeal without payment of fees, costs and expenses, the court may (1) waive payment by the applicant of fees specified by statute and of taxable costs, and waive the requirement of Section 63-5 concerning the furnishing of security for costs upon appeal, and (2) order that the necessary expenses of prosecuting the appeal be paid by the state. Before incurring any expense in excess of $100, including the expense of obtaining a transcript of the necessary proceedings or testimony, counsel for the applicant shall obtain the permission of the judge who presided at the applicant\u2019s trial. The judge shall authorize a transcript at state expense only of the portions of testimony or proceedings which may be pertinent to the issues on appeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-9\">\u201cThe sole remedy of any party desiring the court to review an order concerning the waiver of fees, costs and security shall be by motion for review under Section 66-6.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b427-13\"> We addressed the respondent mother\u2019s appeal in the companion case of <em>In re Jeisean M., </em>270 Conn. 382, 852 A.2d 643 (2004), which we released on the same date as this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
