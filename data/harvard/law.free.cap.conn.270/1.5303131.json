The named defendant,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the University of Connecticut, argues that the decision of the review board was proper, and further argues that any other outcome would result in a double recovery for the plaintiff.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We conclude that, because the State Employees Retirement Act, codified in chapter 66 of the General Statutes,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> already provides for a statutory offset of certain workers\u2019 compensation benefits; see General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 5-169 (g) and 5-192p (d); see footnotes 23 and 24 of this opinion; in determining the plaintiffs \u00a7 31-308a benefit calculation, the commissioner should not have considered any amounts received as part of her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>state disability retirement benefits. Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the review board.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-5\">The record reveals the following undisputed facts and procedural history. The plaintiff was employed by the state, at the University of Connecticut, on April 17, 1990, when she suffered a compensable injury that left her with a 25 percent permanent partial disability of her back. Her injury arose out of and during the coruse of her employment. Commencing February 7,1995, she was awarded 130 weeks of permanent partial disability benefits pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 31-308, as amended by Public Acts 1989, No. 89-36,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which entitles an employee who sustains a permanent disability to a specified body part to payment of a fixed amount of benefits. After her specific indemnity benefits expired, the plaintiff was awarded $150 per week <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>in benefits from August 6, 1997, through May 5, 2001, pursuant to \u00a7 31-308a, which permits the commissioner, on a discretionary basis, to grant additional benefits \u201cequal to two-thirds of the difference between the wages currently earned by an employee in a position comparable to the position held by such injured employee prior to his injury and the weekly amount which such employee will probably be able to earn thereafter . . . .\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 31-308a.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The parties stipulated that a person engaged in the plaintiffs former position earned $31,325 annually at the time of the commissioner\u2019s decision, a weekly average of $602.40. The most recent medical evidence available indicated that the plaintiffs injury prevented her from working more than four to six hours at a time. The plaintiffs last position paid $8.50 an hour, which would entitle her to gross earnings of $255 per week if she worked thirty hours per week. On the basis of these facts, the commissioner determined that the wage differential between the plaintiffs actual earning capacity and the salary paid for her preinjury position was $347.40 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">The plaintiff retired from state service in 1996 and began receiving service-connected disability retirement benefits from the state amounting to $1396.72 per month, or $324.82 per week. In proceedings before the commissioner, the defendant argued that the plaintiffs disability retirement pension should be considered in determining her \u00a7 31-308a benefit and that such benefit should be reduced accordingly. The commissioner agreed, and, as a result of the offset of her disability retirement benefits against her postinjuiy earning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>capacity, the commissioner determined that the plaintiff received $22.58 per week less than the amount currently being earned by employees in her former position, and subsequently awarded \u00a7 31-308a benefits in the amount of $15.05 per week for fifty-two weeks commencing May 6, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">The plaintiff filed a petition for review on December 6,2001, disagreeing with the commissioner\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 31-308a and the commissioner\u2019s subsequent calculation of her benefits. In an opinion issued February 13, 2003, the review board rejected the plaintiffs contentions, determining that the offset of disability retirement benefits was appropriate under its prior ruling in <em>Iannarone </em>v. <em>Dept. of Mental Retardation, </em>4138 CRB-7-99-10 (June 15, 2001), in which the review board held that a state disability pension should be included in the amount a claimant is \u201c \u2018able to earn\u2019 \u201d for purposes of \u00a7 31-308a. Quoting <em>Iannarone, </em>the review board noted that \u201c \u2018the [wage replacement] benefits sought ... by the claimant are meant to replenish a former income source . . . that is already being replenished in part by a pension from that same entity.\u2019 \u201d In further support of its decision, the review board stated that General Statutes \u00a7 31-314<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> mandates such an offset because, \u201c\u00a7 31-314 requires that the fixing of compensation under [c]hapter 568 duly allow[s] for any sum that an employer has paid to an injured employee on account of her injury.\u201d Finally, the review board rejected the plaintiffs claim that her state disability retirement benefits were in the nature of \u201cfringe benefits\u201d under General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 31-284b,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> which requires cov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>ered employers to maintain \u201cequivalent insurance coverage or welfare fund payments or contributions while the employee is eligible to receive or is receiving workers\u2019 compensation . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">On appeal, the plaintiff claims that benefits received under the state disability retirement plan should not be considered part of \u201cthe weekly amount which such employee will probably be able to earn thereafter\u201d under \u00a7 31-308a. Additionally, the plaintiff argues that her retirement benefits should not be credited as an \u201cadvance\u201d by her employer pursuant to \u00a7 31-314. The plaintiff also claims that her receipt of state disability retirement benefits are in the nature of a \u201cfringe benefit\u201d and are protected by \u00a7 31-284b. Lastly, the plaintiff contends that the state disability retirement statutory scheme requires such benefits to be offset by the receipt of certain workers\u2019 compensation benefits, not the other way around.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-7\">\u201cAs a threshold matter, we set forth the standard of review applicable to workers\u2019 compensation appeals. ... It is well established that [a]lthough not dispositive, we accord great weight to the construction given to the workers\u2019 compensation statutes by the commissioner and [the review] board.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Kuehl </em>v. <em>Z-Loda Systems Engineering, Inc., </em>265 Conn. 525, 532, 829 A.2d 818 (2003). \u201cIt is well settled that we do not defer to the [review] board\u2019s construction of a statute\u2014a question of law\u2014when, as in the present case, the provisions at issue previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>have not been subjected to judicial scrutiny or when the [review] board\u2019s interpretation has not been time tested.\u201d <em>Rayhall </em>v. <em>Akim Co., </em>263 Conn. 328, 354, 819 A.2d 803 (2003). Accordingly, because this issue is one of first impression for our courts, our review is plenary.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">\u201cWe begin with our well established principles of statutory interpretation in analyzing the [plaintiffs] claim. Our legislature recently has enacted No. 03-154, \u00a7 1, of the 2003 Public Acts, which provides: \u2018The meaning of a statute shall, in the first instance, be ascertained from the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\u2019 In the present case, the relevant statutory text and the relationship of that text to other statutes do. not reveal a meaning that is plain and unambiguous.\u201d <em>Bergeson </em>v. <em>New London, </em>269 Conn. 763, 769-70, 850 A.2d 184 (2004). Accordingly, in ascertaining the meaning of \u00a7 31-308a, we will \u201clook to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation . . . .\u201d <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Kramer, </em>267 Conn. 336, 343, 838 A.2d 170 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">Because \u201c[i]n determining the meaning of a statute ... we look not only at the provision at issue, but also to the broader statutory scheme to ensure coherency of our construction\u201d; <em>Schiano </em>v. <em>Bliss Exterminating Co., </em>260 Conn. 21, 42, 792 A.2d 835 (2002); we will begin with a basic overview of the workers\u2019 compensation statutory scheme. \u201cBenefits available under the [Workers\u2019 Compensation Act] serve the dual function of compensating for the disability arising from the injury and for the loss of earning power resulting from that injury. . . . Compensation for the disability takes the form of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>payment of medical expenses . . . and specific indemnity awards, which compensate the injured employee for the lifetime handicap that results from the permanent loss of, or loss of use of, a scheduled body part. . . . [S]ee General Statutes \u00a7 31-308 (b) (loss of or loss of use of member) and (d) (scarring); see also 4 A. Larson &amp; L. Larson, Workers\u2019 Compensation Law (2002) \u00a7 80.04, p. 80-12 ([permanent partial schedule awards are based on medical condition after maximum improvement has been reached and ignore wage loss entirely). . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">\u201cCompensation for loss of earning power takes the form of partial or total incapacity benefits. . . . Incapacity . . . means incapacity to work, as distinguished from the loss or loss of use of a member of the body. . . . Partial incapacity benefits are available when the employee is able to perform some employment, but [is] unable fully to perform his or her customary work .... Accordingly, partial incapacity benefits are available when an actual wage loss has resulted from the injury, providing a wage supplement for the difference between the wages the worker would have earned, but for the injury, and the wages the worker currently is able to earn. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-308 (a) and 31-308a (a) . . . . The duration of partial incapacity benefits is limited by statute. . . . Conversely . . . [t]otai incapacity benefits, unlike partial incapacity benefits, are unrestricted as to duration.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rayhall </em>v. <em>Akim, Co., </em>supra, 263 Conn. 349-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">In the present case, when the plaintiff sustained her injury, she was awarded 130 weeks of permanent partial disability benefits pursuant to \u00a7 31-308. After her \u00a7 31-308 benefits had been exhausted, the plaintiff requested additional discretionary benefits pursuant to \u00a7 31-308a. The version of \u00a7 31-308a in effect at the time of the plaintiffs injury provided: \u201cIn addition to the compensa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>tion benefits provided by section 31-308 for specific loss of a member or use of the function of a member of the body . . . the commissioner, after such payments . . . have been paid for the period set forth . . . may award additional compensation benefits for such partial permanent disability equal to two-thirds of the difference between the wages currently earned by an employee in a position comparable to the position held by such injured employee prior to his injury and the weekly amount which such employee will probably be able to earn thereafter, to be determined by the commissioner based upon the nature and extent of the injury, the training, education and experience of the employee, the availability of work for persons with such physical condition and at the employee\u2019s age, but not more than the maximum provided in section 31-309. . . . The duration of such additional compensation shall be determined upon a similar basis by the commissioner.\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 31-308a. The fundamental issue in this appeal is whether the disability retirement benefits payable under the State Employees Retirement Act should be treated as part of the \u201cweekly amount which [an] employee will probably be able to earn thereafter\u201d by a commissioner when he or she is considering the amount of additional benefits to award under \u00a7 31-308a. Although the plaintiffs arguments on these matters are informative, and we will address them accordingly, we note that, it is because the state disability retirement statutes expressly mandate the offset of certain types of workers\u2019 compensation benefits; see General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 5-169 (g) and 5-192p (d); see footnotes 23 and 24 of this opinion; that we are convinced ultimately of the wisdom of the plaintiffs position.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">\u201cAs with all issues of statutory inteipretation, we look first to the language of the statute.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Spears </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>263 Conn. 22, 28-29, 818 A.2d 37 (2003). In the present case, the relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>statutory language provides that benefits are \u201cto be determined . . . based upon the nature and extent of the injury, the training, education and experience of the employee, [and] the availability of work for persons with such physical condition and at the employee\u2019s age . . . .\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 31-308a. A fundamental rule of statutory construction dictates that, ordinarily, where the legislature has mandated specific factors to be taken into consideration in reaching a result, other factors cannot be considered. <em>State </em>v. <em>Vickers, </em>260 Conn. 219, 225, 796 A.2d 502 (2002) (\u201c[w]e have stated that [u]nless there is evidence to the contrary, statutory itemization indicates that the legislature intended [a] list to be exclusive\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). In the present case, because \u00a7 31-308a expressly enumerates several factors for the commissioner to consider, none of which involves external economic concerns, but instead reflect on a particular claimant\u2019s injury and subsequent ability to work, the plaintiff argues that a commissioner\u2019s award is confined to the consideration of such factors. The defendant responds by pointing out that such benefits are purely discretionary; see General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 31-308a (\u201cthe commissioner . . . <em>may </em>award additional compensation benefits\u201d [emphasis added]); and therefore, a commissioner has very broad discretion in determining a \u00a7 31-308a award, and is not confined solely to the enumerated factors set forth in the statute. As both the plaintiff and the defendant are basically correct, insofar as they rely on common principles, we must look beyond such generalized arguments in order fully to determine this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">The plaintiff next argues that the review board\u2019s decision in <em>Iannarone </em>v. <em>Dept. of Mental Retardation, </em>supra, 4138 CRB-7-99-10, and its decision in this case, improperly relied on a particular definition of the word \u201cearnings\u201d that distorts the statutory language. First, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>plaintiff argues that the statutory phrase, \u201cthe weekly amount which such employee will probably be able to earn thereafter\u201d; General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 31-308a; concerns a claimant\u2019s \u201c \u2018ability to earn\u2019 \u201d rather than a claimant\u2019s \u201c \u2018earnings.\u2019 \u201d In Iannarone, the review board construed the state disability retirement benefits a claimant was receiving as \u201cearnings,\u201d in part, by relying on a definition of that term, contained in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th Ed. 1979), as \u201cthe gains of a person derived from his services [or] labor without the aid of capital; money or property gained or merited by labor, service, or the performance of something.\u201d <em>Iannarone </em>v. <em>Dept. of Mental Retardation, </em>supra, pp. 4-5. The review board applied a similar definition in this case. The plaintiff contends, however, that the state disability retirement benefits she receives are not payable to her as a result of any current services, labor or performance, but on account of her past services and as a retirement benefit, and therefore, the benefits are not \u201cearnings.\u201d Instead, the plaintiff contends that these benefits are on a par with Social Security or payments from a private disability insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">Moreover, the plaintiff points out that the term \u201cearning capacity\u201d is also defined in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990) as \u201cthe capability of [a] worker to sell his labor or services in any market reasonably accessible to him, taking into consideration his general physical functional impairment resulting from his accident, any previous disability, his occupation, age at time of injury, nature of injury and his wages prior to and after the injury . . . .\u201d The plaintiff thus contends that her \u201cability to earn\u201d does not generate her state disability retirement benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">In addition, the plaintiff points us. to definitions of \u201cable\u201d and \u201cearn\u201d to further support her position. She points out that we previously have defined the term earn as \u201cto acquire by labor, service, or performance\u201d; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>(internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Hartford Electric Light Co. </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>131 Conn. 1, 5, 37 A.2d 361 (1944); and that the Random House Dictionary of the English Language (2d Ed. 1987) defines \u201cable\u201d as \u201chaving necessary power, skill, resources or qualifications . . . .\u201d The plaintiff argues that these definitions also demonstrate why state disability retirement benefits should not be considered under \u00a7 31-308a, as such benefits are not acquired by labor, services or performance rendered after injury. In fact, the plaintiff argues, a worker who is disabled is \u201c \u2018unable\u2019 \u201d rather than \u201c \u2018able\u2019 \u201d to earn, to the extent of their disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">The plaintiff also draws our attention to the term \u201cthereafter\u201d in the statute, and suggests that the term be given its proper import. The plaintiff argues that \u00a7 31-308a specifically deals with the ability to earn <em>after </em>sustaining an injury, because the term \u201cthereafter\u201d obviously refers to the time after the claimant\u2019s injury. According to the plaintiff, state disability retirement benefits cannot be considered part of what a worker is \u201cable to earn thereafter\u201d; General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 31-308a; i.e., postinjury, because such benefits are not based upon any activity of the claimant <em>after </em>his or her injury, but are premised exclusively upon services performed <em>prior </em>to the injury, as well as the claimant\u2019s age.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 5-169 (a) <em>and </em>(b) and 5-192p (a) and (c). Therefore, the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>argues, state disability retirement benefits should not be deemed \u201cearnings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">We find these arguments by the plaintiff to be persuasive, particularly in light of the legislative history of \u00a7 31-308a. Section 31-308a was enacted in 1967 in order to provide workers\u2019 compensation commissioners the ability to grant supplemental benefits to certain claimants who required additional assistance. See Public Acts 1967, No. 842, \u00a7 25. \u201cThis section gives the commissioners authority to provide additional payments to workers who have exhausted their specific benefits, based upon the employee\u2019s injury, the availability of work for persons with such disability and the employee\u2019s training, education, experience and age. . . . [T]he present law with its specific payments for injuries does not at all times take into account that each man is a separate being and no one formula can be applied to determine what his true damages have been. This section gives the commissioners leeway to apply equity to the case . . . .\u201d 12 H.R. Proc., Pt. 9, 1967 Sess., p. 4043, remarks of Representative Paul Pawlak, Sr. Although there have been changes made to the statute since its enactment, the operative language at issue here has remained relatively inchanged.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> From comments made by the legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>ture at times in which \u00a7 31-308a was amended, it appears that in calculating benefits, the legislature was concerned, not with a broad all-inclusive definition of \u201cearnings,\u201d but intended the formula to reflect the difference between the <em>actual wages </em>the claimant had earned from his employer before his injury and the wages the claimant would be able to earn after his injury. See 13 H.R. Proc., Pt. 8, 1969 Sess., p. 4012, remarks of Representative Dominic J. Badolato (\u201c[\u00a7] 8 provides for an award of two-thirds of the difference between the pay earned after the accident over what [claimant] was earning before\u201d); Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Labor and Public Employees, Pt. 1, 1979 Sess., p. 282, remarks of Norman Zolot, counsel for the Connecticut State Labor Council, AFL-CIO (\u201c[claimant] gets [two-thirds] of the difference between his old job and his new job\u201d); Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, supra, p. 299, remarks of James Stewart (\u201ca worker would receive two-thirds of the difference between what he was receiving on the lower paying job and what he actually would have earned in the previous position\u201d); 36 H.R. Proc., Pt. 18,1993 Sess., p. 6188, remarks of Representative Mary U. Eberle (\u201cwage differential for the time [the employee] can return to work, but [the employee] can\u2019t earn as much as they did before\u201d). The legislature consistently has viewed \u00a7 31-308a as a \u201cwage differential benefit\u201d statute, and thus we view the statute\u2019s parameters as referring narrowly to \u201cwages\u201d as opposed to a more expansive term such as \u201cearnings.\u201d See 36 H.R. Proc., supra, pp. 6143, 6148, 6253, remarks of Representative Michael P. Lawlor. We find persuasive evidence to support the plaintiffs contention that \u201c[t]he additional benefits for a permanent partial disability, awarded at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>discretion of a commissioner under section 31-308a, are designed to compensate a worker for his or her lost earning capacity\u201d; Connecticut General Assembly, Legislative Program Review and Investigations Committee, Workers\u2019 Compensation in Connecticut (January 1991) p. 89; and are not meant to encompass all \u201cearnings\u201d of the claimant in its formula.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">In determining that the plaintiffs state disability retirement benefits must be included in her \u00a7 31-308a benefits calculation, the review board additionally relied on General Statutes \u00a7 31-314, which provides: \u201cIn fixing the amount of any compensation under this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>chapter, due allowance shall be made for any sum which the employer has paid to any injured employee or to his dependents on account of the injury, except such sums as the employer has expended or directed to be expended for medical, surgical or hospital service.\u201d The plaintiff argues that her state disability retirement benefits, which are maintained by the state treasurer for the state employees retirement commission, should not be considered payments \u201cby the employer,\u201d here, the named defendant, because the disability retirement benefits are paid from separate funds that are not under the control of the university.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The defendant argues that the review board\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 31-314 to bolster its decision was proper. The defendant contends that \u201c[t]he true issue is not which branch of the state pays the plaintiffs disability retirement pension but, rather, that the payment is directly based on the injury she sustained out of and in the course of her employment with the state.\u201d Additionally, the defendant argues that \u00a7 31-314 refers to any sum paid \u201con account of the injury\u201d and therefore includes the plaintiffs state disability retirement benefits because such benefits are paid \u201con account of,\u201d or <em>because of, </em>the plaintiffs injury; if the plaintiff had not sustained the injury, she would not have received such benefits. The plaintiff responds that \u00a7 31-314 is not meant to apply in her circumstance, but is meant to govern true \u201cadvance payments\u201d made by an employer to his employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">We note that there is only limited guidance available from case law regarding \u00a7 31-314. In <em>Loftus </em>v. <em>Vincent, </em>49 Conn. App. 66, 73, 713 A.2d 892 (1998), the Appellate Court referenced \u00a7 31-314 as providing statutory evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>dence that the workers\u2019 compensation scheme prohibited double recovery. The employee in <em>Loftus </em>had received workers\u2019 compensation benefits as a result of an injury he sustained at work, and was later awarded over $12,000 in back wages as a result of the employer\u2019s improper retaliatory discharge under General Statutes \u00a7 31-290a.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Id., 70-71, 72. The Appellate Court affirmed the commissioner\u2019s finding of retaliatory discharge, but reversed the award of back wages because of the commissioner\u2019s failure to offset, or make \u201cdue allowance,\u201d as required by \u00a7 31-314, for the workers\u2019 compensation payments made by the employer during the plaintiffs disability. Id., 74. It is noteworthy that in <em>Loftus, </em>the offset involved one award of chapter 568 benefits against another for the same period, whereas the present case involves the offset of sums paid by a separate agency under a distinctly different benefit system.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">Similarly, <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Berlin Construction Co., </em>93 Conn. 155, 105 A. 326 (1918), is of little help. Therein, we determined that General Statutes (1918 Rev.) \u00a7 5354 (presently \u00a7 31-314) did not authorize the crediting of payments made to injured employees, <em>before </em>then-deaths, against any compensation awarded to an employee\u2019s dependents <em>after </em>that employee\u2019s death. Id., 158-60. In reaching that conclusion, this court relied, in part, on the heading of the statute, \u201c[ajllowance for advance payments,\u201d which is the same heading as in the current version of the statute. See id., 160. \u201cThe heading of the section . . . expresses the purpose of the section: the payment upon an obligation before it was due or determined. . . . The employer may make advance payments to the employee or to the dependent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>and this section intended to give him <em>the right to credit </em>upon the amount found due the employee, <em>the advance payments made </em>by the employer . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">We note further that the legislative history of \u00a731-314 also fails to shed light on the language in question. The section was enacted as part of the original Workers\u2019 Compensation Act in 1913, and the language of the statute has remained almost unchanged since its inception. See Public Acts 1913, c. 138, \u00a7 14; Public Acts 1961, No. 491, \u00a7 37. There is no legislative history referencing any specific intent in enacting this provision. As in <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Berlin Construction Co., </em>supra, 93 Conn. 160, we look to the statute\u2019s heading for guidance. \u201cThe title and stated purpose of legislation are, while not conclusive, valuable aids to construction. <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Ludgin, </em>175 Conn. 545, 554, 400 A.2d 712 (1978) .... Where, however, the language of the act is clear and not subject to interpretation, titles are of less significance. <em>Algonquin Gas Transmission Co. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>162 Conn. 50, 55, 291 A.2d 204 (1971). Given the . . . language in the present statute, we consider the title of some assistance in our construction.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Jacquemin, </em>196 Conn. 53, 68 n.17, 491 A.2d 1043 (1985). Because \u00a7 31-314 is captioned \u201c[ajllowance for advance payments,\u201d we find persuasive the plaintiffs argument that the statutory phrase \u201cany sum . . . paid ... on account of the injury\u201d means something other than payments made <em>because of </em>the employee\u2019s injuries. Instead, we read payments made \u201con account of\u2019 to mean those payments paid on credit, or in advance of, any sums that subsequently become payable by the employer. \u201cAdvances may take several forms. The most common is the situation where an employer or insurer agrees to make some payment on a without prejudice basis pending their investigation as to whether to accept <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>the claim as compensable or not. The advance is made without admitting liability and, if the claim is later accepted as compensable, the amount advanced is set off against any amount then due on the claim.\u201d J. Asselin, Connecticut Workers\u2019 Compensation Practice Manual (1985) p. 271 (discussing \u00a7 31-314). Based on this interpretation, payments received by the plaintiff as state disability retirement benefits would not qualify as \u201cadvance payments\u201d made by the plaintiffs employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">The gravamen of the defendant\u2019s arguments, and also the review board\u2019s decision in this matter, is the contention that, because the state, as the plaintiffs former employer, is paying a disability retirement pension to the plaintiff due to a compensable injury, she already is being compensated for her loss of earnings. The defendant argues that the statutory intent behind \u00a7 31-308a is to compensate for a loss of earnings due to a compensable injury. In the present case, because the plaintiff already is being compensated by the state for the identical loss under her disability retirement pension, without an offset, the result will be a double recovery. The defendant contends that the purpose of workers\u2019 compensation benefits is to make a person whole once she has sustained an injury that arises out of and in the course of her employment, not financial gain. The plaintiff responds to this concern by arguing that there would be no double recovery in the present case because the statutory scheme explicitly requires that workers\u2019 compensation benefits be offset against state disability retirement benefits and not the other way around. In other words, when the retirement commissioner, as mandated by the legislature, deducts from the plaintiffs state disability retirement benefits the amount she receives from workers\u2019 compensation bene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>fits, there will be no double recoveiy. We agree with the plaintiff.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">The State Employees Retirement Act originated in 1919 and consisted of a single paragraph. Public Acts 1919, c. 210. Far from its humble beginning, it currently sets forth a comprehensive retirement system that provides benefits to a broad range of state employees. It is administered by the state employees retirement commission (retirement commission). See General Statutes \u00a7 5-155a. Benefits are payable from funds held in a separate retirement fund held by the state treasurer. See General Statutes \u00a7 5-156. The system is funded on an actuarial reserve basis from the state\u2019s general fund; therefore, retirement funds are not paid directly by any employing department for which an employee has worked. See General Statutes \u00a7 5-156a. There are two tiers in the state retirement plan. Tier I is set forth at General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 5-157 to 5-192d inclusive. Tier II is set forth at General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 5-192e to 5-192x inclusive. See General Statutes \u00a7 5-192f (e) and (f). Tier II primarily covers employees appointed after January 1, 1984. See General Statutes \u00a7 5-192g. There are a few <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>important distinctions between the plans,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> but for our proposes in this opinion, it is the similarities between the plans that are significant. Under either plan, a disability that prevents the employee from continuing to work in the position for which the employee was hired triggers the payment of disability retirement benefits. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 5-169 (a) and (b) and 5-192p (a). More important, both plans expressly require state disability retirement benefits to be reduced, or offset, by the employee\u2019s receipt of certain types of workers\u2019 compensation benefits. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 5-169 (g) and 5-170 (b); see also General Statutes \u00a7 5-192p (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">The review board ignored the plaintiffs arguments regarding the offsets available under the State Employees Retirement Act because the record was inadequate regarding whether the plaintiff received benefits under Tier I or Tier II, and because the availability of such offsets was not argued in much detail. Additionally, the review board noted that, \u201c[a]s a g\u00e9neral matter, [the] commission\u2019s jurisdiction is limited to claims and questions arising under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. <em>Hunnihan </em>v. <em>Mattatuck Mfg. Co., </em>243 Conn. 438, 443 [705 A.2d 1012] (1997).\u201d Therefore, there was no finding that the State Employees Retirement Act mandated an offset for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. The plaintiff claims that no such finding was required because the distinction between the two retirement tiers is insubstantial and irrelevant for purposes of this case. We agree, and note further that a commissioner <em>must </em>consider other statutory provisions when it is necessary to do so in order to appropriately dispose of the issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>before him or her. See <em>Hunnihan </em>v. <em>Mattatuck Mfg. Co., </em>supra, 243 Conn. 443 n.5 (\u201csubject matter jurisdiction of the commission . . . has encompassed the interpretation of statutory provisions codified outside the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act when such interpretations have been incidentally necessary to the resolution of a case arising under that act\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">If the plaintiff were a Tier I employee, General Statutes \u00a7 5-170 (b) would govern. Section 5-170 is entitled \u201c[ejffect of workers\u2019 compensation and disability payments,\u201d and it provides in relevant part that <em>\u201c[rjetirement income payments made to a member receiving disability payments </em>and necessary medical and hospital expenses <em>under the provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, </em>as set forth in chapter 568, <em>shall be reduced for any period for which such disability payments are being made or have been made, </em>except as provided in subsection (c) . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 5-170 (b). The statutory exceptions to the offset do not apply in the present case.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>Although the statutory precursor to the current offset provision of \u00a7 5-170 surfaced in 1961; see Public Acts 1961, No. 234, \u00a7 19; the general idea that the receipt of state retirement disability benefits should be reduced by the receipt of workers\u2019 compensation benefits appeared as early as 1941. \u201cNo person shall be paid a retirement salary for any month for which he shall receive payments resulting from a [workers\u2019] compensation or other disability claim from the state or any political subdivision thereof or from any [workers\u2019] compensation insurance carried by the state or any political subdivision thereof, except to the extent of the excess over such payment of such retirement salary which he would have been entitled to in the absence of such payments.\u201d General Statutes (Sup. 1941) \u00a7 12f. The legislature wanted to ensure that no state employee would receive double compensation payments for a loss of earnings because of the operation of two separate statutory schemes\u2014the retirement statutes and the workers\u2019 compensation statutes.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> See Conn. Joint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>Standing Committee Hearings, Public Personnel, 1951 Sess., p. 187-3 (\u201c[the statute] recognizes that it would be unjust to pay an injured employee both a retirement salaiy and, in addition, to pay compensation for loss of earnings under the Workers\u2019] Compensation Act\u201d).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>In 1983, the legislature amended \u00a7 5-170 (b) in order to adjust the statutory framework to take into account the newly adopted Tier II retirement system, and therefore added a provision for the reduction of benefits in accordance with \u00a7 5-169. Public Acts 1983, No. 83-533, \u00a7 48.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Section 5-169 (g)<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> governs the maximum disability retirement benefits allowed under the Tier I scheme. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>Subsection (g) provides two maximum calculations and provides that if both m\u00e1ximums apply, the lesser disability benefit will be paid. Both m\u00e1ximums provide that \u201c[t]he disability benefit . . . shall not exceed [either 100 percent or 80 percent] of the member\u2019s base <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>salary or the rate of salary of the member on his date of disability, whichever is greater, <em>less any periodic cash benefit payments being made to a member under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 5-169 (g) (1) and (2). Importantly, \u00a7 5-192p (d),<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> governing Tier II employees, provides identical offset language.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> See General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>\u00a7 5-192p (d) (1) and (2) (\u201c[t]he disability benefit . . . shall not exceed . . .

Therefore, regardless of whether the plaintiff is covered by the auspices of Tier I or Tier II, the State Employees Retirement Act mandates that her disability retirement benefits be offset by the workers\u2019 compensation benefits that she receives under \u00a7 31-308a.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">On December 15, 2003, after the present case was argued before this court, we issued an order requesting that the retirement commission advise us of its practices in reducing state disability retirement benefits by the amount of any workers\u2019 compensation benefits that the employee has been awarded pursuant to \u00a7 31-308a. On January 15, 2004, the retirement commission filed a brief indicating that it does not offset such benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">The retirement commission indicated that its method of treating \u00a7 3 l-308a benefits awarded to state disability retirees is a result of the manner in which retirement service credit is granted during periods in which claimants are receiving workers\u2019 compensation benefits. In the past, when no retirement contributions were required for employees who were receiving permanent partial disability benefits under \u00a7 31-308a or specific indemnity benefits under \u00a7 31-308, no retirement credit was granted. When retirement contributions were required for employees who were receiving temporary total disability under \u00a7 31-307<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> or temporary partial disability under \u00a7 31-308 (a), retirement credit was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>Currently, no retirement contributions are required under General Statutes \u00a7 5-161 (f),<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> but the commission\u2019s practice of awarding or not awarding retirement credit based on the type of benefits received has continued due to the inherent contrast between benefits made in recognition of a temporary loss of earning power, and those made in recognition of a permanent disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">The retirement commission explained that because \u201cperiods during which an individual receives benefits for permanent loss are not included as retirement credit before retirement . . . such payments are not offset from the disability retirement benefits after retirement. \u201d Specifically, because payments pursuant to \u00a7 31-308a are paid in recognition of permanent disability, the retirement commission does not use such payments to reduce, or offset, state disability retirement payments. The retirement commission also contended that since \u00a7 31-308a benefits are discretionary and of relatively short duration, a workers\u2019 compensation commissioner is in a better position to ensure that the proper amount of benefits is being received by the plaintiff. The retirement commission further noted that, should we determine that state disability retirement benefits should be offset by \u00a7 31-308a benefits, there will be \u201cnegative administrative consequences.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">Although the commission\u2019s current practice might be based on sound administrative reasoning, and a change in such practice inevitably might lead to thorny administrative concerns, we cannot condone the continued contravention of our legislature\u2019s directive that state disability retirement benefits be offset by certain types of workers\u2019 compensation benefits, such as those avail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>able pursuant to \u00a7 31-308a.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> \u201cThere is a presumption that the legislature, in enacting a law, does so with regard to existing relevant statutes so as to make one consistent body of law.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Murtha, </em>179 Conn. 463, 466, 427 A.2d 807 (1980). In addition, when statutes provide that an activity shall be performed in a certain manner, there ordinarily is an implied prohibition against performing that activity in a different fashion. <em>State </em>v. Kelly, 208 Conn. 365, 371, 545 A.2d 1048 (1988) (\u201c[a] statute which provides that a thing shall be done in a certain way carries with it an implied prohibition against doing that thing in any other way\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). In the present case, we conclude that the legislature explicitly has provided for an offset mechanism under \u00a7\u00a7 5-169 (g) and 5-192p (d); see footnotes 23 and 24 of this opinion; and we cannot allow the past practice of an agency, no matter how well-meaning, to disregard the clear mandate of such provisions.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>The decision of the review board is reversed and the case is remanded for recalculation of the plaintiffs \u00a7 31-308a benefits award.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b20-14\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 31-308a provides: \u201cIn addition to the compensation benefits provided by section 31-308 for specific loss of a member oruse of the function of amember of the body, or any personal injury covered by this chapter, the commissioner, after such payments provided by said section 31-308 have been paid for the period set forth in said section, may award additional compensation benefits for such partial permanent disability equal to two-thirds of the difference between the wages currently earned by an employee in a position comparable to the position held by such injured employee prior to his injury and the weekly amount which such employee will probably be able to earn thereafter, to be determined by the commissioner based upon the nature and extent of the injury, the training, education and experience of the employee, the availability of work for persons with such physical condition and at the employee\u2019s age, but not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>more than the maximum provided in section 31-309.

Therefore, the plaintiff argues, <em>Iannarone </em>would apply not only to service-connected state disability retirement benefits, but also to state retirement benefits awarded based upon years of service unrelated to disability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b32-6\"> See Public Act 842 (original formulation involved \u201cthe difference between the average weekly earnings of the employee and the weekly amount which the employee will probably be able to earn thereafter\u201d); Public Acts 1969, No. 696, \u00a7 8 (modified formula to be based upon two thirds of difference); Public Acts 1979, No. 79-376, \u00a7 76 (modified description of \u201caverage weekly earnings of the employee\u201d to \u201cwages currently earned by an employee in a position comparable to the position held by such injured employee prior to his injury\u201d); Public Acts, Spec.

In <em>Ferrara </em>v. <em>Clifton Wright Hat Co., </em>125 Conn. 140, 142, 3 A.2d 842 (1939), the claimant sought benefits that allowed \u201chalf of the difference between his average weekly earnings before the injury and the amount he is able to earn thereafter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) General Statutes (1930 Rev.) \u00a7 5237, the statute at issue in <em>Ferrara, </em>was the predecessor to \u00a7 31-308 (a), which provides compensation for partial incapacity. In <em>Ferrara, </em>this court interpreted the phrase \u201c \u2018[a]ble to earn,\u2019 \u201d as applied to the situation in which a claimant is not employed \u201c \u2018thereafter,\u2019 \u201d as meaning \u201cthe amount he is capable of earning if employed\u2014the equivalent of earning capacity.\u201d <em>Ferrara </em>v. <em>Clifton Wright Hat Co., </em>supra, 142. The plaintiff argues that, because this language is identical to the language at issue in the present case, and because the application of \u00a7 31-308 (a) to wage loss due to partial disability is consonant with \u00a7 31-308a, and because we already have interpreted this phrase, there is no justification for the review board to ignore this precedent and \u201cinject into its analysis the nonstatutory term \u2018earnings.\u2019 \u201d The review board responds to this argument by pointing out that this court\u2019s focus in <em>Ferrara </em>involved a claimant who had been denied a finding of permanently impaired earning capacity despite his inability either to continue his former work as a hatter or to obtain other employment, and not a situation, such as in the present case, involving the receipt of a benefit from an employer. Although this is true, we note that the language at issue in <em>Ferrara </em>sheds some light on the statutory language in the present case because it involved a benefit calculation based on \u201chalf of the difference between [the employee\u2019s] average weekly earnings before the injury and the amount he is able to earn thereafter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ferrara </em>v. <em>Clifton Wright Hat Co., </em>supra, 142. To the extent that such language is the same as that at issue here, <em>Ferrara </em>supports our reading that such language refers to a claimant\u2019s earning capacity rather than a claimant\u2019s earnings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b35-7\"> The plaintiff further argues that the defendant\u2019s interpretation would lead to absurd results. For example, if an employer paid Social Security contributions on behalf of an employee, and the employee subsequently received Social Security benefits, the employer could be given credit for such contributions under \u00a7 31-314.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b36-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-290a (a) provides: \u201cNo employer who is subject to the provisions of this chapter shall discharge, or cause to be discharged, or in any manner discriminate against any employee because the employee has filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits or otherwise exercised the rights afforded to him pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b39-7\"> The plaintiff also argues that disability retirement benefits are \u201cfringe benefits\u201d protected by General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 31-284b (a), which seeks to \u201cmaintain, as nearly as possible, the income of employees who suffer employment-related iiyuries\u201d by requiring covered employers who provide \u201caccident and health insurance or life insurance coverage for any employee or makes payments or contributions at the regular hourly or weekly rate for full-time employees to an employee welfare fund\u201d to provide equivalent coverage while the employee is receiving workers\u2019 compensation payments. See footnote 11 of this opinion. In essence, the plaintiff claims that her state disability retirement benefits constitute a form of insurance because the state is paying them, not in its role as an employer, but rather in its capacity as a self-insurer. Therefore, the plaintiff opines, \u00a7 31-284b protects these benefits, and the employer is required to maintain them while the employee is eligible to receive workers\u2019 compensation. We need not address this argument, however, in light of our ultimate conclusion that the plaintiff is entilled to a \u00a7 31-308a award unmitigated by her state disability retirement benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b40-6\"> For example, under Tier I, retirement contributions are required of the employee; see General Statutes \u00a7 5-161; whereas such contributions are not required under Tier II. Additionally, Tier I employees receive benefits based upon Social Security earnings as well as excess earnings beyond Social Security; see General Statutes \u00a7 5-162; whereas the Tier n plan utilizes a different \u201cbreakpoint\u201d and percentage system to award benefits. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 5-192f (a) and 5-1921 (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b41-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 5-170 (c) provides: \u201cRetirement income payments shall not be reduced: (1) For a member receiving a specific indemnity award under section 31-307 or 31-308; (2) for a member who received a judgment for personal injuries and pain and suffering under the provisions of section 31-293, provided he has reimbursed the state in full for all sums expended by it under chapter 568.\u201d We note that these exceptions are not triggered in the present case because the benefits at issue do not constitute a specific indemnity award under either General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 31-307 or General Statutes \u00a7 31-308. Furthermore, the inherent difference between specific indemnity awards and \u00a7 31-308a awards makes clear why \u00a7 31-308a benefits would not be included among the exceptions to the offset. \u201c[S]pecific indemnity benefits, are not paid as compensation for loss of earning power but to compensate the injured employee for the incapacity through life because of the loss or loss of use of the body member in question. Thus, such benefits are not dependent on actual incapacity. Even if the claimant has returned to work and is earning more than he did prior to the injury, but has incurred a permanent partial disability, he is entitled to a specific indemnity award.\u201d J. Asselin, supra, p. 151; see also Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Public Personnel, 1951 Sess., p. 187-4 (\u201csince payments for specific awards are . . . not based upon loss of earnings, but on the handicap for life, an employee can retire, receive a retirement salary and keep such specific award\u201d).

See Public Acts 1987, No. 87-287, \u00a7 1. Currently, General Statutes \u00a7 5-170 (b) provides in relevant part that \u201c[u]nless the Retirement Commission has waived the overpayment ... in any case in which a member has received retirement income payments in excess of his entitlement under this subsection, the Comptroller shall act to recover such overpayments by any appropriate means, including (1) withholding such sums from future retirement income payments in accordance with regulations to be adopted by the Retirement Commission . . . and (2) <em>petitioning the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner having jurisdiction of the member\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim for an order reducing the member\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation award by the amount of such overpayment. . . .\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)

Accordingly, this amendment further supports our conclusion that the State Employees Retirement Act provides for the receipt of workers\u2019 compensation benefits to be taken into account when awarding disability retirement benefits, and authorizes the offset to be taken into account in the calculation of workers\u2019 compensation awards only when there has been an overpayment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b43-6\"> In addition to the legislative history available, there is significant secondary material that supports the plaintiffs contention that the legislature clearly intended the retirement offsetting scheme <em>as </em>provided by the State Employees Retirement Act, and not the mechanism the review board currently utilizes.
