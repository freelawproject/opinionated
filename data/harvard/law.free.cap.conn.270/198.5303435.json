Prior to trial, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the information, claiming that, although he had possessed a handgun without a permit as alleged, he had done so while operating a taxicab in which he had a proprietary interest, and, therefore, his possession of the handgun without a permit was not prohibited by \u00a7 29-35 (a) because his taxicab constituted a place of business within the meaning of that exception to \u00a7 29-35 (a). The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss and, with the permission of the trial court,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the state appealed,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> claiming that the place of business exception of \u00a7 29-35 (a) does not apply to taxicabs. We agree with the state and, consequently, reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>The following relevant facts are undisputed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At all times pertinent to this appeal, the defendant was a taxicab driver in the city of New Haven. When operating his taxicab, the defendant carried a handgun in a pack on his waist. The defendant did not obtain a permit for the handgun in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 29-28 (b).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant operated his taxicab under the auspices of Metro Taxi Company, Inc. (Metro Taxi).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">On June 15, 2001, at about 11 p.m., the defendant picked up a customer who, while attempting to rob him, stabbed the defendant in the neck. The defendant removed his handgun from the pack on his waist and shot and killed the assailant. The defendant then drove away from the scene and disconnected his two-way radio, which serves to track the location of his taxicab. Meanwhile, the New Haven police determined that a taxicab from Metro Taxi had been involved in the shoot<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>ing and contacted the company. Initially, Metro Taxi was unable to locate the defendant. Eventually, however, the defendant contacted Metro Taxi and, when he was informed that the police were looking for him, he gave his location and waited for the police to arrive. When the police arrived at approximately 4:30 a.m. on June 16,2001, the defendant advised them that his handgun was in the trunk of his taxicab.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">The defendant was charged with carrying a pistol without a permit in violation of \u00a7 29-35 (a). He thereafter moved to dismiss the charge, claiming that he was exempt from the permit requirement of \u00a7 29-28 (b) because his taxicab, in which he had a proprietary interest,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> was a place of business within the meaning of that exception to \u00a7 29-35 (a). In opposing the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, the state claimed that a taxicab is not a place of business within the meaning of \u00a7 29-35 (a). In support of its contention, the state placed particular reliance on General Statutes \u00a7 29-38,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>with exceptions not applicable to taxicabs, expressly prohibits, inter alia, the carrying of a pistol without a permit in any motor vehicle. Although the trial court acknowledged that the primary purpose of \u00a7\u00a7 29-35 (a) and 29-38 is to restrict the possession of unlicensed handguns in the public sphere, it nevertheless granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, concluding that, in light of the place of business exception of \u00a7 29-35 (a), the legislature necessarily had determined that the interest of a business proprietor in protecting his or her business premises outweighs the public interest in prohibiting the proprietor from possessing a handgun on his or her business premises without first obtaining a permit. The trial court further concluded that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>defendant\u2019s taxicab fell within the place of business exception of \u00a7 29-35 (a) and, therefore, that the defendant\u2019s possession of a handgun without a permit while operating his taxicab did not constitute a violation of \u00a7 29-35 (a). Consequently, the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">With the permission of the trial court, the state filed this appeal. On appeal, the state maintains that the place of business exception of \u00a7 29-35 (a) is inapplicable to taxicabs.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">The issue raised by the state\u2019s claim is one of statutory interpretation, and, therefore, our review is plenary. E.g., <em>Segal </em>v. <em>Segal, </em>264 Conn. 498, 506, 823 A.2d 1208 (2003). \u201cThe meaning of a statute shall, in the first instance, be ascertained from the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\u201d Public Acts 2003, No. 03-154, \u00a7 1. When a statute is not plain and unambiguous, however, as in the present case, \u201cwe [also] look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter [for interpre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>tive guidance].\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Nizzardo </em>v. <em>State Traffic Commission, </em>259 Conn. 131, 141, 788 A.2d 1158 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Special rules govern our review of penal statutes. \u201cWe have long held that [c]riminal statutes axe not to be read more broadly than their language plainly requires .... Thus, we begin with the proposition that [cjourts must avoid imposing criminal liability where the legislature has not <em>expressly </em>so intended . . . and ambiguities are ordinarily to be resolved in favor of the defendant. ... In other words, penal statutes are to be construed strictly and not extended by implication to create liability which no language of the act purports to create. . . . [T]his does not mean [however] that every criminal statute must be given the narrowest possible meaning in complete disregard of the purpose of the legislature. ... No rule of construction . . . requires that a penal statute be strained and distorted in order to exclude conduct clearly intended to be within its scope\u2014nor does any rule require that the act be given the narrowest meaning. It is sufficient if the words are given their fair meaning in accord with the evident intent of [the legislature]. . . . The rule that terms in a statute are to be assigned their ordinary meaning, unless context dictates otherwise . . . also guides our interpretive inquiry.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>256 Conn. 517, 531-32, 779 A.2d 702 (2001). With these principles in mind, we turn to the merits of the state\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly construed the term \u201cplace of business\u201d in \u00a7 29-35 (a) to include taxicabs.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">The state maintains that the trial court failed to consider that term in its proper statutory context and, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>particular, in relation to the provisions of \u00a7 29-38 (a), which expressly prohibit, inter alia, a person from transporting, without a permit, a pistol or revolver in a motor vehicle. The state asserts that the more specific provisions of \u00a7 29-38 (a) necessarily inform our understanding of the more general provisions of \u00a7 29-35 (a). The state further notes that \u00a7\u00a7 29-35 (a) and 29-38 (b) exempt certain occupations from the permit requirement otherwise applicable to the possession of handguns and that, notably, the occupation of taxicab driver is not included among them. The state also maintains that the trial court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 29-35 (a) is inconsistent with the legislative purpose underlying that statutory provision and \u00a7 29-38, namely, to prohibit the possession of unregistered handguns in the public arena generally and in motor vehicles specifically. Finally, the state claims that the trial court\u2019s statutory interpretation leads to the bizarre result that a taxicab driver is free to carry a pistol without a permit in his taxicab even though, under \u00a7 29-38, he is prohibited from carrying certain less dangerous weapons in his taxicab, such as brass knuckles or a BB gun. For the reasons advanced by the state, we agree that a taxicab is not a place of business within the meaning of \u00a7 29-35 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">As in all cases of statutory analysis, we begin with the pertinent statutory language. General Statutes \u00a7 29-35 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cNo person shall carry any pistol or revolver upon one\u2019s person, except when such person is within the dwelling house or place of business of such person, without a permit to carry the same issued as provided in section 29-28. . . .\u201d Although the word \u201cplace,\u201d like virtually all words, has different connotations, we are persuaded that the term \u201cplace <em>of business\u201d </em>implies a particular or fixed location and not merely a type of chattel. In other words, we generally think of a motor vehicle as mobile personal property that, at any point in time, <em>occupies </em>a particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>place but that is not, <em>itself, </em>a place. Even in circumstances in which a motor vehicle is integral to one\u2019s business, we usually do not refer to that motor vehicle as the <em>place </em>where that business is <em>located. </em>Thus, as we noted in <em>State </em>v. <em>Vickers, </em>260 Conn. 219, 796 A.2d 502 (2002), one\u2019s place of business is \u201cthe premises in which the business one owns or controls is located . . . .\u201d Id., 225. A motor vehicle generally is not considered the premises in which a business is located.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Consideration of the term \u201cplace of business\u201d within the broader context of \u00a7 29-35 (a) as a whole bolsters our conclusion that the place of business exception includes fixed places of business only. As we observed in <em>State </em>v. <em>Vickers, </em>supra, 260 Conn. 219, \u00a7 29-35 (a) \u201cdelineates the specific jobs that . . . are excluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>from the permit requirement.\u201d Id., 225. The specific occupations exempted under \u00a7 29-35 (a) include parole and peace officers of this state or another state while engaged in the pursuit of official duties, federal marshals, federal law enforcement agents, and members of the armed forces \u201cwhen on duty or going to or from duty . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 29-35 (a). Mobility is essential to these occupations, as it is to a taxicab driver. In contrast to the occupation of taxicab driver, however, the occupations exempted under \u00a7 29-35 (a) are occupations that involve the protection of <em>the public </em>and for which weapons are considered an essential tool of the trade. The legislature carved out a limited exception for those public safety occupations by expressly exempting them from the strictures of \u00a7 29-35 (a); if the legislature had intended to expand significantly the number and kind of exempted occupations to include taxicab drivers and other mobile types of occupations, we reasonably may presume that the legislature also would have done so expressly. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Vickers, </em>supra, 225 (absent contrary evidence, statutory itemization indicates that legislature intended list to be exclusive).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Similarly, the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 29-35 (a) prohibiting the possession of a handgun without a permit outside a dwelling house or place of business expressly do not apply to: (1) \u201cthe transportation of pistols or revolvers as merchandise\u201d; (2) \u201cany person transporting any pistol or revolver while contained in the package in which it was originally wrapped at the time of sale and while transporting the same from the place of sale to the purchaser\u2019s residence or place of business\u201d; (3) \u201cany person while transporting any such pistol or revolver from such person\u2019s place of residence or business to a place or individual where or by whom such pistol or revolver is to be repaired or while returning to such person\u2019s place of residence or busi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>ness after the same has been repaired\u201d; (4) \u201cany person transporting a pistol or revolver in or through the state for the purpose of taking part in competitions, taking part in formal pistol or revolver training, repairing such pistol or revolver or attending any meeting or exhibition of an organized collectors\u2019 group if such person is a bona fide resident of the United States and is permitted to possess and carry a pistol or revolver in the state or subdivision of the United States in which such person resides\u201d; (5) \u201cany person transporting a pistol or revolver to and from a testing range at the request of the issuing authority\u201d; and (6) \u201cany person transporting an antique pistol or revolver, as defined in section 29-33.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">These six limited exceptions to \u00a7 29-35\u2019s general prohibition of the possession of a handgun without apermit outside of a dwelling house or place of business represent the legislature\u2019s recognition that, on occasion, it may be necessary to transport an unlicensed handgun from a dwelling house or place of business to another location for a specific and limited purpose, including, for example, the repair of the handgun. The narrowly circumscribed nature of these exceptions, however, is indicative of the overriding purpose of \u00a7 29-35 (a), namely, to curtail the possession of unlicensed handguns in the public arena. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Vickers, </em>supra, 260 Conn. 227-28. Moreover, in keeping with that purpose, the legislature has placed severe restrictions on the manner in which an unlicensed handgun may be transported in accordance with any one of the six aforementioned exceptions. Specifically, General Statutes \u00a7 29-35 (a) provides that no unlicensed pistol or revolver may be transported in a motor vehicle under one of those exceptions unless the pistol or revolver is unloaded and \u201cis not readily accessible or directly accessible from the passenger compartment of the vehicle or, if such pistol or revolver is being transported <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>in a motor vehicle that does not have a compartment separate from the passenger compartment, such pistol or revolver shall be contained in a locked container other than the glove compartment or console.\u201d These stringent requirements pertaining to the transport of unregistered handguns in motor vehicles reinforce our conclusion that the legislature did not intend for motor vehicles to be included in the place of business exception of \u00a7 29-35 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Furthermore, \u201c[i]t is a familiar principle of statutory construction that where the same words are used in a statute two or more times they will ordinarily be given the same meaning in each instance.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>266 Conn. 108, 123, 830 A.2d 1121 (2003). The term \u201cplace of business\u201d appears several times throughout \u00a7 29-35 (a). Specifically, and as previously discussed, the statute allows the transportation of pistols or revolvers that are contained in the packaging in which they originally were contained at the time of sale \u201cfrom the place of sale to the purchaser\u2019s residence or place of business . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 29-35 (a). General Statutes \u00a7 29-35 (a) also allows a person to transport a handgun \u201cfrom such person\u2019s place of residence or business to a place or individual where or by whom such [handgun] is to be repaired . . . .\u201d In these contexts, the term \u201cplace of business\u201d clearly signifies a fixed location one travels to and from. We see no reason why the legislature would have intended for that very same term to be given a different meaning in the same statutory subsection.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Finally, and perhaps most importantly, our reading of the place of business exception of \u00a7 29-35 (a) is supported, if not compelled, by the plain and unambigu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>ous provisions of its sister statute, namely, \u00a7 29-38 (a).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Thames Talent, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>265 Conn. 127, 136, 827 A.2d 659 (2003) (in ascertaining statutory meaning, we look to, inter alia, statute\u2019s relationship to other legislation). Indeed, any possible doubt as to whether a taxicab is a place of business under \u00a7 29-35 (a) is dispelled by the clear dictates of General Statutes \u00a7 29-38 (a), which provides in relevant part: \u201cAny person who knowingly has, in any vehicle owned, operated or occupied by such person, any weapon, any pistol or revolver for which a proper permit has not been issued as provided in section 29-28 . . . shall be fined not more than one thousand dollars or imprisoned not more than five years or both . . . .\u201d Unlike \u00a7 29-35 (a), \u00a7 29-38 contains no exception for a. \u201cplace of business\u201d and contains no other exception applicable to taxicabs. Consequently, the conduct of the defendant in the present case is proscribed by the express terms of \u00a7 29-38 (a).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In accordance with settled principles of statutory interpretation, therefore, our determination of whether the legislature intended a taxicab to be a place of business under \u00a7 29-35 (a) necessarily is guided by the plain strictures of \u00a7 29-38 (a). See, e.g., <em>Hatt </em>v. <em>Burlington Coat Factory, </em>263 Conn. 279, 310, 819 A.2d 260 (2003) (to ensure coherent construction of statutory provision, we look not only to provision at issue but also to broader statutory scheme); <em>Waterbury </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>260 Conn. 506, 557, 800 A.2d 1102 (2002) (statutes relating to same subject matter are construed \u201cso as to create a rational, coherent and consistent body of law\u201d). More<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>over, we must presume that the legislature was fully cognizant of the provisions and import of \u00a7 29-35 (a) when it adopted the provisions of \u00a7 29-38 (a)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and that it perceived no conflict between them. See, e.g., <em>Hatt </em>v. <em>Burlington Coat Factory, </em>supra, 310 (legislature \u201cis always presumed to know all the existing statutes and the effect that its action or non-action will have on any one of them\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). If the legislature had intended to exempt taxicabs from the provisions of \u00a7 29-38, it easily could have expressed such an intent. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Russo, </em>259 Conn. 436, 450, 790 A.2d 1132 (if legislature had intended to limit access by law enforcement personnel to records of prescriptions for controlled substances, it easily could have expressed that intent), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 879, 123 S. Ct. 79, 154 L. Ed. 2d 134 (2002); cf. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>supra, 266 Conn. 119 (court is \u201cnot permitted to supply statutory language that the legislature may have chosen to omit\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). The fact that \u00a7 29-38 does not contain an exception for taxicabs convinces us that a taxicab does not fall within the purview of the place of business exception of \u00a7 29-35 (a) because it would be counterintuitive to conclude that our legislature would criminalize under one statute conduct that it intended to allow under another. Indeed, to conclude otherwise would frustrate the clear intent of the legislature, as manifested by the plain language of \u00a7 29-38, to criminalize the possession of unlicensed handguns in <em>all </em>motor vehicles, including taxicabs, except in the limited circumstances expressly identified in subsection (b) of that statutory section. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFrancesco, </em>235 Conn. 426, 436, 668 A.2d 348 (1995) (\u201c[principles of statutory construction . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>require us to construe a statute in a manner that will not thwart its intended purpose\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">The defendant contends that the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the place of business exception of \u00a7 29-35 (a) is not irreconcilable with the provisions of \u00a7 29-38. Specifically, the defendant claims that because \u00a7 29-38 (a) expressly authorizes the possession of a pistol in a motor vehicle if a permit has been issued pursuant to \u00a7 29-28, \u201cit logically follows that [a' person] who is exempt from obtaining a . . . permit under [\u00a7] 29-28 via the [\u00a7] 29-35 (a) \u2018place of business\u2019 exception . . . would also be exempt from prosecution for a violation of [\u00a7] 29-38, the statute prohibiting weapons in a motor vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">The defendant\u2019s assertion that he would be exempt from prosecution under \u00a7 29-38 <em>if he </em>were exempt from the permit requirements of \u00a7 29-35 (a) does not address, let alone resolve, the issue before us, namely, whether the defendant, a taxicab driver, is, <em>in fact, </em>exempt from the provisions of \u00a7 29-35 (a) prohibiting a person from carrying a pistol or revolver without a permit. Indeed, the defendant appears to advance this argument merely to demonstrate that it is possible to fashion a plausible interpretation of \u00a7 29-38 that would render it linguistically compatible with the trial court\u2019s construction of \u00a7 29-35 (a). To achieve this end, however, the defendant must tease ambiguity from \u00a7 29-38 where none exists. That is, \u00a7 29-38 plainly prohibits the carrying of unlicensed handguns in motor vehicles\u2014with exceptions not applicable here\u2014and refers to \u00a7 29-28 <em>simply to identify the provisions governing the procedure for obtaining the permit that is required of persons who wish lawfully to possess apistol or revolver in a vehicle. </em>See footnote 6 of this opinion. The defendant nevertheless asks us to conclude that \u00a7 29-38 <em>implicitly </em>exempts an unspecified number of motor vehicles from its provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>sions simply because it <em>refers to </em>\u00a7 29-28, a statute that does no more than establish the procedures to be followed when applying for a gun permit. Well established rules of statutory construction compel us to conclude otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">First, \u201c[w]e will not impute to the legislature an intent that is not apparent from unambiguous statutory language in the absence of a compelling reason to do so.\u201d <em>Home Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>235 Conn. 185, 195, 663 A.2d 1001 (1995). Moreover, we are unwilling to conclude that the legislature would choose such a tortuous path to a correct understanding of \u00a7\u00a7 29-35 (a) and 29-38. This is especially true in light of the list of exceptions that are expressly enumerated in \u00a7 29-38; see, e.g., <em>Gay &amp; Lesbian Law Students Assn. </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees, </em>236 Conn. 453, 476, 673 A.2d 484 (1996) (\u201c[w]here express exceptions [to a statute] are made, the legal presumption is that the legislature did not intend to save other cases from the operation of the statute\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); and the notable absence of any cross reference to \u00a7 29-35 (a) in \u00a7 29-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">The defendant\u2019s argument is contrary to yet another applicable principle of statutory construction, namely, that \u201cspecific statutory provisions are presumed to prevail over more general statutory provisions dealing with the same overall subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Andresen, </em>256 Conn. 313, 329, 773 A.2d 328 (2001). As we previously discussed, \u00a7 29-35 (a) applies to the possession of a pistol or revolver <em>generally, </em>whereas \u00a7 29-38 applies specifically to the possession of such a weapon <em>in a motor vehicle. </em>In such circumstances, we presume that the specific provisions of the latter statute prevail over the more general provisions of the former statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">Moreover, \u201cwe have long held that . . . exceptions to statutes are to be strictly construed with doubts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>resolved in favor of the general rule rather than the exception and that those who claim the benefit of an exception under a statute have the burden of proving that they come within the limited class for whose benefit it was established.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gay &amp; Lesbian Law Students Assn. </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees, </em>supra, 236 Conn. 473-74. The defendant, however, would have us turn this precept on its head and conclude that a taxicab falls <em>within </em>the \u201cplace of business\u201d <em>exception </em>of \u00a7 29-35 (a) and <em>outside </em>the <em>broadly inclusive language </em>of \u00a7 29-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Furthermore, because \u00a7 29-38, by its plain terms, is applicable to taxicabs, the trial court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 29-35 (a) places \u00a7 29-38 in constitutional jeopardy with respect to others similarly situated to the defendant. As we previously have explained, it would be illogical\u2014indeed, it probably would be irrational\u2014for the legislature to have criminalized conduct under \u00a7 29-38 that it has exempted from the proscription of \u00a7 29-35 (a). The trial court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 29-35 (a), however, would lead to just such a result. Thus, a taxicab driver who possesses a handgun in his taxicab in reliance on that construction of \u00a7 29-35 (a) would have a strong claim that his prosecution under \u00a7 29-38 for the very same conduct would be barred, under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment, because he was not afforded fair warning that such conduct was prohibited. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>264 Conn. 593, 616, 825 A.2d 111 (2003) (due process requires that statutory scheme \u201cafford a person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what [conduct] is permitted or prohibited\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Perruccio, </em>192 Conn. 154, 164, 471 A.2d 632 (\u201claws [must] give [a] person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so that he [or she] may act accordingly\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]), appeal dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>missed, 469 U.S. 801,105 S. Ct. 55, 83 L. Ed. 2d 6 (1984). The due process quagmire that would arise with respect to \u00a7 29-38 if, <em>but only if, </em>a taxicab is deemed to be a \u201cplace of business\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 29-35 (a), runs afoul of a bedrock principle of statutory construction, namely, that courts \u201cindulge in every presumption in favor of [a] statute\u2019s constitutionality. . . . [Thus, in] choosing between two constructions of a statute, one valid and one constitutionally precarious, we will search for an effective and constitutional construction that reasonably accords with the legislature\u2019s underlying intent. . . . We undertake this search for a constitutionally valid construction when confronted with criminal statutes as well as with civil statutes.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>238 Conn. 389, 493, 680 A.2d 147 (1996). Never before has this court rejected a reasonable interpretation of one statute when to do so would render another statute unconstitutional, and we see no reason to do so now.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">In addition to the foregoing problems, the construction of \u00a7 29-35 (a) adopted by the trial court and advanced by the defendant leads to bizarre results. Under the trial court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 29-35 (a), a taxicab driver lawfully may possess an unregistered handgun while operating a taxicab even though, under \u00a7 29-38, that same taxicab driver is prohibited from possessing any other weapon, including, for example, a BB gun or a knife with a blade that is four inches in length or longer. BB guns and knives, however, are considerably <em>less </em>dangerous than pistols and revolvers\u2014especially pistols and revolvers in the hands of persons who have not successfully completed a course in the safe use of such weapons, which is a prerequisite to obtaining a permit for a pistol or revolver. See General Statutes \u00a7 29-28 (b). We see no reason why the legislature would have intended the anomalous result that flows from the trial court\u2019s construction of \u00a7 29-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>35 (a) and, therefore, we will not impute such an intent to the legislature. See, e.g., <em>Vibert </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>260 Conn. 167, 177, 793 A.2d 1076 (2002) (this court will not interpret statute \u201cto reach ... a bizarre or absurd result\u201d); <em>Modern Cigarette, Inc. </em>v. <em>Orange, </em>256 Conn. 105, 120, 774 A.2d 969 (2001) (statutes construed using common sense and assuming that reasonable and rational result was intended).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Finally, the trial court\u2019s construction of \u00a7 29-35 (a) is fundamentally flawed for yet another important reason: it is contrary to the propose of the statute itself, namely, \u201cto legislate the prohibition of unregistered handguns in the public sphere.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Vickers, </em>supra, 260 Conn. 227. To conclude, as the trial court did, that taxicabs fall within the place of business exception of \u00a7 29-35 (a) will result in a proliferation of handguns in motor vehicles: street vendors and caterers, traveling salespersons, limousine drivers and a multitude of other persons who use their motor vehicles to conduct business\u2014the Good Humor man included\u2014would be authorized to carry handguns in those vehicles without first obtaining a permit in accordance with \u00a7 29-28. This result \u201cundermine [s] the clear intent of the legislature to limit the number of unlicensed handguns in the public arena.\u201d Id., 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">Indeed, under the trial court\u2019s inteipretation of \u00a7 29-35 (a), a taxicab driver\u2019s \u201cplace of business\u201d is, in effect, anywhere his taxicab happens'to be located, whether that location is a school parking lot, a crowded city street or a residential neighborhood. The trial court sought to minimize this fact by reasoning that a taxicab driver is not truly in the public sphere when he is in his taxicab because he has the right both to exclude the public from his vehicle and to require any passengers to conform to certain rules. But the same may be said of virtually any driver operating any motor vehicle on any public road. The mere fact that a person has a control<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>ling or ownership interest in the vehicle that he or she is driving, and therefore may exclude others from it, does not remove that automobile and its operator from the public arena.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">The defendant asserts that our conclusion today is \u201ccontrary to the notion that ambiguities within criminal statutes are ordinarily resolved in favor of the defendant,\u201d and that the rule of lenity compels an outcome of the case in his favor. We disagree. \u201c[T]he touchstone of [the] rule of lenity is statutory ambiguity.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jason B., </em>248 Conn. 543, 555, 729 A.2d 760, cert. denied, 528 U.S. 967, 120 S. Ct. 406,145 L. Ed. 2d 316 (1999). Thus, as the United States Supreme Court has explained, courts do not apply the rule of lenity unless \u201ca reasonable doubt persists about a statute\u2019s intended scope <em>even after resort to the language and structure, legislative history, and mo livating policies of the </em>statute.\u201d (Emphasis altered; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Moskal </em>v. <em>United States, </em>498 U.S. 103, 108, 111 S. Ct. 461, 112 L. Ed. 2d 449 (1990); accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Jason B., </em>supra, 555; see also <em>Albernaz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>450 U.S. 333, 342, 101 S. Ct. 1137, 67 L. Ed. 2d 275 (1981) (\u201cLenity thus serves only as an aid for resolving an ambiguity; it is not to be used to beget one. The rule comes into operation at the end of the process of construing what [the legislature] has expressed, not at the beginning as an overriding consideration of being lenient to wrongdoers.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>[Internal quotation marks omitted.]); <em>State </em>v. <em>Courchesne, </em>262 Conn. 537, 556 n.15, 816 A.2d 562 (2003) (rejecting contention that rule of lenity applies whenever defendant musters plausible interpretation of criminal statute); <em>State </em>v. <em>Albert, </em>252 Conn. 795, 803, 750 A.2d 1037 (2000) (rule of lenity does not require statutory interpretation that frustrates evident legislative intent). Because, after a careful examination of the language, context, legislative genealogy and purpose of \u00a7 29-35 (a), no reasonable doubt exists as to whether a taxicab is a \u201cplace of business\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 29-35 (a), the rule of lenity is inapplicable.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">We note, finally, that although we conclude that the legislature did not intend to include taxicabs in the place of business exception of \u00a7 29-35 (a), it is equally apparent that the legislature also did not intend to create an absolute bar against a taxicab driver\u2019s possession of a handgun in his or her taxicab. Under our statutory scheme, the legislature merely intended for a taxicab driver, like any other person whose business may rely on a motor vehicle, to obtain a permit to carry a handgun <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>before bringing it into his or her vehicle. This is sound public policy. Indeed, we can think of no good reason why <em>not </em>to require taxicab drivers to obtain a handgun permit\u2014and the mandatory training on handgun use and safety\u2014before allowing them to carry such deadly weapons while traversing the public highways of this state. Indeed, the requirement is commonsensical, and we believe that our statutory scheme reflects the legislature\u2019s exercise of that unassailably sound public policy judgment.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">In this opinion BORDEN, NORCOTT and VERTEF-EUILLE, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b218-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 29-35 (a) provides: \u201cNo person shall carry any pistol or revolver upon one\u2019s person, except when such person is within the dwelling house or place of business of such person, without a permit to cany the same issued as provided in section 29-28.

In <em>People </em>v. <em>Wooten, </em>168 Cal. App. 3d 168, 214 Cal. Rptr. 36 (1985), the court stated: \u201cThe clear legislative purpose [of the California statute barring the possession of handguns without a permit or license] is to prohibit the carrying around of concealed weapons. [The statutory scheme] provides an exception for possession in one\u2019s residence or place of business. The natural meaning of the term \u2018place of business\u2019 is a fixed location, simply because almost all businesses are conducted in some office, store or other building. When a business is mobile, one generally says that the business is not conducted in any particular place . . . Id., 173. The court in <em>Wooten </em>further explained that the word \u201cplace,\u201d properly understood in context, is not reasonably susceptible of the broad interpretation that had been urged by the defendant, Robert Lee Wooten, in that case. See id., 175. The court stated: \u201cAnyone reading [the] terms [of the statutory scheme] would see that its exemption for residences and places of business does not extend to the vehicle used by every businessman who must travel in the course of his business. [Wooten\u2019s] use of a dictionary definition of \u2018place\u2019 as \u2018an indefinite region or expanse\u2019 does not invoke any vagueness that would be perceived by a person of common intelligence. This use applies to large places\u2014for example, California is a \u2018place.\u2019 Does this mean that anyone who does business in California can carry a concealed weapon anywhere in the state because it is his \u2018place of business\u2019? Of course not. The phrase, \u2018place of business\u2019 has a narrower meaning than each of its component terms. It is used to describe stores, offices, warehouses, etc. where business is conducted.

Under our interpretation of \u00a7\u00a7 29-35 (a) and 29-38, however, a <em>licensed </em>handgun owner lawfully may remove his or her handgun from the taxicab at any time. Moreover, a licensed handgun owner who chooses to leave the handgun in his or her vehicle will have received mandatory training with regard to the proper storage and use of that handgun. See General Statutes \u00a7 29-28 (b).

See, e.g., Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 750.227 (2) (2001) (\u201c[a] person shall not carry a pistol . . . except in his or her dwelling house, place of business, <em>or on other land possessed by the person, </em>without a license\u201d [emphasis added]). We disagree that the language of any such sister state statute is pertinent to our inquiry because we must construe \u00a7 29-35 (a) in light of <em>its </em>language, and with proper regard for our own unique legislative scheme and history, in particular, \u00a7 29-38, and the interrelated genealogy of that provision and \u00a7 29-35 (a). Moreover, even if those out-of-state statutes were relevant to the interpretation of our statutory scheme, they simply do not buttress the defendant\u2019s contention; most of those statutes employ language that, like the Michigan statute, reflects the legislature\u2019s understanding that the term \u201cplace of business\u201d connotes something affixed to the land. Indeed, the vast majority of states <em>prohibit </em>the possession of unlicensed handguns in taxicabs, and, to our knowledge, no state impliedly authorizes such possession. The defendant has provided no persuasive reason why we should construe \u00a7 29-35 (a) in such a manner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b239-9\"> The defendant also cites the hazardous nature of the taxicab business as a reason for concluding that the legislature intended to exempt taxicab drivers from the general proscription of \u00a7 29-35 (a). Specifically, the defendant alludes toa federal study indicating that a significant number of taxicab drivers are murdered each year. Although we do not dispute that driving a taxicab entails certain risks, we disagree that those risks militate in favor of the trial court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 29-35 (a). Indeed, we reiterate that our reading of the statute does not bar a taxicab driver from possessing a handgun while operating a taxicab; a taxicab driver need only obtain a permit to do so. Moreover, to the extent that driving a taxicab poses certain risks, those risks are faced equally by taxicab drivers who concededly are not exempt from prosecution under \u00a7 29-35 (a) because they have no proprietary interest in the cab they are operating. Thus, if the dangerous nature of the activity of driving a taxicab truly were a reason to exempt taxicabs from the purview of \u00a7 29-35 (a), there is no reason why the legislature would not have provided such an exemption for <em>any and all </em>taxicab drivers and not just for those who happen to have a proprietary interest in the taxicabs that they are driving at any particular point in time.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b239-8\">ZARELLA, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AHc\">concurring. Although I regard this as a very close case, I concur in the result reached by the majority. I agree, in particular-, with the conclusion of the majority that the trial court\u2019s interpretation of General Statutes \u00a7 29-35 (a), if allowed to stand, would place General Statutes \u00a7 29-38 in constitutional jeopardy with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>respect to others similarly situated to the defendant because it would deprive such persons of fair warning as to the conduct permitted or prohibited under the statutory scheme. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>264 Conn. 593, 616, 825 A.2d 111 (2003); <em>State </em>v. <em>Perruccio, </em>192 Conn. 154, 164, 471 A.2d 632, appeal dismissed, 469 U.S. 801, 105 S. Ct. 55, 83 L. Ed. 2d 6 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">I also agree with the majority that the rule of lenity does not apply in this case because, upon an examination of the text of the statute and its relationship to other statutes; see Public Acts 2003, No. 03-154, \u00a7 1; it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that a taxicab does not fall within the \u201cplace of business\u201d exception of \u00a7 29-35 (a). I disagree, however, with the view of the majority that the court may examine, in any given case, extratextual sources to clarify the meaning of a criminal statute before applying the rule of lenity.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">The majority relies on <em>Moskal </em>v. <em>United States, </em>498 U.S. 103, 111 S. Ct. 461, 112 L. Ed. 2d 449 (1990), in stating that the rule of lenity does not apply unless \u201ca reasonable doubt persists about a statute\u2019s intended scope <em>even after resort to the language and structure, legislative history, and motivating policies of the stat</em>ute.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) Majority opinion, p. 219, quoting <em>Moskal </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 108. The court in <em>Moskal, </em>however, did not examine whether the use of legislative history and extratextual sources to resolve ambiguity in a statute is consistent with the fair warning rationale underlying the rule of lenity; see <em>Moskal </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 107-108; and neither has this court. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Courchesne, </em>262 Conn. 537, 611-12 n.8, 816 A.2d 562 (2003) <em>(Zarella, J., </em>dissenting). My concern is that judicial reliance on the \u201clegislative history\u201d and \u201cmotivating policies\u201d of a statute to clarify its meaning may compromise the purpose of the rule of lenity, namely, to provide \u201c[a] fair warning ... to the world in language that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>common world will understand, of what the law intends to do if a certain line is passed.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>R. L. C., </em>503 U.S. 291, 308, 112 S. Ct. 1329, 117 L. Ed. 2d 559 (1992) (Scalia, J., with whom Kennedy and Thomas, Js., join, concurring in part and concurring in judgment). As I have noted previously, it is for this reason that \u201c[sjeveral members of the United States Supreme Court . . . have expressed their view that the rationale for the rule of lenity precludes consideration of extratextual sources to clarify an ambiguous statute.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Courchesne, </em>supra, 611 n.8 (Zarella, J., dissenting), citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>R. L. C., </em>supra, 307 (Scalia, J., with whom Kennedy and Thomas, Js., join, concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (\u201cit is not consistent with the rule of lenity to construe a textuaily ambiguous penal statute against a criminal defendant on the basis of legislative history\u201d). Accordingly, this court\u2019s continued reference to the language of <em>Moskal </em>is unwarranted in the absence of its own examination of whether the use of extratextual sources to clarify an ambiguous statute is consistent with the principle of fair warning.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Furthermore, the United States Supreme Court has noted that \u201cthe need for fair warning will make it rare that legislative history or statutory policies will support a construction of a statute broader than that clearly warranted by the text . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>R. L. C., </em>supra, 503 U.S. 306 n.6 (plurality opinion). These words indicate that, even the highest court in our nation, to which the majority has turned for guidance, does not believe that extratextual sources always should be considered when applying the rule of lenity. I therefore do not agree with the majority\u2019s reliance on the quoted passage from <em>Moskal </em>because the passage suggests that the rule of lenity may be applied following routine consideration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>of legislative history and other extratextual evidence of a statute\u2019s meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Finally, to the extent that I believe that the rule of lenity precludes consideration of extratextual sources to clarify the meaning of a criminal statute, I disagree with the standard of statutory review employed by the majority at the outset of its opinion, which suggests that the court may examine extratextual evidence to resolve ambiguities in a criminal statute prior to applying the rule of lenity.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">I concur in the majority opinion in all other respects.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b242-8\">KATZ, J., with whom SULLIVAN, C. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ahs\">joins, dissenting. The sole issue in this appeal is whether a taxicab falls within the \u201cplace of business\u201d exception of General Statutes \u00a7 29-35 (a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The majority agrees with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>the state that the trial court improperly determined that a taxicab may constitute a place of business. Specifically, the majority concludes that, because a taxicab is a motor vehicle, taxicab drivers are not exempt under the place of business exception in \u00a7 29-35 (a). In essence, the majority determines that, even if the defendant, John Lutters, had a proprietary interest in his taxicab, his taxicab cannot constitute a place of business because of its mobility. I respectfully disagree with the majority. The issue is whether the legislature intended to exempt from the permit requirement a place of business that is not stationary. Because I have reasonable doubt about the application of the exemption to the defendant\u2019s taxicab, I would affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Like the majority, I begin with our well established principles of statutory interpretation in analyzing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>defendant\u2019s claim. Our legislature recently has enacted No. 03-154, \u00a7 1, of the 2003 Public Acts, which provides: \u201cThe meaning of a statute shall, in the first instance, be ascertained from the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\u201d In the present case, the relevant statutory text and the relationship of that text to other statutes do not reveal a meaning that is plain and unambiguous. Accordingly, the analysis is not limited and, like the majority, I look to other factors relevant to the inquiry into the meaning of \u00a7 29-35, including its legislative history and the circumstances surrounding its enactment and its purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Additionally, this case implicates our rigorous rules of construction regarding criminal statutes. In specific, \u201c[w]e have long held that [c]riminal statutes are not to be read more broadly than their language plainly requires .... Thus, we begin with the proposition that [c]ourts must avoid imposing criminal liability where the legislature has not <em>expressly </em>so intended . . . and ambiguities are ordinarily to be resolved in favor of the defendant. ... In other words, penal statutes are to be construed strictly and not extended by implication to create liability which no language of the act purports to create. . . . [T]his does not mean [however] that every criminal statute must be given the narrowest possible meaning in complete disregard of the purpose of the legislature. ... No rule of construction . . . requires that a penal statute be strained and distorted in order to exclude conduct clearly intended to be within its scope\u2014nor does any rule require that the act be given the narrowest meaning. It is sufficient if the words are given their fair meaning in accord with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>the evident intent of [the legislature]. . . . The rule that terms in a statute are to be assigned their ordinary meaning, unless context dictates otherwise . . . also guides our interpretive inquiry.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>256 Conn. 517, 531-32, 779 A.2d 702 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Finally, I note the rule of lenity, which applies whenever there is a reasonable doubt as to the scope of a statute. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Sostre, </em>261 Conn. 111, 120, 802 A.2d 754 (2002). This rule is \u201cnot merely a convenient maxim of statutory construction.\u201d <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>United States, </em>442 U.S. 100, 112, 99 S. Ct. 2190, 60 L. Ed. 2d 743 (1979). Rather, as the United States Supreme Court consistently has reaffirmed, the rule of lenity is rooted in principles of due process and the separation of powers. See, e.g., id. (rule rooted in fundamental principles of due process); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bass, </em>404 U.S. 336, 348, 92 S. Ct. 515, 30 L. Ed. 2d 488 (1971) (two policies behind rule of lenity are to give \u201c \u2018fair warning ... of what the law intends to do if a certain line is passed\u2019 \u201d and that \u201clegislatures and not courts should define criminal activity\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wiltberger, </em>18 U.S. (5 Wheat.) 76, 95, 5 L. Ed. 73 (1820) (\u201cThe rule that penal laws are to be construed strictly ... is perhaps not much less old than construction itself. It is founded on the tenderness of the law for the rights of individuals . . . and on the plain principle that the power of punishment is vested in the legislative, not in the judicial department.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">The language of the statute itself is the first stop on this journey. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Vickers, </em>supra, 260 Conn. 221-22, the issue on appeal was whether the defendant, a welder, who was found to be in possession of a firearm when he was summoned to his supervisor\u2019s office at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>his employer\u2019s manufacturing plant, was at his place of business such that he was exempt from the permit requirement of General Statutes \u00a7 29-28. As we explained therein, the phrase \u201cplace of business\u201d is not defined explicitly in either the text of \u00a7 29-35 (a), or anywhere else in the General Statutes. Therefore, our consideration in <em>Vickers </em>of the meaning of the phrase as used in \u00a7 29-35 (a) was an issue of first impression. Id., 224. We looked first to the common understanding expressed in the law and in dictionaries;.see <em>Caldor, Inc. </em>v. <em>Heffernan, </em>183 Conn. 566, 570-71, 440 A.2d 767 (1981); as well as to sentence structure and the remainder of the statutory section delineating the specific occupations excluded from the permit requirement to conclude that the legislature did not intend the phrase \u201cplace of business\u201d to refer to all employees at all places of employment. <em>State </em>v. <em>Vickers, </em>supra, 224-25. Rather, we determined that the legislature had intended to restrict the presence of unlicensed handguns in the public sphere, and accordingly, we concluded that the statutory exception to the permit requirement is extended only to individuals within their dwelling houses or in their place of business in which they have a proprietary or controlling interest and to those who fall under the specific occupations so delineated. Id., 229.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">The state relies on this legislative intent to argue that, because the legislature\u2019s goal was to limit the number of firearms in the public sphere carried by persons untrained in their use, a motor vehicle <em>cannot </em>be part of the place of business exception. In determining the issue, the majority endorses much of the state\u2019s reasoning supporting its proposed interpretation. I address those arguments separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">First, the state points to General Statutes \u00a7 29-38,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which criminalizes the possession of a weapon in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>motor vehicle without a permit. The state argues that, because it is a crime for someone to have a weapon in a motor vehicle without a permit, reading \u00a7\u00a7 29-35 and 29-38 together, and keeping in mind the goal to limit the access to firearms in public, the legislature could not have intended to allow a motor vehicle to constitute a place of business. The state contends that \u00a7 29-38, the more specific statute, must prevail over \u00a7 29-35, the more general provision dealing with the same subject matter. Subsection (b) of \u00a7 29-38 contains a list of occupations and situations to which the proscriptions in subsection (a) do not apply, and the state maintains that, because taxicab drivers are not included therein, the legislature did not intend to exempt them from the permit requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The defendant has several responses. First, he recognizes the prohibitions listed in \u00a7 29-38, but points out that possession of a pistol in a motor vehicle is not prohibited, but merely is circumscribed to persons with permits. Therefore, the legitimate concerns expressed by the state, and espoused by the majority, about the presence of firearms in the public sphere do not result in possession of the weapon being outlawed, but merely constrained. Additionally, the defendant suggests that, by incorporating the permit statute, \u00a7 29-28, in \u00a7 29-38, it equally is logical to conclude that someone who is exempt from needing to obtain a permit via the \u00a7 29-35 (a) \u201cplace of business\u201d exemption, would also be exempt from prosecution for a violation of \u00a7 29-38. Furthermore, because the legislature did not intend to exclude <em>all </em>taxicab drivers from the permit requirement, but only those whose taxicabs fall within the \u201cplace of business\u201d exception, its failure to include that category <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>of driver in subsection (b) of \u00a7 29-38 does not prohibit an interpretation that a taxicab <em>might </em>qualify under \u00a7 29-35. The defendant contends, therefore, that \u00a7\u00a7 29-35 and 29-38 can be read in harmony, limiting the possession of firearms to those persons who have permits pursuant to \u00a7 29-28, or who fall within the exceptions contained in either \u00a7 29-35 or \u00a7 29-38. In other words, according to the defendant, by incoiporating the permit statute, \u00a7 29-28, in the motor vehicle statute, \u00a7 29-38, it is not irrational as a matter of statutory construction to conclude that someone who is exempt from needing to obtain a permit via the \u00a7 29-35 (a) \u201cplace of business\u201d exception would also be exempt from prosecution for a violation of \u00a7 29-38. Although I do not find the defendant\u2019s reasoning unassailable, I also am not persuaded by the majority\u2019s analysis.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore, upon reflection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>of all the relevant considerations, I consider the defendant\u2019s construal sufficient to provide me with reasonable doubt regarding the operation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Indeed, the language used by other states to limit gun possession is far less ambiguous. Our legislature, in drafting \u00a7 29-35, specifically <em>could have </em>limited the \u201cplace of business\u201d exception to fixed businesses, as evidenced in a number of sister state statutes. See, e.g., Ala. Code \u00a7 13A-11-73 (Michie 1994) (exception for \u201cfixed place of business\u201d); Idaho Code \u00a7 18-3302 (7) (Michie 1997) (same); 720 111. Comp. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 5/24-1 (a) (4) (West 2003) (same); Ind. Code \u00a7 35-47-2-1 (Lexis 1998) (same); Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 21-4201 (a) (4) (1995) (same); N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2C:39-6e (West 1995) (\u201c[fjor the purposes of this section, a place of business shall be deemed to be a fixed location\u201d); N.D. Cent. Code \u00a7 62.1-03-01 (2) (b) (1995) (exception for \u201cfixed place of business\u201d); Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 6106 (a) (1) and (2) (West 2000) (same); S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 16-23-20 (8) (1985) (same); Wash. Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7 9.41.050 (1) (a) (West 1998) (same).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>Finally, I note statutes in other states and jurisdictions in which the legislature provided some modifying language within the statute creating the <em>unambiguous </em>grounds upon which to conclude that place of business refers solely to land. See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 13-3102 (B) (2001) (prohibition against carrying deadly weapon without permit \u201cshall not apply to a person in his dwelling, on his business premises or <em>on real property owned or leased by tha,t person\u201d </em>[emphasis added]); D.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 22-4504 (a) (LexisNexis 2001) (\u201c[n]o person shall carry ... a pistol, without a license ... [1] ... in a place other than the person\u2019s dwelling place, place of business, or <em>on other land possessed by the </em>person\u201d [emphasis added]); Iowa Code \u00a7 724.4 (4) (a) (2001) (defense when person armed with dangerous weapon \u201cin the person\u2019s own dwelling or place of business, or <em>on land owned or possessed by the person\u201d </em>[emphasis added]); Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 750.227 (2) (2003) (\u201c[a] person shall not carry a pistol . . . except in his or her dwelling house, place of business, or <em>on other land possessed by the person, </em>without a license\u201d [emphasis added]); R.I. Gen. Laws \u00a7 11-47-8 (a) (2002) (\u201c[n]o person shall, without a license or permit . . . carry a pistol or revolver . . . except in his or her dwelling house or place of business or <em>on land possessed by him or her\u201d </em>[emphasis added]); S.D. Codified Laws \u00a7 22-14-11 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>(Michie 1998) (prohibition against carrying concealed pistol or revolver without permit \u201cshall not apply to any person ... in his own dwelling house or place of business or <em>on land owned or rented by him or by a member of his </em>household\u201d [emphasis added]). The absence of such modifying language in \u00a7 29-35 is persuasive evidence that our legislature did not intend necessarily to further limit the exceptions in \u00a7 29-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">The state next argues that the statutory development of \u00a7\u00a7 29-35 and 29-38 reveals that the legislature never intended the place, of business exception to apply to motor vehicles. In its original form, \u00a7 29-35 provided that \u201c[n]o person shall carry any pistol or revolver in or upon any vehicle or upon his person, except when such person shall be within his dwelling house or place of business, without a permit to carry the same issued as hereinbefore provided.\u201d Public Acts 1923, c. 252, \u00a7 9. Section 10 of that same Public Act provided for exemptions to \u00a7 9 based on certain occupations and in certain circumstances. Public Acts 1923, c. 252, \u00a7 10. The wording remained virtually identical through 1930, when those two sections of the Public Act were codified together in the revised statutes. See General Statutes (1930 Rev.) \u00a7 2671. Then, in 1935, the legislature created two separate statutes, one pertaining to carrying a pistol without a permit; General Statutes (Cum. Sup. 1935) \u00a7 1009c; the other pertaining to having a pistol in a vehicle. See General Statutes (Cum. Sup. 1935) \u00a7 1010c. The \u201cplace of business\u201d exception was not included in \u00a7 1010c. According to the state, the legislature\u2019s failure to carry over the exception indicates that it did not intend for the exception to apply when motor vehicles were involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">As the defendant points out, there is no legislative history available for the 1935 provisions. Therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>it is hard to look to that change as expressing any authoritative direction on the subject. As we recognized in <em>State </em>v. <em>Vickers, </em>supra, 260 Conn. 227-28, however, subsequent legislative history, specifically as it pertains to No. 81-222 of the 1981 Public Acts, clearly expressed an intent to minimize the possession of firearms in public.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See 24 S. Proc., Pt. 10, 1981 Sess., p. 3146, remarks of Senator Howard T. Owens, Jr. The state is correct that that always has been a significant consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">The interest of protecting the public at large from the unrestricted possession of guns traveling in the public sphere must be balanced, however, against that of property owners in being able to protect their property. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Vickers, </em>supra, 260 Conn. 224-25. Although, in <em>Vickers, </em>we did not define the phrase \u201cpublic sphere,\u201d we looked to the \u201ccommon understanding expressed in the law and in dictionaries.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 224. Doing so again in the present case, I note that the word \u201cpublic\u201d means: \u201cOpen to all; notorious. Commonto all or many; general; open to common use. Belonging to the people at large; relating to or affecting the whole people of a state, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>nation, or community; not limited or restricted to any particular class of the community.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990). Weighed against that consideration is the right to protect one\u2019s property interest. Because a mere employee has no property interest to be balanced against the public interest, however, we concluded in <em>Vickers </em>that the employee in that case was not exempt from the permit requirement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Vickers, </em>supra, 225. A person who has a proprietary interest in his place of business has a recognized interest in protecting that property, however, and when that person is within his place of business, he is <em>not </em>in the public sphere. That remains as true in a taxicab as it does in a store, a restaurant, a club, a theatre, or the like. Indeed, as the trial court recognized in this case, the taxicab driver has the right to exclude the public, to require a passenger to conform to certain rules, and to protect his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">The state next argues that a decision that recognizes a taxicab as a place of business for purposes of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>exemption from carrying a pistol without a permit would be an anomaly.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Indeed, the state contends that \u201c[a]ll the states that have considered the issue have, for various reasons, concluded that the \u2018place of business\u2019 exception should not be applied to taxicabs or other mobile businesses.\u201d Other than the aforementioned states in which the pertinent statutes provide specific linguistic guidance on the issue of whether a taxicab may constitute a place of business; see part IIA of this dissenting opinion; I have found only three states in which the courts have acted in the absence of such direction in deciding whether a taxicab can be a place of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">The courts in New York are split on whether a taxicab constitutes a place of business under the exception in \u00a7 265.02 (4) of the New York Penal Laws.

The New York Court of Appeals, while recognizing the issue of whether a taxicab constitutes a place of business under \u00a7 265.02 (4) of the New York Penal Laws, expressly has declined the opportunity to resolve it. <em>People </em>v. <em>Francis, </em>38 N.Y.2d 150, 152, 341 N.E.2d 640, 379 N.Y.S.2d 21 (1975) (\u201cwe do not today decide the question of whether the place of business exception should apply to one in defendant\u2019s position\u201d). Accordingly, the law in New York remains unsettled concerning the applicability of the place of business exception to taxicabs. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Malave, </em>124 Misc. 2d 210, 215, 476 N.Y.S.2d 422 (1984) (noting \u201cthe unsettled state of the case law\u201d concerning meaning of \u201cplace of business\u201d); <em>People </em>v. <em>Allison, </em>117 Misc. 2d 463, 464 n.1, 458 N.Y.S.2d 496 (1983) (noting disagreement among New York courts concerning issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>of whether taxicab is place of business); <em>People </em>v. <em>McWilliams, </em>96 Misc. 2d 648, 653-54, 409 N.Y.S.2d 610 (1978) (noting \u201cthat this area of the law is at best, unsettled,\u201d and concluding that \u201c[i]f the \u2018place of business exception\u2019 has any application to a taxicab, it should apply to the taxi driver who possesses a loaded firearm in his taxi, without utilizing it for any purpose outside of his role as a driver. Since there has been no definitive appellate determination on this particular issue, its resolution should be left to the trier of fact.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The courts in California similarly have been indecisive concerning the question of whether the place of business exception of \u00a7 12026 of the California Penal Code applies to taxicabs.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In <em>People </em>v. <em>Marotta, </em>128 Cal. App. 3d Sup. 1, 6, 180 Cal. Rptr. 611 (1981), the Appellate Department of the Superior Court concluded that the place of business exception applies to taxicabs. The court reasoned that a taxicab \u201cis as much a place of business as a store in a fixed location. This is where the cab driver worked and collected his fees. The driver had no other business location which the cab served to facilitate, such as a store\u2019s delivery truck, where the truck is not the location of the enterprise, but merely the means to facilitate the store\u2019s business.\u201d Id., 5. The court further stated: \u201cThe term \u2018place of business\u2019 has no set or established meaning in California case or code law. Importing into these words the limitation of a fixed geographic location is unsupported in the law. In California\u2019s highly mobile culture many business enterprises have no fixed geographic location. Even such staid institutions as banks often use mobile facilities.\u201d Id., 6. Finally, the court noted that, \u201c[h]ad the Legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>ture intended to . . . exclude vehicles from the compass of the words \u2018place of business,\u2019 it could easily have done so.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Thereafter, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Wooten, </em>168 Cal. App. 3d 168, 173, 214 Cal. Rptr. 36 (1985), the California Court of Appeal declined to extend the place of business exception to the case of a bounty hunter who had been convicted of carrying a concealed, loaded pistol in the glove compartment of his pickup truck. Noting that <em>\u201cMarotta </em>is readily distinguishable,\u201d the court reasoned: \u201cWhile taxicab drivers must do business in their cabs, bounty hunters do not. Their job is to get out of their car and arrest bail jumpers, not to run over them. The vehicle is simply a means to transport the bounty hunter. Unlike a taxi driver whose work cannot be done without a vehicle, bounty hunters may leave their own cars behind and use airplanes, buses, trains or taxis to pursue bail jumpers.\u201d Id. The court went on to criticize the reasoning of <em>Marotta, </em>remarking that \u201c[t]he natural meaning of the term \u2018place of business\u2019 is a fixed location,\u201d and does not include mobile businesses. Id. Additionally, the court concluded that \u00a7 12026 of the California Penal Code was not unconstitutionally vague because \u201c[t]he phrase \u2018place of business\u2019 has a [narrow] meaning . . . [that] is used to describe stores, offices, warehouses, etc. . . . [and] not mobile pieces of personal property.\u201d Id., 174-75. Nonetheless, <em>Wooten </em>did not overrule <em>Marotta </em>explicitly, nor have any more recent decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">Finally, I note that the Arkansas Supreme Court decisively has interpreted the exceptions to that state\u2019s statute prohibiting the carrying of a weapon without a permit. Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 5-73-120 (c) (Michie Sup. 2003) provides in relevant part: \u201cIt is a defense to a prosecution under this section that at the time of the act of carrying a weapon . . . [c] [t]he person is in his or her own dwelling, place of business, or on property in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>he or she has a possessory or proprietary interest . . . .\u201d In <em>Boston </em>v. <em>State, </em>330 Ark. 99, 101, 952 S.W.2d 671 (1997), the court concluded that this exception does not apply to taxicabs. Because \u201c[i]n three of the other exemption sections [of \u00a7 5-73-120 of the Arkansas Code Annotated], the legislature created exceptions in instances where a person was in an automobile,\u201d the court held that \u201c[t]he exemption for a \u2018business\u2019 is contained in a subsection of the statute which pertains to real property . . . .\u2019\u2019Id. Therefore, these jurisdictions provide little guidance or insight into whether a decision that a taxicab can be a place of business for purposes of an exemption from carrying a pistol without a permit would indeed be an anomaly.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">Finally, I return to the rule of lenity. \u201cWhen the statute in question is one of a criminal nature ... we must refrain from imposing criminal liability [when] the legislature has not expressly so intended. . . . [C]riminal statutes are not to be read more broadly than their language plainly requires and ambiguities are ordinarily to be resolved in favor of the defendant. . . . Finally, unless a contrary interpretation would frustrate an evident legislative intent, criminal statutes are governed by the fundamental principle that such statutes are strictly construed against the state.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>255 Conn. 782, 788-89, 772 A.2d 559 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Harrell, </em>238 Conn. 828, 832, 681 A.2d 944 (1996), emphasizing that a criminal statute should not be applied so as to impose criminal liability unless the legislature has <em>\u201cexpressly </em>so intended\u201d; (emphasis in original); we \u201cdetermined as a matter of statutory interpretation that the word \u2018murder\u2019 as used in \u00a7 53a-54b means intentional murder as defined by Public Acts 1973, No. 73-137, \u00a7 2, now codified as [General Statutes] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>\u00a7 53a-54a(a). [See id., 835-36.] Therefore, we concluded in <em>Harrell </em>that the defendant\u2019s conviction for arson murder in violation of [General Statutes] \u00a7 53a-54d could not serve as a predicate murder for purposes of the capital felony statute.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Coltherst, </em>263 Conn. 478, 500, 820 A.2d 1024 (2003), citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Harrell, </em>supra, 839. Similarly, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>241 Conn. 702, 712, 699 A.2d 57 (1997), we rejected the state\u2019s claim that the defendant\u2019s conviction of felony murder could serve as the predicate for capital felony when the defendant\u2019s codefendant had an intent to kill, concluding that the \u201crequirement [under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54b] of an intentional murder refers to the underlying murder that the defendant was <em>convicted of </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Sostre, </em>supra, 261 Conn. 142, we stated that \u201c[e]ven if we were to conclude, however, that it is simply uncertain whether [General Statutes] \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (6) was intended to apply to a capital felony committed during the course of a robbery, <em>when a reasonable doubt persists about a statute\u2019s intended scope even after resort to the language and structure, legislative history, and motivating policies of the statute . . . we apply the rule of lenity and resolve any ambiguity in favor of the defendant.\u201d </em>(Citation omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) See <em>Moskal </em>v. <em>United States, </em>498 U.S. 103, 108, 111 S. Ct. 461, 112 L. Ed. 2d 449 (1990) (\u201cwe . . . [reserve] lenity for those situations in which a reasonable doubt persists about a statute\u2019s intended scope even <em>after </em>resort to \u2018the language and structure, legislative history, and motivating policies\u2019 of the statute\u201d [emphasis in original]). The defendant argues in the present case that if the language of \u00a7 29-35, its legislative history and the motivating policies do not <em>clearly </em>support his interpretation, we are <em>at least </em>faced with an ambiguity, thereby implicating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>the rale of lenity, which favors his construction of the exemption provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Because I have a reasonable doubt about the application of the exemption to the defendant\u2019s taxicab, I agree with the defendant. Indeed, the absence in \u00a7 29-35 of qualifying terms such as \u201cfixed,\u201d \u201cland\u201d or \u201creal property,\u201d on the one hand, or explicit reference to motor vehicles, on the other; see footnote 4 of this dissenting opinion; makes the defendant\u2019s invocation of the rale of lenity particularly appropriate. Therefore, I would conclude that the defendant\u2019s taxicab, over which he had exclusive control, falls within the \u201cplace of business\u201d exemption of \u00a7 29-35 (a). In so concluding, I recognize the laudatory general purpose of \u00a7 29-35 to control the threat to public safety in the indiscriminate possession and carrying of concealed and loaded weapons, while also giving effect to the express exception that allows businesspersons to protect their property. Indeed, I cannot choose to take note of one legislative purpose, so as to achieve the admirable social end of stronger gun control, while ignoring the intent of the legislative purpose embodied in the exceptions. That goal\u2014to allow businesspersons to possess weapons to protect their property\u2014is as important to a taxicab driver as it is to a businessperson in a fixed locale,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> while the possible danger to the public posed by taxicab <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>drivers with guns is no more serious than that posed by armed retail store operators.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Finally, I am not unaware of the hypothetical scenarios that the State threatens will result from this opinion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Consistent with how this court decides cases, we cannot forecast how any particular hypothetical situation will be resolved. Any person reading the terms of \u00a7 29-35 in conjunction with this opinion, however, should appreciate that the exemption for residences and places of business would not extend to the vehicle used by <em>every </em>businessperson who must travel in the course of his or her business. The phrase \u201cplace of business\u201d has a narrower meaning than each of its component terms. On the other hand, where it is not possible to perform the business without using the vehicle, its mobility, in and of itself, should not preclude its consideration as a \u201cplace of business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<blockquote id=\"b242-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 29-35, entitled \u201cCarrying of pistol or revolver without permit prohibited.

I suggest that this is the same anomaly permitted by the legislature in its decision to allow a firearm in a motor vehicle when a permit, has been granted pursuant to \u00a7 29-28, but not allow these other weapons for which a permit is not authorized. See General Statutes \u00a7 29-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">The majority also is persuaded that, as a practical matter, the defendant\u2019s proposed reading of the statute would be unworkable. For example, if a taxicab driver left his vehicle to get lunch, he would be required to leave his loaded pistol in the taxicab and the pistol would potentially be accessible to the public at large. This trepidation exists either way this case is resolved. The permit requirement certainly would allow the taxicab driver to remove the gun at any time, but does not guarantee that he will not leave the firearm unattended in the vehicle nonetheless.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">The majority also relies on the permit requirement in \u00a7 29-28 as evidence of the legislature\u2019s intent to minimize the possible harm to the public from firearms through misuse or accident. To allow a person without training to have a pistol in a motor vehicle greatly increases the likelihood of harm because, if the firearm is discharged, the bullet likely will exit the vehicle and enter the public arena. Finally, the majority relies on the \u201csix limited exceptions to \u00a7 29-35\u2019s general prohibition against the possession of a handgun without a permit outside of a dwelling house or place of business\u201d and the \u201csevere restrictions on the manner in which an unlicensed handgun may be transported\u201d as representative of \u201cthe legislature\u2019s recognition that, on occasion, it may be necessary to transport an unlicensed handgun from a dwelling house or place of business to another location for a specific and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>limited purpose . . . [and] is indicative of the overriding purpose of \u00a7 29-35 (a), namely, to curtail the possession of unlicensed handguns in the public arena.\u201d As the defendant cautions, however, the exposure to the danger of firearms can be far greater in stationary places of business, like restaurants, where there are more potential victims than in a motor vehicle. Moreover, these various exceptions deal with <em>transportation to and from </em>a dwelling house or place of business, and do not address the issue of what is a dwelling house or a place of business.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b250-10\"> Similarly, five other states that have enacted statutes addressed to the carrying of a weapon in a motor vehicle have differentiated between private automobiles and common carriers, thereby providing better guidance.

Senator Howard T. Owens, Jr., explained that the purpose of the mandatory minimum sentence was to provide \u201ca warning to those [who] might go out and use [a] handgun for some illicit reason ... to leave their handgun at home, because if they do [not] and they\u2019re caught with it. . . they have the problem of this mandatory sentence.\u201d 24 S. Proc., Pt. 10, 1981 Sess., p. 3146. During the discussion of the bill in the House of Representatives, Representative Robert G. Jaekle expressed a similar rationale: \u201cIf you want to keep your gun in your home or place of business, you don\u2019t even need a permit; but if you want to carry it out on the street where you and I and our constituents walk, by golly, get a permit. That\u2019s what our present law says. That\u2019s what this bill seeks to enforce.\u201d 24 H.R. Proc., Pt. 12, 1981 Sess., pp. 3845-46.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b254-8\"> <em>In State </em>v. <em>Vickers, </em>supra, 260 Conn. 225, we noted that \u201c[t]he remainder of [\u00a7 29-35 (a)] delineates the specific jobs that also are excluded from the permit requirement.\u201d See also footnote 1 of this dissenting opinion. \u201cWe have stated that [ujnless there is evidence to the contrary, statutory itemization indicates that the legislature intended [a] list to be exclusive.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Vickers, </em>supra, 225. Therefore, we determined that \u201cthe legislature did not intend the phrase \u2018place of business\u2019 to refer to all employees at all places of employment.\u201d Id. Rather, \u201cthe statutory exception is extended only to individuals within their dwelling houses or in their place of business in which they have a proprietary or controlling interest and to those who fall under the specific occupations so delineated.\u201d Id., 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">In the present case, the issue is not whether the statutory exception of \u00a7 29-35 applies to all taxicab drivers, as an occupational class. Rather, the question is whether a taxicab is a place of business. If a taxicab indeed is a place of business, then the individual who has a proprietary or controlling interest in that taxicab is exempt from the permitting requirements of \u00a7 29-35, irrespective of whether he falls within a specific occupation delineated therein. Accordingly, the inclusion of the list of excluded occupations is of little value to the inquiry.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b255-7\"> Certainly, it would not be an anomaly in Connecticut to recognize that a building need not be stationary. Indeed, the legislature has chosen to treat stationary structures and motor vehicles identically for purposes of determining whether a burglary has transpired. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-100 (a) (1) (\u201c \u2018[bjuilding\u2019 in addition to its ordinary meaning, includes any . . . vehicle\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b257-7\"> Section 12026 of the California Penal Code provides an exception for weapons kept within one\u2019s \u201cplace of residence\u201d or \u201cplace of business.\u201d In 1988, the California legislature expanded \u00a7 12026 to include an exception for weapons kept \u201con private property owned or lawfully possessed by the citizen or legal resident.\u201d Cal. Penal Code \u00a7 12026; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Melton, </em>206 Cal. App. 3d 580, 593, 253 Cal. Rptr. 661 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b261-7\"> According to a study by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, 431 taxicab drivers died from job-related iiquries between 1992 and 1995. Of these fatalities, 338 were homicides. A. Knestaut, \u201cFatalities and Injuries Among Truck and Taxicab Drivers,\u201d 2 Compensation and Working Conditions 55, 59, table 3 (1997). \u201cCabdrivers had the highest homicide rate\u201432 homicides per 100,000\u2014among the occupations most affected by deadly violence. This rate is four times more than that of police officers. Robbery appeared to be the motive in many cases. . . . Several factors help to explain why taxicab drivers are frequent victims of this crime: They work alone, frequently at night, and handle cash. In addition, taxicab drivers tend to work in areas, such as inner cities, with higher crime rates.\u201d Id., 55.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b262-12\"> Equally of concern is the hypothetical scenario that could result from the limiting of \u00a7 29-35 to stationary structures. Indeed, as the defendant points out, in the absence of a fixed locale limitation in either the dwelling exception or the place of business exception, such a limitation would expose dwellers in mobile homes to criminal prosecution as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
