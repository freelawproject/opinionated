The named defendant,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the department of mental retardation, argues that the decision of the review board was proper, and further argues that any other outcome would result in a double recovery for the plaintiff. For the reasons set forth in <em>Starks </em>v. <em>University of Connecticut, </em>supra, 21-29, we conclude that, because the State Employees Retirement Act, contained in chapter 66 of the General Statutes,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> already provides for a statutory offset of certain workers\u2019 compensation benefits; see General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 5-169 (g) and 5-192p (d); see footnotes 12 and 13 of this opinion; the calculation of the plaintiffs \u00a7 31-308a benefits should not have considered any amounts received as state disability retirement benefits. We, therefore, reverse the decision of the review board.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">The record reveals the following undisputed facts and procedural histoiy. On August 8, 1987, the plaintiff was employed by the defendant as a cook at the South-bury Training School, when she suffered a compensable injury that left her with a 25 percent permanent partial disability of her back. At the time of the injury, the plaintiff earned an average weekly wage of $297. She was awarded 130 weeks of permanent partial disability benefits pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 31-308,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which entitles an employee suffering aperma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>nent disability to a specified body part to payment of a fixed amount of benefits. Her compensation rate was $198.57 per week. Due to her injury, the plaintiff was unable to return to her position as a cook at the South-bury Training School. Consequently, she completed vocational rehabilitation and, since approximately March 1, 1998, she has been employed privately on a light duty basis, earning less than what she had earned at her former state position with the defendant. After her specific indemnity benefits expired, on approximately January 23, 1997, the plaintiff was awarded 165 weeks of benefits pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 31-308a, which permits the commissioner, on a discretionary basis, to grant additional benefits \u201cequal to two-thirds of the difference between the wages currently earned by an employee in a position comparable to the position held by such injured employee prior to his injury and the weekly amount which such employee will probably be able to earn thereafter . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> These supplemental benefits expired on approximately February 7, 1999. Subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>quently, the plaintiff requested another \u00a7 31-308a award retrospective to February 7, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">In 1999, the plaintiff was awarded a state disability retirement pension, retrospective to January 1, 1997, and began receiving benefits of approximately $275 per week. The defendant refused the plaintiffs request for additional \u00a7 31-308a benefits on the basis that the commissioner should take into consideration the benefits she received from her state disability retirement pension. The parties stipulated that, if the plaintiffs state disability retirement benefits were added to the amount she received in wages from her employment in a light duty position, she would not be entitled to receive any \u00a7 31-308a benefits.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">In proceedings before the commissioner, the defendant argued that the plaintiffs disability retirement pension should be considered in determining her \u00a7 31-308a benefit and that such benefit should be reduced accordingly. The commissioner agreed and, as a result, factored that amount in the calculation, thereby deciding not to award a \u00a7 31-308a benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">The plaintiff filed a petition for review on November 21, 2001, disagreeing with the commissioner\u2019s determination that the receipt of state disability retirement benefits should be included in the calculation of \u00a7 31-308a benefits. In an opinion issued October 25, 2002, the review board rejected the plaintiffs appeal, determining that the offset of disability retirement benefits was appropriate under its prior ruling in <em>Iannarone </em>v. <em>Dept. of Mental Retardation, </em>4138 CRB-7-99-10 (June 15, 2001), in which the review board held that a state disability pension should be included in the amount a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>claimant is \u201cable to earn thereafter\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 31-308a. In further support of its decision, the review board stated that General Statutes \u00a7 31-314<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> mandates such an offset because it requires that \u201cdue allowance shall be made for any sum which the employer has paid to any injured employee or to his dependents on account of the injury . . . .\u201d The review board noted that the application of \u00a7 31-314 to the plaintiffs receipt of state disability retirement benefits was consistent with the general rule prohibiting a double recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">\u201cAs a threshold matter, we set forth the standard of review applicable to workers\u2019 compensation appeals. ... It is well established that [although not dispositive, we accord great weight to the construction given to the workers\u2019 compensation statutes by the commissioner and [the review] board.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Kuehl v. Z-Loda Systems Engineering, Inc., </em>265 Conn. 525, 532, 829 A.2d 818 (2003). \u201cIt is well settled that we do not defer to the [review] board\u2019s construction of a statute\u2014a question of law\u2014when, as in the present case, the provisions at issue previously have not been subjected to judicial scrutiny or when the [review] board\u2019s interpretation has not been time tested.\u201d <em>Rayhall </em>v. <em>Akim Co., </em>263 Conn. 328, 354, 819 A. 2d 803 (2003). Accordingly, because this issue is one of first impression for our courts, our review is plenary.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">On appeal, the plaintiff argues that the review board\u2019s decision in <em>Iannarone </em>v. <em>Dept. of Mental Retardation, </em>supra, 4138 CRB-7-99-10, was incorrect when the review board concluded that benefits received under the state disability retirement plan should be considered part of \u201cthe weekly amount which such employee will probably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>be able to earn thereafter\u201d under \u00a7 31-308a. Instead, the plaintiff contends that because the statute expressly provides that benefits are \u201cto be determined . . . based upon the nature and extent of the injury, the training, education and experience of the employee, [and] the availability of work for persons with such physical condition and at the employee\u2019s age\u201d; General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 31-308a; the commissioner\u2019s award determination is confined to the consideration of such enumerated factors. The plaintiff further argues that disability retirement benefits should not be considered toward a claimant\u2019s \u201c \u2018earnings\u2019 \u201d or their \u201c \u2018earning power,\u2019 \u201d and thus, should not be taken into consideration in calculating a \u00a7 31-308a award.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">The defendant relies on the review board\u2019s decision in <em>Iannarone </em>v. <em>Dept. of Mental Retardation, </em>supra, 4138 CRB-7-99-10, as well as its decision in the companion case, <em>Starks </em>v. <em>University of Connecticut, </em>4467 CRB-2-02-12 (February 13, 2003), in which the review board determined that a claimant\u2019s \u00a7 31-308a award should take into consideration any state disability retirement benefits the claimant is receiving in order to avoid a double recovery. The defendant contends that the review board\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 31-308a was proper, particularly in light of the instruction of \u00a7 31-314 to make \u201cdue allowance . . . for any sum which the employer has paid to any injured employee . . . .\u201d The defendant also argues that, because \u00a7 3 l-308a benefits are purely discretionary; see General Statues (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 31-308a (\u201cthe commissioner . . . <em>may </em>award additional compensation benefits\u201d [emphasis added]); a commissioner has very broad discretion in determining a \u00a7 31-308a award, and is therefore not confined solely to the enumerated factors set forth in the statute.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>Our decision in <em>Starks </em>v. <em>University of Connecticut, </em>supra, 270 Conn. 1, is dispositive of this claim. For the reasons set forth in that case, we conclude that the legislature explicitly has provided for an offset mechanism under either under \u00a7 5-169 (g),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>governs Tier I retirees, or \u00a7 5-192p (d),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> which governs Tier II retirees, and therefore benefits awarded under \u00a7 31-308a need not be offset by a claimant\u2019s receipt of state disability retirement benefits.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>The decision of the review board is reversed and the case is remanded for recalculation of the plaintiffs \u00a7 31-308a benefits award.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b52-6\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 31-308a provides: \u201cIn addition to the compensation benefits provided by section 31-308 for specific loss of a member or use of the function of a member of the body, or any personal injury covered by this chapter, the commissioner, after such payments provided by said section 31-308 have been paid for the period set forth in said section, may award additional compensation benefits for such partial permanent disability equal to two-thirds of the difference between the wages currently earned by an employee in a position comparable to the position held by such injured employee prior to his injury and the weekly amount which such employee will probably be able to earn thereafter, to be determined by the commissioner based upon the nature and extent of the injury, the training, education and experience of the employee, the availability of work for persons with such physical condition and at the employee\u2019s age, but not more than the maximum provided in section 31-309. If evidence of exact loss of earnings is not available, such loss may be computed from the proportionate loss of physical ability or earning power caused by the injury. The duration of such additional compensation shall be determined upon a similar basis by the commissioner.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b52-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b52-8\"> The plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b53-6\"> Berkley Administrators was also named as a defendant in this appeal.
