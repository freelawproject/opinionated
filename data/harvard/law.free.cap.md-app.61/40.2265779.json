The results range from the farcical <em>(The Comedy of Errors, </em>Shakespeare) to the adventuresome <em>(The Prince And The Pauper, Puddinhead Wilson, </em>Twain) to the heroic <em>(A Tale Of Two Cities, </em>Dickens).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">This case presents a variation on the theme. It involves not people, but horses; the result is neither farcical, nor adventuresome, nor heroic, but economic.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-10\">Harland W. Sanders, appellant, is an experienced breeder and owner of thoroughbred horses. He started in the business in 1970; trading as Quality Hills Stables, he is licensed in eight States, including Maryland. He has had twenty or more horses in his stable at given times and in 1975, 1976, and 1977, ranked within the top fifteen stables nationally in terms of wins.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-11\">In 1976, Sanders acquired a thoroughbred stallion named Dare to Command; in 1977, he acquired another thoroughbred stallion named Large as Life. Except for a triangular white snip on the nose of Dare to Command, the two horses looked alike; they were both chestnut in color and were about the same size, although Sanders said that Dare to Command was more \u201crobust.\u201d The look-alikes were not alike in ability or value, however, and therein lie the seeds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>of this controversy. Dare to Command was the better performer and therefore the more valuable horse.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Sanders turned the two horses over to King T. Leather-bury, an experienced and licensed trainer, for the purpose of training and racing them, and both horses were, indeed, entered in a number of races. In June, 1977, Sanders sent both horses to Leatherbury\u2019s farm for a rest; they remained there for three months. In September, 1977, the two horses were shipped, together, to the Steele Farm in Kentucky, apparently for the purpose of selling them. In December, 1977, Sanders received an offer of $100,000 for Dare to Command, which he rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">In February, 1978, Sanders directed that Dare to Command be returned to Maryland for further training and racing under Leatherbury\u2019s care. Unfortunately, someone in Kentucky sent back Large as Life, rather than Dare to Command. Notwithstanding that a routine comparison of the horse and the foal certificate that accompanied it would have revealed the error, Leatherbury failed to discover the switch. Later that month, Dare to Command, under the name of Large as Life, was sold to a Florida buyer for $25,000. Large as Life, meanwhile, parading as Dare to Command, was at Leatherbury\u2019s farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">On May 27, 1978, Leatherbury, on Sanders\u2019 behalf, entered Large as Life, <em>sub nom </em>Dare to Command, in the seventh race at Pimlico. The horse was permitted to run, and finished sixth, twenty-three lengths behind the winner. On June 24, 1978, Leatherbury entered the horse, as Dare to Command, in the seventh race at Pimlico; he (the horse) again was permitted to run, and came in seventh, twenty lengths behind the winner. Sanders, laboring under the belief that the horse entered in these races was indeed Dare to Command, was understandably disappointed by these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>dismal results; he concluded that the horse was not worth what he had initially thought. In September, 1978, still in the belief that the horse was Dare to Command, he sold it for $35,000. Some time in 1979, the error was discovered. The respective buyers exchanged the horses, so that each ended up with the right horse, and Sanders looked around for someone to sue. For some reason, he neglected the obvious targets \u2014 Leatherbury and whoever put the wrong horse in the van in. Kentucky \u2014 and sued instead James Joseph Rowan and the owner of Pimlico Race Course, The Maryland Jockey Club, Inc. (hereafter Pimlico).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Rowan was employed by Pimlico as an \u201cidentifier.\u201d Under regulations promulgated by the Maryland Racing Commission, a horse may not be permitted to start a ra^ce unless it has been \u201cfully identified.\u201d COMAR 09.10.01.17K. This identification is made by the \u201cidentifier,\u201d an employee of the track. Before a race, the trainers or their assistants bring the horses entered in the race to the paddock area to be examined by the identifier and saddled. The identifier, armed with the foal certificates for those horses, checks each horse. He does what Leatherbury could have done in February; he compares the markings on the horse and a tattoo on the horse\u2019s lip against the markings and tattoo listed on the foal certificate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If the markings or tattoo do not match those shown on the foal certificate, the identifier immediately notifies the racing stewards and the horse is scratched.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The theory of Sanders\u2019 action was that Rowan, the identifier on May 27 and June 24, 1978, was negligent in failing to note that the horse entered by Leatherbury on those days was not, in fact, Dare to Command and thus in allowing Large as Life, a poorer racehorse, to run under the name of Dare to Command. Rowan should have reasonably foreseen, averred Sanders, that the proximate result of his negligence would be a loss in Dare to Command\u2019s valu\u00e9 as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>racing and breeding prospect. Pimlico, of course, was sued on the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior; </em>as Rowan\u2019s employer, it was liable for his negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Rowan and Pimlico answered Sanders\u2019 declaration and filed third-party claims against Leatherbury. Their basic position was that Leatherbury was the real culprit in the matter in that (1) on both occasions, he brought the wrong horse to the paddock, and (2) even after the two races \u2014 during the period from June 24 to the time the horse was sold in September \u2014 he should have discovered the switch. Had Leatherbury exercised due care in either situation, they claimed, the misimpression under which Sanders was laboring would either have been avoided or corrected, and the loss would not have occurred. As Leatherbury was Sanders\u2019 agent, they urged, his negligence is imputable to Sanders, thereby making Sanders guilty of contributory negligence in the matter. In any event, even if Leatherbury\u2019s negligence were not imputable to Sanders, Leatherbury, as the primary negligent actor, would be liable to them for indemnification.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">All of this was submitted to a jury in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, on issues. The jury answered the issues thusly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-7\">\u201c1. Was James J. Rowan negligent on 5/27/78 and 6/24/78 in identifying \u2018Large as Life\u2019 as \u2018Dare to Command\u2019?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-8\"><em>S </em>Yes _No</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-9\">(a) If your answer is \u2018Yes\u2019, was that negligence a cause of the reduction in value of \u2018Dare to Command\u2019 complained of by the plaintiff, Harland W.

Was Mr. Sanders negligent in allowing \u2018Large as Life\u2019 to be entered in the Pimlico races of 5/27/78 and 6/24/78 under the name of \u2018Dare to Command\u2019?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-5\">_Yes / No</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-6\">(a) If your answer is \u2018Yes\u2019, was that negligence a cause of the reduction in value of \u2018Dare to Command\u2019 complained of by Mr. Sanders?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-7\">-Yes _No</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-8\">4. Was Mr. Sanders or any agent of his acting under his direction and control negligent in failing to discover the mistaken entry of \u2018Large as Life\u2019 instead of \u2018Dare to Command\u2019 in the Pimlico races of 5/27/78 and 6/24/78 before \u2018Dare to Command\u2019 was sold in September of 1978?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-9\">..

Sanders appeals, complaining that:</p>\n<p id=\"b84-13\">(1) The court erred by not ruling as a matter of law that Leatherbury was an independent contractor and non-servant and that Sanders is not, therefore, vicariously liable for his negligence;</p>\n<p id=\"b84-14\">(2) The court erred in its instruction concerning Sanders\u2019 vicarious liability; and</p>\n<p id=\"b84-15\">(3) The court erred in submitting to the jury the issue of whether Sanders or his agent was negligent between June 24, 1978 (the second entry at Pimlico) and the time he sold what he thought was Dare to Command.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-16\">We find no error, and shall therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-17\">\n<em>Leatherbury\u2019s Status</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b84-18\">In the present posture of the case, the issues of whether Leatherbury was negligent in bringing the wrong horse to the paddock and whether that negligence was a cause of the reduction in Dare to Command\u2019s value are not before us. Those issues were decided by the jury (see Issues 2 and 2(a) above) and no complaint about them is made here. Sanders seeks, rather, to escape the effect of the jury\u2019s findings on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>those issues by contending that Leatherbury was neither his employee nor his agent, but was instead an independent contractor. Issue 2(b), he argues, should not have been submitted to the jury; as a matter of law the court should have answered it in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">Appellees\u2019 initial response to this is that Sanders failed to object to the submission of that issue to the jury and has therefore waived his right to appellate review of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">The record shows that Sanders did not move for a directed verdict on the question of Leatherbury\u2019s status as an employee or independent contractor, although he could have done so. He clearly made no objection to the court\u2019s submission of Issues 1, 1(a), 2, and 2(a) to the jury. He began to address the question of Leatherbury\u2019s agency in the context of Issues 2(b), 3(a), and 4(a) when the court interrupted and declared that Leatherbury\u2019s status <em>vis a vis </em>Sanders was an issue of fact for the jury to determine. Sanders responded that he was \u201cnot going to belabor it\u201d but urged that, by virtue of COMAR 09.10.01.57P, making the trainer the \u201cabsolute insurer of the horse he has entered,\u201d any agency relationship had been abrogated. We think that is enough to preserve the issue. <em>See Sergeant Co. v. Pickett, </em>283 Md. 284, 388 A.2d 543 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Our conclusion that the issue is preserved will avail Sanders naught, however, for we find the complaint to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">The legal theories and distinctions sought to be applied by Sanders arise primarily from actions by third parties who have suffered some physical injury by reason of the tortious physical conduct of a person claimed to be the employee or agent of someone else. Redress is sought against the alleged employer/principal on the basis of vicarious liabili<em>ty </em>\u2014 respondeat <em>superior </em>\u2014 and the defense is interposed that the tortious actor was not that defendant\u2019s employee or agent but was instead an independent contractor. It is in that setting that the courts have generally identified these types of relationships \u2014 master/servant (or employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>er/employee), principal/agent, and independent contractor \u2014 and drawn distinctions between and among them with respect to the asserted vicarious liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">What emerges from these cases is that the principal/agent relationship is a generic one \u2014 a genus, of which the master/servant relationship is a species. Thus, while all masters are principals and all servants are agents, there are some principals who are not masters and some agents who are not servants. Agents who are not servants are regarded as independent contractors. <em>See Restatement of Agency 2d, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, 220; Comments d and e to \u00a7 1; Comment a to \u00a7 2; and Introductory Note to Title B of Chapter 7, preceding \u00a7 219; but <em>compare </em>1 <em>Mechem On Agency, </em>2d ed., \u00a7\u00a7 36-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">The distinctions between servants and other (non-servant) agents have been stated in various ways. In <em>Henkelmann v. Insurance Co., </em>180 Md. 591, 600, 26 A.2d 418 (1942), the Court, speaking through Judge Delaplaine, stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AhG\">\u201c[t]he distinction between an agent [who is not a servant] and a servant is that an agent [who is not a servant] is employed to represent his principal in reference to some contractual obligation with a third person, whereas a servant is employed to render service to, rather than for, the master.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">In <em>Globe Indemnity Co. v. Victill Corp., </em>208 Md. 573, 581, 119 A.2d 423 (1956), again through Judge Delaplaine, the Court restated the distinction thusly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-8\">\u201cAn agent is a person who represents another in .contractual negotiations or transactions akin thereto. A servant is a person who is employed to perform personal services for another in his affairs, and who, in respect to his physical movements in the performance of the service, is subject to the other\u2019s control or right of control. Persons who render service but retain control over the manner of doing it are not servants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number><em>Compare Restatement 2d, </em>Introductory Note to Chapter 7, Title B, which is generally consistent with the approach taken in <em>Globe Indemnity Co.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">It is clear, from subsequent cases, that although there are several criteria for determining whether an agent is, or is not, a servant, the ultimate test is that of control. If the principal \u201ccontrols or has the right to control the physical conduct of the other in the performance of the service,\u201d the relationship is that of master/servant. <em>Restatement 2d, </em>\u00a7 2(1); <em>B.P. Oil Corp. v. Mabe, </em>279 Md. 632, 370 A.2d 554 (1977); <em>L.M.T. Steel Products v. Peirson, </em>47 Md.App. 633, 425 A.2d 242 (1981). If there is not that degree of control or right of control, the agent is not a servant, but an independent contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">These distinctions, however stated, have little meaning in themselves; they are important only in defining the duties flowing between the principal and the agent and the principal\u2019s liability to third parties harmed by the tortious physical act of the agent. In the latter regard, the prevailing rule is that, where the relationship is that of master/servant, the master is answerable for the tort of the servant committed while acting in the scope of his employment; where the agent is not a servant, the principal is not liable for the agent\u2019s negligent conduct \u201cunless the act was done in the manner authorized or directed by the principal, or the result was one authorized or intended by the principal.\u201d <em>Henkelmann v. Insurance Co., supra, </em>180 Md. 591, 601, 26 A.2d 418; <em>Globe Indemnity Co. v. Victill Corp., supra, </em>208 Md. 573, 119 A.2d 423; <em>Cox v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>296 Md. 162, 460 A.2d 1038 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Those are the principles sought to be applied here by Sanders. Leatherbury, he argues, clearly was not his servant, either generally or as to the matter in question. Leatherbury was in business for himself. He trained horses for several owners and was himself an owner. Sanders did not have or exercise the right to control the precise manner in which Leatherbury carried out his duties. Moreover, Sand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>ers urges, Leatherbury did not act in a manner authorized or directed by him, and he did not authorize or intend the result that occurred. Accordingly, he is not answerable for Leatherbury\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">What Sanders overlooks is that the liability of a principal for the wrongful acts of his agent is not governed solely by the concepts emanating from these physical injury cases. There is a range of tortious conduct on the part of an agent that may bind the principal and subject him to liability even where the agent is <em>not </em>a servant, where the act was <em>not </em>done in the manner authorized or directed by the principal, and where the result was <em>not </em>authorized or intended by the principal. The principles expressed in <em>Henkelmann, Globe Indemnity Co., </em>and <em>Cox, </em>in other words, do not represent the whole law in this area, but only part of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">We can see this, almost at a glance, by examining briefly Chapter 7 of the <em>Restatement of Agency 2d, </em>in particular Titles B, C, and D thereof. Title B deals specifically with the master/servant relationship; it defines a \u201cservant\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 220-227) and the concept of \u201cscope of employment\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 228-237), and it sets forth the kinds of tortious acts on the part of a servant for which a master may be held liable (\u00a7\u00a7 219, 243-249). Title C is somewhat broader in scope. It describes the situations in which a principal\u2019s liability for the torts of his agent is <em>not </em>dependent upon the agent being a servant. That is the area we need to explore.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">. Section 250 introduces Title C with the general statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AiW\">\u201cA principal is not liable for <em>physical harm </em>caused by the negligent <em>physical conduct </em>of a non-servant agent during the performance of the principal\u2019s business, if he neither intended nor authorized the result nor the manner of performance, unless he was under a duty to have the act performed with due care.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">Succeeding sections then state that a principal <em>is </em>liable for a range of tortious conduct that is not of a physical nature and which produces no physical harm. Of particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>interest, in the context of this case, are \u00a7\u00a7 258 and 261. Section 258, captioned \u201cIncidental Misrepresentations,\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-5\">\u201cIn the absence of an exculpatory agreement, a principal authorizing a servant <em>or other agent </em>to enter into negotiations to which representations concerning the subject matter thereof are usually incident is subject to liability for loss caused to the other party to the transaction by tortious misrepresentations of the agent upon matters which the principal might reasonably expect would be the subject of representations, provided the other party has no notice that the representations are unauthorized.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Section 261, in somewhat similar vein, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-7\">\u201cA principal who puts a servant <em>or other agent </em>in a position which enables the agent, while apparently acting within his authority, to commit a fraud upon third persons is subject to liability to such third persons for the fraud.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">These concepts are carried over into Title D of chapter 7, which deals with a principal\u2019s liability for the tortious conduct of an agent within his <em>apparent </em>authority. Section 265(1) provides generally that a \u201cmaster <em>or other principal </em>is subject to liability for torts which result from reliance upon, or belief in, statements or other conduct within an agent\u2019s apparent authority.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 267 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-9\">\u201cOne who represents that another is his servant <em>or other agent </em>and thereby causes a third person justifiably to rely upon the care or skill of such apparent agent is subject to liability to the third person for harm caused by the lack of care or skill of the one appearing to be a servant <em>or other agent </em>as if he were such.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>These various principles have found expression in the Maryland cases as well. In the early case of <em>Tome v. Parkersburg R.R. Co., </em>39 Md. 36, 70-71 (1873), the Court adopted the broad rule enunciated in <em>Story On Agency, </em>\u00a7 452, that a principal</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-4\">\u201c \u2018is liable to third persons in a civil suit, for the frauds, deceits, concealments, misrepresentations, torts, negligences, and other malfeasances, or misfeasances, and omissions of duty, of his agent in the course of his employment, although the principal did not authorize, or justify, or participate in, or indeed know of such misconduct, or even if he forbade the acts or disapproved of them. In all such cases the rule applies <em>respondeat superior; </em>and it is founded upon public policy and convenience; for in no other way could there be any safety to third persons in their dealings, either directly with the principal, or indirectly with him, through the instrumentality of agents. In every such case the principal holds out his agent as competent and fit to be trusted, and thereby in effect, he warrants his fidelity and good conduct in all matters within the scope of the agency.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AkQ\">As the <em>Henkelmann </em>Court noted, some of the early expressions of <em>respondeat superior </em>have been narrowed over the years, and the courts \u201chave confined it within limits as narrow as are consistent with the true interests of society.\u201d 180 Md. at 598, 26 A.2d 418. Thus, the broad statement in <em>Tome </em>of vicarious liability for \u201ctorts, negligences, and other malfeasances, or misfeasances\u201d has to be read in the light of later expressions, but the specific liability for fraud, deceit, and misrepresentation has remained more or less intact over the years. <em>See, for example, Purdum v. Edwards, </em>155 Md. 178, 141 A. 550 (1928); <em>State v. Katcef </em>159 Md. 271, 150 A. 801 (1930); <em>cf. Balto. Amer. Ins. Co. v. Ulman, </em>165 Md. 630, 170 A. 202 (1934). In <em>B.P. Oil Corp. v. Mabe, </em>279 Md. 632, 643, 370 A.2d 554, the Court appeared expressly to adopt \u00a7 267 of the <em>Restatement 2d </em>(see <em>ante), </em>although in that case it concluded that the requisite element of reliance had not been shown. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number><em>also Atlantic Fruit Co. v. Railroad Co., </em>149 Md. 1, 130 A. 63 (1925); <em>Restatement of Torts 2d, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 409-429 (Liability Of An Employer Of An Independent Contractor); <em>Rowley v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>60 Md.App. 680, 484 A.2d 306 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">It is clear from all of this that Sanders\u2019 view of the scope of his liability for Leatherbury\u2019s conduct is much too narrow. It is not dependent on whether Leatherbury was his servant. The distinctions and limitations set forth in the <em>Henkelmann </em>line of cases have to be considered in context. Those cases all involved some physical act by the agent that caused physical harm to the plaintiff. Most of them involved automobile accidents, and, indeed, the <em>Henkelmann </em>Court made special mention that problems arising from the \u201cextensive use of the motor vehicle with its accompanying dangers\u201d had led courts to relax the strict application of <em>respondeat superior </em>in those kinds of cases. 180 Md. at 599, 26 A.2d 418. <em>Globe Indemnity </em>involved a vicious assault by the alleged agent committed in the course of the agent\u2019s employment. Those cases thus fall within the ambit of \u00a7 250 of the <em>Restatement, </em>and really do not extend beyond it. To conclude otherwise would not only cast Maryland adrift from generally held principles of law, but would also create some serious internal contradictions in the Maryland case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">We are not concerned here, of course, with any primary liability on Sanders\u2019 part to a third party, or with the effect on him of any physical or intentional tort committed by Leatherbury. Our focus is more narrow; the question is one of imputed contributory negligence. What the foregoing discussion establishes, however, is that, in judging that question, we must look beyond the expressions in <em>Henkelmann, </em>and thus beyond the issue of whether Leatherbury was or was not Sanders\u2019 servant. Section 317 of the <em>Restatement 2d </em>makes this clear. It states: \u201cThe contributory negligence of an agent acting within the scope of his power to bind his principal by his conduct bars the principal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>from recovery against a third person to the same extent as if the principal had been negligent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Comment a to \u00a7 317 states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-6\">\u201cThe situations in which the rule stated in this Section is usually important are those in which a master or his belongings are injured by the combined negligence of a third person and his servant. The rule is seldom applicable except in the case of servants, since one not a master is not responsible generally for the negligent <em>physical </em>conduct of another. <em>The rule may apply, however, where an agent not a servant is acting in the performance of his duties to the principal and the principal\u2019s interests suffer owing to the negligent misrepresentation of the third person combined with the negligence of the agent in failing to realize their untruthfulness. </em>Compare the Restatement of Torts, \u00a7 552.\u201d (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">The Court of Appeals may well have anticipated \u00a7 317 in <em>Atlantic Fruit Co. v. Railroad Co., supra, </em>149 Md. 1, 130 A. 63. The plaintiff there \u2014 Atlantic\u2014delivered a load of bananas to the railroad for shipment from New York to Baltimore. The trip was scheduled to take no more than sixteen hours; in fact, it took an additional twenty-five hours, and the bananas spoiled in transit. In partial defense to Atlantic\u2019s suit, the railroad offered evidence that Atlantic had sent along a \u201cmessenger\u201d with the shipment whose duty it was to regulate the temperature in the railroad cars, that this \u201cmessenger\u201d did not perform that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>duty properly, and that had he done so the bananas would not have spoiled, notwithstanding the delay. The precise status of this \u201cmessenger\u201d \u2014 whether he was a servant or non-servant \u2014 is not at all clear and indeed was not mentioned by the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">The Court of Appeals approved the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury that if the loss was occasioned by the negligence of the messenger in not regulating the temperature the plaintiff could not recover. It concluded, at 8, 130 A. 63, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-5\">\u201cwhile the shipper was under no obligation to send a messenger, and the carrier would have been responsible for the proper care of the goods in transit if no messenger accompanied them, we think the better rule holds that, when the shipper places some one in charge of goods, <em>he is responsible for any loss caused by his agent\u2019s neglect of duty, </em>at least in the absence of a showing that the carrier knew of such neglect.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">The <em>Atlantic Fruit Co. </em>case is significant. By 1925 \u2014 the year it was decided \u2014 the distinctions between servants and other agents were well recognized, and yet the rule of imputed contributory negligence was applied without regard to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">The case before us is a peculiar one, in both its factual and procedural posture. It does not seem to fit precisely into any of the legal pigeonholes discussed above, but it seems clear to us that the concepts enunciated in <em>Tome v. Parkersburg R.R. Co., Atlantic Fruit Co., State v. Katcef </em>and <em>Restatement of Agency 2d, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 258, 261, 265, 267, and 317 are more relevant than the distinctions arising from what are essentially direct personal injury cases. It is important in this regard to keep in mind the underlying rationale of <em>respondeat superior. </em>As the Court pointed out in <em>Adams v. Cost, </em>62 Md. 264, 267 (1884), the doctrine arose from the maxim, <em>qui facit per alium facit per se </em>(he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>who acts through another acts himself); hence, the theory that, when an agent commits a tortious act within the scope of his designated duties, the principal \u201cis constructively present; the negligence is his negligence, and he is responsible for the resulting injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Regulations of the Maryland Racing Commission specify that a horse may be entered in a race only \u201cby the owner of the horse, by his authorized agent, or by some person deputized by him\u201d (COMAR 09.10.01.17C), that a horse \u201c.that has not been fully identified may not be permitted to start\u201d (COMAR 09.10.01.17K), that a horse may not be permitted to start unless its name is registered with the racing secretary (COMAR 09.10.01.17L), and that the trainer \u201cis the absolute insurer of the horse he has entered\u201d (COMAR 09.10.01.57P). Other regulations provide that the trainer \u201cmay represent the owner in the matter of entries [and] declarations...\u201d (COMAR 09.10.01.57F), that the trainer \u201cshall have his horse in the paddock at the time appointed\u201d (COMAR 09.10.01.57G), and that the trainer \u201cshall attend his horse in the paddock...\u201d (COMAR 09.10.-01.57H).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">As much as the Maryland Rules of Practice and Procedure are not merely guides to the practice of law but \u201cprecise rubrics\u201d to be read and followed, <em>Countess v. State, </em>286 Md. 444, 463, 408 A.2d 1302 (1979), so these regulations of the Racing Commission are more than merely helpful hints to those engaged in the horse racing industry. They are also precise rubrics, intended to ensure the integrity of the industry and to protect the public against fraud and corruption. They do this, in part, by establishing certain specific procedures to be followed in the running of races, by requiring nearly everyone participating in the conduct of racing to be licensed, and by placing specific responsibility on the various licensees to follow the mandated procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>In the context of the issue now before us, two things are absolutely clear from this regulatory scheme: (1) the trainer is responsible for seeing to it that the right horse is brought to the paddock, and (2) in all that the trainer does in entering the horse and causing the horse actually to run in a race, he acts as the owner\u2019s designated agent. Throughout, in his dealings with the track, he represents the owner, whose horse it is and who primarily benefits from the horse\u2019s success. It is not so much a matter of servant vs. independent contractor; by virtue of the regulatory scheme and the contract between them, the owner has placed the trainer in the position of being able to switch or otherwise misrepresent the horse he has entered for the owner and thus, wittingly or unwittingly, to defraud the track and the public. As a licensed and experienced owner, Sanders understood that Leatherbury would be acting directly and exclusively on his behalf in these important matters, and he cannot be heard to disavow the mistakes that Leatherbury made in discharging his agency. It necessarily is a case of <em>quifac\u00fc per alium facit per se; </em>Leather-bury\u2019s negligence is Sanders\u2019 negligence and Sanders is responsible for the resulting injury. <em>Adams v. Cost, supra, </em>62 Md. at 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">For these reasons, the court clearly did not err in declining Sanders\u2019 tenuous invitation to exonerate him as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">\n<em>Jury Instruction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">Sanders\u2019 second argument stems from the same misconception as his first \u2014 that vicarious culpability depends upon a showing that he had a right to control the operative details of Leatherbury\u2019s work. He complains that the court\u2019s instruction in this regard was too general and allowed the jury to find agency \u201cmerely because [Leather-bury] was acting on behalf of Sanders and Sanders directed where the horse should race.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>There are three answers to this complaint. First, unlike the first issue, there is not even a semblance in the record of a timely, articulated objection to the instruction. Second, the instruction given, read fairly, does not suffer from the deficiency complained of; and, third, in light of the conclusions expressed in regard to the first issue, it would appear that Sanders in fact got more than was his due.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">\n<em>Leatherbury\u2019s Agency After June %</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">The defense of contributory negligence was in two parts. The first concerned Leatherbury\u2019s negligence in entering the wrong horse in the two races; the second had to do with his failure to discover the error during the period after the second race and before the horse thought to be Dare to Command was sold. Had Leatherbury (or Sanders) been diligent, the defendants argued, the mistake would have been discovered before Large as Life, <em>sub nom </em>Dare to Command, was sold in September. In that event, the two horses would again have been switched and Sanders would have suffered no loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">This second aspect of the contributory negligence defense was submitted to the jury as Issues 4 and 4(a). By answering them in the affirmative, the jury found that Sanders \u201cor [an] agent of his acting under his direction and control\u201d was indeed negligent in failing to discover the mistake during this period, and that such negligence also was a cause of the loss in value of Dare to Command. Sanders\u2019 final complaint is that the court should not have submitted those issues to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">We need not address that question. In light of the jury\u2019s response to Issues 2, 2(a), and 2(b) and our conclusion that there was no error in the submission of those issues, the complaint about Issues 4 and 4(a) is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; APPELLANT TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b81-8\">. Both horses were acquired through claiming races; Sanders claimed Dare to Command for $25,000, Large as Life for $14,500. During the time Sanders owned the horses, Dare to Command was entered in races carrying higher stakes and purses and won considerably more money than Large as Life.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b82-7\">.
