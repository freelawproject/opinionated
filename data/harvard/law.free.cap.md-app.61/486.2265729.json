Greenfeld, which opinion is expressly adopted as the opinion of this Court.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-7\">\u201cThis is Petitioner\u2019s first Petition for relief under the Uniform Post Conviction Procedure Act, Article 27, \u00a7\u00a7 645A-645J, inclusive, of the Annotated Code of Maryland. A hearing was held on this Petition on October 19, 1984.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-8\">Petitioner pleaded guilty on October 7, 1982 before Judge James W. Murphy to possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. He was given a 2-year suspended sentence and placed on 3 years of supervised probation. \u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-9\">Petitioner asserts that his guilty plea was not voluntarily and knowingly made because at that time he was not informed either by the court or his attorney that deportation was a possible consequence of pleading guilty. Petitioner testified at the post-conviction hearing to the following: that he is a native of Jamaica and has resided in the United States since 1974; that when he entered his guilty plea, he had the status of a \u2018resident alien\u2019; that he then possessed and continues to possess a so-called \u2018green card\u2019 (an alien registration card issued by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service), which entitles him to continued residence in this country; and that at the time of his guilty plea he knew that he was required to \u2018obey all laws\u2019 of the United States as a condition of retaining his green card and remaining in this country. Moreover, when he pleaded guilty, Petitioner admitted committing the offense with which he was charged (T.8-9).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-10\">Almost two years after his guilty plea and conviction, deportation proceedings were instituted against him pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a)(ll).l No hearing has yet been scheduled on those charges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-11\">Petitioner\u2019s first contention is that the court had a duty to inform him of the consequence of deportation pursuant to former Maryland Rule 731c, then in effect, which stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-12\">The Court may not accept a plea of guilty without first questioning the defendant on the record to determine that the plea is made voluntarily, with understanding of the nature of the charge <em>and the consequences of the plea. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-13\">The phrase, \u2018the consequences of the plea,\u2019 has been construed in Maryland to impose upon trial judges the duty to inform defendants of direct consequences of pleading guilty, such as the maximum potential sentence. <em>Bryant v. State, </em>47 Md.App. 551, 424 A.2d 1115 (1981). Courts in other states distinguish between direct and collateral consequences, requiring courts to inform defendants of the former, but not of the latter. <em>See, e.g. State v. Malik, </em>680 P.2d 770 (Wash.App.1984) (a deportation case); <em>State v. Fournier, </em>118 N.H. 230, 385 A.2d 223 (N.H.1978). Whether this distinction applies in Maryland has not been found in any reported Maryland appellate decision, though cases have held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>courts have no duty to inform defendants of such consequences as the possibility of reference to Patuxent Institution, <em>Smith v. Director, </em>13 Md.App. 53, 280 A.2d 910 (1971),2 or the nature of a suspended sentence on probation, <em>Durbin v. State, </em>56 Md.App. 442, 468 A.2d 145 (1983).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-5\">In <em>Bryant v. State, </em>47 Md.App. 551, 424 A.2d 1115 (1981), the Court of Special Appeals vacated the defendant\u2019s guilty plea on the ground that the trial court failed to inform him of the maximum statutory sentence. In arriving at its decision, the Court looked for guidance to federal cases interpreting Rule 11c of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-6\">Before accepting a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, the Court must address the defendant personally in open court and inform him of, and determine that he understands the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-7\">(1) the nature of the charge to which the plea is offered, the mandatory minimum penalty provided by law, if any, and the maximum possible penalty provided by law____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-8\">Prior to 1974, as <em>Bryant </em>points out at 556, 424 A.2d 1115, Rule 11c required defendants to be informed of \u201cthe consequences of the plea,\u201d which is the precise language used in former Maryland Rule 731c. Federal courts have uniformly interpreted this language to require trial courts to inform defendants only of direct, as opposed to collateral, consequences. <em>See, e.g., Cuthrell v. Director, </em>475 F.2d 1364 (4th Cir.1973); <em>Michel v. U.S., </em>507 F.2d 461 (2d Cir.1974); <em>Fruchtman v. Kenton, </em>531 F.2d 946 (9th Cir.1976); <em>Cordero v. U.S., </em>533 F.2d 723 (1st Cir.1976); <em>U.S. v. Cariola, </em>323 F.2d 180 (3d Cir.1963); <em>U.S. v. Parrino, </em>212 F.2d 919 (2d Cir.1954), <em>cert. denied, </em>348 U.S. 840, 75 S.Ct. 46, 99 L.Ed. 663 (1954); <em>Meaton v. U.S., </em>328 F.2d 379 (5th Cir.1964) <em>cert. denied, </em>380 U.S. 916, 85 S.Ct. 902, 13 L.Ed.2d 801 (1965). Two of these cases specifically dealt with deportation proceedings and held them to be collateral consequences about which the defendant need not be informed by the court. <em>See Cordero v. U.S., </em>533 F.2d at 726: \u2018We are not disposed to treat deportation differently from all of the other collateral consequences...'; and <em>Michel v. U.S., </em>507 F.2d at 465, holding that consequences such as deportation are collateral since they are civil proceedings administered by another agency over which the trial judge has no control.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-9\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit ruled similarly on the same issue, although not in the context of deportation. In <em>Cuthrell v. Director, Patuxent Institution, </em>475 F.2d 1364 (4th Cir.1973), the defendant challenged the voluntariness of his guilty plea in a habeas corpus proceeding on the grounds that he was not informed of the possibility of commitment to Patuxent Institution pursuant to the Maryland Defective Delinquent Act. In dismissing the defendant\u2019s petition, the court held that failure to advise the defendant of this collateral consequence \u2014 a commitment resulting from a separate civil proceeding to determine whether the defendant was, in fact, a defective delinquent \u2014 did not render the defendant\u2019s guilty plea involuntary. A consequence was considered to be direct only if \u2018the result represents a definite, immediate and largely automatic effect on the range of the defendant\u2019s punishment.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 1366.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-10\">Applying the <em>Cuthrell </em>criteria to the present case, it is abundantly clear that Petitioner\u2019s possible deportation is merely collateral to his guilty plea. First, the consequence of deportation arises from a separate civil proceeding. Whereas Petitioner's guilty plea was entered in state criminal court, deportation is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>adjudicated in federal civil court. Furthermore, deportation is neither \u2018definite\u2019 nor \u2018largely automatic\u2019; Federal law permits Petitioner to apply for suspension of deportation for humanitarian reasons pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(a)(2). Finally, it is not altogether certain that deportation is \u2018immediate.\u2019 Petitioner entered his guilty plea in October of 1982. Nearly two years later he received a notice informing him of pending deportation proceedings. <em>(See </em>Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 1). Moreover, Petitioner testified that what triggered the immigration authorities\u2019 inquiry into his record was his March, 1984 re-entry into this country after a brief visit to Jamaica. Had Petitioner not left and re-entered the United States, deportation proceedings might never have been instituted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-5\">Even the two cases primarily relied on by Petitioner adhere to the principle that the court\u2019s failure to inform the Defendant of this consequence does not invalidate the guilty plea. See <em>Edwards v. State, </em>393 So.2d 597, 598 (Fla.App. 1981) (\u2018We first hold that it is not the responsibility of the trial court to advise a defendant of federal deportation consequences at the time of taking a guilty plea, and the trial court\u2019s omission of this advice does not render the plea involuntary.\u2019); <em>Commonwealth v. Wellington, </em>305 Pa.Super. 24, 27, 451 A.2d 223 (1982) (\u2018Courts have thus consistently held that a trial court\u2019s failure to inform a defendant of [deportation] does not invalidate his plea. Accordingly, we cannot find the court\u2019s omission to be a basis for allowing appellant to withdraw her guilty plea.\u2019).3</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-6\">Petitioner seeks to bolster his position by calling to the court's attention the fact that five states have recently enacted legislation specifically requiring trial courts to advise alien defendants, prior to acceptance of their guilty pleas, of the possibility of deportation. This hinders, rather than supports, Petitioner\u2019s contention, for they only serve to change prevailing case law. In the absence of such a statute in Maryland, this court is constrained to follow the overwhelming weight of authority in this country that the trial court\u2019s failure to advise Petitioner of possible deportation proceedings did not affect the voluntariness of his guilty plea. Petitioner\u2019s first contention is therefore denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-7\">Petitioner\u2019s second contention is that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel because his lawyer failed to inform him of the possibility of deportation.4 The factual predicate necessary to succeed on this claim \u2014 namely, that his lawyer knew or should have known that he was an alien \u2014 is absent. Petitioner testified that although he never told his attorney that he was an alien, he nevertheless expected his attorney to figure out that he was an alien just from hearing his foreign accent.5 Since the attorney was not called to testify, what the attorney knew or should have known would be mere speculation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-8\">In any event, Petitioner admitted that he knew he must \u2018obey all laws\u2019 if he was to remain in this country. When Petitioner admitted his guilt when he pleaded guilty, he knew, or should reasonably have known, that this amounted to a failure to obey all laws, which fact would put his continued presence in the United States in jeopardy. Therefore, Petitioner possessed the very knowledge that he claims his attorney should have given him. Consequently, the failure of the trial attorney to provide this advice did not prejudice Petitioner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-9\">The two cases relied on by Petitioner, <em>Edwards v. State, </em>393 So.2d 597 (Fla.App.1981) and <em>Commonwealth v. Wellington, </em>305 Pa.Super. 24, 451 A.2d 223 (1982), are inapposite. They are based upon the factual premise that relief can be granted if a defendant who pleads guilty is \u201cotherwise unaware of the consequence of deportation.\u201d <em>Edwards v. State, </em>393 So.2d at 600. In the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>here under consideration, Petitioner did have knowledge of the risk of deportation. His second contention must also be denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-5\">1 This section states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-6\">\u00a7 1251 Deportable aliens (a) General classes</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-7\">Any alien in the United States ... shall, upon the order of the Attorney General be deported whose * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-8\">(11) is, or hereafter at any time after entry has been, ... convicted of a violation of, or a conspiracy to violate, any law or regulation relating to the illicit possession of or traffic in narcotic drugs or marihuana____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-9\">2 When <em>Smith </em>was decided, sentences to Patuxent Institution were permitted to be indeterminate pursuant to former Article 3IB.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-10\">3 These cases do, however, lend limited support to Petitioner\u2019s second contention discussed <em>infra.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-11\">4 Petitioner first raised this issue at the hearing. No mention of it appears in his Petition. The court addresses this issue so as to avoid a second post conviction petition on this related issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-12\">5 The court observed the Petitioner to speak fluent English with a Carribean accent.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-13\">APPLICATION FOR LEAVE TO APPEAL DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
