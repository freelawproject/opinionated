Browning a special class D liquor license, appellants Elwood Jamison and others appealed to the Circuit Court for Garrett County (Leasure, J.). The court affirmed the board. Appellants have now brought their grievances here, but we shall not address them because we hold the appeal must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">By virtue of Art. 2B, \u00a7 175(a) the decision of a county board of liquor license commissioners may be appealed to the appropriate circuit as provided in subsection (b). Subsection (f) makes the circuit court decision final: \u201cNo further appeal shall lie\u201d from that decision unless \u201cany judge of the circuit court of any county shall in any case finally decide a point of law at variance with any decision previously rendered by any other judge of the State on the same question____\u201d No argument is made here that there is another trial court decision conflicting with that of Judge Leasure in this case. Thus, if Art. 2B, \u00a7 175(f) applies we must dismiss the appeal. <em>Suttleman v. Board of Liquor License Commissioners, </em>209 Md. 134, 120 A.2d 388 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">Appellants argue that \u00a7 175(f) is inapplicable because the Garrett County Liquor Control Board is a State agency. Therefore, they assert, the appeal provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act now codified as \u00a7\u00a7 10-215 and 10-216 of the State Government Article, control. Under those provisions there is an appeal to this court as of right from the decision of a circuit court rendered on appeal from a State administrative agency in a contested case.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-10\">We assume, without deciding, that this case is a contested one within the APA definition. State Government Art. \u00a7 10-201(c). The question is whether the board is a State agency. The APA defines an agency as, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201can officer or unit of the State government authorized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>by law to adjudicate contested cases____\u201d Section 10-201(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Art. 2B, \u00a7 153 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-6\">In Garrett County, the liquor control board is hereby declared to be a State agency to administer the provisions of this article and as such is clothed with discretionary powers, in granting, refusing, revoking or suspending licenses for the sale of alcoholic beverages, within the limits proscribed under this article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">We know little of the legislative history of this statute except that (with some differences not here pertinent) it was initially adopted by Chs. 547 and 611 of the Acts of 1967.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The general purpose of those Acts was to create the liquor control board and to eliminate the liquor licensing powers of the county commissioners, who had theretofore sat <em>ex officio </em>as a board of liquor license commissioners pursuant to Art. 2B, \u00a7 151 (Code, 1957, 1966 Supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">At first reading \u00a7 153 would seem to support appellant\u2019s position. But like so many matters arising out of Art. 2B, the question is not so simple. To answer it, that is to ascertain the true legislative intent, we must look to the general scheme of Art. 2B as well as several of its specific provisions. <em>See Turner v. State, </em>61 Md.App. 1, 484 A.2d 641 at 644-645 (1984) (statutes in <em>pari materia </em>are to be construed harmoniously, giving effect to the provisions of each).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">As a general matter the State policy evidenced by Art. 2B is to be administered and enforced by two types of agencies: \u201clocal boards of license commissioners and liquor control boards----\u201d Art. 2B, \u00a7 1(a)(2). For present purposes, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>former are primarily concerned with the issuance of liquor licenses. <em>See, e.g. </em>\u00a7 54(a) (applications for most types of licenses to be filed \u201cwith the board of license commissioners ... or the clerk of the circuit court ... if there be no such board\u201d) and \u00a7\u00a7 148-158 (setting forth in detail the composition, powers, procedures, and compensation applicable to these boards). The latter are designed chiefly to purchase and sell alcoholic beverages, \u00a7 163, and to operate county dispensaries, \u00a7 161. <em>See </em>generally \u00a7\u00a7 159-168. Separate subtitles of Art. 2B establish the principal powers and duties of each type of agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">It is not uncommon for members of some of these bodies to wear two hats. For example, in several counties the county commissioners serve <em>ex officio </em>as the board of license commissioners (\u00a7 151), as was once the case in Garrett County. We conclude that two hats are still <em>a la mode </em>in Garrett County, so far as the liquor control board is concerned. That is, we think its members may sit as a board of license commissioners or as a liquor control board, depending upon the function being performed at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">As we have seen, Art. 2B in general vests the local liquor licensing function in boards of license commissioners. The statutes dealing with this activity are generally written with reference to those boards, not with reference to liquor control boards. While \u00a7 153 could be read broadly enough to give the Garrett County Liquor Control Board all the duties of a board of license commissioners, the legislative intent appears to have been otherwise. Significant here is \u00a7 159(c)(6) which in pertinent part provides: \u201cIn Garrett [County] the [liquor control] board shall also be known as the board of license commissioners ... upon which shall be devolved all the duties and rights given elsewhere in this article.\u201d What is now \u00a7 159(c)(6) was adopted by one of the same Acts that adopted \u00a7 153. Ch. 611, Acts of 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">When we read \u00a7 153 and \u00a7 159(c)(6) together it becomes apparent that the legislature intended to establish two boards in Garrett County; two boards with identical mem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>bership, but each performing a different function. Sitting as a liquor control board, established by \u00a7 159, those members were to perform the duties and exercise the powers prescribed by \u00a7\u00a7 160-168. Sitting as a board of license commissioners they were to carry out the activities prescribed for those boards in other portions of the article\u2014 \u201call the duties and rights given elsewhere in this article.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This construction is consistent with the general provisions of Art. 2B and makes them readily applicable. It provides a harmonious and logical reading of \u00a7\u00a7 153 and 159(c)(6), taken together.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Moreover, it is in accord with the construction the board itself seems to have placed on the statutes. Its letterhead bears the legend \u201cLiquor Control Board of Garrett County\u201d and (in larger letters) \u201cBoard of License Commissioners.\u201d The application in this case is addressed to the \u201cboard of license commissioners.\u201d The notice of hearing advises that an application has been filed \u201cwith the Board of License Commissioners of Garrett County\u201d and that there will be a hearing \u201cin the office of [not before] the Liquor Control Board.\u201d The notice is \u201cBy Order of the Board of License Commissioners of Garrett County.\u201d It is fair to assume that these forms of documents were not adopted just for this case; no one suggested anything to the contrary when we raised the point at oral argument. Such administrative construction where, as here, it is not plainly inconsistent with the statute, should not be disregarded when judicial construction is undertaken. <em>See Baltimore &amp; Ohio RR Co. v. Bowen, </em>60 Md.App. 299, 305, 482 A.2d 921 (1984). In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>absence of legislative history to the contrary we hold that this construction represents the legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">That being so, it follows that when Browning applied for and received his special class D license, he was before the board of license commissioners. Such a board is not a State agency within the contemplation of the APA. <em>Valentine v. Board of License Commissioners, </em>291 Md. 523, 435 A.2d 459 (1981).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore, the judicial review provisions of \u00a7 175(f) apply and under them we must dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED. APPELLANTS TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b444-10\">. Ch. 547 amended Art. 2B, \u00a7 151 to delete Garrett from the list of counties in which the county commissioners sat as a liquor license board and amended \u00a7 153 to add Garrett to the list of counties having a \"State agency\" liquor control board. Ch. 611 made technical changes in \u00a7 153 (chiefly to list the counties in alphabetical order) and inserted, what is now \u00a7 159(c)(6), by adding Garrett to the list of counties in which the liquor control board was also designated the board of liquor license commissioners.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b446-6\">. That the same individuals act as members of both boards does not violate the prohibition against holding two offices of profit \"created by the Constitution or Laws of this State____\u201d Declaration of Rights, Art. 35. Although the members of the Garrett County Liquor Control Board receive compensation in that capacity, Art. 2B, \u00a7 159(h)(1), no salary is specified for their service as license commissioners. \"Where no salary is specified for such boards which serve ex officio, the members thereof are to receive no additional compensation____\u201d Section 155(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b447-12\">. Whether the Garrett County Liquor Control Board is a State agency within contemplation of the APA, when its members are acting in that capacity, is a question we need not and do not decide.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
