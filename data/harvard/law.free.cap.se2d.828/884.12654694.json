While babysitting the two children, the Petitioner sexually abused both of them. The two children did not report the sexual abuse to their parents until 2012. After the children's parents informed the police of the allegations, the Petitioner was indicted on two charges of sexual assault in the first degree, and two charges of sexual abuse by a parent, guardian, custodian, or person in a position of trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Petitioner was tried for the crimes as an adult in 2013. The jury acquitted Petitioner of one count of sexual assault in the first degree, however, the jury found him guilty of the second count of sexual assault in the first degree and the two counts of sexual abuse by a parent, guardian, custodian, or person in a position of trust. The circuit court sentenced Petitioner to an aggregate sentence of thirty-five to seventy-five years of incarceration. The Petitioner was further sentenced to fifty years of supervised release and was required to register as a sexual offender for his lifetime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Petitioner appealed the conviction to this Court.

Va. Code \u00a7 61-11-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) of the Juvenile Sentencing Reform Act to be applied retroactively. The State argues that the circuit court's ruling was correct and that there is nothing in the text of the statute which shows that the Legislature intended for the statute to operate retroactively. In order to fully understand the Juvenile Sentencing Reform Act, some discussion is in order regarding the trilogy of United States Supreme Court decisions that prompted legislative action in this area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The first case in the trilogy was\n   <em>\n    Roper v. Simmons\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5928574\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/551/\">\n    543 U.S. 551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5928574\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/551/\">\n    125 S. Ct. 1183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5928574\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/551/\">\n    161 L. Ed. 2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005). The defendant in\n   <em>\n    Roper\n   </em>\n   was convicted of capital murder by the state of Missouri and sentenced to death. When the defendant committed the murder, he was seventeen years old. After exhausting his direct appeals, the defendant filed a habeas petition in state court arguing that the execution of individuals under 18 years of age at the time they committed their capital crimes, is prohibited by the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution as applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. The Missouri Supreme Court agreed with the defendant and vacated his death sentence. The state appealed to the United States Supreme Court. In\n   <em>\n    Roper\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held that the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution prohibit a death penalty sentence for persons who committed capital crimes as juveniles. The decision affirming the lower court was based, in part, on a recognition of three general differences between juveniles and adults. The Supreme Court reasoned as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Three general differences between juveniles under 18 and adults demonstrate that juvenile offenders cannot with reliability be classified among the worst offenders. First, as any parent knows and as the scientific and sociological studies respondent\n   and his amici cite tend to confirm, [a] lack of maturity and an underdeveloped sense of responsibility are found in youth more often than in adults and are more understandable among the young. These qualities often result in impetuous and ill-considered actions and decisions. It has been noted that adolescents are overrepresented statistically in virtually every category of reckless behavior. In recognition of the comparative immaturity and irresponsibility of juveniles, almost every State prohibits those under 18 years of age from voting, serving on juries, or marrying without parental consent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   The second area of difference is that juveniles are more vulnerable or susceptible to negative influences and outside pressures, including peer pressure. This is explained in part by the prevailing circumstance that juveniles have less control, or less experience with control, over their own environment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   The third broad difference is that the character of a juvenile is not as well formed as that of an adult. The personality traits of juveniles are more transitory, less fixed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   These differences render suspect any conclusion that a juvenile falls among the worst offenders. The susceptibility of juveniles to immature and irresponsible behavior means their irresponsible conduct is not as morally reprehensible as that of an adult. Their own vulnerability and comparative lack of control over their immediate surroundings mean juveniles have a greater claim than adults to be forgiven for failing to escape negative influences in their whole environment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Roper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5928574\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/551/\">\n    543 U.S. at 569-570\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5928574\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/551/\">\n    125 S.

Ed. 2d 825\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010), to persons sentenced to life without parole for non-homicide crimes committed when they were juveniles. The defendant in\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   was charged by the state of Florida with armed burglary and attempted armed robbery. The defendant was sixteen years old at the time of the crimes. The defendant pled guilty to both charges. The trial court accepted the plea but deferred sentencing the defendant and placed him on probation. The defendant subsequently violated probation and was sentenced under the plea to life imprisonment for the armed burglary and 15 years for the attempted armed robbery. After the defendant exhausted his direct appeal in state courts, he filed a petition for certiorari with the United States Supreme Court. Consistent with its reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Roper\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court granted relief to the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   , in part, based upon the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   No recent data provide reason to reconsider the Court's observations in\n   <em>\n    Roper\n   </em>\n   about the nature of juveniles. As petitioner's amici point out, developments in psychology and brain science continue to show fundamental differences between juvenile and adult minds. For example, parts of the brain involved in behavior control continue to mature through late adolescence. Juveniles are more capable of change than are adults, and their actions are less likely to be evidence of irretrievably depraved character than are the actions of adults. It remains true that [f]rom a moral standpoint it would be misguided to equate the failings of a minor with those of an adult, for a greater possibility exists that a minor's character deficiencies will be reformed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   ***\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   In sum, penological theory is not adequate to justify life without parole for juvenile nonhomicide offenders. This determination; the limited culpability of juvenile nonhomicide offenders; and the severity of life without parole sentences all lead to the conclusion that the sentencing practice under consideration is cruel and unusual. This Court now holds that for a juvenile offender who did not commit homicide the Eighth Amendment forbids the sentence of life without parole. This clear line is necessary to prevent the possibility that life without parole sentences will be imposed on juvenile nonhomicide offenders who are not sufficiently culpable to merit that punishment. Because [t]he age of 18 is the point where society draws the line for many purposes between childhood and\n   adulthood, those who were below that age when the offense was committed may not be sentenced to life without parole for a nonhomicide crime.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448995,3641893\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/48/\">\n    560 U.S. at 68-75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448995,3641893\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/48/\">\n    130 S.

Ed. 2d 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012), the Supreme Court extended its\n   <em>\n    Roper\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    /\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   analysis to persons who committed homicides as juveniles and sentenced to life in prison. The decision in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   involved two consolidated criminal cases. In both cases, the defendants were convicted of capital murder and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the time of the murders, both juveniles were 14 years old. In the consolidated appeals to the Supreme Court, the defendants argued that a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without parole, for crimes committed when they were under the age of 18, violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishments. The Supreme Court agreed with the defendants as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   The cases before us implicate two strands of precedent reflecting our concern with proportionate punishment. The first has adopted categorical bans on sentencing practices based on mismatches between the culpability of a class of offenders and the severity of a penalty.... Several of the cases in this group have specially focused on juvenile offenders, because of their lesser culpability. Thus,\n   <em>\n    Roper\n   </em>\n   held that the Eighth Amendment bars capital punishment for children, and\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   concluded that the Amendment also prohibits a sentence of life without the possibility of parole for a child who committed a nonhomicide offense.\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   further likened life without parole for juveniles to the death penalty itself, thereby evoking a second line of our precedents. In those cases, we have prohibited mandatory imposition of capital punishment, requiring that sentencing authorities consider the characteristics of a defendant and the details of his offense before sentencing him to death. Here, the confluence of these two lines of precedent leads to the conclusion that mandatory life-without-parole sentences for juveniles violate the Eighth Amendment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   ...\n   <em>\n    Roper\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   establish that children are constitutionally different from adults for purposes of sentencing. Because juveniles have diminished culpability and greater prospects for reform ... they are less deserving of the most severe punishments. Those cases relied on three significant gaps between juveniles and adults. First, children have a lack of maturity and an underdeveloped sense of responsibility, leading to recklessness, impulsivity, and heedless risk-taking. Second, children are more vulnerable ... to negative influences and outside pressures, including from their family and peers; they have limited contro[l] over their own environment and lack the ability to extricate themselves from horrific, crime-producing settings. And third, a child's character is not as well formed as an adult's; his traits are less fixed and his actions less likely to be evidence of irretrievabl[e] depravity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    567 U.S. at 470-471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    132 S.

Code \u00a7 61-11-23(b) under\n   <em>\n    Taylor's\n   </em>\n   second prong we are guided by the rules of statutory construction that require courts to give meaning to all provisions in a statutory scheme.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   A statute is enacted as a whole with a general purpose and intent, and each part should be considered in connection with every other part to produce a harmonious whole.

In making this holding, we wish to underscore several matters. First, this Court is quite aware of the heinous nature of the Petitioner's crimes in this case. However, the horrific acts that the Petitioner committed against the victims in this case cannot prevent this Court from carrying out its duty to apply the law equally to all litigants. Our faithful and unbiased inquiry into the legislative intent regarding\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2061-11-23\">\n    W. Va. Code \u00a7 61-11-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), instructs us that the Legislature made no distinction on the types of criminal conduct juveniles engaged in order to benefit from the retroactivity of the statute. Consequently, the Petitioner's egregious crimes are subject to parole consideration under the statute.

J.T. was unable to provide any independent personal knowledge of what occurred in the bathroom with Petitioner. Rather, J.T. simply stated that, \"Michael made us suck his weenie.\" He could provide\n   no further or specific details regarding the alleged encounter with Petitioner.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   ...

Accordingly, I concur in the majority's\n   decision affirming the circuit court's final order with regard to these issues. However, the majority then proceeds to substitute its judgment for that of the Legislature and to essentially rewrite W.Va.

Accordingly, I dissent from the majority's holding as to the question of retroactivity and would affirm the circuit court's well-reasoned determination that W.Va.

Instead, the majority has substituted its own judgement for that of the Legislature and decreed that, \"by necessary implication,\" the Legislature intended to make the statute retroactive. However, there is simply nothing within the text of the statute or any evidence adduced from the record that would support such an \"implication.\" Indeed, the opposite is true. The only reference to the question of retroactivity within the statute is contained within the language of subsection (d) of the statute which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   The provisions of this subsection are only applicable to\n   <em>\n    sentencing proceedings\n   </em>\n   for convictions rendered after the effective date of this section and do not constitute sufficient grounds for the\n   <em>\n    reconsideration of sentences\n   </em>\n   imposed as the result of convictions rendered after the effective date of this section.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   W.Va. Code \u00a7 61-11-23(d)(2) (2014) (emphasis added). The provisions of subsection (d) that the Legislature unequivocally stated were not to be applied retroactively provide for comprehensive mental health evaluations that a circuit court \"shall consider\" \"prior to the imposition of sentence.\" W.Va. Code \u00a7 61-11-23(d)(1) (2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   The other provisions of W.Va. Code \u00a7 61-11-23, contained in subsections (a), (b), and (c), relate to prohibiting the imposition of a life sentence without parole for juveniles transferred to adult status, the time periods in which such persons can be considered for parole, and the factors which should be considered at sentencing of such persons.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, subsection (d) creates an entirely new requirement that, prior to sentencing of a juvenile who has been transferred to adult status, such person must have a \"comprehensive\n   mental health evaluation conducted by an [sic] mental health professional licensed to treat adolescents in the State of West Virginia.\" W.Va. Code \u00a7 61-11-23(d)(1) (2014). It was entirely logical for the Legislature to clarify that such reports are only required for sentencings that take place after the effective date of the statute and that the requirement of such a\n   <em>\n    newly required\n   </em>\n   report was not intended to be used as a basis for reconsideration of previously imposed sentences. Such provision in no way gives rise to the implication that the other provisions of W.Va. Code \u00a7 61-11-23 were to be applied retroactively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Contrary to the majority's holding, the only natural \"implication\" was that the Legislature relied upon West Virginia Code \u00a7 2-2-10(bb) (1988) which provides that a statute it adopts \"is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless expressly made retrospective.\" The impact of the majority's decision is that the Legislature, despite the clear statutory presumption that its statutes are prospective unless it expressly holds otherwise, cannot rely on such presumption if the court wishes to read into the statute some contrary \"implication.\" The majority's holding sets a dangerous and warranted precedent and in effect renders West Virginia Code \u00a7 2-2-10(bb) meaningless. \"It is always presumed that the legislature will not enact a meaningless or useless statute.\" Syllabus Point 4,\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

Indeed, the record indicates that passage of the statute was, to some degree, a reaction to the holding in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   . Nonetheless, it is a great leap from that premise to the majority's holding that such cases give rise to the \"natural implication\" that the Legislature intended the statute to apply retroactively. Clearly, the Legislature was aware of the holding in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   and, had it believed such holding called for the retroactive application of the statute, it certainly could have included language enacting the statute to apply retroactively. It did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   More perplexing is the majority's reliance on language contained in the introduced version of the statute - language that was\n   <em>\n    not included\n   </em>\n   in the version of the bill that was adopted by the Legislature. The majority, in support of its holding that the statute should be applied retroactively, quotes extensive findings related to the treatment of juveniles that were included in the original version of House Bill 4210 as introduced during the 2014 Legislative Session. However, as the majority recognizes in a footnote, these findings were removed from the bill before it was enacted by the Legislature. The fact that the Legislature affirmatively acted to remove the quoted findings during the Legislative process, between the introduction of the bill and its passage, is a clear indication that such findings\n   <em>\n    were not\n   </em>\n   reflective of the Legislature's intent. The majority relies on such unadopted findings in an attempt to provide some shred of evidence within the record supporting its finding of a \"necessary implication\" to overcome the statutory presumption against retroactivity. Such evidence, however, simply does not exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Clearly, the statute itself does not contain \"clear, strong and imperative words\" that the Legislature intended it to apply retroactively, and the record does not support the majority's finding of a \"necessary implication\" that \"the Legislature intended to give the statute retroactive force and effect.\" Syllabus Point 4,\n   <em>\n    Taylor v.

West Virginia Code \u00a7 61-11-23(b) contains the parole provisions for juveniles transferred to adult status that are in contention in this matter. These provisions provide for parole eligibility after such juvenile has served fifteen years, regardless of what crime they committed, or how many crimes they committed.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    W.Va. Code \u00a7 61-11-23(b) (2014).

Code \u00a7 61-11-23(c) (2014). Finally, West Virginia Code \u00a7 62-12-13b delineates the factors that the Parole Board must consider when a juvenile who has been transferred to adult status and is serving a sentence becomes parole eligible.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    W.Va.

The record reflects that at the petitioner's sentencing in the present case, the circuit court found,\n    <em>\n     inter alia,\n    </em>\n    that based on the evaluation prepared in aid of sentencing:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-170\">\n    \"[Petitioner Christopher J.] presents as an immature, impulse-driven, young man lacking empathy and concern for the emotional experiences of others. A person with poor impulse control issues and a lack of forethought would have an even more difficult time avoiding acting out on such a stimulus than other adolescents. They find it is likely that [Petitioner Christopher J.] saw an opportunity in young children [Petitioner Christopher J.] baby-sat to meet [Petitioner Christopher J.'s] need for power and control in [Petitioner Christopher J.'s] life. It says in his life. And at the same time meet sexual gratification to a lesser degree. It is unclear at this time whether [Petitioner Christopher J.] is a good candidate for sexual offender treatment as he does not yet accept responsibility for his actions. He has an elevated sense of self and has those antisocial personality characteristics which make him likely to avoid responsibility and blame others.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-171\">\n    In the report they felt that it would take at least 25 years of supervision in the penitentiary setting to see whether or not there was an impact of rehabilitation. In essence, they found that because of the nature of the actions, the age of the victims [Petitioner Christopher J.] may never be able to control those impulses and, therefore, remain a risk that - and this is my side of it - would only increase to get - increasingly get more dangerous because as [Petitioner Christopher J.] get[s] older [his] ability to manipulate young people, find [Petitioner Christopher J.] in a position to take advantage of them would increase also so my finding is that [Petitioner Christopher J.'s] antisocial character traits are such that [Petitioner Christopher J. is] an extreme risk to young people and that's why I'm imposing the maximum sentence that can be imposed.\"\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
