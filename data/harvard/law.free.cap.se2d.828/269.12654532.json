On appeal, Robinson challenged the sufficiency of the evidence, and a divided panel of this Court reversed the conviction.\n   <em>\n    Robinson v.

We granted the Commonwealth's petition for rehearing\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   , stayed the mandate of the panel decision, and reinstated the appeal on the docket of this Court. Upon a rehearing\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   , we find that the trial court did not err and affirm appellant's conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.

So viewed, the victim, R.W.,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   testified that in April and May of 2017, she and her husband were residing with Robinson and his girlfriend in a house belonging to Robinson's girlfriend. R.W. testified that, in the afternoon of May 23, 2017, she returned to the house with her sister after an outing. Because the door was latched, she knocked on the door to enter the house. Robinson opened the door and told her, \"[Y]ou just woke me up.\" She stated that she apologized and stepped into the house. She testified, \"[H]e grabbed my breasts right behind my nipples and twisted as hard as he could.\" She stated, \"I smacked his hands away\" and that then \"[h]e smacked my bottom.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   R.W.'s sister testified that she was standing next to R.W. during the incident and that she saw Robinson \"put his hands on my sister's breasts and twist[ ].\" She further testified that R.W. then told \"him to get off of her\" and that he finally removed his hands from her breasts \"[a]bout maybe a minute later.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   R.W. testified that there were other occasions, including at least one prior to the incident on May 23, 2017, in which Robinson had touched her in a sexual way and that she had expressed to him on multiple occasions that she did not want him to touch her. She also testified that Robinson had told her that \"if [she] said something\" about his actions, she and her husband would have to move out of the house. She added that, at the time, she and her husband had nowhere else to go. During her testimony, R.W. also stated that Robinson \"cupped the front of me and told me he can have it if he wanted it,\" although it is somewhat unclear from her testimony when that action occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The trial judge denied Robinson's motion to strike and found Robinson guilty of sexual battery based on the May 23, 2017 incident. Specifically, the trial judge found that \"because of the manner in which [R.W.] said that [Robinson] grabbed and held and twisted her breasts, the requirement of force is met.\" The judge concluded that \"the evidence indicates that the requisite degree of force was applied.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On appeal, Robinson's sole assignment of error states, \"The trial court erred in finding evidence sufficient to convict based on use of force when there was no evidence that the alleged touching was accomplished by the use of force sufficient to overcome the victim's will.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II. ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   When considering the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal, \"a reviewing court does not 'ask itself whether\n   <em>\n    it\n   </em>\n   believes that the evidence at the trial established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.' \"\n   <em>\n    Crowder v.

Second, the facts make clear that the touching was accomplished against the will of the complaining witness as the victim twice got up to try to get away from Johnson.

While we are rightly hesitant to overturn previous decisions of this Court, there are occasions where a wrongly decided case providing erroneous precedent must be overturned. The opinion of this Court in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   misinterpreted the plain language of the statute, failed to apply the appropriate appellate standard of review giving due deference to the fact finder, and incorrectly found on appeal a lack of force despite the very facts showing force cited in the Court's opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Similarly, considering the facts of the case now before us in light of the statutory element of force in Code \u00a7 18.2-67.4, and given the totality of the circumstances here - including Robinson's twisting of the breasts \"as hard as he could\" and the duration of it - we certainly cannot conclude that no rational fact finder could have found Robinson guilty of sexual battery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   III. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We hold that a rational fact finder could conclude that Robinson accomplished the touching \"by force\" because not only did he touch or grab the victim's breasts but he also \"twisted as hard as he could\" - and held on to her in that manner for about a minute, according to the victim's sister, who was standing stunned next to her. Furthermore, it is undisputed on appeal that this battery occurred against the will of the victim - and that the touching satisfied the statutory requirement of sexual abuse, as defined in Code \u00a7 18.2-67.10. In short, considering the totality of the circumstances, we simply cannot say that no rational fact finder could have found Robinson guilty of sexual battery beyond a reasonable doubt. For all of these reasons, we affirm Robinson's conviction for sexual battery in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-67.4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Affirmed.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   O'Brien, J. with whom Humphreys and Malveaux, JJ., join, dissenting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   I agree with the majority that the sole issue in this appeal is whether the evidence established that the act was committed \"by force\" as required by Code \u00a7 18.2-67.4(A)(i). There is no question that appellant \"intentionally touch[ed]\" clothing covering the complaining witness' \"intimate parts,\" her breasts, \"with the intent to sexually molest, arouse, or gratify.\" Code \u00a7 18.2-67.10(2) ; 18.2-67.10(6)(a). These actions constitute \"sexual abuse.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=365%20S.E.2d%20237\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   There is also no question that appellant committed sexual abuse \"against the will of the complaining witness.\" Code \u00a7 18.2-67.4(A)(i). However, for non-consensual touching to be elevated from assault and battery to sexual battery, the sexual abuse must be accomplished \"by force, threat, intimidation, or ruse.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=365%20S.E.2d%20237\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because I cannot find that appellant's actions, although reprehensible and offensive, demonstrated that he accomplished the sexual abuse by force, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   This Court initially addressed the degree of force necessary to support a sexual battery conviction in\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

In reversing\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , the majority does not repudiate the requirement that the sexual abuse must be accomplished by force or that a defendant must employ some force beyond that required to accomplish the unlawful touching. Rather, it finds that evidence of the teenage victim waking to find the defendant \"holding [the victim] real close to him\" as the defendant fondled the victim's genitals was sufficient to establish the necessary force.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 531,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=365%20S.E.2d%20237\">\n    365 S.E.2d 237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Here, however, the restraint employed by appellant was inherent in the act itself; it was not used to overcome the will of the complaining witness to accomplish the non-consensual touching. The majority finds that testimony from the complaining witness' sister that appellant \"twisted [the complaining witness' breasts] as hard as he could\" for \"about maybe a minute\" was sufficient to prove that he used force to accomplish the sexual abuse.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, there was no evidence that appellant overcame her will besides the unlawful act of grabbing and twisting her breasts. For example, appellant did not hold the complaining witness so that he could accomplish the touching, as in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   . The duration and intensity of appellant's sexual abuse under Code \u00a7 18.2-67.10(6)(a) is not evidence that he first used force to overcome her will to accomplish the act as required by Code \u00a7 18.2-67.4(A)(i). Clearly, appellant's actions were aggressive and non-consensual; the complaining witness testified that she \"smacked\" his hands away. However, the inherent violence of the act does not, of itself, establish that it was committed \"by force.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Evidence that appellant acted without warning or provocation cannot satisfy the \"force\" element of sexual battery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Woodard v.

In addition, the relevant part of the statute dealing with force under which Johnson was convicted is essentially the same as the relevant part of the statute dealing with force under which Robinson was convicted. Both statutes provide that the sexual abuse be performed \"against the will of the complaining witness, by force ....\" Therefore, the \"force\" requirement in\n    <em>\n     Johnson\n    </em>\n    is the same as the \"force\" requirement contained in Code \u00a7 18.2-67.4 and at issue in this appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    Overruling\n    <em>\n     Johnson\n    </em>\n    to find the facts sufficient to establish that the crime was committed \"by force\" reduces the word \"force\" as used in the statute to redundant surplusage.
