Plaintiff argues that summary judgment was improper, asserting a genuine issue of material fact existed as to: (1) the presence\n   of a legal duty owed to him by the Church; and (2) his contributory negligence in falling on a set of stairs leading into the Church while carrying a casket. After careful review, we reverse the ruling of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The record below indicates the following:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff attended a funeral at the Church, located at Sampson Avenue in Dunn, North Carolina, on a sunny day in February of 2015. Before the service started, Plaintiff entered the Church sanctuary through an entrance facing Sampson Avenue. As Plaintiff and a church deacon were speaking, the minister who would be conducting the service approached and asked Plaintiff if he would be willing to help carry the deceased's casket into the sanctuary. Plaintiff declined. Some time later, an employee of the funeral home, Third-Party Defendant Dafford Funeral Home, Inc. (\"Dafford\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   asked Plaintiff to help carry the casket. Plaintiff reconsidered and agreed to help, as he felt physically capable of assisting and Dafford did not have enough employees on hand to carry the casket into the building.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff followed the Dafford employee out of the sanctuary through a door facing U.S. Route 421, different than the door Plaintiff had entered earlier, and descended a set of concrete and brick stairs. Once outside, Plaintiff walked approximately 25 to 30 feet to the hearse containing the casket. Plaintiff joined three other men at the hearse, and the group carried the casket, without any apparent difficulty, to the bottom of the stairs Plaintiff had navigated moments earlier. They then began ascending the stairs, unhindered by the casket. Before reaching the entryway, Plaintiff, who was positioned on the front left side of the casket, tripped on the top step and injured his knees. The top step was approximately two-and-a-half inches taller than the preceding steps.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff filed suit against the Church on 22 August 2017, alleging negligence, negligence\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    res ipsa loquitur\n   </em>\n   arising out of the stair's defective and dangerous condition,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the difference in height between the top step and the ones below it. In response, the Church filed a combined answer and third-party complaint against Dafford for contribution and indemnification, asserting by affirmative defense that Plaintiff was contributorily negligent in failing to use reasonable care. Plaintiff, with leave of the trial court, filed an amended complaint on 5 March 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Church moved for summary judgment on Plaintiff's claims. The Church's motion argued, among other things, that Plaintiff possessed equal or superior knowledge of the alleged defective condition, having descended the stairs without issue moments before tripping. Plaintiff filed an affidavit in opposition; he also filed an affidavit from an engineering expert attesting to the defect in the stairs. Following a hearing, the trial court granted the Church's summary judgment motion on the grounds that Plaintiff had equal or superior knowledge of the open and obvious hazard and failed to exercise due care in navigating the steps. Plaintiff appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     ANALYSIS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff argues that because he introduced sufficient evidence demonstrating genuine issues of material fact, his negligence claim should have survived summary judgment. The Church disagrees, asserting that: (1) Plaintiff had equal or superior knowledge of\n   the alleged defect so the Church did not owe him a duty of care; and (2) Plaintiff's contributory negligence caused him to trip. Reviewing the evidence and applicable law, we agree with Plaintiff and reverse the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    A.

Taken in the light most favorable to him, this evidence creates a disputed issue of material fact concerning whether the defect was hidden or open and obvious.

These conclusory assertions of fact, however, are disputed by Plaintiff's evidence. Plaintiff's deposition testimony and affidavit assert that the danger in this case was not the act of carrying a casket up a flight of stairs, but was instead a hazardous difference in height between the top step and the ones below it; indeed, Plaintiff stated in his affidavit that his \"fall occurred solely because [he] tripped on the top stair of the staircase\" and expressly disclaimed any effect the casket had on his ability to climb the steps. He also testified in deposition that he had no concerns carrying the casket with just four people and reiterated in his affidavit that he is \"a strong man and had no difficulty lifting the casket or carrying the casket[.]\" Nor, per his affidavit, did he have a \"reason to think that four strong adults could not safely carry a casket up a flight of stairs.\" As for the danger itself, Plaintiff's affidavit states that \"the defect in the stairs ... cannot be perceived by the naked eye at a reasonable distance while climbing those stairs\" or \"while walking down ... or ... up the stairs[,]\" and he testified at deposition that he \"didn't recognize\" the defect at the time he descended the steps.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Taking this evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, a reasonable and prudent person would not know to take any precautions against this apparently imperceptible danger, whether carrying a casket or not. Thus, that same reasonable and prudent person would not believe taking the adjacent ramp to be necessary, nor feel the need to seek additional help or use a trolley, and we do not believe that carrying\n   a casket up the church steps into the sanctuary for a funeral is an indisputably negligent act.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    O'Neal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8527009\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/55/225/#p229\">\n    55 N.C.

So we cannot conclude that, as a matter of law, Plaintiff was contributorily negligent in electing to utilize the apparently safe stairs rather than taking the casket up the adjacent ramp.

Specifically, the evidence conclusively establishes that Plaintiff began his fall when he tripped over a step which was properly constructed. And, the evidence also conclusively establishes that Plaintiff was negligent as he stumbled over the next\n   step whose defective design was obvious. I believe that Judge Gray ruled correctly and, therefore, I dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Here, Plaintiff's own expert described the stairs essentially as follows: There are five concrete steps leading from the sidewalk to the Church's entry door. But there is also a rise from the top (fifth) concrete step into the Church building itself. The rises between the five concrete steps (that is, between the first and second, the second and third, the third and fourth, and the fourth and fifth) are all concrete and are\n   uniform in height, about 6.5 inches each.

Specifically, Plaintiff admitted in his deposition that he began his fall when he tripped as he was stepping from the fourth concrete step to the fifth concrete step, before attempting to make the last step into the Church building:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Q: Are you tripping on concrete or brick?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   A: Both of them, really.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   Q: Which one do you trip on first?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   A: Well, it would have to be that one first because it comes first.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   Q: Which one?

Through this testimony, Plaintiff clearly states that he first tripped on the top of the concrete rise between the fourth and fifth step. Any doubt as to what Plaintiff was saying was cleared up with his response to the following question, which clearly assumes that Plaintiff began tripping as he was stepping on the fifth concrete step:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   Q: From the area you started tripping, which you say [is] the front of this concrete step, would you draw a line from that point over to this part of the picture and put a 1 on it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Plaintiff then marked on a photo of the steps that he began tripping on the\n   <em>\n    top front corner\n   </em>\n   of the fifth concrete step; he did not initially trip on the 10.5 inch rise from the fifth step into the Church building. This picture marked by Plaintiff was before Judge Gray and is part of the record on appeal. And Plaintiff's own evidence, through the affidavit of his expert, is uncontradicted that this step between the fourth and fifth concrete step was not in violation of the Building Code, as it was uniform with the other steps that Plaintiff had just ascended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   I am guided by our Supreme Court that \"if [a] step is properly constructed and well lighted so that it can be seen by one entering or leaving the [building], by the exercise of reasonable care, then there is no liability.\"\n   <em>\n    Garner v.

Based on\n   <em>\n    Garner\n   </em>\n   , I conclude that the Church was not liable with respect to Plaintiff's stumble as he stepped from the fourth concrete step to the fifth.

Assuming, the Church may have been negligent as to this final step because of the height differential, Plaintiff was also negligent for not taking due care in taking this final step. Plaintiff's own expert described the rise between the concrete steps as being concrete, but that the rise between the last concrete step into the church consisted of some concrete, then brick, and then a wooden threshold, a difference which I believe was open and obvious. The picture of the steps in the record shows obvious differences between the other step rises and the rise leading into the building, such as the rise into the building consisting of some concrete, then mostly dark red brick, and then a white threshold, whereas the other rises were uniformly gray concrete. Further, Plaintiff had walked down these same steps just minutes prior to the fall, surely noticing the height differential as he stepped from the Church building to the top step. And the evidence shows that it was daytime when he fell.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stoltz v.
