He voluntarily transferred to inactive status in September 2011. On April 24, 2013, the Court suspended Petitioner from the practice of law in this state for ninety-days for failing to file his state and federal income tax returns for tax years 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010.\n   <em>\n    In re Flowers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7335434\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/402/385/\">\n    402 S.C. 385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7335434\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/402/385/\">\n    741 S.E.2d 759\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   Petitioner did not seek reinstatement; however, he now asks the Court to accept his request to resign from the South Carolina Bar pursuant to Rule 409, SCACR.
