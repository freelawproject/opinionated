Gecy, River City Developers, LLC, and River City Real Estate, LLC (collectively, River City) appeal the circuit court's order granting partial summary judgment to Hilton C. Smith, Jr., Coosaw Investments, LLC, and Hilton C. Smith, Jr., Inc. of South Carolina (collectively, Coosaw) on River City's malicious prosecution claim. On appeal, River City argues the circuit court erred in finding River City was unable to prove the element of favorable termination of proceedings. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   River City is a residential construction company owned by Benjamin C. Gecy. Coosaw was the real estate developer of Somerset Point at Lady's Island (Somerset Point), a subdivision in Beaufort, South Carolina. River City built several homes and improvements on lots in Somerset Point. As developer, Coosaw created and controlled the Somerset Point Homeowner's Association (HOA). In 2011, River City allegedly informed the HOA it believed Coosaw, and the construction companies it controlled, deviated from and modified the design and construction standards mandated for the subdivision. River City claims Hilton C. Smith, Jr., as agent for the HOA, responded to these allegations by accusing River City of deviating from new design standards the HOA issued for the subdivision and demanding payment of fees and fines from River City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As a result of this dispute, River City filed a lawsuit against Coosaw on September 20, 2011 (the 2011 action), which alleged causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, and unfair trade practices. Coosaw counterclaimed and crossclaimed against River City for violating the HOA's design standards and sought a temporary injunction to block River City from continuing construction in Somerset Point. Coosaw also filed a notice of lis pendens that described a piece of\n   property in Somerset Point-Lot 16--as affected by the litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   River City moved to strike the notice of lis pendens on the ground that Coosaw never included any information about Lot 16 in its counterclaim and crossclaim for injunctive relief. The master-in-equity agreed, and struck the notice of lis pendens finding \"the [c]ounterclaim and [c]rossclaim do not seek to affect the title to the subject real property in this litigation.\" Coosaw filed a motion seeking reconsideration of the master's decision to strike the notice of lis pendens. During the hearing on Coosaw's motion to reconsider, the master also considered a motion from River City to strike an assessment lien placed on Lot 16 by Coosaw. The master ultimately denied both Coosaw's motion to reconsider the master's decision to strike the notice of lis pendens and River City's motion to strike the assessment lien placed on Lot 16 by Coosaw. The master issued a written order explaining his findings:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   I find that the harm to River City in granting [Coosaw]'s Motion to Reconsider outweighs the benefit to [Coosaw] if the [notice of] Lis Pendens remains in place. Striking the [notice of] Lis Pendens will allow River City's lender to resume providing construction draws and River City's project can then be completed. [Coosaw's assessment] lien, however, is subordinate to River City's loan which should not prohibit the lender from dispensing construction draws to River City. I find that balancing the equities in this case is appropriate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Coosaw appealed the master's order to this Court, but it ultimately withdrew the appeal after River City's sale of Lot 16 rendered the issue moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On October 23, 2014, River City filed the lawsuit at issue in this appeal, alleging causes of action for malicious prosecution and abuse of process based on Coosaw's filing of the\n   notice of lis pendens in the 2011 action. As to its malicious prosecution cause of action, River City asserted in its complaint, \"With respect to the unlawful [notice of] Lis Pendens ... th[ose] proceedings have been terminated in [River City]'s favor.\" However, all of the causes of action alleged by both parties in the 2011 action remain pending before the circuit court.\n   Coosaw filed a motion for summary judgment on River City's malicious prosecution claim, arguing there was never a favorable termination of proceedings for River City. At the motion hearing, River City specifically argued it received a favorable termination of proceedings: the master's removal of the notice of lis pendens. Coosaw asserted there was no favorable termination for River City because the master removed the notice of lis pendens on equitable, not substantive grounds. The circuit court granted Coosaw's summary judgment motion on River City's malicious prosecution claim finding, \"[River City] is unable to prove the element of termination of [the underlying] proceeding in [River City]'s favor.\" The circuit court determined the master based his removal of the notice of lis pendens on equitable, not substantive grounds and found there was no favorable termination. River City filed a motion seeking reconsideration, which the circuit court denied.

Without the requirement that a termination reflect the merits, a party could obtain a favorable result in a malicious prosecution action while the claim underlying the malicious prosecution action was still pending. This could theoretically result in a party receiving two conflicting decisions arising from the same case: a favorable decision on the malicious prosecution action and an unfavorable decision on the underlying claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Based on our review of the sources addressing this element, we interpret the element of favorable termination of proceedings to mean a termination reflective of the merits.\n   <em>\n    See Prosser and Keeton on The Law of Torts\n   </em>\n   at 874; 54 C.J.S.\n   <em>\n    Malicious Prosecution\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 60 (2018) ; 52 Am. Jur. 2d\n   <em>\n    Malicious Prosecution\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 29 (2018). This interpretation means a termination consistent with a finding for the defendant on substantive grounds and not based solely on technical or procedural considerations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   52 Am. Jur. 2d\n   <em>\n    Malicious Prosecution\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 42 (2018) ; Vitauts M.

For example, a case's dismissal based on the statute of limitations would not be a favorable termination because a decision on the statute of limitations does not reflect the merits of the action.\n   <em>\n    Palmer Dev.

We believe this holding is in accordance with the aforementioned criminal cases because the terminations in these criminal cases reflected on the innocence of the accused.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   , 171 S.C. at 498, 172 S.E. at 873 (finding a favorable termination when criminal charges against a defendant were dismissed);\n   <em>\n    Elletson\n   </em>\n   , 231 S.C. at 570, 99 S.E.2d at 386 (finding a favorable termination when a defendant was charged with commission of a crime and exonerated);\n   <em>\n    McKenney\n   </em>\n   , 304 S.C. at 21, 402 S.E.2d at 888\n   (finding a favorable termination when criminal charges were\n   <em>\n    nolle prossed\n   </em>\n   for reasons which imply or are consistent with innocence). Finally, we caution that our interpretation of this element only applies to a malicious prosecution claim founded upon a civil proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Turning to the present case, we find River City failed to establish the favorable\n   termination element of its malicious prosecution claim because we find a party's successful removal of a notice of lis pendens alone does not constitute a favorable termination to support a malicious prosecution claim. The underlying action on the merits remains pending; thus, this action is premature. River City's success in striking the notice of lis pendens alone does not equate to a finding in its favor on any substantive ground.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   52 Am. Jur. 2d\n   <em>\n    Malicious Prosecution\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 42 (2018). A notice of lis pendens is fundamentally procedural because it merely serves as another form of pleading and does not confer any substantive right.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pond Place\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1110036\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/351/1/#p16\">\n    351 S.C. at 30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1110036\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/351/1/#p16\">\n    567 S.E.2d at 896\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"We find a lis pendens filed in conjunction with an action involving the same real estate is merely another form of pleading.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Adhin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7050348\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/44/1245/#p1251\">\n    44 So.3d at 1251-52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The filing of a notice of lis pendens does not create ... any superior substantive property rights.\"). A notice of lis pendens is typically filed with a complaint, and only contains the names of the parties, the object of the action, and a description of the property affected by the lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 15-11-10 (2005).

We still agree, as this Court found in\n   <em>\n    Pond Place\n   </em>\n   , that \"the proper action against a maliciously filed [notice of] lis pendens is under abuse of process or malicious prosecution.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1110036\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/351/1/#p16\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1110036\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/351/1/#p16\">\n    at 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1110036\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/351/1/#p16\">\n    567 S.E.2d at 897\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
