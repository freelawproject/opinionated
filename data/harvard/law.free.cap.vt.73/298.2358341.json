The defendant and said Elizabeth Ring were tenants in common of a farm, on which the crops in question were grown, from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>time they were planted until and at the time of the alleged trespass and trover unless the defendant had been deprived of his interest in the premises by his failure to redeem under a decree of foreclosure. The decree in question provided that the defendant might redeem on or before September 7, 1900, and gave the said Elizabeth Ring, for redemption, seven days thereafter. The defendant did not redeem, and the said Elizabeth, on September 14, 1900, did. On the same day she conveyed the premises in question to the plaintiff by deed of warranty. Shortly afterwards the defendant, who was in the occupation of the premises, harvested and carried away certain crops that season grown by him, planted upon a portion of the premises that he had occupied. This suit was brought for the taking and carrying away of said crops.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b315-5\"><em>Edward H.

Seymour, 51 Vt. 320. But the mortgage is not thereby extinguished. If the tenant who fails to redeem does not pay his just portion of the mortgage debt, he may be foreclosed by the other tenant; but, until such foreclosure, the relation of the parties to the common property is that of tenants in common. Such being the relation of the parties to the property in question, the action of trespass and trover cannot be maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
