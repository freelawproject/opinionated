As a general proposition it will not issue when there is another adequate remedy. As a result of this doctrine it is a rule of almost universal application that it will not issue when there is an adequate remedy by appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">Here there was an adequate remedy by appeal; and the petitioner availed himself of it at first, but for some unalleged reason, abandoned his appeal and allowed tbe judgment and sentence to stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\"><em>Hence the writ will not </em>issue, <em>and the petition is dismissed with costs.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
