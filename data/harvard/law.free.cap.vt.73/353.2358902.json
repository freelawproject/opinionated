S. 1698 to recover the penalty for knowingly receiving illegal fees. Plea, the general issue. Trial by jury, Franklin county, September Term, 1900, <em>Stafford, </em>J., presiding. Verdict and judgment for the plaintiff. The defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-12\">The defendant was collector of taxes for the town, of Johnson and the fees in question grew out of the due collection by him from the plaintiff in Bakersfield of an unpaid balance of a tax. At the close of the evidence the defendant moved the court to direct a verdict in his favor. The motion was denied.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b369-13\"><em>Brigham &amp; Start </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b369-14\"><em>George M.

Bakersfield is through Waterville; that nine miles would cover the distance from Johnson to Waterville, and that upon investigation he considered it eight miles from Waterville to Bakersfield; and that it must have been two miles from Bakersfield to where he found the plaintiff; that figuring it this way it made nineteen miles where he charged twenty; that he did not know the distance when he made the charge; that he guessed at it \u2014 used his best judgment in regard to- it, and made the charge in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">These estimates of the defendant were evidence tending to show that there was an overcharge of one mile, but we find nothing in his testimony which tends to show that the overcharge was knowingly made. The mere fact that he was without definite knowledge of the distance and yet failed to- make inquiry cannot be given that effect. He may have had good reason to believe that his own.knowledge and judgment regarding the distance from Walter Cutting\u2019s meadow to the treasurer\u2019s office in Johnson were as likely to. be correct as any information that could reasonably be obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
