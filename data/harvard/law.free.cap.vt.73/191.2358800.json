The trial court held that it did, on the strength of <em>Hartland </em>v. <em>Hackett, </em>57 Vt. 92. There the collector was arrested on an extent and committed to jail, and had not been discharged with consent of the town nor by operation of law, but was out on bail, and it was held that the extent proceedings barred the town from maintaining an action previously commenced on the collector\u2019s official bond, for that the remedies were elective and not concurrent, a claim not made by counsel for the defence, who stood solely on the ground that the imprisonment operated in law as a satisfaction, a question that the court said it was not necessary to consider. That case has been three times referred to by this court unfavorably, namely, in <em>White </em>v. <em>White, </em>68 Vt. 167, <em>Sheeran </em>v. <em>Sparhawk, </em>68 Vt. 605, and in <em>Pawlet </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>69 Vt. 400, and we think it time that it be overruled, as not properly distinguishing between consistent and inconsistent remedies, and as misapplying the law of that subject to the case, the basal idea of that law being, that a man shall not be permitted to insist at different times upon the truth of each of two inconsistent claims or positions, according to the promptings of his private interest; as, to affirm and to disaffirm a contract, and the like. But there is no inconsistency between the remedy of extent against a delinquent collector, and a remedy on his offi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>cial bond, for neither involves a repudiation of the other, but both are in affirmance of his contract to collect and pay over. It is not like suing in tort when that disaffirms a contract, nor like suing in assumpsit when that waives a tort. Whether a collector\u2019s property can be pursued when his body is held in execution on an extent is another question, and one not raised here, for this collector\u2019s body has never been taken in execution on the extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-3\">The three cases referred to aptly illustrate and correctly state and apply the doctrine of the election of remedies, and therefore an extended discussion of it here is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
