Gould\u2019s PI., Ch. 3, ss. 2, 166. It is not sufficient to allege that a certain act was fraudulently and deceitfully committed, but such facts must be stated as will give it that character. A declaration in fraud cannot be sustained without appropriate facts being alleged to ground the action upon, showing that the plaintiff had been damnified by the defendant\u2019s deceit or wrongful act. <em>Ide </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>11 Vt. 615; <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Bourdon, </em>50 Vt. 494; <em>Sprague </em>v. <em>Fletcher, </em>67 Vt. 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">It is alleged in these counts that the plaintiff carried on the business of selling typewriters at St. Johnsbury, and that the defendant fraudulently contriving to purchase a typewriter of the plaintiff at agent\u2019s price of seventy-five dollars, when the regular price was one hundred dollars, \u201cfraudulently and deceitfully contriving, and craftily and subtly intending to deceive and defraud the plaintiff in this behalf, requested the plaintiff to send him on trial an Underwood typewriter at agent\u2019s price, and then and there represented to the plaintiff that he, the defendant, knew of intending purchasers, and that if he were satisfied with such typewriter on trial, he would keep such typewriter at agent\u2019s price and become the agent for such Underwood typewriter in St. Johnsbury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">It is alleged that the plaintiff confided in these representations and delivered a typewriter to the defendant for a five days\u2019 trial, when, if the defendant were satisfied with it, he might if he desired purchase it at agent\u2019s price and become an agent for its sale, otherwise to return it to the plaintiff. But it is not alleged wherein it was a fraud upon the plaintiff by which he was damnified that the defendant obtained the chat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>tel at agent\u2019s price, nor is there a denial that he intended to become such agent, nor is the representation that he knew of intending purchasers alleged to have been false.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">The plaintiff contends that these two counts, omitting unnecessary words, are good counts in trover. They do indeed allege a demand by the plaintiff and the defendant\u2019s refusal to return the chattel, but there is no direct allegation of a conversion ; and a demand and refusal are only evidence of a conversion, and stating the mere evidence of a material fact is not sufficient, nor do a demand and refusal in the circumstances alleged constitute a conversion. The allegations are that the defendant took the chattel upon an undertaking to return it after five days\u2019 trial, or retain it at agent\u2019s price and become agent for its sale, otherwise to return it to the plaintiff; that after the expiration of the five days he did not accept it at agent\u2019s price and become agent, and did not return it to the plaintiff although requested. These are allegations of agreements made by the defendant with the plaintiff and of a breach thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">The second count is a good count in trover, and the first and third being in assumpsit, there is a misjoinder.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed; demurrer sustained and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
