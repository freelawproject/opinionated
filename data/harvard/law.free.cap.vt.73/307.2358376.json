S. 1298, regulating appeals from justice judgments. The action was commenced before a justice of the peace, from whose judgment the defendant appealed. In County Court the plaintiff moved that the appeal be dismissed, \u201cfor that the case is not appealable, as appears by the justice copy of record and appeal.\u201d The appeal was dismissed, and the defendant excepted. The justice copy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>is not before us, but in its place the bill of exceptions states, that the <em>ad damnum </em>was twenty dollars; that the declaration in the writ was in the general counts in assumpsit and set the damages at twenty dollars; that at the justice trial a new count was added, which is set forth; that the defendant\u2019s plea was the general issue; that the plaintiff\u2019s specifications were, \u201cto car-fare $2.94, to board $1.00, to damages for breach of contract $10.00 \u2014 $13.94;\u201d that the verdict was in the plaintiff\u2019s favor for $3.94 and costs; and that the defendant was allowed an appeal. The case also recites, partially at least, the course of trial before the justice, \u2014 saying that the plaintiff\u2019s evidence tended to show that the defendant procured a third party to write a letter to the plaintiff requesting him to- come to- St. Johnsbury, or send his medicines, at once, as the defendant wished to be treated for the liquor habit, \u2014 which letter is set forth, \u2014 and that in response the plaintiff came and made a contract with the defendant to give him the treatment and be paid therefor twenty-five dollars; that the defendant refused to take the treatment, but promised to pay the plaintiff his expenses as per the first two items of the specification; and that the ten dollar item is for damages for breach of the contract, that being the amount of the profit therein. The new count, among other things which need not be noticed, alleged that the defendant was indebted to the plaintiff \u201cin and about the profit that would have inured to- the plaintiff\u2019s benefit if the defendant had not broken the contract,\u201d and set the damages at fourteen dollars and ninety-four cents, but did not set forth the special contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">The defendant now insists that the judgment must be reversed for error in dismissing the appeal, and the question is, Does error appear ? He makes two claims: first, \u201cthat the case is appealable as appears of record;\u201d second, that, if not, it must be presumed to be so, because the justice allowed the appeal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>unless the contrary positively appears. Let these claims be examined separated.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">It is said that the sum demanded by the new count is more than twenty dollars, which, if true, makes the case appealable. But it is not true. The sum demanded is expressly fourteen dollars and ninety-four cents. Even if the count be treated as a special declaration upon the contract, it cannot be held to demand more. A declaration expressly demanding in damages a sum less than twenty dollars cannot be held to demand more, merely because it proceeds upon the breach of an ex-ecutory contract which, if the plaintiff had been permitted to perform and had performed it, would have entitled him to a larger sum. Such is the fair result of the cases. <em>Church </em>v. <em>Vanduzee, </em>4 Vt. 195, 198; <em>Wightman </em>v. <em>Carlisle, </em>14 Vt. 296; <em>Warren </em>v. <em>Newfane, </em>25 Vt. 250; <em>Crosby </em>v. <em>Enterprise Cheese Co., </em>67 Vt. 638. The cases cited by the defendant\u2014 <em>Connecticut &amp; Passumpsic Rivers R. Co. </em>v. <em>Bates, </em>32 Vt. 420; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>45 Vt. 372; <em>Concord </em>v. <em>National Bank of Derby Line, </em>51 Vt. 144 \u2014 do not hold otherwise, but only that a case is appealable, under another clause of the statute, when the plantiff\u2019s specifications exceed twenty dollars, or when the plaintiff, to recover, must introduce an exhibit in writing exceeding that sum. Here it is not claimed that the case shows an exhibit within the meaning of the statute, and, as we have seen,, neither the specification nor the sum demanded by the declaration exceeded twenty dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">So much for the first claim; now foir the second. The defendant insists that the County Court was bound to- presume, in favor of the regularity of the justice\u2019s allowance, that the plaintiff did present an exhibit exceeding twenty dollars, \u2014 to presume, if necessary, that the liquor cure contract was in writing and presented as an exhibit, or that the defendant pleaded -in offset demands exceeding twenty dollars and filed an affi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>davit, or that something else was done which, under the statute, would have entitled the defendant to an appeal; and he cites <em>Johnson </em>v. Williams, 48 Vt. 565.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-3\">The justice record <em>not </em>being before us, the bill of exceptions must be taken in one of two ways \u2014 either as containing, or as not containing, a complete account of the justice\u2019s proceedings. If the former, the judgment was right for reasons already given. If the latter, it must be presumed, in favor of the judgment of the County Court, that the justice record there shown did profess to recite the whole proceeding, and that it showed no ground for an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
