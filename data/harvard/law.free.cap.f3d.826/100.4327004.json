CARNEY, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b130-20\">Defendant-Appellant John G. Rowland, the former governor of Connecticut, came under scrutiny in 2012 for his efforts to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>obtain paid political consulting work on behalf of two Republican Congressional candidates in the 2010 and 2012 election cycles. One of those candidates, Lisa Wilson-Foley, allegedly arranged with Rowland to pay him through her husband\u2019s company, Apple Rehab, to avoid reporting the payments to the Federal Election Commission (\u201cFEC\u201d). After a trial, a jury convicted Rowland on seven counts of violating campaign-finance laws and falsifying records. The United States District Court for the District of Connecticut (Janet Bond Arterton, <em>J.) </em>sentenced Rowland principally to 30 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Rowland now appeals his conviction and sentence. His primary argument on appeal is that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1519, which prohibits \u201cknowingly ... falsifying] ... any record, [or] document,\u201d does not apply to his conduct: namely, preparing contracts that purported to establish business consulting relationships with political candidates or their businesses, when in fact the parties were negotiating for him to provide political consulting services to the candidates\u2019 campaigns. He also asserts a <em>Brady </em>violation based on the government\u2019s alleged failure to disclose statements made by Lisa Wilson-Foley in an interview with investigators. Finally, he challenges the District Court\u2019s evidentiary rulings, jury instructions, and application of the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">For the reasons set forth below, we AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court. We conclude that the broad language of \u00a7 1519 encompasses the creation of documents \u2014 like the contracts at issue here \u2014 that misrepresent the true nature of the parties\u2019 negotiations, when the documents are created in order to frustrate a possible future government investigation. We reject Rowland\u2019s assertion that principles of contract law prevent us from concluding that documents styled as contracts are \u201cfalsified\u201d within the meaning of the statute. We also determine that the government adequately disclosed Wilson-Fo-le/s statements to Rowland, and that even if it did not, he is not able to show that he was prejudiced by the deficiency. Finally, we reject his challenges to the District Court\u2019s other rulings at trial and at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">BACKGROUND<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">John G. Rowland, the former governor of Connecticut, resigned that post in 2004 amid a corruption scandal, and later pled guilty to a federal charge of conspiracy to commit honest-services and tax fraud. After serving his sentence, Rowland sought to use his political experience by doing political consulting work on behalf of Republican candidates seeking federal office in Connecticut. The instant charges stem from his efforts to secure employment on two campaigns: the 2010 campaign of Mark Greenberg and the 2012 campaign of Lisa Wilson-Foley.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-11\">Rowland and Greenberg first met in the summer of 2009, when Greenberg told Rowland he was considering a run for the United States Senate. Rowland suggested that Greenberg \u201cthink about Congress\u201d and repeatedly offered to serve as a paid consultant for the campaign. Gov\u2019t App. at 23 (Tr. 91:24). Rowland told Greenberg he did not want to be paid by the campaign\u2014 which would have had to report his employment \u2014 but instead wanted to be paid by Greenberg\u2019s business or charitable interests. Later that year, Rowland pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>pared and gave to Greenberg a draft contract, according to which he proposed to provide \u201cconsulting services\u201d for Green-berg\u2019s businesses and his nonprofit, the Simon Foundation. Under the proposal, Rowland would be paid $35,000 per month for 14 months and $25,000 per month for the year thereafter. Greenberg never hired Rowland to work on his campaign or for any other entity, and \u201cripped ... up\u201d the draft contract after his meeting with Rowland. App. at 118 (Tr. 207:16).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">Rowland met Wilson-Foley two years later, in September 2011. Rowland contacted Wilson-Foley \u2014 who by then had declared her Congressional candidacy \u2014 and her husband, Brian Foley, with \u201can idea to run by [them]\u201d: namely, that he would take on a paid role in her campaign. Gov\u2019t App. at 716. Wilson-Foley and her husband believed that Rowland could be helpful to the campaign, but were concerned that (in Foley\u2019s words) \u201chaving a former governor who was a convicted felon connected to the campaign as an advisor\u201d could potentially jeopardize her candidacy. Gov\u2019t App. at 199 (Tr. 796:17-19). Several of Wilson-Foley\u2019s staffers and friends urged her to remain at a distance from Rowland.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Foley, who headed Apple Rehab (\u201cApple\u201d), a nursing home company, made a suggestion: Apple would hire Rowland as a consultant, but in reality Rowland would work primarily for Wilson-Foley\u2019s campaign. Because Rowland would be paid by Apple rather than by the campaign, they believed that by this stratagem they could avoid the requirement that his employment be publicly reported to FEC.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Foley and Rowland ultimately agreed that Rowland would receive $5,000 per month, to be paid by Apple\u2019s attorney, Christian Shelton, in order to avoid direct \u201cconnections\u201d between Rowland and the Foleys. Gov\u2019t App. at 724. Wilson-Foley explained to her campaign manager that Rowland would be paid by Apple because \u201cthat way they wouldn\u2019t have to report it to the FEC.\u201d Gov\u2019t App. at 310 (Tr. 1240:23-24).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">After this agreement was finalized, Rowland worked on Wilson-Foley\u2019s campaign almost daily, vetted press releases, used a campaign e-mail address, and received access to the campaign calendar. He attended staff meetings and was involved with communications strategy and fund-raising. Rowland also did some work for Apple during this period: He met with Apple staff on eight to ten occasions, conducted research at - Apple\u2019s request about the nursing home industry in Connecticut, helped Apple hire a new lobbyist, and advised Apple on union issues, among other tasks. The record indicates,-however, that Rowland\u2019s campaign involvement may have substantially exceeded the amount of work he performed on behalf of Apple. For example, during the relevant period, Rowland participated in 787 e-mail exchanges about the campaign, but only 63 e-mail exchanges regarding Apple, and 23 e-mail exchanges about both Apple and the campaign.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">Rowland\u2019s relationship with the Wilson-Foley campaign became public in April 2012. Although Wilson-Foley, Foley, and Rowland denied anything improper about the arrangement, Rowland\u2019s ties to the campaign and Apple ended shortly thereafter. After the disclosures, the federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>government began investigating Rowland\u2019s work for the campaign.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">In June 2014, a grand jury returned an indictment charging Rowland with (1) falsification of records in a federal investigation in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1519, based on the Greenberg contract; (2) conspiracy to commit various offenses in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, based on an alleged unlawful conspiracy with Wilson-Foley and Foley; (3) falsification of records in a federal investigation in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1519 and 2, based on the Foley contract; (4) two counts of causing the submission of false statements to the FEC in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001(a)(2) and 2, based on the omission of Rowland\u2019s payments from two FEC reports filed by the Wilson-Foley campaign; and (5) two counts of causing illegal campaign contributions in violation of 2 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 441a(a)(l)(A), 441a(f), and 437g(d)(l)(A)(ii) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, based on Foley\u2019s payments to Rowland for his campaign work in 2011 and 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">Following a jury trial, Rowland was convicted on all counts. The District Court denied Rowland\u2019s motion for a new trial on the basis of alleged <em>Brady </em>violations: namely, the government\u2019s alleged failure to disclose certain statements made by Wilson-Foley at an investigatory interview. Rowland was sentenced to 30 months\u2019 imprisonment and three years of supervised release. He now appeals both his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">Rowland\u2019s primary argument on appeal is that the evidence did not support his convictions under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1519 because the contract he offered to Greenberg and the contract he signed with the law office of Apple\u2019s lawyer, Christian Shelton, were not \u201cfalsified\u201d within the meaning of the statute. He also argues that he is entitled to a new trial because the government improperly withheld <em>Brady </em>material from the defense. Finally, he raises a number of other issues relating to the District Court\u2019s evidentiary rulings, its jury instructions, and his sentence.'We address these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-11\">I. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1519</p>\n<p id=\"b133-12\">We review Rowland\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence <em>de novo, </em>viewing the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the government, with all reasonable inferences drawn in its favor.\u201d <em>United States v. Mi Sun Cho, </em>713 F.3d 716, 720 (2d Cir. 2013) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-13\">Rowland was convicted of two counts of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1519, an obstruction of justice statute that was passed in 2002 as part of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The statute prohibits</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-14\">knowingly altering], destroying], mutilating], concealing], covering] up, falsifying], or making] h false entry in any record, document, or tangible object with the intent to impede, obstruct, or influence the investigation or proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States ... or in relation to or contemplation of any such matter or case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-15\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1519. The government contended that Rowland \u201cfalsified] ... documents]\u201d when he (1) prepared the contract proposal that he presented to Greenberg in 2009, and (2) drafted the contract with Brian Foley, Apple, and Apple\u2019s lawyer, Christian Shelton, in 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-16\">A. Meaning of \u201cFalsify\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-17\">Rowland first argues that the documents could not be \u201cfalsified\u201d within the meaning of the statute because to \u201cfalsify\u201d means only to tamper with, a preexisting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>document, not to create a new document from whole cloth.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">\u201cOur starting point in statutory interpretation is the statute\u2019s plain meaning, if it has one.\u201d <em>United States v. Dauray, </em>215 F.3d 257, 260 (2d Cir. 2000). The plain meaning \u201cdoes not turn solely on dictionary definitions of [the statute\u2019s] component words,\u201d but is also determined by \u201cthe specific context in which that language is used, and the broader context of the statute as a whole.\u201d <em>Yates v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 1074, 1081-82, 191 L.Ed.2d 64 (2015) (plurality opinion) (internal quotation marks omitted). If the meaning is plain, the inquiry ends there. <em>Daniel v. Am. Bd. of Emergency Medicine, </em>428 F.3d 408, 423 (2d Cir. 2005). If we find the statutory provision ambiguous, however, \u201cwe then turn to canons of statutory construction for assistance in interpreting the statute.\u201d <em>Greathouse v. JHS Sec. Inc., </em>784 F.3d 105, 111 (2d Cir. 2015). We resort to legislative history only if, after consulting canons of statutory instruction, the meaning remains ambiguous. <em>Daniel, </em>428 F.3d at 423.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">We begin with the text. Where, as here, there is no statutory definition of a term, we consider \u201cthe ordinary, commonsense meaning of the words.\u201d <em>Dauray, </em>215 F.3d at 260.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary offers two relevant definitions of \u201cfalsify.\u201d The first is the definition offered by Rowland: \u201cto make false by mutilation or addition: tamper with.\u201d <em>Falsify, </em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged (2002). But the second supports the government\u2019s position here: \u201cto represent falsely: misrepresent, distort.\u201d <em>Id.-, see also Falsify, </em>Oxford English Dictionary (2d ed. 1989) (defining \u201cfalsify\u201d as \u201c[t]o give a false account of; to misrepresent\u201d). Dictionary definitions thus confirm that, in common usage, it is acceptable to say that someone \u201cfalsifies\u201d a document when he creates a document that misrepresents the truth.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-13\">We acknowledge that, as Rowland points out, the Supreme Court has cautioned against overreliance on dictionary definitions in interpreting this particular statute. <em>See Yates, </em>135 S.Ct. at 1081-82. But the same interpretive clues that led the plurality in <em>Yates </em>to depart from the ordinary dictionary definition in that case counsel in favor of following the dictionary definition here.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-14\">First, \u00a7 1519\u2019s caption is \u201cDestruction, alteration, or falsification of records in Federal investigations and bankruptcy.\u201d In <em>Yates, </em>the plurality concluded that this caption pointed away from interpreting the statute\u2019s phrase \u201ctangible object\u201d to include a fish because the caption \u201cconveys no suggestion that the section prohibits spoliation of any and all physical evidence, however remote from records.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1083. Rather, \u00a7 1519, the plurality observed, was intended to sweep in only \u201crecords, documents, or devices closely associated with them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, unlike in <em>Yates, </em>interpreting \u201cfalsify\u201d \u2014 in accordance with its dictionary definition' \u2014 to include the creation of a document fits comfortably within the general purview of the statute suggested by the title.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-15\">Second, Rowland\u2019s preferred definition of \u201cfalsify\u201d would overlap with other verbs in the statute. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 1085 (rejecting government\u2019s interpretation because it would \u201crender superfluous\u201d another statutory provision). He argues that \u201cfalsify\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>prohibits only changes to existing documents. But the statute expressly prohibits \u201caltering] ... any record, document, or tangible object\u201d with the requisite intent. If we limited the reach of \u201cfalsify\u201d as Rowland suggests, the word would add nothing to the statute\u2019s meaning. \u201cIt is well-settled that courts should avoid statutory interpretations that render provisions superfluous: \u2018It is our duty to give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute.\u2019\u201d <em>State St. Bank &amp; Tv. Co. v. Salovaam, </em>326 F.3d 130, 139 (2d Cir. 2003) (quoting <em>Duncan v. Walker, </em>533 U.S. 167, 174, 121 S.Ct. 2120, 150 L.Ed.2d 251 (2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Rowland argues that the interpretive canon of <em>noscitur a sociis </em>\u2014 \u201ca word is known by the company it keeps,\u201d <em>Yates, </em>135 S.Ct. at 1085 \u2014 also supports his position here. We rely on that principle \u201cto avoid ascribing to one word a meaning so broad that it is inconsistent with its accompanying words, thus giving unintended breadth to the Acts of Congress.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., </em>513 U.S. 561, 575, 115 S.Ct. 1061, 131 L.Ed.2d 1 (1995)) (internal quotation marks omitted). In \u00a7 1519, \u201cfalsifies\u201d appears in a list of other verbs \u2014 \u201calters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up ... or makes a false entry in\u201d \u2014 that, Rowland argues, imply the preexistence of a document. Rowland plausibly argues that we should therefore interpret \u201cfalsify,\u201d too, to apply only to preexisting documents. But when the plain meaning of \u201cfalsify\u201d and other interpretive guideposts lead to the opposite conclusion, a lone canon of construction cannot cabin the meaning of \u201cfalsify\u201d as Rowland urges.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">To the extent any ambiguity remains, legislative history also supports the government\u2019s contention that creating a new document can violate \u00a7 1519: \u201cSection 1519 is meant to apply broadly to any acts to destroy <em>or fabricate </em>physical evidence so long as they are done with the intent to obstruct, impede or influence the investigation or proper administration of any matter, and such matter is within the jurisdiction of an agency of the United States, or such acts done either in relation to or in contemplation of such a matter or investigation.\u201d S. Rep. No. 107-146, at 14 (2002) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">B. Falsity of Rowland Contracts</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">Having concluded that a defendant may violate \u00a7 1519 by creating a document that is false or that misrepresents the truth \u2014 that is, was \u201cfalsified\u201d\u2014 we turn to the question whether the contracts at issue here were \u201cfalsified.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">Rowland\u2019s primary support for his claim that the contracts at issue were not \u201cfalsified\u201d lies in <em>United States v. Blankenship, </em>382 F.3d 1110 (11th Cir. 2004). In that case, the Eleventh Circuit interpreted a different statute that prohibited knowingly and willfully \u201cmakfing] or us[ing] any false writing or document\u201d in any matter under federal jurisdiction. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001(a)(3). The defendant, the owner of a minority-owned business, entered into subcontracts and equipment leases to make it appear that he was providing services to a government contractor. <em>Blankenship, </em>382 F.3d at 1116-17. In fact, the services were provided by a different company, not owned by a minority, that sought to take advantage of the government\u2019s preference for contracts with minority-owned businesses. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b135-11\">The court vacated the defendant\u2019s conviction, reasoning that the contracts between the defendant and the other company were not \u201cfalse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1132-36. The court began its analysis with the proposition that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-12\">there are only two ways in which a contract can possibly be considered \u201cfalse.\u201d First, a contract is false if a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>person forges or alters it.... The only other way in which a contract can be \u201cfalse\u201d is if it contains factual misrepresentations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 1132. The court concluded that promises made in a contract are not \u201cfalse,\u201d even if \u201cneither party actually intended to carry through on their promises,\u201d because \u201c[a] \u2018promise\u2019 contained in a contract is not a certification that the promisor will actually perform the specified acts, or presently intends to perform those acts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1133. Instead, the court observed, a contract simply creates a legal relationship requiring <em>either </em>performance or payment of damages. <em>Id. </em>at 1134.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Although in some circumstances, we might agree with these observations, our approach diverges from that of the Eleventh Circuit. We think that importing principles of contract law into the interpretation of this criminal statute muddies the issues rather than clarifies them. In our view, a written contract may be \u201cfalsified\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1519 if it misrepresents the true nature of the parties\u2019 agreement. Here, Rowland purported to memorialize the terms of his arrangements with Green-berg and the Foleys in written documents. In fact, according to the government\u2019s evidence at trial, those documents intentionally did <em>not </em>reflect the arrangement contemplated by the parties, which involved Rowland providing political consulting to Greenberg\u2019s and Wilson-Foley\u2019s campaigns. Instead, the documents reflected and were designed to reflect that he would be providing business consulting services to their corporate or charitable interests. If Rowland had written a memo to his file purporting to summarize the negotiations in this misleading way (that is, as business rather than political consulting), we think it plain that the memo would properly have been treated as a \u201cfalsified\u201d document: that is, it would have misrepresented the conversations on which it was. based. Where the government is able to prove the knowledge and intent elements of the statute as well, .that Rowland presented his notes in the form of a contract does not avoid his criminal liability under \u00a7 1519.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">Our decision in <em>United States v. Jespersen, </em>65 F.3d 993 (2d Cir. 1995), is instructive. In that case, we easily concluded that a contract was \u201cfalse\u201d when it was inconsistent with the true relationship between the parties. Jespersen, an IRS employee, arranged for government contractors to do repairs on his home for free in exchange for government contracts. <em>Id. </em>at 995-96. When the arrangement was uncovered, he created a backdated contract setting out a schedule of payments that he was supposed to make (but never did). <em>Id. </em>at 996. Jespersen was convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503 for, among other things, creating a false document in response to a grand jury subpoena. <em>Id. </em>at 997. We sustained his conviction on the basis that the contract was \u201cnot merely backdated, but fraudulently showed that [the contractor] had been paid for the work performed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 998. The fact that the document took the form of a contract erected no barrier to our determination that it was \u201cfalse.\u201d <em>See also United States v. Mandanici, </em>729 F.2d. 914, 920 (2d Cir. 1984) (in prosecution under 18 U.S.C.\u00a7 1001, finding a contract to be \u201cfalse\u201d when promisor had no intention of complying with promise when making it); <em>United States v. Shah, </em>44 F.3d 285, 294 (5th Cir. 1995) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">Rowland\u2019s use of the draft Greenberg contract as- part of his effort to derail the government\u2019s investigation in 2013 does not conclusively establish his liability, but it does illustrate how the document falsified \u2014 i.e., misrepresented \u2014 the true relationship between the parties. In a letter to prosecutors, Rowland\u2019s counsel wrote that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>the draft contract \u201cevidence[s] my statement that the discussion concerning raising funds for the charity took place in October and early November. As you will see from the contract, there is no mention of the campaign, and indeed the contract continues for a period of time long after the campaign would have ended.\u201d App. at 576. In fact, Greenberg testified at trial that the October and November negotiations principally concerned political consulting, not work for his charity. That the Greenberg document was styled as a contract does not preclude our conclusion that it was in fact \u201cfalsified\u201d and therefore may be the basis for liability under \u00a7 1519.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">The government\u2019s case that the Wilson-Foley contract was falsified is even stronger. First, the contract purported to establish a relationship between Rowland and Christian Shelton, Apple\u2019s attorney, when Rowland was in fact retained primarily to provide services to Lisa Wilson-Foley\u2019s political campaign. As Shelton wrote in an e-mail to Foley, the drafters put Shelton\u2019s name on the contract to avoid direct \u201cconnections\u201d between Rowland and Wilson-Foley, because of \u201cRowland\u2019s background and the compliance issue that creates.\u201d Gov\u2019t App. at 724. During the drafting process, Rowland suggested that the contract should use his corporate identity\u2014 JGR Associates, LLC \u2014 rather than his name, for \u201cmore cover.\u201d App. at 562.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Express references to political consulting that were present in the original contract were deleted from the final version, supplying further circumstantial evidence that the parties intended to conceal the true nature of the agreement. <em>Compare </em>Gov\u2019t App. at 726 <em>with </em>App. at 549-53. The jury could readily conclude from this and other evidence that Rowland and his co-conspirators intentionally created a document that misrepresented their relationships with the aim of concealing the truth from the FEC \u2014 and, not incidentally, the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">Because the jury was entitled to conclude that both the Greenberg and Foley contracts were \u201cfalsified\u201d in the sense that they were created to misrepresent the true relationships among the parties, Rowland\u2019s convictions under \u00a7 1519 stand, and we need not reach his argument that the \u201cprejudicial spillover\u201d from the \u00a7 1519 evidence requires us to overturn his convictions on all other counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">II. Alleged <em>Brady </em>Violation</p>\n<p id=\"b137-11\">Next, Rowland argues that he is entitled to a new trial because the government did not comply with its disclosure obligations under <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). In particular, he contends that Lisa Wilson-Foley made exculpatory statements to the government during a March 10, 2014 interview that were omitted from the government\u2019s Memorandum of Interview (MOI) (which was provided to the defense) and not otherwise disclosed to Rowland. Had they been provided, the defense would likely have called her to testify about her statements, he asserts.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-12\"><em>\u201cBrady </em>requires that the government disclose material evidence favorable to a criminal defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Mahaffy, </em>693 F.3d 113, 127 (2d Cir. 2012). \u201cEvidence is favorable if it is either exculpatory or impeaching, and it is material if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations and internal quotation marks omitted). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>defendant need not show that the suppressed evidence would have resulted in an acquittal. <em>See Youngblood v. West Virginia, </em>547 U.S. 867, 870, 126 S.Ct. 2188, 165 L.Ed.2d 269 (2006) (per curiam). Rather, a conviction must be reversed \u201cupon a showing that the favorable evidence could reasonably, be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">When reviewing alleged <em>Brady </em>violations, we \u201cexamine the record <em>de novo </em>to determine whether the information in question is material as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Mahaffy, </em>693 F.3d at 127. The trial judge\u2019s assessment of the effect of nondisclosure is entitled to \u201cgreat weight.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Rowland bases his assertion of a <em>Brady </em>violation on (1) an affidavit by Craig Raabe, Wilson-Foley\u2019s attorney at the time of the interview with the government, and (2) an e-mail and notes written by another lawyer for the Foley family, Jessica Santos. According to Raabe, the MOI was incomplete in several respects, one of which Rowland identifies as a possible <em>Brady </em>violation. Raabe asserts that, despite pressure from the government during a break in the interview, Wilson-Foley refused to adopt the government\u2019s view that Rowland\u2019s work for Apple was a \u201csham\u201d rather than a real job. App. at 446-47. Similarly, Santos\u2019s notes from the interview reflect that Wilson-Foley told the government that \u201cit didn\u2019t ring out to her that Brian hired him as a sham; she didn\u2019t know this at the time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 513. Wilson-Foley\u2019s rejection of the government\u2019s characterization of Rowland\u2019s job as a \u201csham\u201d is not expressly recorded in the MOI. After that interview, the government withdrew the joint plea agreement it had offered Foley and Wilson-Foley, under which Wilson-Foley would not have been prosecuted.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">Rowland contends that Wilson-Foley\u2019s refusal to accept the government\u2019s characterization of his job as a \u201csham\u201d tends to exculpate him by casting doubt on one of the government\u2019s key claims at trial: that when Rowland wrote \u201cI get it\u201d in an e-mail to Brian Foley, he was referring to the need to conceal their unlawful scheme to \u201cemploy\u201d Rowland at Apple in exchange for services that he would actually provide to the campaign.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">But the Raabe affidavit and Santos notes are basically consistent with the MOI, which <em>was </em>disclosed to Rowland. According to the MOI, Wilson-Foley denied telling her campaign manager, Chris Co-vucci, that \u201cit was good to have Mr. Rowland working for her husband and there was no concern with Mr. Rowland and the FEC filings.\u201d Gov\u2019t App. at 868. When she was asked about Rowland\u2019s e-mail reminding her that' he was a \u201cvolunteer,\u201d she told the government that \u201cit did not register to her that her husband, Brian, was paying Mr. Rowland.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In other words, the MOI records Wilson-Foley\u2019s denial of a connection between her campaign and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>Rowland\u2019s employment at Apple&amp;emdash;exactly what Rowland now claims he did not know.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">In addition, as the District Court found, Wilson-Foley\u2019s position that Rowland\u2019s employment with Apple was not a \u201csham\u201d because she expected Rowland to do <em>some </em>work there was already known to the defense from other evidence. \u201c[E]vi-dence is not considered to have been suppressed within the meaning of the <em>Brady </em>doctrine if the defendant or his attorney either knew, or should have known, of the essential facts permitting him to take advantage of that evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Paulino, </em>445 F.3d 211, 225 (2d Cir. 2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). Other evidence disclosed to Rowland&amp;emdash;including a voicemail left for a prosecutor by Wilson-Foley\u2019s counsel shortly after this interview and statements she made to the press in 2012&amp;emdash;evinced Wilson-Foley\u2019s stated belief that Rowland had a real job at Apple.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Rowland argues that he could have used Wilson-Foley\u2019s statements to impeach Brian Foley\u2019s testimony by emphasizing that Wilson-Foley had originally stuck to her story that Rowland was a volunteer for her campaign with a legitimate job at Apple. But Rowland had abundant other evidence with which to impeach Brian Foley, and in fact Rowland\u2019s counsel did cross-examine him on the fact that the original \u201cpackage\u201d plea agreement had changed. Gov\u2019t. App. at 296. \u201c[W]here the undisclosed evidence merely furnishes, an additional basis on which to challenge a witness whose credibility has already been shown to be questionable or who is subject to extensive attack by reason of other evidence, the undisclosed evidence may be cumulative, and hence not material.\u201d <em>United States v. Avellino, </em>136 F.3d 249, 257 (2d Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">Furthermore, Rowland has not shown that the Wilson-Foley statements put \u201cthe whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.\u201d <em>Youngblood, </em>547 U.S. at 870, 126 S.Ct. 2188 (internal quotation marks omitted). We give \u201cgreat weight\u201d to the District Court\u2019s determination that, \u201c[g]iven the strength of the other trial evidence against Defendant, ... [he] has not met his burden of showing that there are grounds for a new trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Rowland, </em>No. 3:14cr79(JBA), 2015 WL 1190118, at *4 (D. Conn. Mar. 16, 2015). Here, there was considerable record evidence that Rowland, Foley, and Wilson-Foley conspired to conceal payments to Rowland made in exchange for services rendered to the Wilson-Foley campaign. For instance, Wilson-Foley\u2019s campaign manager testified that when he objected to the prospect of having Rowland on the official campaign payroll, she suggested that \u201cmaybe the campaign doesn\u2019t have to pay him.\u201d Gov\u2019t App. at 358 (Tr. 1432:1-2). Shortly after that conversation, Rowland and Wilson-Foley had three telephone conversations, which were followed by Rowland\u2019s \u201cI get it\u201d e-mail to Brian Foley. In another e-mail, Rowland also described his work on the campaign as \u201c \u2018helping,\u2019 \u201d with quotation marks suggesting that \u201chelp\u201d was a euphemism for paid work. <em>Id. </em>at 722. Later in the campaign, Rowland reminded Wilson-Foley that he was \u201cjust a volunteer helping you and \u2018many other Republican candidates\u2019 in case anyone asks.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 743. Finally, as the District Court noted, Rowland\u2019s role on the campaign expanded as soon as he agreed to the contract with Apple. He reported to campaign headquarters more frequently and his campaign-related e-mail correspondence also increased substantially. From the time the contract was signed in November 2011 until his campaign role was made public in April 2012, his work for Apple and his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>Apple-related correspondence remained minimal.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">Against the backdrop of this powerful documentary and testimonial evidence of Rowland\u2019s guilt, neither Wilson-Foley\u2019s testimony \u2014 which, had it been favorable to Rowland, would have been subject to cross-examination by the government \u2014 nor the use of her interview statements to impeach Brian Foley would have changed the outcome of the trial. Accordingly, Rowland would not be entitled to a new trial even if he could persuade us \u2014 as he has not \u2014 that the government failed to meet its disclosure obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">III. Evidentiary Rulings</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Rowland also challenges three of the District Court\u2019s evidentiary rulings. This Court reviews rulings on the admissibility of trial evidence for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Fazio, </em>770 F.3d 160, 165 (2d Cir. 2014). \u201cA district court has abused its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence or rendered a decision that cannot be located within the range of permissible decisions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>In re Sims, </em>534 F.3d 117, 132 (2d Cir. 2008)). We will reverse only if an error affects a \u201csubstantial right,\u201d Fed. R. Evid. 103(a), meaning that the error \u201chad a \u2018substantial and injurious effect or influence\u2019 on the jury\u2019s verdict,\u201d <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>413 F.3d 201, 210 (2d Cir. 2005) (quoting <em>United States v. Dukagjini, </em>326 F.3d 45, 62 (2d Cir. 2003)). \u201c[W]here a court, upon review of the entire record, is sure that the evi-dentiary error did not influence the jury, or had but very slight effect, the verdict and the judgment should stand.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 764, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946)) (alterations and other marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">Only one of Rowland\u2019s evidentiary challenges merits detailed discussion. At trial, Rowland sought to introduce e-mails and text messages that he wrote to Apple Chief Operating Officer Brian Bedard about matters related to the company. The District Court ruled that the writings were inadmissible hearsay because they would in effect allow Rowland to testify without making himself available for cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">An out-of-court statement is hearsay only if it is offered \u201cto prove the truth of the matter asserted in the statement.\u201d Fed. R. Evid. 801(c). Here, Rowland\u2019s purpose in offering the writings was not to establish the truth of his statements that, for instance, \u201cthe unions will push to nail non-union shops which of course flys [sic] in the face of saving $$,\u201d as Rowland wrote in one e-mail. App. at 578. Instead, Rowland sought to establish that he \u201cwas, in fact, working at Apple and taking the initiative to communicate with Bedard.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 54-55. The text messages and e-mails were therefore not hearsay and should have been admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">But no new trial is warranted, because this error was harmless. The defense was permitted to use the writings to refresh Bedard\u2019s recollection. Bedard then testified about the nature of the communications: namely, that he and Rowland communicated via text message about the status of the contract negotiations. The defense also introduced other evidence of Rowland\u2019s actual work for Apple, such as a report that he prepared at Apple\u2019s request about a state-sponsored study of nursing care in Connecticut. Under these circumstances, we are confident that the District Court\u2019s evidentiary error \u201cdid not influence the jury, or had but very slight effect,\u201d and therefore no new trial is war<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>ranted. <em>Garcia, </em>413 F.3d at 210 (quoting <em>Kotteakos, </em>328 U.S. at 764, 66 S.Ct. 1239).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Rowland\u2019s remaining eviden-tiary challenges are meritless. It was not error for the District Court to allow Brian Foley to testify about the meaning of Row- \u2022 land\u2019s use of expressions like \u201cI get it,\u201d \u201cthis arrangement,\u201d and \u201ccover,\u201d because those expressions were ambiguous without the context that Foley supplied. <em>See United States v. Urlacher, </em>979 F.2d 935, 939 (2d Cir. 1992). It was also proper for Sam Fischer and Mark Katz, Greenberg\u2019s campaign aides, to testify regarding what Greenberg told them about his meetings with Rowland, namely Rowland\u2019s- proposal to work for the campaign while being paid by the Simon Foundation. What Green-berg told Fischer and Katz was not offered for the truth of the matters asserted, but instead to provide context for what Fischer and Katz knew during their subsequent meeting with Rowland. The statement was offered for its effect on the listeners, not its truth, and was therefore not hearsay. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Evid. 801(c). And even if we assume that the government may have, in its closing statement, treated Fischer and Katz\u2019s testimony as if it had been offered for the truth of the matter, those comments were (1) not objected to by Rowland at the time and (2) not unfairly prejudicial. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>968 F.2d 130, 142 (2d Cir. 1992) (\u201cIt is a rare case in which improper comments in a prosecutor\u2019s summation are so prejudicial that a new trial is required.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">IV. Jury Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Rowland identifies a number of alleged errors in the District Court\u2019s jury instructions. We review those instructions <em>de novo. United States v. Roy, </em>783 F.3d 418, 420 (2d Cir. 2015) (per curiam). \u201cA jury instruction is erroneous if it misleads the jury as to the correct legal standard or does not adequately inform the jury on the law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Naiman, </em>211 F.3d 40, 50 (2d Cir. 2000)). A defendant challenging a jury instruction on appeal must demonstrate that he requested a charge that \u201caccurately represented the law in every respect,\u201d that the charge delivered was erroneous, and that he was prejudiced by the error. <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">\u201c[A] criminal defendant is entitled to have instructions presented relating to any theory of defense for which there is any foundation in the evidence, no matter how weak or incredible[] that evidence may be.\u201d <em>United States v. Durham, </em>825 F.2d 716, 718-19 (2d Cir. 1987) (internal quotation marks omitted). The defendant bears the burden of establishing that an adequate evidentiary basis exists for the requested charge. <em>See United States v. Bok, </em>156 F.3d 157, 163 (2d Cir. 1998). A district court\u2019s determination to the contrary is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Hurtado, </em>47 F.3d 577, 585 (2d Cir. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">Rowland argues that the District Court erred by failing to instruct the jury that \u201cMr. Rowland contends that he understood that any payments he received were for work performed for Apple.\u201d App. at 293. The District Court rejected this charge, reasoning that \u201c[fit\u2019s a proxy for [Rowland\u2019s] testimony, which the jury didn\u2019t hear.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 318. Instead, the jury was instructed that Rowland \u201ccontends that ... any payments he received were for work performed for Apple Healthcare, Inc.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 401-02. Rowland now argues that this instruction did not properly represent his defense, which was that \u2014 no matter what Brian Foley\u2019s intentions were \u2014 Rowland <em>believed </em>that he was being compensated only for his work for Apple. But this aspect of his defense was ade<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>quately reflected in other parts of the jury instructions, in which the court informed the jury that \u201cMr. Rowland ... contends that he acted in good faith at all times and not with the intent alleged in each count of the Indictment\u201d and that \u201cMr. Rowland contends that any work performed by him for the Wilson-Foley campaign was in a volunteer capacity. \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 400-02. The District Court did not err in declining to use Rowland\u2019s preferred phrasing.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">None of Rowland\u2019s other objections to the jury instructions has merit. His contention that the jury needed detailed instructions regarding the FEC rules that govern a candidate\u2019s contributions to his own campaign is unavailing. He argues that this instruction was needed to correct the \u201cmisimpression\u201d from Greenberg\u2019s testimony that Rowland\u2019s proposal to have Greenberg pay him directly was \u201cwrong.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 52. But the jury was in fact told (albeit in other words) that Greenberg personally would have been permitted to pay Rowland for his services, as long as Greenberg reported those payments to the FEC. <em>See </em>Gov\u2019t App. at 666 (Tr. 2579:14-23). Rowland\u2019s final argument on jury instructions, that the court erred by instructing the jury that a defendant can falsify a document by knowingly omitting a material fact, is erroneous for the same reasons that Rowland\u2019s challenge to his \u00a7 1519 convictions fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Y. Guidelines Calculation</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Finally, Rowland challenges the District Court\u2019s application of a six-level sentencing enhancement for \u201cthe value of the illegal transactions\u201d pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2C1.8 and 2B1.1. \u201cThis Court reviews a district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines <em>de novo, </em>while factual determinations underlying a district court\u2019s Guidelines calculation are reviewed for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Cramer, 777 </em>F.3d 597, 601 (2d Cir. 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">The applicable 2014 Sentencing Guidelines include a sentencing enhancement for campaign finance offenses that is based on the value of the illegal transactions, if the value exceeds $5,000. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2C1.8 (2014). The District Court calculated the value of the illegal transactions to be $35,000, the total amount of the payments Rowland received from Apple. That results in a six-level enhancement under the 2014 Guidelines. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">Rowland argues that the District Court erred in its calculation. He does not dispute that he received $35,000 in payments from Apple. But he argues that the amount he received should have been offset by $5,000, which he asserts to be the value of the services he actually provided to the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">The District Court rejected this argument on the ground that the value to Apple of any services Rowland rendered was simply \u201ca byproduct of the attempted cover-up of the true nature of the campaign contributions.\u201d <em>United States v. Rowland, </em>No. 3:14cr79(JBA), 2015 WL 1275655, at *5 (D. Conn. Mar. 19, 2015). We agree with the District Court. The record supports the court\u2019s conclusion that the legitimate services Rowland performed for Apple were inseparably intertwined with the services he performed for Wilson-Foley\u2019s campaign, and that Rowland would not have performed services for Apple at all but for his planned cover-up. Because the District Court\u2019s factual finding regarding the nature of the payments to Apple is not \u201cclear error,\u201d <em>Cramer, 777 </em>F.3d at 601, the six-level sentencing enhancement was proper and the sentence need not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-11\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b142-12\">Rowland\u2019s remaining argument, regarding the constitutionality of limits on indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>vidual campaign contributions, is foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Buckley v. Valeo, </em>424 U.S. 1, 96 S.Ct. 612, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976). Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b131-7\">.
