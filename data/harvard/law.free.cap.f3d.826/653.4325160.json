Defendant Brent Tarntino (\u201cTarntino\u201d) appeals from a judgment of the United States District Court for the Western District of New York (Siragusa, /.), granting summary judgment to Plaintiffs-Appellees MPC Franchise, LLC (\u201cMPC Franchise\u201d) and MP Cleary, Inc. (\u201cMP Cleary\u201d) (collectively, \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) \u2014 entities owned principally by Tarntino\u2019s cousins, David Cleary and Robert Cleary \u2014 on Plaintiffs\u2019 claim that Tarntino fraudulently obtained his federal trademark registration for the PUDGIE\u2019S mark in connection with restaurants that principally serve pizza, pasta, and submarine sandwiches.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-12\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b681-13\">\n<em>A. Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b681-14\">The dispute over the PUDGIE\u2019S mark traces back more than fifty years to the town of Elmira, New York, just north of the Pennsylvania border. In 1963, three brothers \u2014 Charles \u201cPudgie\u201d Cleary, Francis Cleary, and Michael Cleary, Sr.\u2014 opened up a pizza parlor on the north side of Elmira and named it Pudgie\u2019s, after one of the three brothers. The following year, the three brothers opened a second Pudgie\u2019s location, this time on the south side of Elmira. The two locations came to be known as \u201cPudgie\u2019s Northside\u201d and \u201cPudgie\u2019s Southside,\u201d respectively. Pudgie\u2019s Northside and Pudgie\u2019s Southside experienced continued success, prompting the three brothers in 1972 to form the Pudgie\u2019s Pizza Franchising Corporation (\u201cPPFC\u201d) for the purpose of offering and selling franchises for additional Pudgie\u2019s pizza parlor locations. PPFC then registered the PUDGIE\u2019S mark with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cPTO\u201d). <em>See </em>PUDGIE\u2019S, Registration No. 1,102,421 (Sept. 12,1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-15\">The three brothers had a sister, Bernadette Tarntino, who, in 1973, purchased a franchise from PPFC and opened a Pudgie\u2019s location in Horseheads, New York, located several miles north of Elmi-ra. The location came to be known as \u201cPudgie\u2019s Horseheads.\u201d To manage Pudgie\u2019s Horseheads, Bernadette Tarntino formed a corporation named Pudgie\u2019s Pizza Corporation \u2014 Horseheads (\u201cPPCH\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-16\">In 1985, the PTO cancelled PPFC\u2019s federal ' trademark registration of the PUDGIE\u2019S mark after PPFC failed to file a required declaration. For several years, however, PPFC continued to operate its franchises as before.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>In 1990, Michael Cleary, Sr. died owning 50% of the stock in PPFC, as well as all of MP Cleary, which in turn owned Pudgie\u2019s Southside and another Pudgie\u2019s location in Pennsylvania. These interests passed on to his sons, David and Robert Cleary, as well as his wife, Rosa Cleary. PPFC began to deteriorate, however, sometime in the early 1990s. On September 29, 1993, PPFC officially dissolved, and another franchisor did not immediately take its place. As a result, the restaurants that were operating as franchisees of PPFC just prior to PPFC\u2019s dissolution became independently run operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">The chain of Pudgie\u2019s pizza restaurants that got their start in Elmira, New York, was not the only chain of restaurants in the nation to use the name \u201cPudgie\u2019s\u201d in connection with restaurants and food services. In the New York City metropolitan area, there was a chain of restaurants principally serving Med chicken that also went by the name of \u201cPudgie\u2019s\u201d (or, more specifically, \u201cPudgie\u2019s Famous Chicken\u201d). In 2002, Arthur Treacher\u2019s, Inc. (\u201cArthur Treacher\u2019s\u201d), the entity that operated the Pudgie\u2019s Famous Chicken restaurants at the time, obtained a federal trademark registration for the \u201cPUDGIE\u2019S\u201d mark in connection with \u201c[r]estaurant[s] and carry[-]out restaurant services.\u201d PUDGIE\u2019S, Registration No. 2,565,298 (April 30, 2002). Arthur Treacher\u2019s later assigned its interest in the PUDGIE\u2019S mark to PAT Franchise Systems, Inc. (\u201cPAT\u201d). MP Cleary learned of PAT\u2019s mark in 2004, when it looked into obtaining a new federal trademark registration for the PUDGIE\u2019S mark. Shortly thereafter, MP Cleary and PAT reached an agreement regarding the mark, pursuant to which PAT granted MP Cleary a \u201cnon-exclusive, perpetual and transferable license to use and display the PUDGIE\u2019S mark ... in connection with MP Cleary\u2019s existing and future restaurants,\u201d while PAT \u201cretain[ed] the right to use the [PUDGIE\u2019S mark] solely in connection with its \u2018Pudgie\u2019s Famous Chicken\u2019 business.\u201d J.A. 196. PAT then assigned its interest in the PUDGIE\u2019S mark to Tru-Foods, LLC (\u201cTruFoods\u201d) in 2008. In 2009, David and Robert Cleary formed MPC Franchise to begin franchising Pudgie\u2019s pizza restaurants.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">Meanwhile, Bernadette Tarntino died in 2007, leaving a one-third stake in PPCH to each of her three children, one of whom is Defendant-Appellant Tarntino. On July 12, 2010, Tarntino filed an application with the PTO seeking a federal trademark registration for a mark \u201cconsist[ing] of the word \u2018Pudgie\u2019s\u2019 displayed in a custom font,\u201d for use in connection with \u201c[p]izza parlors\u201d and \u201c[r]estaurant services featuring pizza, pasta, and subs.\u201d J.A. 526-27 (emphasis omitted). Tarntino certified in his application that \u201c[t]o the best of his[ ] knowledge and belief[,] no other person, firm, corporation, or association has the right to use the [PUDGIE\u2019S] mark,\u201d either in \u201cidentical form\u201d or \u201cin such near resemblance ... as to be likely ... to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> J.A. 531. Because applicants for federal trademark registrations generally must include a \u201cspecimen\u201d representative of the mark\u2019s actual use in the marketplace, <em>see </em>37 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>C.F.R. \u00a7 2.56, Tarntino also submitted with his application a photograph of a Pudgie\u2019s pizza box that he obtained from Pudgie\u2019s Horseheads, where he worked at the time. Displayed beneath the PUDGIE\u2019S mark on the pizza box were the words \u201c\u00ae Pudgie\u2019s Pizza Franchising Corporation 1972.\u201d J.A. 378; J.A. 602, \u00b6 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">On February 22, 2011, the PTO issued Tarntino a federal trademark registration for the PUDGIE\u2019S mark. <em>See </em>PUDGIE\u2019S, Registration No. 3,922,745 (Feb. 22, 2011). By letters dated March 30, 2011, Tarntino informed all owners of Pudgie\u2019s pizza establishments, including MPC Franchise, that, among other things: he was the registered owner of the PUDGIE\u2019S mark, as \u201cused in the operation of food establishments\u201d; the mark entitled him to \u201cnationwide priority with respect to use of the \u2018Pudgie\u2019s\u2019 logo in the operation of pizza parlors and the provision of restaurant services featuring pizza, pasta, and submarine sandwiches\u201d; and Pudgie\u2019s pizza establishments could not use the mark beyond the geographic regions they currently served without first obtaining Tarnti-no\u2019s written permission. J.A. 549. Failure to obtain such permission, Tarntino warned, could prompt him to file a trademark-infringement lawsuit. Following this letter, Tarntino also called at least one Pudgie\u2019s pizza establishment reiterating his rights in the PUDGIE\u2019S mark, and touted his sole ownership of the PUDGIE\u2019S mark on Facebook.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">\n<em>B. Procedural History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">On June 21, 2011, Plaintiffs filed suit against Tarntino in the United States District Court for the Western District of New York, alleging various violations of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1051 <em>et seq. </em>Relevant here is Plaintiffs\u2019 second cause of action, seeking cancellation of Tarntino\u2019s mark pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1064(3), principally on the grounds that Tarntino fraudulently obtained the mark. In response, Tarntino, along with PPCH, counterclaimed, alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>federal trademark infringement, common-law trademark infringement, and federal unfair competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-9\">After Tarntino moved for summary judgment, Plaintiffs cross-moved for partial summary judgment, including with regard to their claim seeking cancellation of Tarntino\u2019s mark due. to fraudulent procurement. In a ruling dated May 13, 2014, the district court (Siragusa, /.) granted Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment insofar as it relied on fraud as a basis for cancellation of Tarntino\u2019s mark, finding that the record clearly demonstrated, <em>inter alia, </em>that Tarntino \u201cknew that Plaintiffs were already franchising pizzerias, using the very same mark that he was attempting to register for that same purpose.\u201d <em>MPC Franchise, LLC v. Tarntino, </em>19 F.Supp.3d 456, 480-81 (W.D.N.Y. 2014). The district court canceled Tarntino\u2019s registration, dismissed Tarntino and PPCH\u2019s counterclaim for federal trademark infringement, granted Tarntino and PPCH\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Plaintiffs\u2019 federal unfair-competition claim, and denied Tarntino and PPCH\u2019s motion for summary judgment on several other counterclaims. <em>See id. </em>at 484-86. Tarntino and PPCH thereafter voluntarily dismissed their remaining counterclaims. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-10\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b683-11\">\u201cWe ... review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, ... drawing all factual inferences in favor of the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Chabad Lubavitch of Litchfield Cty., Inc. v. Litchfield Historic Dist. Comm\u2019n, </em>768 F.3d 183, 192 (2d Cir. 2014). We affirm when \u201cwe are able to conclude ... that there is no genu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>ine issue of dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Ne. Research, LLC v. One Shipwrecked Vessel, </em>729 F.3d 197, 207 (2d Cir. 2013) (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Costello v. City of Burlington, </em>632 F.3d 41, 45 (2d Cir. 2011)).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-3\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">On appeal, Tarntino principally contests the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Plaintiffs on their claim seeking cancellation of Tarntino\u2019s PUDGIE\u2019S mark on the grounds that Tarntino procured the mark by fraud. Under the Lanham Act, \u201cany person who believes that he is or will be damaged\u201d may file a \u201cpetition to cancel a registration of a mark,\u201d for which \u201cregistration was obtained fraudulently.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1064(3); <em>see also </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1119. \u201cFraud in procuring a trademark registration ... occurs when an applicant knowingly makes false, material representations of fact in connection with his application.\u201d <em>In re Bose Corp., </em>580 F.3d 1240, 1243 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (quoting <em>Torres v. Cantine Torresella S.r.l., </em>808 F.2d 46, 48 (Fed Cir. 1986)); <em>see also Orient Express Trading Co. v. Federated Dep\u2019t. Stores, Inc., </em>842 F.2d 650, 653 (2d Cir. 1988) (specifying that a plaintiff seeking cancellation of a trademark on the basis of fraudulent procurement must point to a \u201cknowing misstatement ... with respect to a material fact\u201d (emphasis omitted)). \u201cA party seeking cancellation of a registered trademark on grounds of fraud must demonstrate the alleged fraud by \u2018clear and convincing evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Orient Express, </em>842 F.2d at 653 (quoting <em>Beer Nuts, Inc. v. Clover Club Foods Co., </em>711 F.2d 934, 942 (10th Cir. 1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">Here, Tarntino applied for the PUDGIE\u2019S mark in his individual capacity and signed an oath attesting, <em>inter alia, </em>that: (1) he believed himself to be \u201cthe owner of the ... mark\u201d; and (2) \u201c[t]o the best of his[] knowledge and belief[,] no other person, firm, corporation, or association has the right to use the [Pudgie\u2019s] mark,\u201d either in \u201cidentical form\u201d or \u201cin such near resemblance ... as to be likely ... to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive.\u201d J.A. 531. Tarntino does not dispute the materiality of these representations, but argues that he lacked fraudulent intent with respect to them. Specifically, Tarntino argues that the Federal Circuit\u2019s 2009 decision in <em>Bose </em>makes clear that the scienter standard for fraud on the PTO is met only when an applicant <em>actually knew </em>that material statements in the trademark application were false, and that it is not enough that the applicant <em>should have known </em>about such falsity. Under that heightened standard, Tarntino urges, Plaintiffs failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that he had sufficient scienter with respect to the above statements. According to Tarntino, the district court, in concluding otherwise, misapplied the scienter standard and effectively held Tarntino liable for misstatements in his trademark application simply because he <em>should have known </em>that they were false. We agree with Tarntino about the degree of scienter required for a plaintiff successfully to allege fraudulent trademark procurement, but nevertheless find no genuine issue of material fact that Tarntino fraudulently obtained his mark.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>In <em>Bose, </em>the Federal Circuit rejected the federal Trademark Trial and Appeals Board\u2019s (\u201cTTAB\u201d) scienter standard for claims alleging fraudulent trade- . mark procurement, under which \u201c[a] trademark applicant commits fraud in procuring a registration when it makes material representations of fact in its [trademark application] which it knows or <em>should know </em>to be false or misleading.\u201d 580 F.3d at 1244 (first alteration in original) (quoting <em>Medinol Ltd. v. Neuro Vasx, Inc., </em>67 U.S.P.Q.2d 1205, 1209 (T.T.A.B. 2003)). As the Federal Circuit clarified, \u201ca trademark is obtained fraudulently under the Lanham Act only if the applicant or registrant <em>knowingly </em>makes a false, material representation with the intent to deceive the PTO.\u201d <em>Bose, </em>580 F.3d at 1245 (emphasis added). We agree with the Federal Circuit in <em>Bose </em>that \u201c[m]ere negligence is not sufficient to infer fraud\u201d on the PTO. <em>See id. </em>at 1244 (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Symbol Techs., Inc. v. Opticon, Inc., </em>935 F.2d 1569, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1991)). That is, to succeed on a claim that a trademark holder procured the mark by fraud, a plaintiff cannot merely show that the trademark holder \u201cshould have known\u201d that the application contained false statements of material fact. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Tarntino asserts that <em>Bose </em>reflects a paradigm shift as to the scienter required to show fraudulent trademark procurement, which raises the question whether this Circuit\u2019s case law is consistent with <em>Bose. </em>We conclude that it is. To be sure, we stated in <em>Patsy\u2019s Italian Rest., Inc. v. Ba\u00f1as, </em>658 F.3d 254 (2d Cir. 2011) \u2014 in the routine course of reciting the general elements of a claim alleging fraudulent trademark procurement \u2014 that one of the requirements of such a claim was that \u201c[t]he person making the representation knew <em>or should have known </em>that the representation was false (\u2018scienter\u2019).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 270 (emphasis added) (quoting 6 J. Thomas MoCaRthy, McCaRthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition \u00a7 31:61 (4th ed.), Westlaw (database updated Dec. 2009)).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But any suggestion in <em>Patsy\u2019s </em>that the scienter element is satisfied when a plaintiff shows merely that an applicant \u201cshould have known\u201d the falsity of a representation is dicta. After the district court in <em>Patsy\u2019s </em>canceled a mark held by one of the parties, the issue on appeal, as framed by the parties, was whether there was sufficient evidence that the mark holder <em>\u201cknew </em>that [a certain statement about the duration and continuity of its use of the mark] was a misrepresentation\u201d at the time the mark holder submitted its allegedly fraudulent application. <em>Id. </em>at 271 (emphasis added). We concluded that there was ample evidence to support the jury\u2019s conclusion that the mark holder \u201chad to have known\u201d that the statement was false, <em>id. </em>not simply that it \u201cshould have known.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-9\"><em>Patsy\u2019s </em>thus did not alter the law of this Court, stated in prior cases such as <em>Orient Express, </em>that for a plaintiff to show that a trademark holder fraudulently ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>tained her trademark, the \u201callegedly fraudulent statements [in the application] may not be the product of mere error or inadvertence.\u201d <em>Orient Express, </em>842 F.2d at 653. Rather, they must be \u201cknowing misstatement[s]\u201d of material fact that \u201cindicate a \u2018deliberate attempt to mislead the [PTO].\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(second alteration in original) (quoting <em>Money Store v. Harriscorp Fin., Inc., </em>689 F.2d 666, 670 (7th Cir. 1982)). This standard is consistent with <em>Bose, </em>and with all other Circuits to have considered the question post-Rose. <em>See Hokto Kinoko Co. v. Concord Farms, Inc., </em>738 F.3d 1085, 1098 (9th Cir. 2013) (concluding that a counterclaim defendant seeking cancellation of plaintiffs mark did not satisfy the scienter standard because the defendant \u201cput forth no evidence suggesting that the false statement [in the plaintiffs application] was anything other than the result of a simple mistake,\u201d and \u201cadduced no evidence that [the plaintiff] <em>knew </em>of the misstatement ... or intended to defraud the [PTO]\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of Saint John of Jerusalem of Rhodes &amp; of Malta v. Fla. Priory of the Knights Hospitallers of the Sovereign Order of Saint John of Jerusalem, Knights of Malta, the Ecumenical Order, 702 </em>F.3d 1279, 1289 (11th Cir. 2012) (stating that \u201c[a]n applicant commits fraud when he <em>\u2018knowingly </em>makes false, material representations of fact in connection with an application for a registered mark\u2019 \u201d and requiring a \u201cpurpose or intent to deceive the PTO in the application for the mark\u201d (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Angel Flight of Ga., Inc. v. Angel Flight Am., Inc., </em>522 F.3d 1200, 1209 (11th Cir. 2008)); <em>Fair Isaac Corp. v. Experian Info. Solutions, </em>650 F.3d 1139, 1148 (8th Cir. 2011) (\u201cFraud in procuring a trademark registration or renewal occurs when an applicant <em>knowingly </em>makes false, material representations of fact in connection with his application.\u201d (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Bose, </em>580 F.3d at 1243)).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">Nevertheless, while we agree with Tarntino that it is insufficient for a claim of fraudulent procurement of a mark that the applicant \u201cshould have known\u201d about the falsity of a representation in the application, Tarntino\u2019s arguments about the requisite degree of scienter do not aid him. As an initial matter, it is plain that the district court did not rely on an incorrect scienter standard in determining that Tarntino fraudulently obtained his mark. To be sure, the district court quoted <em>Patsy\u2019s </em>for the general elements of a claim for mark cancellation based on fraudulent procurement, and thus included the language from <em>Patsy\u2019s </em>that the applicant \u201cshould have known\u201d the falsity of alleged misrepresentations. <em>MPC Franchise, </em>19 F.Supp.3d at 478 (quoting <em>Patsy\u2019s, </em>658 F.3d at 270). But the district court unequivocally found that no material issue of fact existed as to Tarntino\u2019s <em>actual knowledge of </em>falsity with respect to the misrepresentations alleged by Plaintiffs. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 480-81 (\u201cTarntino ... <em>knew </em>that Plaintiffs were already franchising pizzeri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>as, using the very same mark that he was attempting to register for that same purpose.\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>see also id. </em>at 480 (\u201cTarntino was <em>well aware </em>that he was merely a one-third owner of the [corporation that in turn owned Pudgie\u2019s Horse-heads]. Tarntino\u2019s misstatement of ownership was not a mistake.... Tarntino was not attempting to register the mark on behalf of the corporation in which he was a part owner; he registered it for himself.\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Indeed, it is beyond question that Tarn-tino possessed the requisite degree of scienter, even under the more stringent standard for which Tarntino advocates. Even though Tarntino applied individually and personally for the mark, Tarntino admits \u2014 as he must \u2014 \u201cthat [he] did not individually or personally use the [PUDGIE\u2019S m]ark\u201d at any point in time. Appellant\u2019s Br. 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">Further, there is abundant evidence that Tarntino knew that others had rights to use the mark that were at least equal, if not clearly superior, to his own. Most importantly, Tarntino was well aware of multiple other Pudgie\u2019s locations that were using the mark in the precise same capacity in which he applied for the mark, including the very first Pudgie\u2019s locations, Pudgie\u2019s Northside and Pudgie\u2019s South-side, located mere miles away from Pudgie\u2019s Horseheads. Unsurprisingly, Tarntino was familiar with the beginnings of the original Pudgie\u2019s locations, which his uncles (one of whom Tarntino described as \u201cthe godfather ... of the family\u201d) started, and which grew into a family business involving many of Tarntino\u2019s close relatives. J.A. 384. In a deposition, Tarntino admitted that he knew that when his mother opened Pudgie\u2019s Horseheads, she operated the restaurant as a franchisee. He even had a copy of a franchise agreement between his mother and PPFC defining, <em>inter alia, </em>the scope of his mother\u2019s rights to use the PUDGIE\u2019S mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">The district court correctly concluded that no material issue of fact existed as to whether Tarntino knowingly made false, material representations in his application. Indeed, the specimen that he included with his application exhibited that the PUDGIE\u2019S mark originally came from PPFC, as it was an image of a pizza box displaying the words \u201c\u00ae Pudgie\u2019s Pizza Franchising Corporation 1972\u201d beneath the PUDGIE\u2019S mark. J.A. 378. And when asked in a deposition whether these words \u201csignified] to [Tarntino] that someone other than [him] owned [the PUDGIE\u2019S mark],\u201d Tarntino conceded that the words indicated to him that someone else \u201cha[d] the rights to\u201d the mark \u201c[a]long with [him].\u201d <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b687-10\">Given these facts, it cannot be gainsaid that Tarntino knew fully well that other Pudgie\u2019s locations used the PUDGIE\u2019S mark even before Pudgie\u2019s Horseheads existed, in the same general area as Pudgie\u2019s Horseheads and for use in connection with pizza restaurants. Thus, even setting aside the fact that Tarntino applied for the PUDGIE\u2019S mark in his individual capacity despite only having acquired in 2007 a one-third share in the corporation that owned Pudgie\u2019s Horseheads, Tarntino could not have believed earnestly that \u201cno other person, firm, corporation, or association ha[d] the right to use the [PUDGIE\u2019S] mark,\u201d either in \u201cidentical form\u201d or \u201cin such near resemblance ... as to be likely ... to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive.\u201d J.A. 531. No genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether Tarntino knew that other entities had rights to use the mark in the very manner in which he sought to use the mark, and whether he intended to mislead the PTO by attesting otherwise in his trademark application.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Plaintiffs on their claim seeking cancellation of Tarntino\u2019s mark.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b682-5\">. Specifically, Tarntino attested that \"[t]o the best of his[] knowledge and belief no other person, firm, corporation, or association has the right to use the mark in commerce, either in the identical form thereof or in such near resemblance thereto as to be likely, when used on or in connection with the goods/services of such other person, to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive.\u201d J.A. 531; <em>see also </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1051(a)(3) (listing the general verification requirements for a trademark application based on use in commerce); 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.33(b)(1) (setting forth the oath enshrining the statutory requirements).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b684-5\">. Tarntino also disputes Plaintiffs' contention that his statement in his application that the date of the mark's first use was in 1980 was fraudulent. Notwithstanding the fact that in 1980, Tarntino was, by his own admission, seven years old and \"not directly using the mark,\u201d J.A. 104, Tarntino argues that his statement of first use was not material. We need not address Tarntino\u2019s statement of first use here, as we conclude on other grounds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>that Plaintiffs established by clear and convincing evidence that Tarntino fraudulently obtained his mark.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b685-7\">. At the time we heard argument in <em>Patsy\u2019s, </em>McCarthy's treatise still reflected the pre-Bose TTAB standard, and had not yet been updated to take into account the Federal Circuit's decision in <em>Bose.

Because we conclude that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to whether Tarnti-no possessed actual knowledge with respect to false representations of material fact in his application, we need not address whether a somewhat less stringent standard than actual knowledge \u2014 such as \"reckless disregard,\u201d <em>see Bose, </em>580 F.3d at 1246 n. 2, or the \"willful blindness\u201d standard that applies to claims of induced patent infringement, <em>see Glob.-Tech Appliances, Inc. </em>v. <em>SEB S.A., </em>563 U.S. 754, 766-68, 131 S.Ct. 2060, 179 L.Ed.2d 1167 (2011) \u2014 may satisfy the scienter requirement for fraudulent procurement of a mark, <em>cf. Bose, </em>580 F.3d at 1246 n. 2 (\"The PTO argues that ... making a submission to the PTO with reckless disregard of its truth or falsity satisfies the intent to deceive requirement.
