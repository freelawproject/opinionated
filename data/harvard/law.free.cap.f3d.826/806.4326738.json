HIGGINSON, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b822-11\">Jimmie Williams appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his claim that defendant J.B. Hunt Transport, Incorporated fired him from his job as a tractor-trailer driver due to his disability and in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-16\">When J.B. Hunt hired Williams in June 1999, Williams affirmed that he had read and understood J.B. Hunt\u2019s company policies, which require that drivers meet \u201call Federal and State requirements for certification and [commercial driver] licensing ... including a current DOT [Department of Transportation] medical physical.\u201d These policies reflect federal regulations prohibiting any person from \u201cdriv[ing] a commercial motor vehicle unless he/she is qualified.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 391.11. To be \u201cphysically qualified,\u201d a driver must meet certain \u201cphysical qualification standards\u201d and also \u201ccompl[y] with the medical examination requirements in \u00a7 391.43.\u201d <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 391.41(a)(3)(i). A person is not physically qualified if, among other things, he has a current clinical diagnosis of any \u201ccardiovascular disease of a variety known to be accompanied by syncope\u201d (fainting), or any \u201ccondition which is likely to cause loss of consciousness or any loss of ability to control a commercial motor vehicle.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 391.41(b)(4), (b)(8). The medical examiner who provides the driver\u2019s certification must attest \u201cthat the driver does not have any physical, mental, or organic condition that might affect the driver\u2019s ability to operate a commercial vehicle safely.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 391.43. The DOT regulations also outline a process for resolution of conflicting medical evaluations. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 391.47.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-17\">On May 19, 2010, Williams fainted at his home and was diagnosed with syncope. Williams went on medical leave the next day. The physician who made this diagnosis, Dr. Chuong Nguyen, recommended a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>diagnostic workup and advised that Williams could return to work on June 1, 2010. Dr. Nguyen later extended Williams\u2019s return-to-work date to July 15. He also diagnosed Williams with ventricular tachycardia (a rapid and irregular heartbeat). On July 15, 2010, Williams saw a different physician, Dr. C.H. Howard with Concentra Medical Centers in Houston, who certified Williams as meeting the DOT standards outlined in 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 391.41. The notes from that examination reflect that Williams told the doctor that he passed out \u201cdue to a cough,\u201d and do not mention Williams\u2019s prior diagnoses of syncope and ventricular tachycardia.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">On July 16, 2010, J.B. Hunt received a report from Dr. Nguyen noting the syncope and ventricular tachycardia diagnoses. J.B. Hunt forwarded that report to Concentra \u2014 believing that information therein differed from the medical history reflected in Dr. Howard\u2019s certification\u2014 and because Dr. Howard was not available, a third physician, Dr. Ellison Wittels, reviewed the report. Dr. Wittels then wrote a letter to J.B. Hunt stating: \u201cI have reviewed the Medical Condition Report you faxed to me.... At this time [Williams\u2019s] DOT Certification is rescinded until further clarification is received in regard to his medical problem.\u201d Less than a week later, Dr. Nguyen sent to J.B. Hunt notes and test results from the diagnostic workup, along with a letter opining that Williams could return to work immediately. J.B. Hunt forwarded these documents to Dr. Wittels. On July 29, 2010, Dr. Wit-tels saw Williams in his office and told him that his DOT certification was being rescinded.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-8\">Before Williams learned about the rescission of his certification, J.B. Hunt had informed him that it needed additional medical information in order for Williams to continue on approved leave. After the meeting between Williams and Dr. Wittels, J.B. Hunt sent Williams letters requesting more information and warning that his failure to provide it, or his inability to return to work by certain dates, could lead to his termination. Williams points to no evidence that he ever submitted additional medical documentation to J.B. Hunt or Concentra.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nor did he ever file an application for the DOT to resolve any conflict between medical evaluations pursuant to 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 391.47. At some point after his medical leave expired and no earlier than September 8, 2010, J.B. Hunt administratively terminated Williams. J.B. Hunt maintains that it did so because Williams had not been medically certified to return to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-9\">After filing a disability discrimination charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and receiving a right-to-sue letter, Williams filed this lawsuit, alleging that he was terminated in violation of the ADA.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> J.B. Hunt filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction based on failure to exhaust administrative remedies, or in the alternative, for summary judgment. The district court granted the motion on subject-matter jurisdiction grounds. <em>See generally Williams v. J.B. Hunt Transp., Inc., </em>132 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>F.Supp.3d 858 (S.D. Tex. 2015). Williams appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">The district court dismissed Williams\u2019s ADA claim for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), reasoning that a plaintiff in Williams\u2019s situation must, before filing suit, exhaust his administrative remedies by initiating 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 391.47\u2019s process for resolution of conflicting medical evaluations. <em>Williams, </em>132 F.Supp.3d at 874. Although no statute requires such exhaustion and \u00a7 391.47 does not itself refer to the ADA or discrimination claims, courts have found it prudent to impose an exhaustion requirement because of the DOT\u2019s greater competence in determining when its safety regulations are met. <em>See, e.g., Harris v. P.A.M. Transp., Inc., </em>339 F.3d 635, 637-39 (8th Cir. 2003); <em>Campbell v. Fed. Express Corp., </em>918 F.Supp. 912, 916-21 (D. Md. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">This court has not yet had occasion to determine whether to impose this exhaustion requirement. But any such requirement would not be jurisdictional. The Supreme Court recently emphasized \u201cthat a rule should not be referred to as jurisdictional unless it governs a court\u2019s adjudicatory capacity, that is, its subject-matter or personal jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Henderson ex rel. Henderson v. Shinseki, </em>562 U.S. 428, 435, 131 S.Ct. 1197, 179 L.Ed.2d 159 (2011). And not all administrative exhaustion requirements are jurisdictional. Indeed, \u201cin the absence of a statutory requirement of exhaustion of administrative remedies, the jurisprudential doctrine of exhaustion controls.\u201d <em>Taylor v. U.S. Treasury Dep\u2019t, </em>127 F.3d 470, 475 (5th Cir. 1997). That doctrine \u201cis not jurisdictional in nature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we have corrected district courts that have treated as jurisdictional administrative exhaustion requirements not mandated by any statute\u2019s text. <em>See Caldera v. Ins. Co. of the State of Pa., </em>716 F.3d 861, 867 n.11 (5th Cir. 2013); <em>Premiere Network Servs., Inc. v. SBC Commc\u2019ns, Inc., </em>440 F.3d 683, 686 n.5 (5th Cir. 2006). No statute requires that an ADA plaintiff exhaust the \u00a7 391.47 process before filing a lawsuit, <em>Campbell, </em>918 F.Supp. at 918, let alone does so in jurisdictional terms, <em>see Henderson, </em>562 U.S. at 438, 131 S.Ct. 1197. Thus, the district court should not have dismissed this ADA claim for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-9\">J.B. Hunt moved in the alternative for summary judgment, arguing that Williams could not establish a prima facie case of discrimination on the basis of disability. We may affirm on any ground raised below and supported by the record, even if the district court did not reach it. <em>Gilbert v. Donahoe, </em>751 F.3d 303, 311 (5th Cir. 2014); <em>see Premiere, </em>440 F.3d at 692, 686 n.5 (affirming dismissal, but noting that Rule 12(b)(1) was the wrong vehicle for dismissing the action). Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). A \u201cdispute about a material fact is \u2018genuine\u2019 \u201d if \u201ca reasonable jury could return <em>k </em>verdict for the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). But if a party \u201cfails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party\u2019s case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial,\u201d a court should enter summary judgment. <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-10\">Title I of the ADA prohibits employment discrimination \u201con the basis of disability.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a). Where\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>as here \u2014 the plaintiff relies on circumstantial evidence to prove an ADA violation, we apply the <em>McDonnell-Douglas </em>burden-shifting framework. <em>Cannon v. Jacobs Field, Servs. N.A., Inc., </em>813 F.3d 586, 590 (5th Cir. 2016). Under this framework, the plaintiff must first make out a prima facie case of discrimination by showing: \u201c(1) the plaintiff has a disability, or was regarded as disabled; (2) he was qualified for the job; and (3) he was subject to an adverse employment decision on account of his disability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If he does so, the employer must articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action. <em>Id. </em>Then the burden shifts back to the plaintiff \u201cto produce evidence from which a jury could conclude that the employer\u2019s articulated reason is pretextual.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">Of course, Congress did not intend the ADA to do away with federal safety regulations. As the Supreme Court has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-6\">When Congress enacted the ADA, it recognized that federal safety rules would limit application of the ADA as a matter of law. The Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee Report on the ADA stated that \u201ca person with a disability applying for or currently holding a job subject to [DOT standards for drivers] must be able to satisfy these physical qualification standards in order to be considered a qualified individual with a disability under title I of this legislation.\u201d The two primary House committees shared this understanding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APl\"><em>Albertson\u2019s, Inc. v. Kirkingburg, </em>527 U.S. 555, 573, 119 S.Ct. 2162, 144 L.Ed.2d 518 (1999) (alteration in original) (citations omitted). Thus, \u201ccourts have consistently held that an employment action based upon an employee\u2019s or prospective employee\u2019s inability to satisfy DOT medical standards does not violate disability discrimination laws.\u201d <em>Talbot v. Md. Transit Admin., </em>No. WMN-12-1507, 2012 WL 5839945, at *2 (D. Md. Nov. 15, 2012). Otherwise, motor-carrier employers would face the dilemma of risking ADA liability or violating the DOT\u2019s command that \u201ca motor carrier shall not ... permit a person to drive a commercial motor vehicle unless that person is qualified\u201d under the agency\u2019s safety regulations. <em>See </em>49 C.F.R. \u00a7 391.11. Applying this logic and recognizing the DOT\u2019s greater expertise in applying its medical-certification regulations, three sister circuits have rejected commercial drivers\u2019 ADA claims when, as here, a doctor found the plaintiff medically unqualified and the plaintiff did not obtain a contrary opinion through the DOT\u2019s administrative process.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">In one such case, a trainee driver named Harris was examined by a Dr. Hussey, who issued him a certificate of qualification. <em>Harris, </em>339 F.3d at 636-37. But details in Dr. Hussey\u2019s examination report concerned the employer\u2019s medical review office, who sent that report and additional medical records to a second doctor. That doctor reviewed Harris\u2019s records and concluded that Harris was not medically qualified; as a result, the employer declined to hire him. <em>Id. </em>at 637. The Eighth Circuit affirmed dismissal of Harris\u2019s ADA claim because, among other reasons, he could not \u201cprove an essential element of a prima facie ADA claim: namely, that he was qualified to perform the job function of a commercial truck driver.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 638-39. The court noted that \u201cDOT regulations clearly require a valid medical examiner\u2019s certificate of physical qualification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 639. And it rejected Harris\u2019s argument that Dr. Hussey\u2019s initial certification satisfied that requirement, concluding that once a second doctor disputed that certification, Harris could not establish a prima facie ADA case unless he went through 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 391.47\u2019s dispute resolution process. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b826-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>The Seventh Circuit reached a similar conclusion when an ADA plaintiff lacked DOT medical certification at the time he sought reinstatement as a commercial driver. <em>See Bay v. Cassens Transp. Co., </em>212 F.3d 969, 973-76 (7th Cir. 2000). That court explained that \u201c[ujnder applicable DOT regulations, Cassens was not allowed to permit Bay to resume driving until he produced a copy of a doctor\u2019s certificate indicating he was physically qualified to drive, and nothing in the ADA purports to change that obligation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 974 (citations omitted). Citing the availability of \u00a7 391.47, the court further reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Adu\">[I]t is only when a dispute [between physicians] is resolved in favor of the employee that an employer is obligated to return the employee to work. Until that point, Cassens was entitled to rely on Bay\u2019s failure to obtain certification in refusing to allow him to resume his employment as a commercial truck driver, and Cassen may assert Bay\u2019s lack of certification as a valid defense to Bay\u2019s ADA claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b826-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 975 &amp; n.2. The Seventh Circuit therefore concluded that Bay could not establish the \u201cotherwise qualified\u201d element of his ADA claim and affirmed the district court\u2019s summary judgment against him. <em>Id. </em>at 975-76.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">Finally, in an unpublished opinion, the Sixth Circuit reached the same conclusion when two physicians disagreed ; over whether an ADA plaintiff was qualified under DOT regulations and the plaintiff did not seek resolution under \u00a7 391.47f <em>See King v. Mrs. Grissom\u2019s Salads, Inc., </em>No. 98-5258, 1999 WL 552512, at *1-3 (6th Cir. 1999). That appellate court affirmed summary judgment in favor of the employer, holding that the plaintiff was \u201cnot a qualified individual under the ADA\u201d because he lacked the requisite certification and failed to exhaust the \u00a7 391.47 procedure. <em>Id. </em>at *2-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-8\">Williams cites no contrary authority, and persuaded by the reasoning of our sister circuits, we conclude that Williams failed to establish that he was qualified for the job in question \u2014 an essential element of his ADA claim. It is undisputed that a physician rescinded Williams\u2019s DOT certification months before J.B. Hunt terminated Williams, and that Williams never sought review under \u00a7 391.47. Because he lacked the DOT certification required by federal law, J.B. Hunt could not let him return to driving, and the company\u2019s administrative termination of Williams did not violate the ADA.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-9\">Williams\u2019s counterarguments are unavailing. He contends that \u00a7 391.47 does not apply because there is no \u201cdisagreement between the physician for the driver and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>the physician for the motor carrier,\u201d 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 391.47(b)(2); rather, he asserts, the disagreement is between two Concen-tra doctors retained by J.B. Hunt. The Eighth Circuit rejected a similar argument in Harris,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and we conclude that, because Williams relies on the certification initially issued by Dr. Howard and the supportive opinion given by Dr. Nguyen, there is clearly a \u201cdisagreement between [a] physician for the driver and [a] physician for the motor carrier.\u201d Williams also argues that \u00a7 391.47 does not apply because\u2019 Dr. Wit-tels did not physically examine him. But neither did the doctor who refused certification in <em>Harris; </em>there, as here, the physician concluded that the plaintiff was not qualified based on a review of medical records. <em>Harris, </em>339 F.3d at 637.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Williams cites no contrary authority suggesting that \u00a7 391.47 does not apply in his situation, and none of his arguments overcomes the fact that Williams\u2019s DOT certification was \u201crescinded\u201d months before J.B. Hunt took any adverse employment action against him. At the time he was terminated, Williams was not certified under DOT medical standards; therefore, he was not qualified for his job under the ADA and summary judgment is appropriate.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"Apu\">For the reasons stated, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal of this action.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b822-12\">. Congress delegated to the Secretary of Transportation the authority to prescribe driver qualifications. <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 31102(b)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b823-6\">. Williams alleged in his complaint that he \"provided [J.B. Hunt] with additional medical documentation plainly demonstrating that all test results that he received were normal and that the original diagnosis of 'syncope, ventricular tachycardia\u2019 was eliminated as a cause of [his] fainting.\u201d But of course, a party opposing summary judgment must present evidence and cannot \u201crest on his allegations.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248-49, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b823-11\">. Williams also brought a claim under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, but he abandoned that claim in the district court and does not mention it on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b826-6\">. The Seventh Circuit noted that it might be proper for a court to \"look behind\u201d a plaintiff's lack of certification in some circumstances \u2014 for example, if the doctor\u2019s disqualification was based on a condition not covered by DOT regulations, or if there was evidence of bad faith or collusion between the employer and the medical professional. <em>Bay, 212 </em>F.3d at 975. But here, as in <em>Bay, </em>\"[a] mere ongoing medical relationship between a company and a health organization does not demonstrate a conflict of interest, nor is there any evidence in the record that [Dr. Wittels's] evaluation was biased.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 975 n.4. Williams claims in his brief that J.B. Hunt \"had one of its administrative assistants tamper with [his] DOT certification,\u201d and suggests that this is evidence of animus or bad faith. But the evidence Williams cites for this allegation merely shows that an administrative assistant contacted Concentra to \"inform [Dr. Howard] that the company had received a Medical Condition Report that he should see, since the diagnosis in the report differed from the information reflected in\u201d Dr. Howard\u2019s report, and that the assistant then sent that report to Concentra, whereupon a second doctor reviewed Williams\u2019s medical records. That is not evidence of bad faith or collusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b827-5\">. <em>See Harris, </em>339 F.3d at 638 (\"[W]e reject Harris's argument that, because the medical disagreement in this case is between MTC\u2019s [a truck-driving school\u2019s] physician and PAM\u2019s [the employer's] physician, the DOT procedures do not apply. Harris adopted the MTC physician's finding that he was physically qualified when he presented it to PAM as proof of his eligibility for employment. He also submitted evidence of, and thereby adopted, his own physician's opinion that he was qualified to drive a truck.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b827-6\">. <em>See also Cliburn v.
