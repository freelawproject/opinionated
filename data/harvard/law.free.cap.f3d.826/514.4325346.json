To date, only Martinez Vega, Cuevas, and one other have stood trial. <em>See United States v. Garcia, </em>757 F.3d 315 (D.C. Cir. 2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-16\">The indicted individuals were allegedly affiliated with the Fuerzas Armadas Revo-lucionarias de Colombia (\u201cFARC\u201d), a \u201cleft-wing guerilla group that has waged a violent insurgency against Colombia\u2019s government for much of the last fifty years.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 316. Though it initially eschewed the drug trade as counterrevolutionary, the FARC embraced the manufacture and exportation of cocaine in the early 1980s as a lucrative means to fund its increasingly ambitious military objectives. John Otis, <em>The FARC and Colombia\u2019s Illegal Drug Trade, </em>Wilson Center (Nov. 2014), at 3, https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/ files/Otis_FARCDrugTrade2014.pdf. By the 1990s and early 2000s, after the breakup of the famous Medellin and Cali cartels, the FARC began to consolidate its control over the coca fields and cocaine production. <em>Id. </em>at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-17\">Martinez Vega and Cuevas allegedly occupied different roles within the cocaine trade. Martinez Vega\u2019s role primarily consisted of exporting cocaine and importing arms. Throughout his association with the FARC, he was allegedly responsible for exporting at least 11,000 kilograms of cocaine and with supplying the FARC with 250 tons of ammunition, explosives, and weapons. Cuevas, on the other hand, allegedly operated a large cocaine laboratory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>that produced thousands of kilograms of cocaine paste each week. In addition to supervising that operation, Cuevas allegedly met with FARC officials on several occasions to oversee the shipment of coca base to his laboratory.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">After their capture and extradition to the United States, Martinez Vega and Cuevas were tried for and convicted of violating Title 21 of the United States Code, Sections 812, 952, 959, 960, and 963. Taken together, these sections provide for the punishment of any person who knowingly or intentionally conspires to import, manufacture, or distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine into the United States. The district court then sentenced Martinez Vega and Cuevas to 330 and 348 months\u2019 imprisonment, respectively. These defendants come before us now appealing their convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Three categories of issues are raised in this appeal: the joint issues, the Martinez Vega-specific issues, and the Cuevas-spe-cific issues. Both Martinez Vega and Cue-vas challenge the sufficiency of the evidence, the <em>mens rea </em>jury instructions, and the district court\u2019s denial of their motions alleging prosecutorial misconduct. Martinez Vega challenges several evidentiary rulings pertaining to identification evidence, as well as the application of a \u201cmanagerial\u201d sentencing enhancement. Finally, Cuevas challenges the admission of certain evidence, the adequacy of the district court\u2019s curative instruction to the jury regarding stricken testimony, the district court\u2019s refusal to permit cross-examination about witnesses wearing ankle monitoring devices, and its application of certain sentencing enhancements. Detailed discussions of the facts, evidence, and standards of review will be set forth as necessary to address each issue Defendants raise.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">I. Joint Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">Martinez Vega and Cuevas together raise three arguments for vacating their convictions: (i) the <em>mens rea </em>evidence was insufficient; (ii) the <em>mens rea </em>jury instructions were misleading; and (in) the Government committed prejudicial prosecuto-rial misconduct. We address each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">A. Sufficiency of Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">Defendants argue the evidence at trial was insufficient to prove the <em>mens rea </em>element of their charged offense; that they <em>knew </em>or <em>intended </em>the cocaine would end up in the United States. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 952(a); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 959(a); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 960(a)(1), (a)(3). In their view, not only did the Government fail to put on any direct evidence of <em>mens rea, </em>the proffered circumstantial evidence doesn\u2019t justify the inference that either of them knew the destination of the cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">Challenging a jury verdict for insufficient evidence carries with it an \u201cexceedingly heavy burden.\u201d <em>United States v. Booker, </em>436 F.3d 238, 241 (D.C. Cir. 2006); <em>see also United States v. Morris, </em>576 F.3d 661, 666 (7th Cir. 2009) (describing the burden as a \u201cnearly insurmountable hurdle\u201d). To prevail, Defendants must convince the court that no \u201crational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Stadd, </em>636 F.3d 630, 636 (D.C. Cir. 2011). We review sufficiency-of-the-evidence claims \u201cin the light most favorable to the government, drawing no distinction between direct and circumstantial evidence, and giving full play to the right of the jury to determine credibility, weigh the evidence and draw justifiable inferences of fact.\u201d <em>United States v. Dykes, </em>406 F.3d 717, 721 (D.C. Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-11\">We conclude the jury\u2019s <em>mens rea </em>determinations were justified by sufficient evidence. The Government demonstrated sev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>eral facts from which a rational juror could reasonably infer intent or knowledge that the cocaine would end up in the United States. First, it demonstrated that at least half of the cocaine produced in Colombia is exported to the United States, establishing a substantial probability that at least some of the 11,000 kilograms of cocaine Martinez Vega trafficked or the thousands of kilograms of cocaine paste Cuevas manufactured each week was headed to the. United States. Second, several witnesses confirmed that, among the FARC rank- and-file, it was a widespread and generally known fact that the cocaine they handled was destined for the United States. Maria Santiago and Hern\u00e1n Santiago each testified that the destination of these drugs (the United States) was a topic of discussion among Cuevas\u2019s subordinates at the laboratory. And Alexis Perez offered similar testimony with respect to Martinez Vega, that it was \u201csomething normal to hear the comments that the coke was coming to the United States because it was said that it is the country that most consumes it.\u201d These testimonies justify an inference that those within both Martinez Vega\u2019s and Cuevas\u2019s operations were generally aware of the intended destination. Third, Martinez Vega and Cuevas had high-level roles in their association with the FARC, which, in conjunction with the previous point, justifies an inference that, given their rank within the organization, they were even more likely to know the destination than their subordinates. Martinez Vega was a leader within the 16th Front of the FARC \u2014 he was an important enough leader that the FARC provided security as he conducted his operations. Cuevas was the \u201cgeneral administrator\u201d of a large cocaine laboratory where he supervised about 80 workers and met with FARC officials to coordinate product deliveries.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">These data points justify the jury\u2019s inferences that both Martinez Vega and Cuevas knew or intended the drugs would end up in the United States. This is not a close question. In fact, in <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>this court upheld a conviction for conspiracy to import cocaine into the United States against an insufficiency challenge based on evidence that closely mirrors the evidence in this case. 476 F.3d 961, 963 (D.C. Cir. 2007). First, a former DEA Agent testified, based on his extensive experience, that \u201calmost every drug operation that transports Colombian cocaine by land through Central America intends to import the cocaine into the United States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 969. Second, there was direct evidence that \u201cmany of the lower-level individuals involved with the ... shipment of cocaine knew [it] was headed to the United States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And third, Martinez \u201csupervised many key aspects of the international transportation of this massive shipment of cocaine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 968.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">In response, Defendants stress a lack of <em>direct </em>evidence of knowledge or intent, but that emphasis is unavailing. Our review of insufficiency claims treats all evidence\u2014 direct or circumstantial \u2014 the same. <em>See Dykes, </em>406 F.3d at 721. Moreover, this argument carries even less weight considering their insufficiency claim alleges a lack of direct <em>mens rea </em>evidence. In \u201cmost cases in which the defendant\u2019s state of mind is at issue, it may be near impossible to establish the requisite <em>mens rea </em>through direct evidence,\u201d and therefore proof must be inferred from circumstantial evidence instead. <em>United States v. Schaffer, </em>183 F.3d 833, 843 (D.C. Cir. 1999). As we have shown, the proffered circumstantial evidence is sufficient to support the jury\u2019s guilty verdicts, and accordingly, we reject Defendants\u2019 insufficiency claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">B. Jury Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">Martinez Vega and Cuevas also challenge the district court\u2019s jury instruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>tions. Specifically, they claim the instructions failed to adequately convey that Defendants \u201cpersonally intended the cocaine be imported into the United States or personally knew the cocaine would be imported into the United States.\u201d Defendants Br. 41. Defendants\u2019 argument focuses on the district court\u2019s use of a \u201cshorthand\u201d description of the <em>mens rea </em>requirement. In their view, the instructions were \u201chighly ambiguous\u201d and \u201cwiden[ed] the meaning of conspiracy\u201d by \u201cminimiz[ing] a defendant\u2019s necessary involvement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">When reviewing a challenge to jury instructions, \u201c[t]he pertinent question is whether, taken as a whole, the instructions accurately state the governing law and provide the jury with sufficient understanding of those issues and applicable standards.\u201d <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>605 F.3d 985, 1018 (D.C. Cir. 2010). While the propriety of a submitted jury instruction is reviewed <em>de novo, </em>\u201cthe choice of language to be used in a particular instruction ... is reviewed only for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Joy v. Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc., </em>999 F.2d 549, 556 (D.C. Cir. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">The district court\u2019s instructions began with a recitation of the charge, which included an accurate description of the \u201cknowing or intending\u201d <em>mens rea </em>requirement. Then, the court broke the Government\u2019s burden into two parts. First, the Government was required to demonstrate an \u201cagreement to import ... or to manufacture and distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine knowing and intending that it would be imported into the United States.\u201d Second, the Government was required to demonstrate that Martinez Vega and Cuevas \u201cintentionally joined in that agreement.\u201d Explaining further, the district court stated the Government must prove \u201ca defendant participated in the conspiracy with knowledge of its unlawful purposes, and with an intent to aid in the accomplishment of its unlawful objectives.\u201d Following this robust description of the Government\u2019s burden, the district court concluded with a concise and accurate summary of the <em>mens rea </em>requirement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AcU\">Thus with respect to count one, if you find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant conspired to import any amount of cocaine into the United States, or to manufacture any amount of cocaine with the intent or knowledge that it would later be imported to the United States, then you should find the defendant guilty. If, however, you find that the government has not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant conspired to import any amount of cocaine into the United States or to manufacture and distribute any amount of cocaine with the intent or knowledge that it would later be imported to the United States, then you should [find] the defendant not guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">On multiple occasions throughout the instructions, the district court accurately and clearly explained the <em>mens rea </em>requirement. And as we have stated, \u201c(j]ury instructions are proper if, when viewed as a whole, they fairly present the applicable legal principles and standards.\u201d <em>Czekalski v. LaHood, </em>589 F.3d 449, 453 (D.C. Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">Defendants\u2019 concern centers on the district court\u2019s shorthand description of the <em>mens rea </em>requirement, \u201cthat a defendant participated in the conspiracy with knowledge of its <em>unlawful purposes, </em>and with an intent to aid in the accomplishment of its <em>unlawful objectives.\u201d </em>This instruction, however, was immediately preceded by a description of what the conspiracy\u2019s unlawful purposes and unlawful objectives were \u2014 the importation, manufacture, and distribution of cocaine with knowledge or intent that it end up in the United States. That <em>mens rea </em>lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>guage is cumbersome, and the district court\u2019s decision to use a shorthand method of referring to it did not render the <em>mens rea </em>instruction ambiguous, especially considering that this shorthand language is bookended by two unmistakably clear and entirely accurate descriptions of the requirement. Jury instructions \u201cmust be evaluated not in isolation but in the context of the entire charge.\u201d <em>Jones v. United States, </em>527 U.S. 373, 391, 119 S.Ct. 2090, 144 L.Ed.2d 370 (1999). Taken as a whole, these instructions clearly informed the jurors of the precise nature of the <em>mens rea </em>question before them. Because the <em>mens rea </em>jury instructions unambiguously and accurately reflected the state of the law, we hold the district court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">C. Prosecutorial Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Defendants allege the prosecutor improperly (i) appealed to the jury to act as the \u201ccommunity conscience\u201d; (ii) expressed personal opinion regarding Defendants\u2019 guilt; and (iii) discussed the court\u2019s overruling of a defense objection during closing arguments. Each of these prosecu-torial misconduct claims fail. We address each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">First, Defendants contend the prosecutor\u2019s references to America\u2019s drug culture and related problems in its closing summation were unfairly \u201cdesigned to inflame the passions or prejudices\u201d of jurors. Defendants Br. 47 (quoting <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>231 F.3d 43, 47 (D.C. Cir. 2000)). Specifically, the prosecutor told the jury that \u201ca lot of the problems here in Washington D.C., in New York, in Detroit where I grew up, can be traced right back to [drug trafficking].\u201d In Defendants\u2019 view, the prosecutor perceived the jury \u201cmight be [uninterested in Colombia\u2019s drug problems,\u201d Defendants Br. 48, which led him to improperly tie the Colombian drug trade to the American drug problem, inviting the jury to act as the \u201ccommunity conscience.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">To be sure, a suggestion that the jury act as the \u201ccommunity conscience\u201d can constitute error. In <em>United States v. Hawkins, </em>our circuit warned it is improper to \u201csubstitute emotion for evidence by equating, directly or by innuendo, a verdict of guilty to a blow against the drug problem.\u201d 595 F.2d 751, 754 (D.C. Cir. 1978); <em>see also United States v. Solivan, </em>937 F.2d 1146, 1151 (6th Cir. 1991) (holding an appeal to the jury to act as the community conscience is improper when it is \u201ccalculated to incite the passions and prejudices of the jurors\u201d). This caution derives from <em>Viereck v. United States, </em>318 U.S. 236, 63 S.Ct. 561, 87 L.Ed. 734 (1943), in which the Supreme Court held a prosecutor\u2019s appeal to jurors\u2019 patriotism during World War II was \u201cwholly irrelevant to any facts or issues in the case, the purpose and effect of which could only have been to arouse passion and prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 247, 63 S.Ct. 561.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">But, critical to our disposition here, the <em>Hawkins </em>panel held that such erroneous appeals may not warrant reversal \u201cin light of the relative strength of the case against the accused.\u201d 595 F.2d at 754. Because \u201c[t]he Government\u2019s case against appellant was strong indeed,\u201d and the \u201cinstructions given by the trial court sufficiently diluted any prejudice,\u201d the panel held it was not \u201can occasion on which reversal would be appropriate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 755; <em>see also United States v. Barnett, </em>No. 97-3091, 1998 WL 203122, at *1 (D.C. Cir. April 8, 1998) (per curiam) (\u201c[A]ppealing to the jury to \u2018do the right thing\u2019 is not clearly erroneous when, as here, the Government couples its argument that the jury should \u2018do the right thing\u2019 with specific references to the evidence in the record.... Furthermore, the evidence presented at trial was sufficiently probative of Barnett\u2019s guilt that any error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>that might have occurred was not prejudicial\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">As it was in <em>Hawkins, </em>so it is here. Even if the prosecutor erred in connecting Martinez Vega\u2019s and Cuevas\u2019s charges to America\u2019s drug problems, the error was harmless because the case against the Defendants was \u201cstrong indeed.\u201d <em>Hawkins, </em>595 F.2d at 755. In light of that strong case, and also given the district court\u2019s instruction that \u201cthe statements and the arguments of the lawyers are not evidence,\u201d the prosecutor\u2019s appeal to the jury to act as the \u201ccommunity conscience\u201d does not warrant reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Second, Defendants contend the prosecutor improperly interjected personal beliefs into his closing statement. \u201cWhen a prosecutor gives his personal opinion on the credibility of witnesses or the defendant\u2019s guilt ... \u2018such comments can ... jeopardize the defendant\u2019s right to be tried solely on the basis of the evidence presented to the jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Hampton, </em>718 F.3d 978, 983 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (quoting <em>United States v. Young, </em>470 U.S. 1, 18, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985)). At various points throughout the prosecutor\u2019s summation, he spoke in the \u201cfirst person singular,\u201d making such statements as, \u201cI think the evidence did prove that ... \u201cI think it is clear ... \u201cBut if you consider the recordings, and I think you should, it becomes obvious ... \u201d; \u201cI don\u2019t know if I buy that ... \u201d; \u201cI\u2019m not sure I buy it. I don\u2019t think you should either ... and \u201cI\u2019m not even sure what to make of this argument.\u201d Defendants argue these statements violate the Supreme Court\u2019s injunction against prosecutors \u201cinterjecting personal beliefs.\u201d <em>See Young, </em>470 U.S. at 7-8, 105 S.Ct. 1038.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Two of our sister circuits have directly confronted the question whether speaking in the first person singular is a ground for a new trial. <em>See United States v. Nerse-sian, </em>824 F.2d 1294, 1328-29 (2d Cir. 1987); <em>United States v. Carleo, </em>576 F.2d 846, 851-52 (10th Cir. 1978). Reviewing similar statements as found here, the <em>Nersesian </em>court \u201cstressed] that it is a poor practice, one which this court has repeatedly admonished prosecutors to avoid.\u201d 824 F.2d at 1328. That said, and despite recognizing \u201c[i]t is well settled that it is improper for a prosecutor to interject personal beliefs into a summation,\u201d the court nonetheless declined to reverse. <em>Id. </em>Viewing the summation \u201cas a whole,\u201d the Second Circuit examined whether the improper language \u201camount[ed] to unacceptable vouching.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Several considerations prompted the court to conclude it did not. For one, the \u201coffending conduct was ... limited to a relatively small portion of an overall lengthy summation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the district court \u201cinstructed] the jury that the lawyer\u2019s statements were not evidence,\u201d and defense counsel made no \u201ccontemporaneous objections.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Also, the court concluded \u201cit can fairly be said that appellants\u2019 convictions were the result of the jury\u2019s assessment of the evidence, not the result of improper argument by the prosecutor.\u201d <em>Id.; see also United States v. Restrepo, </em>547 Fed.Appx. 34, 42 (2d Cir. 2013) (warning prosecutors to avoid first-person formulations but ultimately concluding \u201cthere [was] no likelihood that the jury was misled about the argument the prosecutor was making\u201d); <em>but see United States v. Eltayib, </em>88 F.3d 157, 173 (2d Cir. 1996) (concluding \u201cnot all uses of the pronoun T are improper\u201d such as \u201cI suggest that,\u201d which \u201cshie[s] away from an outright endorsement\u201d). In <em>Carleo, </em>the Tenth Circuit charted a similar path. 576 F.2d at 851-52. Deeming improper the prosecutor\u2019s first person formulation, the court nonetheless determined the prosecutor \u201cwas neither personally vouching for the credibility of the government witness nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>personally attacking the credibility of the defendant,\u201d nor was he \u201cattempting to convey to the jury that he somehow possessed information ... to which the jury was not privy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 852. In light of these conclusions, the court held the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying a motion for a new trial. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">We join our sister circuits in admonishing prosecutors to avoid the \u201cuse of the personal pronoun \u2018I.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nersesian, </em>824 F.2d at 1328. It is poor practice and threatens the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. But as in <em>Nersesian, Restrepo, </em>and <em>Carleo, </em>the prosecutor\u2019s remarks here do not constitute reversible error. As noted above, the district court instructed the jury that the \u201cstatements and the arguments of the lawyers are not evidence,\u201d and the few offending statements were contained within a very lengthy closing summation of the Government\u2019s strong case. While the prosecutor should have avoided the personal pronoun, had he replaced \u201cI\u201d with slightly different phrases like \u201cthe evidence shows\u201d or \u201cthe record is clear that,\u201d he could have communicated a nearly identical sentiment without any impropriety.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Cf. United States v. Eltayib, </em>88 F.3d 157, 172 (2d Cir. 1996) (\u201cThe 'problem with a prosecutor\u2019s use of the pronoun T is that it \u2018tends to make an issue of [the prosecutor\u2019s] own credibility, or to imply the existence of extraneous proof.\u2019 \u201d). Moreover, Defendants\u2019 counsel also failed to object to these statements at trial, so our appellate touch is even lighter here than it otherwise might have been. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Accordingly, we conclude the jury\u2019s guilty verdict was a product of the Government\u2019s strong case against Martinez Vega and Cuevas, not the prosecutors stray improper remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">Third, Defendants argue that a PowerPoint slide containing a reference to an overruled defense objection constituted prosecutorial misconduct. Even assuming the reference was error, Defendants fail to present any theory whatsoever as to why it prejudiced them. Even their reply brief contains no explanation, despite the Government\u2019s argument pointing out this critical defect. Reply Br. at 24. (The entire response: \u201cThe Government offers no theory to support presentation of a PowerPoint slide depicting the overruling of a defense objection to the jury. Defendants submit that none exists, especially in light of the district court\u2019s midtrial instruction.\u201d). Without a showing of \u201csubstantial prejudice,\u201d an act of prosecutorial misconduct cannot constitute reversible error. <em>See United States v. Small, </em>74 F.3d 1276, 1280 (D.C. Cir. 1996). Defendants\u2019 failure to show any prejudice, let alone substantial prejudice, is fatal to their prosecutorial misconduct claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">II. Issues Raised by Martinez Vega</p>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">Martinez Vega individually challenges several of the district court\u2019s rulings pertaining to evidence identifying his involvement in criminal activities. According to Martinez Vega, such evidence was crucial to his eventual conviction because the Government\u2019s case against him relied primarily on accepting both that a person nicknamed \u201cChiguiro\u201d was a significant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>member of the FARC\u2019s 16th Front operation, and that Martinez Vega was that individual.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Specifically, Martinez Vega argues that the district court committed reversible error in failing (i) to compel the Government to correct the false testimony of DEA Intelligence Research Specialist Francisco Garrido; (ii) to give \u201cmissing-evidence\u201d instructions to the jury regarding photo arrays that had been used with certain witnesses; (iii) to sanction the Government for its failure to timely disclose a photograph identifying another man as \u201cChiguiro\u201d; and (iv) to admit a prior inconsistent statement by government witness Ignacio Gonzales Jaramillo. Martinez Vega also appeals the district court\u2019s application of a \u201cmanagerial role\u201d sentencing enhancement. We reject all of the evidentiary claims, but vacate and remand Martinez Vega\u2019s sentence to the district court for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">A. Failure to Correct False Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Former FARC member and prosecution witness Viviana Ortiz testified on cross-examination that, during an interview at the U.S. Embassy in Bogot\u00e1, she was shown some photographs, one of which she identified as Martinez Vega by the nickname \u201cChiguiro.\u201d Defense counsel objected that the prosecution had not previously disclosed Ortiz\u2019s photographic identification of Martinez Vega. The prosecutor disclaimed any prior knowledge of the identification, and the district court instructed the Government to \u201ccheck with your records and your agents to see if ... somebody showed her a photo, if you have a record of it.\u201d S.A. 189-90. The following morning, the prosecutor reported to the court his \u201csuspicion\u201d that Ortiz had been shown photographs by an agent of the Drug Enforcement Agency, but the Government \u201c[didn\u2019t] have a record of that.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">During the defense case, Martinez Vega called Francisco Garrido, a DEA Intelligence Research Specialist, and questioned him about his interviews in Bogot\u00e1 of former FARC members, including Ortiz. On re-direct, defense counsel confirmed with Garrido that Ortiz had identified Martinez Vega as \u201cChiguiro.\u201d When asked, \u201cBut you did not actually show her photographs of Chiguiro, did you?\u201d Garrido responded, \u201cI believe I did. I had a copy of the photo array depicting your client.\u201d S.A. 539.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">Martinez Vega\u2019s counsel objected that Garrido\u2019s testimony was inconsistent with the Government\u2019s prior representation that \u201cthey did not have anybody who could confirm or deny whether Ms. Ort[i]z was shown some identifications [sic].\u201d S.A. 539-40. The Government denied any inconsistency, differentiating between a lack of <em>records </em>about the identification and Garri-do\u2019s own <em>recollection </em>of the events. The court stated that Martinez Vega could ask additional questions if he wished to probe Garrido\u2019s memory.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-11\">During continued questioning by defense counsel, Garrido confirmed that he had shown Ortiz a photo array and claimed that the photographs \u201cbecame part of the case folder.\u201d S.A. 544-46. At sidebar, defense counsel asked for the photographs shown to Ortiz. The Government responded that Garrido appeared to be testifying to \u201chis belief,\u201d but that \u201cthere was only one photo array that was ever created\u201d including Martinez Vega\u2019s picture, and Garrido likely \u201cdoes not have any photo array that is marked by Vivian[a] Ort[i]z, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>or that he recorded as being a specific one that she identified.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 548.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">In a subsequent hearing outside the presence of the jury, the district court allowed both sides to continue questioning Garrido about the issue. Garrido confirmed that he created only one photo array relating to Martinez Vega, but denied any knowledge as to whether anyone had Ortiz \u201cmark a photo array.\u201d S.A. 552. He testified that he did not record or make any notes of Ortiz specifically marking or identifying any photograph in the array. Garri-do also admitted that he had \u201cno independent recollection\u201d of whether or not Ortiz was actually shown a photo array; his belief was based on the fact that he had shown the photo array to \u201cnumerous people\u201d during the investigation. <em>Id. </em>at 553.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">The next day, Martinez Vega moved to dismiss the case due to the Government\u2019s failure to correct Garrido\u2019s testimony before the jury. The court denied the motion from the bench, finding that the Government was not \u201cdeliberately withholding information that\u2019s false or allowing false testimony to go forward uncorrected.\u201d J.A. 1675. Martinez Vega raised the issue again in his motion for a new trial. The court once more denied the request, reasoning that, even if Garrido had testified falsely about having shown Ortiz a photo array, such testimony was immaterial and could not have affected the jury\u2019s judgment because there was sufficient other evidence at trial regarding Martinez Vega\u2019s identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">A claim that the Government violated the Fifth Amendment by knowingly failing to correct false testimony is reviewed <em>de novo. See United States v. Mejia, </em>597 F.3d 1329, 1338 (D.C. Cir. 2010). The district court\u2019s denials of motions for a mistrial and for a new trial are reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>651 F.3d 30, 50 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (mistrial); <em>United States v. Becton, </em>601 F.3d 588, 594 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (new trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-11\">Under <em>Napue v. Illinois, </em>360 U.S. 264, 79 S.Ct. 1173, 3 L.Ed.2d 1217 (1959), the Government \u201cmay not knowingly use false evidence\u201d or \u201callow[ ] it to go uncorrected when it appears,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 269, 79 S.Ct. 1173. \u201cThis rule applies both when the testimony relates directly to an essential element of the government\u2019s proof and when it affects the credibility of a crucial witness.\u201d <em>United States v. Iverson, </em>637 F.2d 799, 801 (D.C. Cir. 1980), <em>modified, </em>648 F.2d 737 (D.C. Cir. 1981). \u201cThe principle that a State may not knowingly use false evidence, including false testimony, to obtain a tainted conviction ... does not cease to apply merely because the false testimony goes only to the credibility of the witness.\u201d <em>Napue, </em>360 U.S. at 269, 79 S.Ct. 1173.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-12\">Yet even if the prosecution either sponsored or failed to correct false testimony, the grant of a new trial is not automatic. <em>See United States v. Burch, </em>156 F.3d 1315, 1329 (D.C. Cir. 1998); <em>Giglio v. United States, </em>405 U.S. 150, 154, 92 S.Ct. 763, 31 L.Ed\u00fcd 104 (1972). Rather, \u201ca reviewing court must determine whether \u2018the false testimony could in any reasonable likelihood have affected the judgment of the jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Burch, </em>156 F.3d at 1329 (quoting <em>Giglio, </em>405 U.S. at 154, 92 S.Ct. 763). Put another way, \u201cthe fact that testimony is perjured is considered material unless failure to disclose it would be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 680, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>As a preliminary matter, the Government\u2019s effort to portray Garrido\u2019s testimony as merely an \u201cequivocal\u201d expression of his \u201cbelief\u2019 that he had shown Ortiz photographs of \u201cChiguiro\u201d (Gov\u2019t Br. 48 \u2014 49) strains credulity and is heavily dependent on selectively parsing and rearranging Garrido\u2019s actual words. While Garrido did initially say he \u201cbelieve[d]\u201d he had shown \u201cphotographs of Chiguiro\u201d to Ortiz, S.A. 539, he then proceeded to describe a specific photo array, whether it included certain individuals, and what he did with the array afterwards. Similarly, when read in context, Garrido\u2019s affirmative response to the question whether he had shown Ortiz \u201cany photographs\u201d was not an answer to a \u201cbroad and general question\u201d about any random assortment of pictures as the Government suggests. Gov\u2019t Br. 49. Since Gar-rido had just testified about a photo array depicting Martinez Vega and Ortiz\u2019s identification of Martinez Vega as \u201cChiguiro,\u201d both defense counsel\u2019s question (\u201cNow let me then ask you about the identification <em>you told us about.... </em>When you met Ms. Ort[i]z on November 19, 2008, did you show her any photographs?\u201d S.A. 544^15) (emphasis added), and Garrido\u2019s answer (\u201cYes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 545), by their plain terms referred to the specific photographs in the aforementioned photo array.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">Disappointingly, the Government knew or should have known that this testimony was suspect. The Government had previously disclaimed any prior knowledge of a photo-array identification by Ortiz and reported to the court that it had no record of anyone showing Ortiz photographs. The Government thus should have been on full alert as soon as Garrido started testifying to a different story. The hearing conducted by the district court, outside of the jury\u2019s presence, spotlighted Garrido\u2019s inaccuracies.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Hair-splitting distinctions in degree of falsity and inaccuracy should not be the currency of federal prosecutors. <em>See Na-pue, </em>360 U.S. at 269, 79 S.Ct. 1173 (\u201c[Although not soliciting false evidence,\u201d the government is bound to correct it \u201cwhen it appears.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">The only thing that saves the Government is that Garrido\u2019s testimony could not \u201cin any reasonable likelihood have affected the judgment of the jury.\u201d <em>Napue, </em>360 U.S. at 271, 79 S.Ct. 1173. Martinez Vega argues that permitting Garrido\u2019s testimony to remain uncorrected not only bolstered the substantive testimony of Ortiz, but also reinforced the overall credibility of both witnesses. That is, a revelation that Garri-do\u2019s testimony was false might have cast <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>doubt on the general reliability of both Ortiz and Garrido, particularly given other inconsistencies in their testimonies. And that in turn might have colored the jury\u2019s acceptance or rejection of Garrido\u2019s and Ortiz\u2019s testimony on other matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">That line of reasoning does not hold up given the record in this case. First, Ortiz\u2019s identification of Martinez Vega during the alleged photo array presentation was of dubious relevance, given that Ortiz had repeatedly identified Martinez Vega and connected him to the nickname \u201cChiguiro\u201d earlier in the trial. Indeed, she identified him by that moniker at the very start of her testimony, and again while being shown video footage of guerillas crossing a river \u201cwith Chiguiro.\u201d Importantly, Ortiz based those in-court identifications on her frequent, personal, and direct observations of Martinez Vega working with the FARC. She recounted, for example, providing security for Martinez Vega while he and his men transported weapons and cocaine base. She also testified to seeing him speak with various FARC commanders and move drugs and weapons to and from camp. At one point, Ortiz recalled how she and other FARC members even ate lunch at Martinez Vega\u2019s house. Given all that, the reference to a photo array was just gilding the lily.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Second, even if the jury had completely disregarded Garrido and Ortiz as unreliable witnesses, multiple other witnesses provided similar testimony. For example, like Ortiz, Mauricio Parra Diaz repeatedly identified Martinez Vega as \u201cChiguiro\u201d and testified that he saw him transporting cocaine and weapons for the FARC. Parra Diaz also confirmed, as did Ortiz, that Martinez Vega carried a pistol \u2014 something only guerillas and drug traffickers were permitted to do in the 16th Front \u2014 and testified that he was present when Front Leader Negro Acacio announced the news of Martinez Vega\u2019s arrest. Likewise, Eugenio Vargas Perdomo identified Martinez Vega as \u201cChiguiro,\u201d and testified that they lived and worked together, trafficking cocaine and buying uniforms, weapons, and ammunition for the 16th Front. And Luis Restrepo testified that Martinez Vega was \u201cChiguiro,\u201d and that he witnessed Martinez Vega repeatedly exchange weapons for cocaine with Negro Acacio.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">Garrido\u2019s testimony, too, generally reiterated other evidence at trial. Garrido explained that Martinez Vega, during his extradition flight to the U.S., stated that his nickname was \u201cChiguiro\u201d and described having moved several tons of cocaine, weapons, and supplies for the FARC. But Carlos Gonzales Jaramillo, a colonel in the Colombian army, also testified that Martinez Vega made similar confessions to him, including that he was \u201cChiguiro\u201d and that he transported several tons of cocaine, as well as uniforms and weapons, for the FARC.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">Accordingly, looking at the evidence in the record as a whole, there is no \u201creasonable likelihood\u201d that the photo-array segment of Garrido\u2019s testimony, even if false, could have altered the outcome of the case. <em>Cf. Giglio, </em>405 U.S. at 154-55, 92 S.Ct. 763 (reversing where \u201cthe Goverriment\u2019s case depended almost entirely on [the perjuring witness\u2019s] testimony; without it there could have been no indictment and no evidence to carry the case to the jury\u201d). Because the false testimony was not material, the district court\u2019s refusal to grant a mistrial or a new trial was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">B. Missing-Evidence Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b557-11\">Another government witness, Mauricio Parra Diaz, testified to being shown photographs at the U.S. Embassy in Colombia by the DEA and selecting Martinez Vega as \u201cChiguiro.\u201d Outside the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>presence of the jury, DEA Special Agents Cesar Medina and Daniel Dyer testified that a photo array had been shown to numerous potential witnesses in Colombia. However, the agents had no specific recollection of the people who were shown the array, and the Government kept no record of that information or of any identifications the witnesses made. In fact, Medina confirmed that \u201cthe understanding\u201d within his office was that he \u201cwould keep no record of this,\u201d but simply call Dyer in the event of an identification, J.A. 1000, and Dyer, for his part, acknowledged that he did not make records of such calls. Medina also testified that the photo array he used was kept in a folder in the DEA\u2019s Bogot\u00e1 Country Office, but that he believed it had since been shredded because the office \u201cshred[s] the photo arrays, because it is not needed any more for that particular interview [sic].\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">In light of that testimony, Martinez Vega requested the following jury instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-5\">Both Ms. Ortiz and Mr. Parra Diaz have testified that they were shown photographs of individuals at the United States Embassy in Bogota and that they identified a photograph of Martinez Vega as that of the person they have each identified as \u201cChiguiro.\u201d The United States has no records or other information that would corroborate this testimony. If photographs were shown to the witnesses for purposes of identification, the Government would be obligated to preserve such photographs, ^s well as any record of what the witnesses may have said at the time \u00f3f their identifications. The United States has no such photographs or records.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">J.A. 1054.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">A third witness, Luis Restrepo, testified that he was shown photographs that \u201cincluded ... Mr. Chiguiro,\u201d whom he identified in court as Martinez Vega. J.A. 1191. Garrido testified that he showed Restrepo a photo array depicting Martinez Vega and that he \u201cthought [the photos] were filed in the case folder.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1362. Again, no such photographs were produced by the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">Martinez Vega requested another instruction regarding Restrepo\u2019s identification:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-10\">If photographs shown to Mr. Restrepo in this case were only within the power of the government to produce, and were not produced by the government, and their absence has not been sufficiently explained, then you may, if you deem it appropriate, infer that the photographs would have been unfavorable to the government.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-11\">J.A. 1054-55. The district court declined to give either instruction, citing no evidence of bad faith on the part of the Government regarding the loss or destruction of the photographs and the fact that \u201cthese were not really identification procedures\u201d in which the \u201conly way [the witnesses] could ever identify\u201d Martinez Vega was through the photo array. <em>Id. </em>at 1698-1700.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-12\">The district court\u2019s decision withholding a missing-evidence instruction is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. West, </em>393 F.3d 1302, 1309 (D.C. Cir. 2005), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Burgess v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 124,128 S.Ct. 1572, 170 L.Ed.2d 478 (2008); <em>see also United States v. Tarantino, </em>846 F.2d 1384, 1404 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (describing standard of review for denial of analogous missing-witness instruction). A missing-evidence instruction \u201cis appropriate if it is peculiarly within the power of one party to produce the evidence and the evidence would elucidate a disputed transaction.\u201d <em>West, </em>393 F.3d at 1309; <em>see also United States v. Williams, </em>113 F.3d 243, 245 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (foundation for analogous miss<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>ing-witness instruction). \u201cWhen these two requirements are met, jurors may be instructed that the controlling party\u2019s failure to produce the evidence permits them to draw the inference that the evidence would have been unfavorable to that party.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16, the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500, and <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), all impose duties on the Government to disclose certain materials and evidence to criminal defendants. In <em>United States v. Bryant, </em>439 F.2d 642 (D.C. Cir. 1971), this court held that those duties to disclose included a correlative duty to preserve that evidence in the first place, since \u201c[o]nly if evidence is carefully preserved during the early stages of investigation will disclosure be possible later,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 651. Accordingly, <em>Bryant </em>instructed that the Government must \u201cpromulgate! ], enforcef ] and attempts in good faith to follow rigorous and systematic procedures designed to preserve all discoverable evidence gathered in the course of a criminal investigation,\u201d or else risk the imposition of sanctions \u201cfor non-disclosure based on loss of evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 652.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Martinez Vega argues that, under <em>Bryant, </em>the Government was obligated to retain the photographs used in the witness identifications, as well as verbatim records of any statements the witnesses may have made at the time. The problem for Martinez Vega is that the Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent decision in <em>Arizona v. Youngblood, </em>488 U.S. 51, 109 S.Ct. 333, 102 L.Ed.2d 281 (1988), narrowed the Government\u2019s constitutional obligations regarding the preservation of evidence. Specifically, the Court held that \u201cthe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, as interpreted in <em>Brady, </em>makes the good or bad faith of the State irrelevant when the State fails to disclose to the defendant material exculpatory evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 57, 109 S.Ct. 333. But if \u201cno more can be said\u201d about the evidence \u201cthan that it could have been subjected to tests, the results of which might have exonerated the defendant,\u201d there is no denial of due process unless a criminal defendant can demonstrate the Government\u2019s bad faith. <em>Id. </em>at 57-58, 109 S.Ct. 333. <em>Youngblood </em>thus confines the Due Process Clause to superintending only those cases in which the missing evidence is material and exculpatory or in which \u201cthe police themselves by their conduct indicate that the evidence could form a basis for exonerating the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 58,109 S.Ct. 333.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">Following <em>Youngblood, </em>this court has held that <em>Bryant, </em>at least with respect to due process claims based on missing evidence the exculpatory value of which is unclear, is \u201cno longer good law.\u201d <em>In re Sealed Case, </em>99 F.3d 1175, 1178 (D.C. Cir. 1996); <em>see also United States v. McKie, </em>951 F.2d 399, 403 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (rejecting reliance on <em>Bryant </em>because \u201cdue process claims ... are now governed by the standards enunciated in <em>Arizona v. Young-blood\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">Martinez Vega nonetheless argues that <em>Bryant </em>provides the relevant standard because his objection is grounded not in the general protections of the Due Process Clause, but in the Government\u2019s specific obligations under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16, the Jencks Act, and <em>Brady.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>Alternatively, Martinez Vega contends that, even under <em>Youngblood, </em>missing-evidence instructions were warranted because the Government\u2019s bad faith can be inferred. Specifically, despite every incentive to maintain careful records of the identifications for subsequent use at trial, the DEA agents kept no such documentation. Martinez Vega emphasizes that the exculpatory value of the untested physical evidence in <em>Youngblood </em>was unknown to the agents. <em>See </em>488 U.S. at 56 n. *, 109 S.Ct. 333 (noting that the defendant \u201chas not shown that the police knew the [missing evidence] would have exculpated him when they failed to\u201d preserve it). Here, by contrast, the agents necessarily knew the results of their photo-array presentations and thus had actual knowledge' whether such documents were actually (and not just potentially) exculpatory. The conspicuous absence of evidence with clearly \u201cknowable\u201d exculpatory value, Martinez Vega concludes, points strongly to bad faith, especially given that the same DEA agents apparently preserved marked photo arrays used in identification procedures conducted with other individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">The Government\u2019s failure to retain records for witness identifications \u2014 records for which the inculpatory or exculpatory value seems obvious \u2014 is troubling. But even assuming <em>Youngblood </em>applies, the erroneous denial of a missing-evidence instruction will not require reversal if the error is harmless. <em>See United States v. Glenn, </em>64 F.3d 706, 710 (D.C. Cir. 1995). And in that regard, Martinez Vega fails to identify how that mistake affected his defense or had a substantial and injurious effect on his trial. <em>Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 765, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946). Indeed, Martinez Vega\u2019s identity as \u201cChiguiro\u201d was established by the testimony of multiple witnesses based on in-person observations and interactions, wholly independent of the missing photo arrays. <em>See, e.g., supra </em>pp. 531-32. Accordingly, any error by the district court in declining to issue missing-evidence instructions was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">C. The \u201cChiguiro\u201d Photograph</p>\n<p id=\"Aor\">Six weeks before trial, the Government turned over a document obtained from Colombian Military Intelligence. The document is a printout of a PowerPoint-type slide containing photographs of four men. Three of the men are labeled FARC commanders in the 16th Front. The fourth photograph shows a person (not Martinez Vega) in full military uniform and is labeled \u201cAngel Leopoldo Lopez, aka Chiguiro.\u201d J.A. 1786.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">At trial, the Government called Major Guillermo Rios, Colombian Military Intelligence\u2019s \u201cchief of analysis\u201d for the 16th Front, who testified that the only names associated with \u201cChiguiro\u201d that the Colombian military had in \u201cthe files [he] looked [at]\u201d and \u201cin the files that [he] received\u201d were \u201cJuan Jose Martinez Vega\u201d and \u201cGentil Alvis Pati\u00f1o.\u201d J.A. 1149.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">On cross-examination, the defense showed the printout with the \u201cChiguiro\u201d photo to Rios, but he denied ever having seen it before. Martinez Vega then filed a motion seeking all exculpatory evidence pertaining to the printout. A few days later, the Government advised Martinez Vega by letter that the slide from which the printout came had been found in an electronic storage file of the DEA Bogot\u00e1 Country Office, but that none of the cur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>rent agents of that office could identify its origin. However, agents who had previously worked in the office stated that the slide was given to them by Colombian intelligence around 2001 in the context of large transmissions of information on FARC members. The letter further explained that the Government\u2019s contacts with the Colombian military and intelligence were also unaware of the origin of the \u201cChiguiro\u201d photograph, the slide, or the information on the slide.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Martinez Vega argued that it was misleading for the Government to ask Rios about his \u201cfiles\u201d and elicit that no other person had been identified as \u201cChiguiro\u201d when the Government \u201cknew that, at some point in time, an agency of Colombian Military Intelligence which reported to the office occupied by Rios, had reached the opposite conclusion.\u201d J.A. 1381. Martinez Vega therefore proposed that the following stipulation be provided to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-6\">The parties stipulate that Defendant Martinez [sic] Exhibit 3 is a document which was found in an electronic storage file of the Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s Bogota Country Office. It is believed that it was transmitted, as part of a larger transmission of information, by Colombian Military Intelligence in or around 2001. The DEA has no further information about the origin of the document, the photographs contained on it, or accuracy of the captions to the photographs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-7\"><em>Id. </em>The Government refused to so stipulate. The court also declined to admit the printout from the slide into evidence since it had not been identified by any witness and had not been verified or authenticated in any way. <em>Id. </em>at 1688-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">In his motion for a new trial, Martinez Vega argued that the Government\u2019s delayed disclosure of the printout \u201cat a time and under circumstances when Defendant could not ascertain the factual basis for the document\u201d violated <em>Brady. </em>J.A. 1780. He also argued that the Government compounded the breach by questioning Major Rios in a misleading way, and that the district court failed to remedy those infractions. The court denied the motion, finding that the printout and the sought-after information were not material.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a new trial for abuse of' discretion, but evaluate <em>de novo </em>the court\u2019s assessment of whether the Government breached its obligations under <em>Brady. See United States v. Orache, </em>484 F.3d 590, 595 (D.C. Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-11\">The district court did not err in denying a new trial because there is no reasonable prospect that earlier disclosure of the printout or any additional information about it would have affected the trial\u2019s outcome. <em>Brady </em>requires the Government to disclose, upon request, \u201cevidence favorable to an accused ... where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment.\u201d 373 U.S. at 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194. The \u201ctouchstone of materiality\u201d is \u201c \u2018a reasonable probability\u2019 of a different result.\u201d <em>Kyles v. Whitley, </em>514 U.S. 419, 434, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995) (quoting <em>Bagley, </em>473 U.S. at 678, 105 S.Ct. 3375). The bottom-line question \u201cis not whether the defendant would more likely than not have received a different verdict with the evidence, but whether in its absence he received a fair trial, understood as a trial resulting in a verdict worthy of confidence.\u201d <em>Kyles, </em>514 U.S. at 434, 115 S.Ct. 1555. \u201cA \u2018reasonable probability\u2019 of a different result\u201d turns on whether the Government\u2019s suppression of evidence \u201c \u2018undermines confidence in the outcome of the trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Bagley, </em>473 U.S. at 678, 105 S.Ct. 3375).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>In this case, for evidence that there was another \u201cChiguiro\u201d affiliated with the FARC to have made any difference, the Government\u2019s case would have to be heavily reliant on Martinez Vega\u2019s use of the nickname. But the record evidence bucks that notion. Multiple witnesses who knew Martinez Vega \u2014 either as \u201cChiguiro\u201d or not \u2014 identified him repeatedly in person and testified to seeing him transporting weapons or cocaine and interacting with leaders of the 16th Front. The district court found that those witnesses \u201cdid not 'have fleeting glimpses of the defendant.\u201d J.A. 2145. Rather, \u201cthey worked with him, ate meals with him, and even lived with him,\u201d leaving \u201clittle room for doubt about the reliability of their identifications of him as the person they observed engaging in conspiratorial acts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Those witnesses personally knew Martinez Vega and observed him in the relevant circumstances. For those witnesses, the name that Martinez Vega went by was largely beside the point. Thus, any revelation that another individual affiliated with the FARC was also referred to as \u201cChiguiro\u201d would not plausibly have had any effect on the outcome of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">D. Prior Inconsistent Statement</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Colonel Ignacio Gonzales Jaramil-lo of the Colombian military testified that he interviewed Martinez Vega in a Venezuelan prison. According to Gonzales Jar-amillo, Martinez Vega denied being involved in the FARC during the initial portion of the interview, which was videotaped. But after the video camera was turned off, Martinez Vega allegedly began admitting his involvement with the organization. Gonzales Jaramillo testified that the camera was off for \u201c20, 25 minutes, maybe half an hour\u201d during the interview. J.A. 1116.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">Following the interview, the Colonel documented the details of the interview. In pertinent part, his report states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-7\">Upon asking [Martinez Vega] about his. ties to kidnapping and drug trafficking, he denied all involvement at any time....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-8\">The interview continued on the same line for almost 2 hours, denying his relationship with the terrorist organization and denying his ties to kidnapping and drug trafficking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-9\">As the conversation progressed, facts from his past life were brought up, thanks to information obtained by intelligence work and, in other cases, supplied by the informant who accompanied the delegation. The presentation of facts made the subject begin to contradict himself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">J.A. 1479.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-11\">During cross-examination, defense counsel confronted Gonzales Jaramillo with the apparent contradiction between his testimony that Martinez Vega was cooperative during the 20 or 30 minutes that the camera was off, and the report\u2019s statement that Martinez Vega denied any connection to the FARC for nearly two hours. The Colonel explained that the two-hour period referred to the entire time he was with Martinez Vega \u201cfrom the first moment I saw him until we started talking because until the cameras were off, we didn\u2019t start a conversation.\u201d J.A. 1119; <em>see also id. </em>at 1120 (\u201cYes, from the first time we saw each other until about \u2014 until we sat down. Less than two hours, but yes, that\u2019s how it was.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-12\">Martinez Vega moved to admit into evidence a copy of Gonzales Jaramillo\u2019s interview report as a prior inconsistent statement. He contends that, because the videotaped portion of the interview did not get into the subject of the FARC, drugs, or kidnapping, the two-hour discussion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>those topics necessarily did not begin until after the camera was turned off.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">The district court denied the motion, finding that it was \u201cnot clear\u201d that the interview report amounted to a prior inconsistent statement since it was ambiguous whether \u201cthe two hours\u201d in the report referred to the length of the entire interview, or only the time during which the camera was turned off. J.A. 1682. The court also noted that \u201cthe jury has heard at length ... what allegedly the report said\u201d during cross-examination of Gonzales Jaramillo, <em>id. </em>and expressed concern that the report elsewhere contained \u201cexculpatory statements of the defendant not subject to cross-examination,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1683.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">The district court\u2019s admission or exclusion of evidence is reviewed for abuse for discretion. <em>See United States v. Morgan, </em>581 F.2d 933, 936 (D.C. Cir. 1978). Federal Rule of Evidence 613(b) permits the use of a witness\u2019s prior inconsistent statement for impeachment \u201cif the witness is given an opportunity to explain or deny the statement and an adverse party is given an opportunity to examine the witness about it.\u201d While \u201cdirect contradiction is not essential,\u201d the trial court \u201chas discretion in determining whether testimony is inconsistent with a prior statement.\u201d 28 Wright &amp; Gold, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure, \u00a7 6203 (2d ed. 2012); <em>see Grunewald v. United States, </em>353 U.S. 391, 423, 77 S.Ct. 963, 1 L.Ed.2d 931 (1957) (\u201c[T]he question whether a prior statement is sufficiently inconsistent to be allowed to go to the jury on the question of credibility is usually within the discretion of the trial judge.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that there was no material inconsistency between Gonzales Jaramillo\u2019s report and his testimony. Gonzales Jaramillo clarified on cross-examination that, although he did not explicitly inquire about the FARC, drugs, and kidnapping during the videotaped portion of the interview, he did ask Martinez Vega why he had been arrested in Venezuela. J.A. 1489-90 (\u201cWhy do they have you here?\u201d; \u201cWhere did they nab you?\u201d; \u201cAlright, but why? In other words, the Venezuelan authorities arrived and what were you doing at the time?\u201d). In response, Martinez Vega denied knowledge as to why the police had picked him up. <em>Id. </em>(\u201cI don\u2019t know. They nabbed me at the farm where I was working and brought me here.\u201d; \u201cI was fixing something of a pool and some kiosks.\u201d). Martinez Vega\u2019s responses to additional questions about his presence and activities in Venezuela were likewise vague and noncommittal. <em>Id. </em>at 1492 (Q: \u201cHow long have you been in Venezuelan territory?\u201d A: \u201cSince last year.\u201d Q: \u201cCan you please be more precise ... ?\u201d A: \u201cI don\u2019t remember exactly.\u201d ... Q: \u201cBeginning of the month ... beginning of the year.\u201d A: \u201cWhen a man brought me here to get papers and help him work.\u201d Q: \u201cWhat man\u201d?); <em>id. </em>at 1494 (Q: \u201cDid you go to Caracas?\u201d A: \u201cIn a car.\u201d Q: \u201cIn a car? With whom?\u201d A: \u201cWith that man.\u201d Q: \u201cWhat\u2019s the man\u2019s name?\u201d A: \u201cAlberto.\u201d Q: \u201cWhat does Alberto look like? ... Alberto what?\u201d A: \u201cI don\u2019t know his last name.\u201d). Martinez Vega was also cagey about a wound in his neck, stating at first that it was from an operation, then explaining that he had been shot, but by whom he did not know.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">Those kinds of unresponsive exchanges are reasonably consistent with testimony that Martinez Vega \u201cdid not accept \u2014 he didn\u2019t volunteer his information as to his FARC membership,\u201d J.A. 1119, and that \u201che did deny his participation ... [h]e kept saying that he had nothing to do, he owed nothing,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1120. They are also not inconsistent with the general statement in the report that Martinez Vega denied his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>relationship to the FARC or any involvement in kidnapping and drugs for two hours, particularly since he had been arrested in Venezuela for those very things.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the report was not a prior inconsistent statement and declining to admit it under Rule 613(b). Moreover, even if the exclusion of the report were error, it was harmless given that any perceived contradiction between the contents of the report and the Gonzalez Jaramillo\u2019s testimony was fully aired for the jury during cross-examination. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>181 F.3d 147, 149 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (evidentiary exclusion harmless because, \u201cduring the cross-examination of [the witness] the jury heard word-for-word what he said at the suppression hearing\u201d and therefore the court\u2019s refusal to admit the transcript \u201cin no way prejudiced [defendant] or impaired his defense\u201d); <em>United States v. Bogle, </em>114 F.3d 1271, 1275 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (court\u2019s refusal to exclude prior written statement of witness was \u201cclearly harmless\u201d where defense was able to impeach the witness about the statement on cross-examination).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">E. Sentencing Enhancement</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">At sentencing, the district court increased Martinez Vega\u2019s base offense level by three for being a \u201cmanager or supervisor\u201d in the narcotics conspiracy. Martin'ez Vega challenges the enhancement for lack of evidence that he supervised other participants in the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">In reviewing a sentencing decision, \u201c[p]urely legal questions are reviewed <em>de novo-, </em>factual findings are to be affirmed unless clearly erroneous; and we are to give due deference to the district court\u2019s application of the [sentencing] guidelines to facts.\u201d <em>United States v. Day, </em>524 F.3d 1361, 1367 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Government must demonstrate that a sentencing enhancement is warranted by a fair preponderance of the evidence, <em>United States v. Bapack, </em>129 F.3d 1320, 1324 <em>(D.C. </em>Cir. 1997), though that evidence may be circumstantial, <em>United States v. Graham, </em>162 F.3d 1180, 1183 (D.C. Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">Section 3B1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines permits the district court to increase a defendant\u2019s base offense level due to his \u201caggravating role\u201d in an offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1. \u201cThe magnitude of the enhancement varies with the culpability of the defendant,\u201d <em>Graham, </em>162 F.3d at 1182-83, as well as the scope of the criminal activity. As relevant here, a defendant is subject to a three-level increase for being \u201ca manager or supervisor (but not an organizer or leader)\u201d of a criminal activity that \u201cinvolved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b); <em>see Graham, </em>162 F.3d at 1183.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-10\">The commentary to Section 3B1.1 instructs the sentencing court to consider several factors in determining whether to apply an enhancement, including \u201cthe exercise of decision making authority, the nature of participation in the commission of the offense, the recruitment of accomplices, the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and the degree of control and authority exercised over others.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 application note 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-11\">\u201cMere control over a scheme rather than over a <em>participant </em>in a scheme\u201d is not enough to warrant an aggravating role enhancement. <em>Bapack, </em>129 F.3d at 1324 (internal quotation marks omitted). Instead, the guidelines require that \u201cthe defendant must have been the organizer, leader, manager or supervisor of one or more <em>participants\u201d </em>in the crimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>nal activity. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 application note 2 (emphasis added). A \u201cparticipant\u201d is a \u201cperson who is criminally responsible for the commission of the offense, but need not have been convicted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3B1.1 application note 1. An individual is \u201c \u2018criminally responsible\u2019 under \u00a7 3B1.1 only if \u2018he commit[s] all of the elements of a statutory crime <em>with the requisite mens rea.\u2019 </em>\u201d <em>United States v. McCoy, </em>242 F.3d 399, 410 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (quoting <em>Bapack, </em>129 F.3d at 1325). \u201cThis does not mean, however, that to qualify as a \u2018participant\u2019 a person must be found criminally responsible as a principal or culpable in the <em>same </em>crime of which the supervising defendant was convicted.\u201d <em>Bapack </em>129 F.3d at 1325 (emphasis added). Instead, \u201ca party who gives <em>knowing aid in some part </em>of the criminal enterprise is a \u2018criminally responsible party.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Hall, </em>101 F.3d 1174, 1178 (7th Cir. 1996)) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Accordingly, to justify the three-level managerial-role enhancement, the Government had to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that Martinez Vega (i) managed or supervised (ii) at least one \u201cparticipant\u201d who was criminally responsible for an offense (iii) in a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive. The district court adequately assessed the first element, but failed to make the required findings on the second and third elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">As to the first element, the district court pointed to record evidence showing that Martinez Vega \u201chad significant responsibility given to him by the leadership of the FARC\u201d and exercised \u201cdecision-making authority on selling these drugs, and transferring them for weapons and getting the weapons.\u201d Sentencing Tr. 45-46. The court recounted the testimony of Parra Diaz, which had \u201csuggested] that the defendant may have a . troop\u201d and had described \u201cMr. Martinez Vega as having guards ... suggesting] that there were many supervised.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 40. The court also relied upon Ortiz\u2019s testimony to the effect that \u201cthe person in charge of that group of drivers and all was \u2018Chiguiro,\u2019 that is the defendant,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 42, and Restrepo\u2019s testimony that \u201cthe defendant was like our commander, our immediate commander,\u201d and \u201cthe defendant actually assigned them where to go,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 42-43. The record thus amply supported the district court\u2019s conclusion that Martinez Vega had sufficient control and authority over other individuals to be a manager or supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">But absent from the district court\u2019s analysis is any consideration of the second element necessary for the enhancement: whether any of the persons allegedly supervised by Martinez Vega qualified as a \u201cparticipant\u201d under Section 3B1.1. The parties specifically contested that issue at the sentencing hearing. The Government asserted that \u201cany individuals who are engaged in moving cocaine and weapons to a guerilla group in the jungles in Colombia would have, by definition, been aware of the criminal nature of the their activities, and they would have been participants as understood by the guidelines.\u201d Sentencing Tr. 26. Martinez Vega countered that the Government had not shown that the workers who helped him load and unload sacks would have known that the sacks contained cocaine base or that it was being exported to the United States. <em>Id. </em>at 37. The district court, however, did not address the issue and made no finding that one or more of those supervised individuals had the requisite criminal <em>mens rea </em>and culpability to count as \u201cparticipants.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>The district court\u2019s assessment of the third element also came up short. The court found that Martinez Vega\u2019s \u201cactivities were otherwise quite extensive in this area\u201d of \u201ctransporting] ... narcotics and weaponry.\u201d Sentencing Tr. 47. But the Guidelines\u2019 \u201cotherwise extensive\u201d inquiry pertains to the scope of the <em>criminal activity </em>as a whole, not the defendant\u2019s particular involvement in it. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B 1.1(b) (asking whether \u201cthe <em>criminal activity </em>involved five or more participants or <em>was otherwise </em>extensive\u201d) (emphasis added). That is, the criminal activity must either involve \u201cfive or more participants\u201d or be \u201cotherwise extensive\u201d in that it involves fewer than five criminally culpable \u201cparticipants,\u201d but could include a number of \u201cunknowing outsiders.\u201d <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>240 F.3d 39, 49 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (\u201cotherwise extensive\u201d demands \u201ca showing that an activity is <em>the functional equivalent </em>of an activity involving five or more participants\u201d) (citation omitted). On that point, the district court made no finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">Accordingly, we vacate Martinez Vega\u2019s sentence and remand to the district court for resentencing in view of the legally required elements for a \u201cmanager or supervisor\u201d enhancement. In so doing, we reach no conclusion as to the sufficiency of the existing record on those issues, but emphasize that the review on remand is constrained to the existing record.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">III. Issues Raised by Cuevas</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Cuevas raises five arguments specific to the case against him, namely, that the district court (i) should have granted Cue-vas\u2019s motion for a mistrial after Garrido testified about a previously undisclosed conversation he had with Cuevas; (ii) should not have admitted into evidence recordings of Cuevas\u2019s phone calls; (iii) violated the Confrontation Clause by limiting Cuevas\u2019s questioning of cooperating witnesses; (iv) wrongly permitted the exhibition of a video depicting a police raid; and (v) erroneously applied sentencing enhancements for being a manager or supervisor and for possession of a firearm. None has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">A. Garrido\u2019s Reference to Cuevas as \u201cMincho\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">Throughout the trial, the Government alleged, and Cuevas denied, that Cuevas was the FARC\u2019s prominent cocaine manufacturer known as \u201cMincho.\u201d After two witnesses had identified Cuevas as Mincho, the Government called Garrido to testify about Cuevas\u2019s extradition. The following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-11\">Q: When did you first encounter Min-cho, or the defendant Cuevas Cabrera that day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-12\">A: I went inside that area while he was being processed by the Colombian authorities. I went in. I asked, \u201cAre you Mincho?\u201d He said, \u201cYes.\u201d I verified his name. Erminso Cuevas Cabrera.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-13\">Cuevas objected to the testimony on the ground that Cuevas\u2019s alleged statement to Garrido had not been disclosed during discovery, and he requested that the testimony be stricken. The court sustained the objection and issued the following instruction to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-14\">Ladies and gentlemen, Agent Garrido mentioned that when he spoke to Mr. [Cuevas] Cabrera, he asked him if he was Mincho, and he said, yes, I am Mincho. I am going to strike that testimony. That was not previously an-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>nouneed as evidence in the case about any statements that Mr. Cabrera may have made that he was Mincho. So I am going to strike that from the testimony, have you, disregard that statement by\u2014 allegedly made by Mr. Cabrera.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Cuevas nevertheless moved for a mistrial, which the district court denied. Cuevas now argues the denial was error because the testimony was highly prejudicial and because the court\u2019s curative instruction, by repeating the offending testimony and by implying its exclusion was due only to a technicality, exacerbated rather than mitigated the prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">A \u201cmistrial is a severe remedy \u2014 a step to be avoided whenever possible, and one to be taken only in circumstances manifesting a necessity therefor.\u201d <em>United States v. McLendon, </em>378 F.3d 1109, 1112 (D.C. Cir. 2004). The district court\u2019s principal consideration in ruling upon a motion for mistrial is the extent of prejudice suffered by the defendant, and we review the district court\u2019s denial only for abuse of discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">In this case, it is not obvious why Garri-do\u2019s stricken testimony was prejudicial considering that at least two other witnesses previously had identified Cuevas as \u201cMincho,\u201d and the evidence established that \u201cMincho\u201d is a common nickname for Erminso. Further, whatever harm may have been done by the testimony was promptly undone by Judge Hogan\u2019s curative instruction. \u201cWe normally presume that a jury will follow an instruction to disregard inadmissible evidence inadvertently presented to it, unless there is an overwhelming probability that the jury will be unable to follow the court\u2019s instructions.\u201d <em>Greer v. Miller, </em>483 U.S. 756, 766 n. 8, 107 S.Ct. 3102, 97 L.Ed.2d 618 (1987) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Neither Judge Hogan\u2019s repetition of the offending testimony (which was necessary to specify the objectionable content for the jury after numerous intervening questions) nor his stated reason (which was no more technical than any other evi-dentiary ruling) created such an \u201coverwhelming probability\u201d here.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">B. Admission of Cuevas\u2019s Phone Calls</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">In 2004 a federal judge in the Southern District of Florida authorized telephone wiretaps based upon a DEA agent\u2019s affidavit stating that the \u201ctarget telephones will be located overseas\u201d and that the \u201cintercepts will be conducted from, and monitored in, the Southern District of Florida.\u201d A confidential DEA source then provided the monitored phones to targets in Colombia. The Government intercepted Cuevas discussing his operations on two calls, which it played at trial during the testimony of the other party to the recorded calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-11\">Cuevas argues the tapes were inadmissible because federal law prohibits foreign surveillance and because the federal judge who approved the wiretaps lacked jurisdiction to do so. Cuevas forfeited these arguments by failing to raise them in the district court, so we consider them at most for plain error. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>773 F.3d 98, 105 (D.C. Cir. 2014); <em>see also United States v. Burroughs, </em>810 F.3d 833, 837-38 (D.C. Cir. 2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-12\">First, Cuevas\u2019s contention that extraterritorial surveillance is prohibited because \u201cTitle III ... has no extraterritorial force\u201d reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the role of the statute. Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 \u201cimposes ... limitations on the use of electronic surveillance.\u201d <em>United States v. Chavez, </em>416 U.S. 580, 580, 94 S.Ct. 1858, 40 L.Ed.2d 380 (1974). If it does not apply extraterritorially, then government surveillance outside the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>States is unconstrained, not forbidden, by Title III.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Second, Cuevas\u2019s contention that a \u201clistening post\u201d in the Southern District of Florida was insufficient to confer jurisdiction upon the federal court there is unavailing if only because every circuit that has considered the question has deemed a listening post sufficient. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Luong, </em>471 F.3d 1107, 1109 (9th Cir. 2006); <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>968 F.2d 130, 136 (2d Cir. 1992). With no \u201ccontrolling precedent\u201d or \u201cother absolutely clear legal norm\u201d to support Cuevas\u2019s position, the purported error by the district court, if error it be, cannot be deemed plain. <em>See United States v. Nwoye, </em>663 F.3d 460, 466 (D.C. Cir. 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">C. Cross-Examination of Cooperating Witnesses</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">At trial, former members of the FARC testified for the Government.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Cue-vas learned that these witnesses wore monitoring devices on their ankles both for their own safety and to prevent them from fleeing and illegally remaining in the United States. Cuevas sought to cross-examine the witnesses about the devices on the ground that they revealed potential bias. After consulting with the U.S. Marshal Service, the district court found the anklets were \u201ca security practice used with many witnesses,\u201d and were not being used because the witnesses were \u201cunder charges or otherwise untrustworthy.\u201d The court concluded that the devices had \u201cno relevance\u201d to the witnesses\u2019 credibility and that inquiry would \u201clead into other areas ... far afield from what is relevant in this trial,\u201d such as the threat Cuevas himself posed to safety of the witnesses. Accordingly, the judge prohibited Cuevas from cross-examining the witnesses about the devices.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-11\">Cuevas argues the limitation violated the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. Although that Clause guarantees a criminal defendant \u201cthe right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him,\u201d a district judge has</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AdD\">wide latitude insofar as the Confrontation Clause is concerned to impose reasonable limits on ... cross-examination based on concerns about, among other things, harassment, prejudice, confusion of the issues, the witness\u2019 safety, or interrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-12\"><em>Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 679, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986). We review the district court\u2019s limitation of cross-examination for abuse of discretion, with the central inquiry being \u201cwhether the jury would have received a significantly different impression of the witness\u2019s credibility had defense counsel been permitted to pursue the [disallowed] line of questioning.\u201d <em>United States v. Wheeler, </em>753 F.3d 200, 205 (D.C. Cir. 2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-13\">The district court did not abuse its discretion here. Questions about the devices would be of no incremental value to the defendant in this case, and the district court reasonably concluded that such questions would \u201cstray far afield from what [was] relevant in this trial.\u201d The jury was already aware that all the former FARC members who testified were admitted participants in a cocaine trafficking organization; that several had admittedly engaged in guerilla warfare; that some were admitted murderers; and that all had been spared prosecution in return for their cooperation with law enforcement. With all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>this laid bare, it is highly unlikely that questions about the monitoring devices would have left the jury with a \u201csignificantly different impression of the witness\u2019s\u201d propensity to bias or motivation to lie on behalf of the Government. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">D. Admission of the Video</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">At trial, Lieutenant Colonel Alvarez Ochoa of the Colombian National Police testified as an expert on Colombian cocaine laboratories and the organization of the FARC. Over Cuevas\u2019s objection, the Government introduced a video of a police raid, in which Alvarez participated, on a cocaine laboratory unconnected to Cuevas. The video depicted a typical cocaine lab in the jungle, the recovery of seven tons of cocaine \u201cbase,\u201d the demolition of the laboratory with explosives, and helicopters that provided armed air support. It is not clear from the testimony whether the video depicted any violent resistance from the operators of the laboratory, but Cuevas claims it did. Cuevas argues the video of a raid on a cocaine lab outside either defendant\u2019s territory was irrelevant and highly prejudicial, and it should have been excluded under Federal Rule of Evidence 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">Rule 403 permits exclusion of otherwise admissible evidence if \u201cits probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of ... unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, [or] misleading the jury.\u201d We review a district court\u2019s determination under Rule 403 \u201cwith great deference, reversing only for grave abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Clarke, </em>24 F.3d 257, 265 (D.C. Cir. 1994). In this case, Cuevas has failed even to offer any account of how the video caused him any prejudice, let alon\u00e9 sufficient prejudice to say the district court gravely abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">E. Sentencing Enhancements</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">Cuevas raises the same objection to the three-level \u201cmanager/supervisor\u201d sentencing enhancement as does Martinez Vega, namely that the district court erred in applying the enhancement because there was insufficient evidence of the culpability of anyone Cuevas supervised. Unlike Martinez Vega, however, Cuevas was expressly found by the district court to have supervised numerous culpable individuals. We are bound by this factual finding unless it is clearly erroneous, <em>see United States v. Henry, </em>557 F.3d 642, 645 (D.C. Cir. 2009), which it is not. The evidentiary record here, including Maria Santiago\u2019s testimony that she worked alongside 80 employees in a cocaine laboratory run by Cuevas, supports the court\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-11\">Cuevas also objects to the imposition of a two-level enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), for possession of a firearm during a drug offense. The district court, however, expressly found that Cuevas carried a weapon while running the lab, and this finding is far from clearly erroneous. Two witnesses testified to having seen Cuevas carry a handgun while committing drug offenses. Cuevas challenges the credibility of those witnesses, but the \u201cdistrict court\u2019s credibility determinations are entitled to the greatest deference from this court on appeal.\u201d <em>Carter v. Bennett, </em>840 F.2d 63, 67 (D.C. Cir. 1988). Cuevas gives us no basis for disturbing the court\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-12\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b569-13\">We affirm the convictions of Juan Martinez Vega and Erminso Cuevas Cabrera. We also affirm Cuevas\u2019s sentence, but we vacate Martinez Vega\u2019s sentence and remand to the district court for resentencing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-14\">\n<em>So Ordered</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b553-6\">. In other words, slight stylistic cures can head off objections like this at the pass. It is important to the integrity of the jury trial process to avoid vouching or interjecting personal beliefs, but there are plenty of proper ways to communicate what the prosecutor attempted to say here. For example, compare the following phrases. The prosecutor said: \"I think the evidence did prove that....\u201d An error-free way to say the same thing: \u201cThe evidence proves....\u201d The prosecutor said, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I buy that ...\u201d, but he could have said, \"What you heard at trial casts doubt on that....\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b554-6\">. \"Chiguiro\u201d is another name for a capybara, \"an extremely large, semi-aquatic rodent, indigenous to South America.\u201d Gov't Br. 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b555-8\">.
