In a collective bargaining agreement, the union and employer also may (and often do) agree to have an arbitrator decide disputes arising out of that agreement. The National Labor Relations Board may still review an arbitration decision in certain circumstances when the losing party says it has been deprived of a right otherwise guaranteed by the National Labor Relations Act. But consistent with the national labor policy favoring arbitration, the Board reviews arbitration decisions under a highly deferential standard, known as the <em>Spielberg-Olin </em>standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-19\">This case concerns a collective bargaining agreement between a union and Verizon New England. In the agreement, the union waived its members\u2019 right to picket, a right the members otherwise would possess under the National Labor Relations Act. During a subsequent labor dispute, Verizon employees visibly displayed pro-union signs in cars that were parked on Verizon property and lined up so that passers-by would see the signs. Verizon ordered the employees to stop displaying the signs. The union challenged Verizon\u2019s action. The legal question was this: Did the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>collective bargaining agreement\u2019s waiver of the union members\u2019 right to picket also waive their right to visibly display pro-union signs in cars that were parked on Verizon property and lined up so that passers-by would see the signs?</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">The collective bargaining agreement between the union and Verizon provided for arbitration of disputes arising out of that agreement. Verizon and the union therefore proceeded to arbitration to resolve their dispute about the signs in the cars. An arbitration panel interpreted the collective bargaining agreement in Verizon\u2019s favor. Not satisfied, the union then took the matter to the NLRB. An administrative law judge again ruled in favor of Verizon. The union appealed the matter to the Board. Although the Board reviews arbitration decisions under a highly deferential standard, the Board in a 2-1 ruling overturned this arbitration decision. The Board determined that the union\u2019s waiver of its members\u2019 right to picket did not waive their right to visibly display pro-union signs in cars on Verizon property.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">We conclude that the Board misapplied its highly deferential standard for reviewing arbitration decisions. Under that standard, the Board should have upheld the arbitration decision in this case. The Board acted unreasonably by overturning the arbitration decision. Therefore, we grant Verizon\u2019s petition for review and deny the Board\u2019s cross-application for enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act guarantees employees the right to engage in certain \u201cconcerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 157.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Included among the concerted activities protected by Section 7 is the right of employees to visibly display pro-union signs in employees\u2019 personal vehicles parked on an employer\u2019s property. <em>See, e.g., International Business Machines Corp., </em>333 N.L.R.B. 215, 219-21 (2001), <em>enforced, </em>31 Fed.Appx. 744 (2d Cir. 2002); <em>District Lodge 91, International Association of Machinists &amp; Aerospace Workers, AFL-CIO v. NLRB, </em>814 F.2d 876, 879 (2d Cir. 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-12\">Just as surely as Section 7 protects employees\u2019 right to picket and display pro-union signs in their cars, unions may waive that right in a collective bargaining agreement. <em>See, e.g., American Freight System Inc. v. NLRB, </em>722 F.2d 828, 832 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (\u201cIt is well settled that a union may lawfully waive statutory rights of represented employees in a collective bargaining agreement.\u201d). Absent a waiver, however, Section 8 of the Act makes an employer\u2019s violation of a Section 7 right an \u201cunfair labor practice.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-13\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b509-14\">Verizon New England is a well-known telecommunications provider that services. Massachusetts and Rhode Island. It maintains facilities in three towns in Massachusetts: Westfield, Springfield, and Hatfield. Employees at those facilities are represented by the International Brotherhood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>of Electrical Workers, Local 2324. Verizon New England and Local 2324 were parties to a collective bargaining agreement valid from August 3, 2003, to August 2, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">The parties\u2019 collective bargaining agreement provided for arbitration \u2014 at the union\u2019s option \u2014 of disputes arising out of the contract. The agreement stated: \u201cIf the Union contends that the intent and meaning of one or more of the Articles of [the] Agreement ... has been violated by the Company, it may demand arbitration.\u201d Joint Appendix at 38. Pursuant to the agreement, arbitration was to be conducted by a three-member Arbitration Board consisting of one representative selected by each party, as well as a mutually agreed-upon neutral arbitrator. The agreement provided that a decision of the Arbitration Board would be \u201cfinal and binding on the Union and the Company.\u201d Joint Appendix at 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">As relevant here, the collective bargaining agreement also contained a waiver of the union members\u2019 right to picket: \u201cThe Union agrees that during the term of this Agreement, or any extension thereof, it will not cause or permit its members to cause, nor will any member of the Union take part in, any strike of or other interference with any of the Company\u2019s operations or picketing of any of the Company\u2019s premises.\u201d Joint Appendix at 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">In early 2008, a few months before the collective bargaining agreement was to expire, Local 2324 planned to picket Verizon\u2019s Westfield, Springfield, and Hatfield facilities. In March 2008, the union prepared for the picketing campaign by distributing pro-union picket signs to employees at those Verizon facilities. The signs were 22 inches by 28 inches and bore pro-union slogans such as \u201cVerizon, Honor Our Existing Contract\u201d and \u201cHonor Our Contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">Employees at the three locations visibly displayed the signs in the windshields of their ears while the cars were parked on Verizon property. In response, Verizon directed the employees to stop visibly displaying the signs in their cars while on Verizon property. The employees complied. But after Verizon\u2019s order to stop displaying the signs, the union filed unfair labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board. The union alleged that Verizon had violated its members\u2019 Section 7 right to display pro-union signs in their cars.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">The Board\u2019s Regional Director declined to rule on the charges. The Regional Director did so because, in her view, the dispute arose \u201cfrom the contract between the parties,\u201d and \u201ccontractual grievance-arbitration procedures are available for resolving the dispute.\u201d Letter from Rosemary Pye, NLRB Regional Director, to Local 2324 (June 18, 2008), Joint Appendix at 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">The union then submitted to arbitration the issue of whether Verizon had violated the collective bargaining agreement by requiring the employees to stop displaying the signs in their parked cars.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">The arbitration panel ruled for Verizon over the dissent of the union-selected member of the panel. The arbitration panel relied on the provision in the collective bargaining agreement expressly waiving the union members\u2019 right to picket. The panel decided that the term \u201cpicketing\u201d included the visible display of pro-union signs in the windshields of employees\u2019 cars.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-11\">Notwithstanding the arbitration panel\u2019s reading of the collective bargaining agreement, the Acting General Counsel of the National Labor Relations Board issued a complaint alleging that Verizon had committed an unfair labor practice. The Acting General Counsel alleged that Verizon had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>violated Section 8 of the National Labor Relations Act by ordering the employees to stop displaying the pro-union signs in their cars.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Under the Board\u2019s highly deferential <em>Spielberg-Olin </em>standard (as relevant here), the Board will defer to an arbitration award unless the award is \u201cclearly repugnant\u201d to the National Labor Relations Act. <em>See Olin Corp., </em>268 N.L.R.B. 573, 574 (1984); <em>Spielberg Manufacturing Co., </em>112 N.L.R.B. 1080, 1082 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Applying that standard, the Administrative Law Judge upheld the arbitration decision in Verizon\u2019s favor. According to the Administrative Law Judge, the arbitration decision was not clearly repugnant to the Act because the contractual term \u201cpicketing\u201d could be read to cover the union activities in question here.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">The union appealed to the National Labor Relations Board. In a divided 2-1 decision, the Board ruled against Verizon. Applying the <em>Spielberg-Olin </em>standard, the Board concluded that the arbitration decision was \u201cclearly repugnant\u201d to the National Labor Relations Act. The Board stated that the arbitration panel incorrectly concluded that the union\u2019s contractual waiver of the right to picket encompassed the right to display pro-union signs in cars. The Board accepted that a union <em>could </em>waive its members\u2019 Section 7 right to display pro-union signs. But the Board stated that the union did not do so in the collective bargaining agreement at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">The Board ordered Verizon to allow employees to display pro-union signs in their cars. Verizon petitioned this Court for review of the Board\u2019s order. The Board cross-applied for enforcement of its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">Our review is deferential, not de novo. We review the Board\u2019s decision for reasonableness, which in this context is sometimes referred to as abuse of discretion review. Put succinctly, the Board\u2019s decision must be reasonable and reasonably explained. <em>See Plumbers &amp; Pipefitters Local Union No. 520 v. NLRB, </em>955 F.2d 744, 750 (D.C. Cir. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b511-12\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b511-13\">Congress has established that labor arbitration agreed upon by a union and an employer is \u201cthe desirable method for settlement of grievance disputes arising over the application or interpretation of an existing collective-bargaining agreement.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 173(d). At the same time, Section 10 of the National Labor Relations Act authorizes the Board to prevent the commission of \u201cany unfair labor practice\u201d notwithstanding \u201cany other means of adjustment or prevention that has been or may be established by agreement, law, or otherwise.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(a). The NLRB therefore may review labor arbitration proceedings in cases where determining whether an unfair labor practice occurred depends in part on whether a party waived a statutorily protected right in the collective bargaining agreement, which in turn depends on an interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement that the arbitrator previously interpreted.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-14\">Under Section 10 of the Act, the Board possesses discretion over how much to defer to arbitration decisions. The standard the Board has long used to review arbitration decisions \u2014 the <em>Spielberg-Olin </em>standard \u2014 is highly deferential to the arbitrator. The Board adopted that highly deferential standard to further the \u201cnational policy strongly favor[ing] the voluntary arbitration of disputes.\u201d <em>Olin Corp., </em>268 N.L.R.B. 573, 574 (1984); <em>see also </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 173(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>The <em>Spielberg-Olin </em>standard calls for Board deference to the arbitrator\u2019s decision so long as the following conditions are met: (1) the arbitration proceedings appear to have been fair and regular; (2) all parties agreed to be bound by the arbitration decision; (3) the arbitrator has adequately considered the unfair labor practice at issue; and (4) the arbitrator\u2019s decision is not \u201cclearly repugnant\u201d to the National Labor Relations Act. <em>See Olin Corp., </em>268 N.L.R.B. at 574; <em>Spielberg Manufacturing Co., </em>112 N.L.R.B. 1080, 1082 (1955); <em>see also Ralphs Grocery Co., </em>361 N.L.R.B. No. 9, 2014-2015 N.L.R.B. Dec. \u00b6 15,843 (July 31, 2014); <em>Roadway Express, Inc., </em>355 N.L.R.B. 197, 210 (2010); <em>Turner Construction Co., </em>339 N.L.R.B. 451, 455 (2003); <em>Mt. Sinai Hospital, </em>331 N.L.R.B. 895, 898 (2000).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">The only question in this case concerns the fourth <em>Spielberg-Olin </em>factor: whether the arbitration decision was \u201cclearly repugnant\u201d to the National Labor Relations Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">In <em>Olin, </em>the Board explained that an arbitrator\u2019s decision is not \u201cclearly repugnant\u201d unless the decision is \u201cpalpably wrong, i.e., unless the arbitrator\u2019s decision is not susceptible to an interpretation consistent with the Act.\u201d <em>Olin Corp., </em>268 N.L.R.B. at 574 (internal quotation marks and footnote omitted). That language in <em>Olin </em>is not especially clear, and it has caused some confusion in past cases. The \u201ci.e.\u201d in the sentence appears to be the source of the confusion, because what comes after the \u201ci.e.\u201d describes a separate way to overturn the arbitrator\u2019s decision, not simply an example or another way to describe what comes before the \u201ci.e.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">To be clear, therefore, the fourth <em>Spielberg-Olin </em>factor establishes two ways in which the Board may overturn an arbitrator\u2019s decision as \u201cclearly repugnant to the Act\u201d: (i) if the arbitrator interpreted the contract to mean that one party waived a right that may not be waived under the National Labor Relations Act, in which case the \u201carbitrator\u2019s decision\u201d is deemed \u201cnot susceptible to an interpretation consistent with the Act\u201d; or (ii) if the arbitrator interpreted the contract in a \u201cpalpably wrong\u201d manner and thereby deprived the losing party of a right otherwise guaranteed under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">An arbitration decision is \u201cnot susceptible to an interpretation consistent with the Act\u201d when an arbitrator interprets a contract to mean that one party waived a right that may not be waived under the National Labor Relations Act. <em>See, e.g., I.R.S. v. Federal Labor Relations Authority, </em>963 F.2d 429, 440 <em>&amp; </em>n. 13 (D.C. Cir. 1992); <em>Plumbers &amp; Pipefitters Local Union No. 520 v. NLRB, </em>955 F.2d 744, 754, 756 (D.C. Cir. 1992); <em>see also </em>Harry T. Edwards, <em>Deferral to Arbitration and Waiver of the Duty to Bargain: A Possible Way Out of Everlasting Confusion at the NLRB, </em>46 OHIO ST. L.J. 23, 30 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-10\">Put the other way, an arbitration decision finding waiver of a right protected by the Act is deemed \u201csusceptible to an interpretation consistent with the Act\u201d so long as the right at issue in the arbitration proceeding may be waived under the Act. <em>See Plumbers &amp; Pipefitters, </em>955 F.2d at 756 (\u201c[W]here the statutory right implieat-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>ed by a grievance settlement is within the category of waivable rights ... then it is unclear why the Board would ever have any choice but to give deference, at least so long as the grievance procedures through which the settlement is reached are fair and regular and the union has not breached its duty of fair representation.\u201d) (emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Therefore, to determine whether an arbitration decision is \u201csusceptible to an interpretation consistent with the Act,\u201d the Board\u2019s task is straightforward: The Board must ask only whether the Act permits the Section 7 right at issue to be waived in a collective bargaining agreement. If the answer to that question is yes, then an arbitrator\u2019s conclusion that the parties to a contract had, in fact, waived that Section 7 right is necessarily \u201csusceptible to an interpretation consistent with the Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">In this case, that inquiry is simple. All agree that the National Labor Relations Act allows a union to waive its members\u2019 Section 7 right to display pro-union signs in vehicles parked on company property. Here, the arbitration panel determined that the union did in fact waive that right. The arbitration decision, therefore, was susceptible to an interpretation consistent with the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b513-10\">Verizon claims that this conclusion \u2014 namely, that the union waived a' waivable statutory right \u2014 is the end of the inquiry under the \u201cclearly repugnant\u201d prong of the <em>Spielberg-Olin </em>standard. We disagree. As we read the Board\u2019s precedents, the <em>Spielberg-Olin </em>standard allows another (albeit narrow) way to show that an arbitration decision is \u201cclearly repugnant to the Act\u201d: if the arbitrator interpreted the contract in a \u201cpalpably wrong\u201d manner and thereby deprived the losing party of a right otherwise guaranteed under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-11\">What does \u201cpalpably wrong\u201d mean? The phrase means what it suggests. Wrong is not enough. The adverb matters. Egregiously wrong, clearly erroneous, badly flawed, totally wrong, jumping the rails. Whatever the exact verbal formulation - we will use \u201cegregiously wrong\u201d \u2014 the basic idea remains the same: The Board must afford great deference to the arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of the contract. <em>See) e.g., Motor Convoy, Inc., </em>303 N.L.R.B. 135, 137 (1991); <em>U.S. Postal Service, </em>275 N.L.R.B. 430, 432 (1985) (arbitration decision that does not comport precisely with Board precedent is not \u201cpalpably wrong\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>To state the obvious, the fact that the Board might read a contract term differently than the arbitrator read it does not suffice to make an arbitration decision \u201cpalpably wrong.\u201d Rather, as the Board has previously stated, its highly deferential standard of review \u201crecognizes that the parties have accepted the possibility that an arbitrator might decide a particular set of facts differently than would the Board. This possibility, however, is one which the parties have voluntarily assumed through collective bargaining.\u201d <em>Andersen Sand &amp; Gravel Co., </em>277 N.L.R.B. 1204, 1205 n. 6 (1985); <em>see also Dennison National Co., </em>296 N.L.R.B. 169, 170 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">To be sure, we ourselves review <em>the Board\u2019s decision </em>under a deferential standard. We may overturn the Board\u2019s decision only if the Board abused its discretion (that is, acted unreasonably) in failing to afford the required deference to the arbitration decision. <em>Plumbers &amp; Pipefitters, </em>955 F.2d at 750; <em>American Freight System Inc. v. NLRB, </em>722 F.2d 828, 832 (D.C. Cir. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Here, the Board should have upheld the arbitration decision. The arbitration decision was far from egregiously wrong. No hard-and-fast definition of the term \u201cpicketing\u201d excludes the visible display of pro-union signs in employees\u2019 cars rather than in employees\u2019 hands, especially when the cars are lined up in the employer\u2019s parking lot and thus visible to passers-by in the same way as a picket line. Indeed, the Board\u2019s own case law on picketing has concluded that the term may, under certain circumstances, extend to the display of stationary signs \u2014 whether in employees\u2019 cars, positioned near an entrance to a job site, or even planted in snowbanks \u2014 on or near the employer\u2019s property. <em>See United Mine Workers of America, District 2, </em>334 N.L.R.B. 677, 686 (2001); <em>Ironworkers District Council of the Pacific Northwest, </em>292 N.L.R.B. 562, 571-76 (1989); <em>Construction &amp; General Laborers Union, Local 304, </em>260 N.L.R.B. 1311, 1316, 1319 (1982); <em>Lawrence Typographical Union No. 570, </em>169 N.L.R.B. 279, 282-84 (1968); <em>Local 182, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, </em>135 N.L.R.B. 851, 856-57 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">In short, there was nothing approaching <em>egregious </em>error in the arbitration panel\u2019s decision to interpret the ban on picketing to encompass the visible display of picket signs in employees\u2019 cars on Verizon property. Under a reasonable application of the <em>Spielberg-Olin </em>standard, the Board should have upheld the arbitration panel\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">Under the <em>Spielberg-Olin </em>standard, the arbitration panel\u2019s decision in this case was not clearly repugnant to the Act. First, the arbitration panel\u2019s decision was susceptible to an interpretation consistent with the Act, because under the Act unions may waive their members\u2019 right to display signs in cars on the employer\u2019s premises. And second, the arbitration panel\u2019s decision was not a \u201cpalpably wrong\u201d interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement. The Board\u2019s contrary decision was unreasonable. We grant Verizon\u2019s petition for review and deny the Board\u2019s cross-application for enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b509-10\">. That provision provides in full: \"Employees shall have the right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection, and shall also have the right to refrain from any or all of such activities except to the extent that such right may be affected by an agreement requiring membership in a labor organization as a condition of employment as authorized in section 158(a)(3) of this title.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 157.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b512-6\">. In December 2014, the Board announced a new, less deferential standard of review to be applied prospectively only. <em>See Babcock &amp; Wilcox Construction Co., </em>361 NLRB No. 132, 201 L.R.R.M. (BNA) 2057 (Dec. 15, 2014). Because this case was pending when the new policy was announced, the Board applied its <em>Spielberg-Olin </em>deference standard rather than the new standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b513-7\">. The Board\u2019s \"palpably wrong\u201d standard is similar to (although perhaps a notch less deferential to the arbitrator than) the extraordinarily deferential standard applied by federal courts reviewing arbitration decisions directly under Section 301(a) of the Labor Management Relations Act. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185. Consistent with the national policy favoring labor arbitration, a federal court \"presiding over a \u00a7 301 proceeding seeking enforcement of an arbitrator's award must give the award the greatest deference imaginable \u2014 the award must be enforced so long as the arbitrator purports to be interpreting the contract rather than dispensing 'his own brand of industrial justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Utility Workers Union of America, Local 246, AFL-CIO v.

For several reasons, I do not agree that \u201cwhat comes after the \u2018i.e.\u2019 describes a separate way to overturn the arbitrator\u2019s decision\u201d instead of \u201csimply an example or another way to describe what comes before.\u201d Maj Op. 486. To begin with, this construction deviates from the term\u2019s ordinary definition \u2014 \u201ci.e.\u201d is short for the Latin <em>id </em>est, meaning \u201cthat is\u201d; not \u201cor\u201d or \u201calternatively\u201d as my colleagues apparently have it. Second, their construction does not comport with the court\u2019s ordinary usage, by which the term restates what is said before. <em>See, e.g., Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009) (\u201cintentionally relinquished or abandoned, i.e., affirmatively waived\u201d); <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 630, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002) (\u201cjurisdiction ..., <em>i.e., </em>the courts\u2019 statutory or constitutional power to adjudicate the case\u201d (internal quotations and emphasis omitted)). Third \u2014 and, in my view, most salient \u2014 we should not give our own interpretation of what Board \u201corders do not say\u201d when the Agency itself has not subsequently done so. <em>Phila. Gas Works v. FERC, </em>989 F.2d 1246, 1250-51 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (\u201cFERC, not we (or FERC\u2019s appellate lawyers), must\u201d perform task); <em>see also SEC v. Chenery Corp., </em>318 U.S. 80, 88, 63 S.Ct. 454, 87 L.Ed. 626 (1943). Tellingly, the majority opinion cites no Board authority for its interpretation of the Board\u2019s use of \u201cpalpably wrong.\u201d I submit that we should ask only whether the arbitrator\u2019s decision is susceptible of an interpretation consistent with the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 151 <em>et seq. </em>The right to picket is a waivable right and we have no independent reason to think waiver inconsistent with the NLRA; the arbitrator\u2019s conclusion that it was waived, then, passes muster and our inquiry should be at an end.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">But more importantly, my colleagues ignore the two-ton elephant in the room, namely, <em>what </em>arbitration deferral standard the Board may lawfully apply. May the Board, for instance, reject the arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) because the Board would not have reached the same conclusion in the first instance? In the past the Board said no, recognizing \u201cthat national policy strongly favors the voluntary arbitration of disputes.\u201d <em>Olin Corp., </em>268 N.L.R.B. 573, 574 (1984). Accordingly, it rejected only \u201cpalpably wrong\u201d or \u201cclearly repugnant\u201d arbitral interpretations of a CBA. <em>Id. </em>(ALJ\u2019s failure to defer to arbitration award \u201cfrustrate[d] the declared purpose of [Board policy] to recognize the arbitration process as an important aspect of the national labor policy favoring private resolution of labor disputes.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">This standard \u2014 although nebulous-tracks our own standard of review of arbitration decisions. <em>See </em>Maj. Op. 487 &amp; n. 3 (\u201cThe Board\u2019s \u2018palpably wrong\u2019 standard is similar to (although perhaps a notch less deferential to the arbitrator) the extraordinarily deferential standard\u201d we apply). When the court is the forum of first review, it enforces the arbitrator\u2019s CBA interpretation \u201cso long as the arbitrator purports to be interpreting the contract rather than dispensing \u2018his own brand of industrial justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Utility Workers Union of Am. v. NLRB, </em>39 F.3d 1210, 1216 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (quoting <em>United Steelworkers v. Enterprise Wheel &amp; Car Corp., </em>363 U.S. 593, 597, 80 S.Ct. 1358, 4 L.Ed.2d 1424 (1960)). Under that review, \u201cwhether the arbitrator erred \u2014 or even seriously erred \u2014 in interpreting the contract\u201d is irrelevant. <em>Nat\u2019l Postal Mail Handlers Union v. Am. Postal Workers Union, </em>589 F.3d 437, 441 (D.C. Cir. 2009). <em>See also Nat\u2019l Football League Mgmt. Council v.

It now appears to defer to the arbitrator\u2019s CBA interpretation only if \u201cBoard law reasonably permits\u201d it. <em>Babcock &amp; Wilcox Constr. Co., </em>361 N.L.R.B.

If the Board applies its new standard, \u201cboth an arbitrator\u2019s award and a conflicting Board order\u201d could \u2014 inconsistently\u2014be \u201cenforced simultaneously in the federal courts.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">If the Board continues to second guess the substance of the arbitrator\u2019s CBA interpretation as opposed to, say, only his choice of remedy, the paradox will become inevitable. To me, it is plain that the Board\u2019s inquiry whether \u201cBoard law reasonably permits\u201d an interpretation is irreconcilable with our review of whether the arbitrator dispensed his \u201cown brand of industrial justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When the time comes, I believe the Board will have to explain why we should accord <em>its </em>decision any deference when it fails to defer to an arbitrator\u2019s conclusion, to which <em>our </em>\u201cextraordinarily deferential standard,\u201d <em>Nat\u2019l Postal, </em>589 F.3d at 441, must be applied. <em>See BP Amoco Corp. v.

The relevant provision of the collective bargaining agreement waived the employees\u2019 right to engage in \u201cpicketing.\u201d An arbitration panel, in a divided decision, found that the unattended display of pro-union signs in parked cars while at work constituted \u201cpicketing.\u201d A dissenting arbitrator strongly disagreed. The Board overturned the arbitration majority\u2019s decision, and we now assess whether the Board acted permissibly in doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">I concur fully in the court\u2019s explanation of the legal standards under which the Board reviews an arbitration decision\u2019s interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement. As the court sets out, one situation in which the Board may set aside an arbitration decision is if an arbitrator reaches a \u201cpalpably wrong\u201d conclusion that the agreement waives employees\u2019 statutory right to engage in the conduct at issue. <em>Ante, </em>at 487-88. The \u201cpalpably wrong\u201d standard is self-evidently a deferential one. But if the Board, applying that deferential standard, concludes that an arbitrator\u2019s interpretation is palpably wrong, we in turn apply a deferential standard in reviewing the Board\u2019s decision. As the court explains, we overturn the Board\u2019s decision only if it is an abuse of discretion \u2014 that is, only if it is unreasonable. <em>Ante, </em>at 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">My sole (and narrow) disagreement with the court concerns the application of that deferential standard in the specific circumstances of this case. In my respectful view, the Board\u2019s decision was not unreasonable in setting aside the arbitration decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">The arbitration majority determined that, when Verizon employees left unattended signs in the windows of their cars in company parking lots while they went about their workday, the employees were engaged in \u201cpicketing.\u201d According to the arbitration majority, \u201cplacing signs in cars\u201d amounts to \u201cpicketing\u201d because it \u201ccommunicates a message.\u201d J.A. 305. The Board could reasonably conclude otherwise. As the Supreme Court has explained, although written communications \u201cmay convey the same information\u201d as workers \u201cpatrolling a picket line,\u201d the \u201cloyalties and responses evoked and exacted by picket lines are unlike those flowing from appeals by printed word.\u201d <em>Hughes v. Superior Court, </em>339 U.S. 460, 465, 70 S.Ct. 718, 94 L.Ed. 985 (1950). Picketing thus is \u201cqualitatively different from other modes of communication.\u201d <em>Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Fla. Gulf Coast Bldg. &amp; Const. Trades Council, </em>485 U.S. 568, 580, 108 S.Ct. 1392, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>99 L.Ed.2d 645 (1987) (internal quotation marks and quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">The Board, for that reason, could find it wrong to deem the unattended display of signs in parked ears to be \u201cpicketing.\u201d But could the Board find it <em>palpably </em>wrong to do so? That is by definition a closer question. I think that, under our deferential standard of review, it was at least reasonable for the Board to find the arbitration majority\u2019s interpretation of \u201cpicketing\u201d to be palpably wrong. In other words, it was at least reasonable for the Board to find the dissenting arbitrator to be palpably correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">The Board has long held that a \u201cnecessary condition! ] of \u2018picketing\u2019 is a confrontation in some form between union members and [persons] trying to enter the employer\u2019s premises.\u201d <em>Chi. Typographical Union No. 16, </em>151 N.L.R.B. 1666, 1669 (1965) (quoting <em>NLRB v. United Furniture Workers of Am., </em>337 F.2d 936, 940 (2d Cir. 1964)). The Board could reasonably conclude that, when union members leave signs behind in their parked cars and enter the workplace for the day, they plainly are not engaged in the sort of personal \u201cconfrontation\u201d with passersby in the parking lot that could be considered \u201cpicketing.\u201d <em>See id. </em>(finding that patrolling while carrying placards in shopping centers and public buildings lacked the \u201celement of confrontation\u201d necessary to constitute picketing). To be sure, picketers might occasionally \u2022 set down their signs while taking a temporary break or while sitting nearby in their cars to avoid rainfall. <em>See, e.g., Constr. &amp; Gen. Laborers Local 304, </em>260 N.L.R.B. 1311, 1316 (1982); <em>Gen. Serv. Emps. Union Local 73, </em>239 N.L.R.B. 295, 302 (1978); <em>Lawrence Typographical Union No. 570, </em>169 N.L.R.B. 279, 282-83 (1968); <em>Local 182, Int\u2019l Bhd. of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen &amp; Helpers of Am., </em>135 N.L.R.B. 851, 856 &amp; n. 6 (1962). But here, the employees left their signs entirely unattended in their cars, and they then went to work. I am unaware of any decision considering employees to be engaged in picketing even while in the workplace carrying out their normal functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">In those circumstances, I believe the Board reasonably found the arbitration majority\u2019s interpretation of the \u201cpicketing\u201d prohibition to be palpably wrong. The Board may not have been compelled to reach that conclusion, and the Board perhaps also would have acted reasonably had it sustained the arbitration decision rather than overturned it. In adopting the latter course, though, the Board, in my respectful view, did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
