KANNE, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b473-10\"> After examining the briefs and the record, we have concluded that oral argument is unnecessary. Thus, the appeal is submitted on the briefs and the record. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b474-7\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">Federal inmate Gregory McCall petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, claiming in part that the district court misapplied U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 5G1.3(b)-(c), the sentencing guideline that governs unfulfilled terms of imprisonment. The court denied his petition, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">After a jury convicted McCall on one count of possessing a firearm as a felon, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1), 924(a)(2), he was sentenced in the Western District of Missouri to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment. His conviction and sentence were affirmed. <em>See United States v. McCall, </em>94 Fed.Appx. 417 (8th Cir.2004). McCall then brought a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 in the Western District of Missouri, challenging his sentence. The district court denied the motion, and the court of appeals denied his application for a certificate of appealability-</p>\n<p id=\"b474-10\">While serving his sentence, McCall was sentenced in a Kansas state court on pending charges of identity theft. He received a 44-month sentence to run consecutively to his federal charge (and was credited 891 days for time served in federal prison).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-11\">McCall then petitioned the district court under \u00a7 2241, arguing among other things that the court misapplied U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 5G1.3(b)-(c), and should have reduced his sentence for time served in pretrial detention, and should have allowed his federal sentence to be served in state prison. The court denied the petition, explaining that \u00a7 2241 could not provide McCall with relief because a federal inmate seeking to challenge his conviction or sentence must normally do so under \u00a7 2255, and McCall did not qualify for any of the narrow exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-12\">On appeal McCall renews his \u00a7 2241 argument that the sentencing court misapplied U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3 at the time of sentencing. His argument challenges the imposition of his sentence, which is a contention ordinarily raised only under \u00a7 2255, <em>see Kramer v. Olson, </em>347 F.3d 214, 217 (7th Cir.2003), whereas challenges to the execution of a sentence are generally brought under \u00a7 2241, <em>see Valona v. United States, </em>138 F.3d 693, 694 (7th Cir.1998). Because McCall attacks the imposition, not the execution, of his sentence, he must demonstrate that he falls within the \u201csavings clause\u201d provided by \u00a7 2255, which permits a prisoner to proceed under \u00a7 2241 if \u00a7 2255 was \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 \u00b6 5; <em>Kramer, </em>347 F.3d at 217; <em>United States v. Prevatte, </em>300 F.3d 792, 799 (7th Cir. 2002). Section 2255 may be inadequate or ineffective if a defendant has been convicted of a \u201cnonexistent offense.\u201d <em>In re Davenport, </em>147 F.3d 605, 611 (7th Cir.1998). And absent extraordinary circumstances a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>challenge premised on the sentencing guidelines can be raised only on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Wisch, </em>275 F.3d 620, 625 (7th Cir.2001); <em>Allen v. United States, </em>175 F.3d 560, 563 (7th Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">McCall, having previously filed a direct appeal and a \u00a7 2255 motion, is unable to satisfy this narrow exception. He does not argue that the charged conduct is no longer a crime or that there is newly discovered evidence. <em>See Lewis v. Peterson, </em>329 F.3d 934, 936 (7th Cir.2003). Nor does he assert that he is innocent of the charges. <em>See Kramer, </em>347 F.3d at 217. Rather, his challenge, premised on the district court\u2019s alleged misapplication of the guidelines, is to the imposition and not the execution of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
