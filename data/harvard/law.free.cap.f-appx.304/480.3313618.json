We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>\u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion an IJ\u2019s denial of a motion to continue, <em>Sandoval-Luna v. Mukasey, </em>526 F.3d 1243, 1246 (9th Cir.2008) (per curiam), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">The IJ did not abuse his discretion in denying Gutierrez-Campos\u2019 request for a continuance because his labor certification had not been approved at the time of the hearing. <em>See id. </em>at 1247 (IJ\u2019s denial of an additional continuance was within discretion where the \u201clabor certification application ... had not been approved at the time of the hearing and no relief was then immediately available\u201d). It follows that the IJ did not violate due process. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000) (requiring error to succeed on a due process claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">We are not persuaded by Gutierrez-Campos\u2019 remaining contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b504-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
