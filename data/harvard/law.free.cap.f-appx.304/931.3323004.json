May 13, 2008), <em>aff'g </em>No. A98 560 282 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City, Nov. 3, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-9\">When the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Shu Wen Sun v. BIA, </em>510 F.3d 377, 379 (2d Cir.2007). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See Salimatou Bah v. Mukasey, </em>529 F.3d 99, 110 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-11\">Here, Wang has failed to exhaust his argument that the immigration judge erred in finding that he could reasonably relocate within China. In addition to the statutory requirement that petitioners exhaust the categories of relief they seek, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1), a petitioner must also raise to the BIA the specific issues he or she later raises in this Court. <em>See Foster v. INS, </em>376 F.3d 75, 78 (2d Cir.2004). While not jurisdictional, this judicially imposed exhaustion requirement is mandatory. <em>Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 119-20 (2d Cir.2007). Therefore, because Wang failed to raise this argument on appeal before the BIA, and because the Government has raised this failure to exhaust in its brief, we decline to consider this issue. <em>See Steevenez v. Gonzales, </em>476 F.3d 114, 117 (2d Cir.2007) (\u201cTo preserve an issue for judicial review, the petitioner must first raise it with specificity before the BIA.\u201d). As a finding that a petitioner can reasonably relocate \u201csafely constitutes a ground, in and of itself, on which an IJ\u2019s denial of withholding of removal [and asylum] may be based,\u201d <em>Steevenez, </em>476 F.3d at 117-18, we need not address the alternate grounds upon which the agency denied that relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-12\">As to the Petitioner\u2019s CAT claim, issues not sufficiently argued in the briefs are considered waived and normally will not be addressed on appeal in the absence of manifest injustice. <em>Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005). Here, Petitioner addresses the denial of CAT relief in a \u201csingle conelusory sentence,\u201d we deem that claim to have been waived. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b956-13\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>tion is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
