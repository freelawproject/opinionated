Van Wyke, which denied Huang\u2019s applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Mei Xing Huang, </em>No. A98 350 338 (B.I.A. Apr. 22, 2008), <em>aff'g </em>No. A98 350 338 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City June 13, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-19\">Where, as here, the BIA affirms the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision directly. <em>Jian Hui Shao v. B.I.A., </em>465 F.3d 497, 500 (2d Cir.2006). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility findings, under the substantial evidence standard. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008). Questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact are reviewed <em>de novo. Salimatou Bah v. Mukasey, </em>529 F.3d 99, 110 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-20\">We find that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. The IJ relied on Huang\u2019s demeanor, noting that she was baffled, confused, and lacking in confidence. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>further found that, when asked basic questions designed to elicit information not listed in her asylum application, her testimony was often non-responsive, stalled, and incoherent. We accord substantial deference to the IJ\u2019s determination as to Huang\u2019s demeanor, as the IJ was in the best position to observe it. <em>See Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 116-117 (2d Cir.2007) (noting that the deference owed to an IJ\u2019s decision \u201cis at its highest point where an IJ\u2019s credibility determinations are based on observation of the applicant\u2019s demeanor\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">Further, the IJ found implausible Huang\u2019s claim that, whereas she was arrested and detained for holding a church meeting at her house, her father, who had allegedly practiced Christianity for over twenty years and was a pastor at several underground churches including Huang\u2019s, never experienced any problems with authorities. The IJ found this claim particularly implausible in light of Huang\u2019s other claims that: (1) she had been a practicing Christian since only 2002; (2) during her detention, government officials asked her for the identities of the key leaders of her church; (3) her parents, when begging the government officials to release her from custody, informed the officials that they, too, were practicing Christians who attended underground churches; and (4) when government officials visited the house she shared with her parents to monitor her activities, thereby causing her to go into hiding, the officials did not bother her parents. When the IJ asked Huang why the authorities had placed her, but not her parents, under surveillance, she testified that the officials were probably interested in monitoring only the activities of younger Christians. However, as the IJ found, this explanation is contradicted by the country conditions evidence Huang submitted and her earlier testimony that officials had interrogated her about the identities of key church leaders irrespective of their age. Because a reasonable factfinder would not be compelled to credit Huang\u2019s explanation, the IJ was not compelled to do so. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005). Further, the IJ\u2019s finding that Huang\u2019s testimony was implausible was not the result of bald speculation but, rather, was \u201ctethered to record evidence,\u201d i.e., Huang\u2019s own testimony and documentary evidence. <em>Wensheng Yan v. Mukasey, </em>509 F.3d 63, 66-67 (2d Cir.2007) (affirming an adverse credibility determination based on the overall implausibility of the applicant\u2019s testimony).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-6\">Moreover, the IJ reasonably found numerous discrepancies in Huang\u2019s testimony that, when considered cumulatively, served to undermine her credibility to such an extent that a reasonable factfinder would not be compelled to believe her claim. <em>See Tu Lin v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 395, 402 (2d Cir.2006). Thus, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, and the IJ\u2019s denial of Huang\u2019s asylum claim on this basis was proper. <em>See Corovic, </em>519 F.3d at 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-7\">Because the only evidence of a threat to Huang\u2019s life or freedom depended upon her credibility, the adverse credibility finding in this case necessarily precludes success on her claims for withholding of removal and CAT relief, as she has not offered any factual basis demonstrating a likelihood of persecution or torture apart from her asylum claim. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>quest for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
