The district court sentenced Kyles to concurrent imprisonment terms of 120 months on Count 1, 240 months on Count 2, and 120 months on Count 3. The district court sentenced Kyles to a consecutive imprisonment term of 60 months for her conviction on Count 4, possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime. The sentences on Counts 2 and 4 were imposed pursuant to the statutorily mandated minimum sentences on those counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Kyles argues that the district court committed plain error in imposing a consecutive five-year sentence pursuant to \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(i), which sets forth a five-year statutory minimum sentence for possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime. Her argument relies on the exception provided in the opening clause of \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). Section 924(c)(1)(A) provides: \u201cExcept to the extent that a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided by this subsection or by any other provision of law,\u201d any person who possesses a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime \u201cshall, in addition to the punishment provided for such ... drug trafficking crime\u201d be subject to one of the mandatory minimum prison terms provided in \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(i)-(iii). According to Kyles, the opening clause means that, if a \u201cgreater minimum sentence\u201d is required for another conviction, then the mandatory minimum sentence under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) does not apply. Kyles argues that the five-year minimum sentence under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(i) is inapplicable to her because \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)(iii) subjects her to a 20-year minimum sentence on her cocaine base offense, Count 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">Because Kyles did not object in the district court to the imposition of the five-year consecutive sentence, plain error review applies. <em>See United States v. Guidry, </em>456 F.3d 493, 505 (5th Cir.2006). To show plain error, Kyles must show an error that is clear or obvious and that affects her substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Baker, </em>538 F.3d 324, 332 (5th Cir.2008). If Kyles makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">In support of her argument, Kyles directs our attention to the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Whitley, </em>529 F.3d 150 (2d Cir.2008), in which the court generally agreed with the interpretation of \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) that Kyles advances here. But, as Kyles concedes, at least three circuits have reached decisions that are contrary to Whitley\u2019s interpretation of the statute and her argument on appeal. <em>See United States v. Jolivette, </em>257 F.3d 581, 586-87 (6th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Studifin, </em>240 F.3d 415, 423-24 (4th Cir. 2001); and <em>United States v. Alaniz, </em>235 F.3d 386, 387-89 (8th Cir.2000). Moreover, this circuit has agreed with the Fourth, Sixth, and Eighth Circuits\u2019 interpretation, although only in an unpublished decision. <em>See United States v. Collins, </em>205 Fed.Appx. 196, 198 (5th Cir.2006) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">In light of the disagreement among circuits and the weight of authority opposing Kyles\u2019 argument (including an unpublished <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>decision from this court), we conclude that the district court\u2019s error, if any, was not clear or obvious.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Salinas, </em>480 F.3d 750, 759 (5th Cir.2007). Accordingly, the sentence imposed by the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b292-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
