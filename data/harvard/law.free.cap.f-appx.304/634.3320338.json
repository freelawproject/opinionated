R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b659-5\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">Jahotman Sihotang, a native and citizen of Indonesia, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 order dismissing his appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s decision denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, protection under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d), and cancellation of removal. Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Reviewing for substantial evidence, <em>Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1015 (9th Cir.2003), we deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">The record does not compel the conclusion that changed or extraordinary circumstances excused the untimely filing of Sihotang\u2019s asylum application. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a)(4), (5); <em>Ramadan v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 646, 656-58 (9th Cir.2007) (per curiam). Accordingly, Sihotang\u2019s asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of withholding of removal because Sihotang\u2019s experiences did not constitute past persecution and Sihotang failed to establish that it was more likely than not that he will be persecuted if he returns to Indonesia. <em>See Hoxha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179, 1184-85 (9th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">Substantial evidence also supports the agency\u2019s determination that Sihotang is not entitled to CAT relief because he failed to establish that it is more likely than not that he will be tortured if he returns to Indonesia. <em>See Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-12\">With respect to cancellation of removal, we lack jurisdiction to review Sihotang\u2019s challenge to the agency\u2019s discretionary determination that he failed to show exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to his children. <em>See Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 929-30 (9th Cir.2005). Sihotang\u2019s contention that the agency denied him due process by misapplying the law to the facts is not supported by the record and does not amount to a colorable due process claim. <em>See id. </em>at 930.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b659-10\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
