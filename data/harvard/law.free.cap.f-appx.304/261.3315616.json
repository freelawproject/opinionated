He contends that the district court inadequately explained its reasoning for sentencing him inside the applicable guideline sentencing range. He further contends that sentences calculated using the 16-level adjustment of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 are not entitled to deference because the adjustment is not supported by empirical evidence and national experience. He finally contends that deference to the guideline sentencing range precluded the district court from considering the reason for his illegal reentry into the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-15\">Sanchez-Valladares did not contend in the district court that the court inadequately explained its reason for the sentence imposed. Our review is for plain error. <em>United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 806 (5th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 625, 172 L.Ed.2d 617 (2008). Sanchez-Valladares\u2019s request for a lower sentence was based solely on his allegation that he illegally reentered the United States to look for his son. The district court heard his argument and the Government\u2019s argument that a within-range sentence was appropriate based on Sanchez-Valladares\u2019s history of arrests and convictions. The district court adopted the presentence report and determined that a within-range sentence was appropriate. The district court adequately explained the sentence. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468-69, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Sanchez-Valladares has not demonstrated error, plain or otherwise, as to the explanation for his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Citing the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007) and <em>Rita, </em>Sanchez-Valladares next argues that the within-guidelines sentence imposed in his case should not be accorded a presumption of reasonableness. Sanchez-Valladares contends that the justification for applying a presumption of reasonableness in his case is undercut because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, the Guideline used to calculate his advisory sentencing guidelines range, was not promulgated according to usual Sentencing Commission procedures and did not take into account empirical data and national experience. Sanchez-Valladares poi\u2019trays the <em>Kimbrough </em>decision as having suggested that the appellate presumption should not be applied to Guidelines that did not take account of this data and experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">Our reading of <em>Kimbrough </em>does not reveal any such suggestion. The question presented in <em>Kimbrough </em>was whether \u201ca sentence ... outside the guidelines range is per se unreasonable when it is based on a disagreement with the sentencing disparity for crack and powder cocaine offenses.\u201d 128 S.Ct. at 564. Speaking specifically to the crack cocaine Guidelines, the Court simply ruled that \u201cit would not be an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when sentencing a particular defendant that the crack/powder disparity yields a sentence \u2018greater than necessary5 to achieve \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s purposes, even in a mine-run case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 575. In <em>Kimbrough, </em>the Court said nothing of the applicability of the presumption of reasonableness. Moreover, the appellate presumption\u2019s continued applicability to \u00a7 2L1.2 sentences is supported by this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338-39 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>172 U.S. 236, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008). The appellate presumption is therefore applicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">To the extent that Sanchez-Valladares\u2019s brief may be construed as contending that the district court did not recognize the extent of its discretion in light of <em>Kimbrough </em>and <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), he did not raise this argument in the district court, and the argument is reviewed for plain error. <em>See Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d at 806.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-11\">Sanchez-Valladares argued in the district court for a sentence below the guideline range based on his reason for reentering the United States illegally. The district court did not explicitly reject Sanchez-Valladares\u2019s argument, but nothing in the record indicates that the district court felt that a sentence below 70 months was appropriate or that the district court did not understand that it could depart or deviate from the guideline sentencing range. Sanchezr-Valladares has faded to satisfy the plain-error standard. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez-Rodriguez, </em>530 F.3d 381, 388 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b286-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
