We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s finding of removability, <em>Nakamoto v. Ashcroft, </em>363 F.3d 874, 882 (9th Cir.2004), and we review de novo questions of law, <em>Vasquez-Zavala v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 1105, 1107 (9th Cir.2003). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-21\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that Bent was removable for alien smuggling where the record establishes that Bent knew of her boyfriend\u2019s alien status, attempted to drive him across the border into the United States, and provided him with her son\u2019s birth certificate to facilitate his entry. <em>See Urzua Covarrubias v. Gonzales, </em>487 F.3d 742, 748-49 (9th Cir.2007) (substantial evidence supported conclusion that petitioner engaged in alien smuggling where he knowingly provided an affirmative act of assistance to brother\u2019s effort to enter the United States illegally); <em>cf. Altamirano v. Gonzales, </em>427 F.3d 586, 595 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-22\">We reject Bent\u2019s contention that the IJ relied on improper evidence in reaching her decision. The record reflects that Bent withdrew her objection to the IJ\u2019s admission into evidence of Hector SernaSandoval\u2019s sworn statement, and the IJ\u2019s decision did not rely upon Serna-Sandoval\u2019s other statements. <em>See Gu v. Gon</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number><em>zales, </em>454 F.3d 1014, 1021 (9th Cir.2006) (hearsay evidence is admissible in immigration proceedings if it is probative and its admission is fundamentally fair).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b647-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
