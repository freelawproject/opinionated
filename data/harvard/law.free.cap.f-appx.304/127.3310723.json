He was sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment on the burglary charge and five years imprisonment on the assault charge, with the sentences to be served consecutively. On appeal, the Appellate Division of the District Court of the Virgin Islands affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-14\">In this appeal, Elliott argues that (1) his pleas were not knowing, voluntary and intelligent, (2) his sentence was disproportionate to his criminal conduct and accordingly violated the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of the Eighth Amendment, (3) he was denied effective assistance of counsel, and (4) the assault count of the information fails to state a crime. Elliott advanced the first three of these contentions before the Appellate Division, and essentially for the reasons given by it in its opinion (App. at 96-106), we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-16\">After reading the ten page transcript of the exchange between Elliott and the Court during the plea hearing, we, too, are satisfied that Elliott was advised of, and fully understood, the nature of the charges to which he pled and the possible consequences of his pleas. Given what was established at the plea hearing, it was not necessary that the Court personally spell out the elements of each charge. <em>Bradshaw v. Stumpf, </em>545 U.S. 175, 183, 125 S.Ct. 2398, 162 L.Ed.2d 143 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-17\">As the Appellate Division noted, the Supreme Court has held that \u201cwhen considering Eighth Amendment challenges to sentencing for felony crimes, \u2018the length of the sentence actually imposed is purely a matter of legislative prerogative.\u2019 \u201d App. at 103 (quoting from <em>Rummel v. Estelle, </em>445 U.S. 263, 274, 100 S.Ct. 1133, 63 L.Ed.2d 382 (1980)). Given the Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent application of that principle in <em>Hutto v. Davis, </em>454 U.S. 370, 102 S.Ct. 703, 70 L.Ed.2d 556 (1982), there is clearly no Eighth Amendment problem here.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-18\">Elliott insists that his counsel (1) \u201cduped and forced\u201d him to enter his pleas, (2) did not explain, or even provide him with a copy of, the information, and (3) did not offer unspecified mitigating evidence on his behalf during the sentencing hearing. These charges cannot be evaluated on the basis of the existing record, howev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>er, and this is not one of those rare cases in which we can adjudicate an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in a direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Giving Elliott the benefit of the doubt, we will view his fourth and final argument as a contention that Count III of the information failed to state a crime. As so viewed, it would not be barred by his guilty plea. <em>United States v. Ruttenberg, </em>625 F.2d 173 (7th Cir.1980). Count III alleges that Elliott \u201cdid with unlawful violence and with intent to injure, assault Susan Sheats with a deadly weapon, to wit, a paint can, by throwing said paint can at Susan Sheats and attempting to strike Susan Sheats with said paint can.\u201d JA at 14. Elliott acknowledges that whether something is a \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d depends not only on what it is but also how it is used. His argument is that a paint can cannot be employed in a manner that renders it a \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d within the meaning of 14 V.I.C. \u00a7 297(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">As we pointed out in <em>Government of the Virgin Islands v. Robinson, </em>29 F.3d 878 (3d Cir.1994), the common law definition of a \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-7\">A deadly weapon is one which, from the manner used, is calculated or likely to produce death or serious bodily injury. Thus whether a weapon is deadly depends upon two factors: (1) what it intrinsically is and (2) how it is used. If almost anyone can kill with it, it is a deadly weapon when used in a manner calculated to kill. Thus the following items have been held to be deadly weapons in view of the circumstances of their use ... iron bars, baseball bats, bricks, rocks, ice picks, automobiles, and pistols used as bludgeons.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 886 (quoting Wayne R. LaFave &amp; Austin W. Scott, Jr., <em>Handbook on Criminal Law </em>537 (1972)). In adopting this definition in Robinson, we did \u201cnot think it difficult to determine whether Robinson\u2019s use of the two-by-four constituted use of a \u2018deadly weapon.\u2019 When Robinson picked up the two-by-four and swung it at [another], it became a weapon which was likely to cause ... serious bodily injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Adopting that same common law definition here, we conclude that a paint can can, indeed, be used in a manner that renders it a \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d within the meaning of 14 V.I.C. \u00a7 297(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">We will affirm the judgment of conviction without prejudice to Elliott\u2019s ability to press his ineffective assistance of counsel claim hereafter in an appropriate proceeding.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b153-8\">. Our noting that we do not finally resolve Elliott's ineffective assistance of counsel claim constitutes no comment on the merits of that claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
