United States v. DeGeorge, </em>380 F.3d 1203, 1220 (9th Cir.2004). The government failed to provide notice of its intent to introduce this evidence, as required by Rule 404(b). <em>Cf. United States v. Hill, </em>953 F.2d 452, 458 (9th Cir.1991). However, any error in admitting the challenged evidence was harmless due to the substantial other evidence of guilt. <em>See United States v. Holler, </em>411 F.3d 1061, 1067 (9th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-14\">The district court properly imposed a firearm enhancement under United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) (2006). It was reasonably foreseeable that Hernandez\u2019s co-defendant would possess a firearm in connection with their joint distribution of methamphetamine. <em>See United States v. Garcia, </em>909 F.2d 1346, 1350 (9th Cir.1990). In addition, the handgun was discovered by officers in plain view in a bedroom where children\u2019s toys were also present. <em>See United States v. Willis, </em>899 F.2d 873, 875 (9th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-15\">Finally, the sentence imposed was reasonable. <em>See United States v. Carty, </em>520 F.3d 984, 994 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc) (noting that a sentence within the Guidelines is reasonable \u201cin the mine run of cases\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b511-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
