He contends the District Court imposed an unreasonable sentence by applying a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 career-offender enhancement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, and we review the District Court\u2019s decision under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-17\">French contends the sentence imposed by the District Court is unreasonable in light of his criminal history. Based on his conviction for \u00a7 1951(a) Hobbs Act robbery and the application of a career-offender enhancement applied under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, the recommended Guideline sentencing range was 360 months to life imprisonment. A career-offender enhancement is appropriate where:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-18\">(1) the defendant was at least eighteen years old at the time the defendant committed the instant offense of conviction; (2) the instant offense of conviction is a felony that is ... a crime of violence ...; and (3) the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b993-20\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-21\">French satisfies each of the three \u00a7 4B1.1(a) criteria. First, on the day of the robbery French was over 18 years old. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>Second, Hobbs Act robbery is a crime of violence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Third, French had at least two prior convictions for violent, felony crimes: in 1993, he was convicted of aggravated assault for stabbing a victim in the head, shoulder, arm, and hand with a screwdriver, and, in 1998, he was convicted of robbing a grocery store by pressing the barrel of an imitation handgun into the neck of a female employee. Despite the applicability of \u00a7 4B1.1(a), French contends that his sentence is unreasonable because his criminal history does not warrant such a severe enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">The touchstone of post <em>-Booker </em>sentencing is reasonableness. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); <em>United States v. Lessner, </em>498 F.3d 185, 203 (3d Cir.2007) (\u201cWe review a sentence for reasonableness, evaluating both its procedural and substantive underpinnings.\u201d). When considering the reasonableness of a sentence, this court engages in a two-part inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">First, we must \u201censure that the district court committed no significant procedural error in arriving at its decision.\u201d <em>United States v. Wise, </em>515 F.3d 207, 217 (3d Cir. 2008). This requires our finding the district court has, <em>inter alia, </em>undertaken a \u201cmeaningful consideration of the factors set forth at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a),\u201d <em>Lessner, </em>498 F.3d at 203, and has \u201cadequately explain[ed] the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the guidelines range.\u201d <em>Wise, </em>515 F.3d at 217 (quoting <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597). However, \u201c[a] sentencing court need not make findings as to each [\u00a7 3553(a) ] factor if the record otherwise makes clear that the court took the factors into account,\u201d <em>Lessner, </em>498 F.3d at 203, and it is not required \u201cto state on the record that [it][has] explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the ... factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Charles, </em>467 F.3d 828, 831 (3d Cir.2006) (quoting <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>437 F.3d 324, 329 (3d Cir.2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-8\">Second, if the district court\u2019s decision contains no procedural error, we \u201cconsider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. To be substantively reasonable, the final sentence must be \u201cpremised upon appropriate and judicious consideration of the relevant [\u00a7 3553(a) ] factors.\u201d <em>Lessner, </em>498 F.3d at 204 (quoting <em>United States v. Schweitzer, </em>454 F.3d 197, 204 (3d Cir. 2006)). Our substantive reasonableness review takes into account the \u201ctotality of the circumstances,\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597, but recognizes \u201c[t]he sentencing judge is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a),\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although we do not apply a presumption of reasonableness when the imposed sentence falls outside the recommended Guidelines range, we do \u201cgive due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. We consider whether the District Court committed procedural error by failing to meaningfully consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. At the sentencing hearing, the District Court considered arguments from French, his attorney, and several witnesses who testified on French\u2019s behalf. Thereafter, the court expressly considered a number \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including (1) French\u2019s personal history, including his mental and behavioral characteristics; (2) the seriousness of French\u2019s crime, his lack of respect for the law, and the need to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>deter him from committing future crimes; (3) the need to provide French with vocational training and medical and correctional treatment; (4) the recommended Guideline range as set forth in the presentence report; and (5) the need for the victims to receive monetary restitution. We are satisfied that the District Court meaningfully considered the appropriate factors, and we find no procedural error in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">Furthermore, the District Court recognized it was imposing a sentence five years below that recommended by the Guidelines, and attributed this variance to mitigating factors involving the robbery itself and to the court\u2019s determination that 25 years was sufficient. This explanation is procedurally sufficient. Nonetheless French contends the District Court\u2019s application of a career offender enhancement overstated his criminal history and rendered his sentence substantively unreasonable. Contrary to French\u2019s allegation that the District Court engaged in a \u201c[r]ote application\u201d of the guideline provisions, the court\u2019s sentencing decision reflects both a judicious consideration of those factors and a prudent application of its post <em>-Booker </em>sentencing discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-6\">In light of French\u2019s lifelong record of violent criminal activity and the serious nature of his most recent offense, the career offender enhancement was reasonable. Although that enhancement results in a recommended Guidelines range of 360 months to life, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, the District Court imposed a 300 month sentence-60 months <em>below </em>the minimum recommended by the Guidelines. Before granting this variance, however, the District Court engaged in a meaningful consideration of <em>all </em>the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and we \u201cgive due deference to [its] decision that the [factors], on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. Accordingly, because it \u201cfalls within the broad range of possible sentences that can be considered reasonable in light of [those] factors,\u201d <em>Wise, </em>515 F.3d at 218, we conclude French\u2019s sentence is substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-8\">The District Court\u2019s application of a career-offender enhancement was proper, and the consequent sentence is both procedurally and substantively reasonable. Because we find no error, we will affirm the judgment of conviction and sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b993-12\">. French was charged with interfering with interstate commerce by robbery (\"Hobbs Act robbery\u201d) in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a), knowingly using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1), unlawful possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), and aiding and abetting in each under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. French was convicted by jury on counts one and two. After the jury convicted him for counts one and two, but before the second half of his bifurcated trial, French pleaded guilty to count three.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b993-13\">. French also contends the District Court abused its discretion in refusing to grant a downward adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3 E1.1; and further abused its discretion in applying an upward adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(4)(B). However, our resolution of the first issue precludes the need to confront these additional contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-23\">The recommended Guideline range for French\u2019s sentence was based entirely on a career-offender enhancement imposed under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(c). The second and third issues pertain to adjustments to the underlying offense level which do not affect the \u00a7 4B1.1(c) enhancement. Accordingly, because we will affirm the District Court\u2019s decision to apply a 4B 1.1(c) career offender enhancement, any decision as to issues two or three will have no impact on the Guidelines calculation, and we need not reach them here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b994-6\">.
