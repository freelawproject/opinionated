An adverse credibility finding must be supported by a \u201clegitimate articulable basis to question the petitioner\u2019s credibility, and ... [a] cogent reason for any stated disbelief.\u201d <em>Yan Xia Zhu v. Mukasey, </em>537 F.3d 1034, 1038 (9th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>341 F.3d 1015, 1022 (9th Cir.2003)). More particularly, because this is a pre-REAL ID Act case, \u201c[i]t is well settled in our circuit that minor inconsistencies that do not go to the heart of an applicant\u2019s claim for asylum cannot support an adverse credibility determination.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Zhu, </em>537 F.3d at 1038-39 (quoting <em>Kaur v. Gonzales, </em>418 F.3d 1061, 1064 (9th Cir.2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-15\">The Immigration Judge\u2019s (IJ) reliance on Ban Htoi\u2019s delay in referencing the rapes as a basis for the adverse credibility finding is at odds with our circuit precedent. We have held that \u201ccultural reluctance\u201d is a \u201ccompelling explanation\u201d for a woman\u2019s \u201cfailure to mention her rape at an earlier time in the [immigration] proceedings.\u201d <em>Mousa v. Mukasey, </em>530 F.3d 1025, 1027-28 (9th Cir.2008) (\u201cThat Mousa, a Chaldean Christian woman from Iraq, was not forthcoming with details about her rape is hardly an irreconcilable problem with her asylum application.\u201d); <em>see also Paramasamy v. Ashcroft, </em>295 F.3d 1047, 1053 (9th Cir.2002) (\u201cParamasamy provided a strong, unrebutted explanation for her reluctance to reveal details \u2014 her cultural reluctance to tell male interviewers that she had been violated.\u201d). Ban Htoi\u2019s failure to mention her rapes during the early stages of her immigration proceedings cannot form the basis of an adverse credibility finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-16\">Because there was no inconsistency in Ban Htoi\u2019s testimony regarding her husband, and the remainder of the justifications for the adverse credibility finding did not go to the \u201cheart\u201d of Ban Htoi\u2019s claim for asylum, the adverse credibility finding was not supported by substantial evidence. We grant the petition for review and re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>mand to the BIA for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Because we reverse on the adverse credibility finding, the BIA must consider the merits of Ban Htoi\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b571-12\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b571-13\">. Because petitioner filed her asylum application \"before May 5, 2005, the provision of the REAL ID Act providing that an adverse credibility finding may be supported by minor inconsistencies does not apply.\" <em>Zhu, </em>537 F.3d at 1039 n. 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
