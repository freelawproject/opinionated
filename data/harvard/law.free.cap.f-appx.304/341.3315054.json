Gomez did not attend her deportation hearing on December 8,1987 at which her attorney withdrew her asylum application and requested voluntary departure. She maintains that she had reasonable cause for not attending the hearing in that notice was sent to her attorney and not her and she had no knowledge of the hearing. The immigration judge and the Board of Immigration Appeals found that notice to the attorney of record constitutes sufficient notice to the respondent and that, in this case, a claim of reasonable cause for failure to appear requires a showing of insufficient assistance of counsel. We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-14\">Gomez contends that the BIA required her to meet the wrong standard for reopening a hearing at which she failed to appear. Gomez asserts the BIA required her to show exceptional circumstances in order to excuse her failure to appear instead of the appropriate standard in effect at the time of her deportation hearing of not having been given a \u201creasonable opportunity to be present\u201d or of showing a \u201creasonable cause for her absence.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nothing in the BIA\u2019s decision, however, indicates that it applied the exceptional circumstances standard. Instead, the BIA ruled that Gomez had proper notice through her counsel and that the IJ properly construed Gomez\u2019s claim that she did not have personal knowledge of the hearing as a claim that her counsel was ineffective for not telling her about the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-15\">Gomez made no showing that she did not have a reasonable opportunity to attend the hearing. She argues that, even with notice to counsel, her alleged actual ignorance of the hearing provides reasonable cause for her absence. But the import of the rule that notice to the respondent\u2019s attorney in an immigration proceeding constitutes notice to the respondent <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> means that, as a matter of law, Gomez was treated as having notice through counsel. It was therefore not an abuse of discretion for the BIA to decide that Gomez was not denied a reasonable opportunity to attend the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>Gomez also asserts that she had reasonable cause for failing to attend based on not knowing about the hearing. However, notice was given to her attorney, legally satisfying notice to her. The only reason, then, that she did not know of the hearing was that her attorney did not tell her. Accordingly, the IJ and the BIA construed Gomez\u2019s reasonable cause claim to require a showing of ineffective assistance of counsel, as set out in <em>In re Lozada</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>as the basis for reopening immigration proceedings. Gomez, however, did not satisfy the procedural prerequisites for raising an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, the BIA did not abuse its discretion by rejecting Gomez\u2019s motion to reopen. Petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b366-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
