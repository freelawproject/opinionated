He appeals his sentence on several grounds. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">1. We review a district court\u2019s sentencing decision for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Carty, </em>520 F.3d 984, 993 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc) (citing <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2459, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)). A sentence is unreasonable if the court commits procedural error, such as basing its sentencing determination on \u201cclearly erroneous facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We conclude, however, that the court\u2019s comments at issue in this appeal did not constitute factual findings, and, therefore, that it did not commit procedural error by basing its sentence on erroneous facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-13\">We also conclude that the district court did not impermissibly base its sentencing determination on Aguilar\u2019s constitutionally protected practices and beliefs. Indeed, Aguilar requested the court to consider his family relationships in the United States as a part of its sentencing determination. Further, Aguilar failed to present any evidence that the district court considered Aguilar\u2019s religious beliefs in making its determination. Therefore, we reject Aguilar\u2019s challenge to the reasonableness of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-14\">2. Next, Aguilar argues that the statute under which he was sentenced, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b), is unconstitutional because it permits a court to increase the statutory maximum sentence based on a judge\u2019s finding of a prior conviction. This argument, however, is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 239-47, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>See also United States v. Rodriguez-Lara, </em>421 F.3d 932, 949-50 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-15\">3. Aguilar also challenges two conditions imposed upon him as part of his supervised release, arguing that the conditions violate his Fifth Amendment right to be free from forced self-incrimination. Aguilar did not object to the imposition of these conditions at the sentencing hearing, so we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Rodriguez, </em>441 F.3d 767, 772 (9th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 290, 172 L.Ed.2d 212 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">The first condition challenged by Aguilar requires that \u201cwithin 72 hours of release from any custody or any reentry to the United States during the period of Court-ordered supervision, the defendant shall report for instructions to the United States Probation Office.\u201d Aguilar argues that this condition violates his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination because it places him in a \u201cclassic penalty situation\u201d as described in <em>Minnesota v. Murphy, </em>465 U.S. 420, 434-35, 104 S.Ct. 1136, 79 L.Ed.2d 409 (1984). He argues that he is faced with an impermissible choice of either reporting to his probation officer upon reentering the country and thereby incriminating himself in another violation of the illegal reentry statute, or refusing to report and, as a result, facing the possible revocation of his supervised release. His argument, however, is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Rodriguez, </em>441 F.3d at 772. The court did not commit plain error by imposing this condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-18\">Aguilar also argues that a second condition of supervised release, which requires that \u201cthe defendant shall answer truthfully all inquiries by the probation officer and follow the instructions of the probation officer,\u201d presents a similar penalty situation that violates his Fifth Amendment right. In light of our decision in <em>United States v. Abbouchi, </em>502 F.3d 850, 859 (9th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 1462, 170 L.Ed.2d 289 (2008), we conclude that imposition of this condition was not plain error. In <em>Abbouchi, </em>we held that it was premature to decide the defendant\u2019s challenge to the same \u201canswer truthfully all inquiries\u201d condition of supervised release, because \u201c[n]othing prevented] Abbouchi from raising a Fifth Amendment issue should it arise.\u201d We note the apparent tension between <em>Abbouchi </em>and our decision in <em>United States v. Saechao, </em>418 F.3d 1073 (9th Cir.2005). We also believe that the \u201canswer truthfully all inquiries\u201d condition presents a serious constitutional question, but we leave that issue for another day.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b514-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
