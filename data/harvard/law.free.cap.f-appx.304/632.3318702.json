We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1015 (9th Cir.2003), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-19\">We review only Pakpahan\u2019s application for withholding of removal because he voluntarily withdrew his application for asylum and does not challenge the IJ\u2019s determination that he did not establish eligibility for CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-20\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that the single beating Pakpahan suffered did not rise to the level of past persecution. <em>See Prasad v. INS, </em>47 F.3d 336, 339-40 (9th Cir.1995). In addition, even if the disfavored group analysis set forth in <em>Sael v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 922, 927-29 (9th Cir.2004), applies to claims for withholding of removal, Pakpahan failed to demonstrate that it was more likely than not he will be persecuted if he returns to Indonesia. <em>See Hoxha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179, 1184-85 (9th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-21\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b657-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
