Smith mounts three challenges to how the district court used conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>underlying the charged, but later dismissed, drug count to calculate his advisory Sentencing Guidelines range. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Police executed a search warrant and raided Smith\u2019s apartment, storming through the front door as Smith ran out the rear. As police pursued Smith, they observed him toss a flask, later discovered to contain crack cocaine. Inside Smith\u2019s apartment, officers found more crack and a semiautomatic pistol. Smith admitted possessing the crack but denied possessing the pistol, claiming that a friend left it in his apartment and he had no way to dispose of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">A federal grand jury indicted Smith for possessing a firearm as a felon and possessing crack cocaine with intent to distribute. He agreed to plead guilty to the firearm offense in exchange for the government dismissing the drug count. At sentencing, the district court \u2014 noting that Smith admitted possessing at least 10 grams of crack with an intent to distribute \u2014 found that Smith possessed both the firearm and the crack, but declined to find that Smith used the firearm in connection with drug trafficking.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">Smith faced a 37-to-46-month Guidelines range on the firearm offense, a range the district court worried did not adequately account for Smith\u2019s admitted involvement in drug activity. Had Smith been convicted of the drug offense, the district court noted, \u201che would have been looking at [a] 60 month minimum.\u201d Attentive to this disparity between the advisory Guidelines range that Smith\u2019s plea yielded and the range that would have applied to his admitted drug possession, the district court informed Smith that it intended to impose a sentence above the advisory range. The court then postponed sentencing to give Smith an opportunity to evaluate whether to withdraw his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">Smith adhered to his guilty plea, and the district court sentenced him \u201cas if he were found guilty of the drug offense,\u201d imposing 60 months imprisonment with this comment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-10\">[T]he guideline range ... is 70 to 87 months if he just takes the drug charge, no gun enhancement, and the quantity\u2014 and give him three points off for acceptance [of responsibility]. So it\u2019s 70-87 months. I think I should at least, in fairness, ... impose a sentence at the bottom of what the guideline range is for the amount of drugs that he had after giving him acceptance of responsibility, which would be 60 months incarceration. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-11\">Smith timely appealed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-13\">Smith urges us to remand for resentencing, arguing that the district court committed a significant procedural error by failing to properly calculate the Guidelines range that would have applied to the dismissed drug count. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). According to Smith, that range should have been scored at 57-to-71 months, not the 70-to-87 months that the district court referenced. This argument carries no weight because <em>Gall </em>only requires \u201ca district court [to] begin all sentencing proceedings by correctly calculating the <em>applicable </em>Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 596 (emphasis added). Smith admits that the district court correctly calculated the applicable range for the firearm offense to which Smith pleaded guilty. The district court then properly exercised its discretion to select a longer sentence that accounted for the conduct underlying the dismissed drug count. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>Smith therefore lacks a valid argument for procedural error.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">We note, as Smith concedes, that the district court intended to \u201cimpose a sentence at the bottom of what the guideline range\u201d would have been for the dismissed drug offense. His 60-month sentence falls just 3 months short of the bottom of the 57-to-71 range that Smith insists <em>would </em>have applied to the drug offense, meaning that even under Smith\u2019s theory, the sentence fits.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Smith\u2019s brief also advanced a Sixth Amendment right-to-trial-by-jury challenge, contending that the district court impermissibly relied upon the conduct underlying the dismissed drug count to calculate his advisory Guidelines range. At oral argument, however, Smith withdrew this argument and conceded that our decision in <em>United States v. Conway, </em>513 F.3d 640 (6th Cir.2008), remains good law and allows district courts to consider dismissed conduct in calculating an advisory Guidelines range. <em>Id. </em>at 645. This concession resolves Smith\u2019s jury-trial-right claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">Smith\u2019s concession also resolves his final argument \u2014 that the district court erred by characterizing his drug possession as \u201crelevant conduct,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6B1.2, after it already found that he did not possess the firearm \u201cin connection with\u201d drug-trafficking, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6). Smith admits that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.21, which allows courts to \u201cdepart upward to reflect the actual seriousness of the offense based on conduct ... underlying a charge dismissed as part of a plea agreement,\u201d compels affirming his sentence unless courts invalidate \u00a7 5K2.21 on Sixth-Amendment grounds. But Smith\u2019s concession at oral argument \u2014 that <em>Conway </em>permits a district court to use dismissed conduct when calculating an advisory Guidelines range, 513 F.3d at 645 \u2014 forecloses this Sixth Amendment challenge. The district court thus properly viewed the drug possession as relevant conduct for sentencing purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">We affirm the district court\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
