He was sentenced to 121 months of imprisonment and five years of supervised release. Henderson argues, pursuant to <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>that his within-guidelines sentence was unreasonable because the Sentencing Guidelines created an unjust disparity between crack and powder cocaine. <em>See </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 575, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007) (holding that it is not an abuse of discretion for a district judge to make a downward departure from the Guidelines based on the crack/powder disparity). Because Henderson did not challenge the substantive reasonableness of his sentence in the district court on this basis, this issue is reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">Under plain error review, Henderson must show that the district court would have given him a lighter sentence if he had been sentenced with the benefit of <em>Kimbrough. Cf. id. </em>at 521 (holding that under plain error review the burden is on the defendant to show that an alleged error necessarily influenced the outcome of the district court proceedings). The sentencing record does not support such a conclusion. Rather, the record indicates that Henderson\u2019s 121-month sentence was based on the 120-month statutory mandatory minimum sentence for his crime. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)(iii). The district court did not express any indication that it felt restrained by the yet-to-be-amended crack cocaine guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c), in sentencing Henderson. <em>Cf. United States v. Burns, </em>526 F.3d 852, 861-62 (5th Cir.2008) (vacating a <em>pre-Kimbrough </em>sentence where the crack/powder disparity was raised at sentencing, but the judge felt he lacked the discretion to make a downward departure from the Guidelines based on that disparity). Consequently, Henderson has not shown that his substantial rights were affected by the <em>pre-Kimbrough </em>sentencing, and he therefore has not shown reversible plain error. <em>See Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 521.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b351-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
