Martin\u2019s causes of actions and allegations are more fully set forth in the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>Court\u2019s opinion reported at <em>Martin v. Delaware Law School, et al., </em>625 F.Supp. 1288 (D.Del.1985). Judgment was eventually entered against Martin, and we affirmed that judgment on August 14, 1989. <em>See </em>C.A. No. 88-3428. Martin returned to the District Court in January 1993 with a motion filed under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(4), wherein he argued, among other things, that the action should be reopened because the District Court judge failed to recuse himself despite his past involvement with the Delaware Law School. The District Court denied Martin\u2019s motion in an order entered on May 10,1993, and we summarily affirmed that decision on December 20, 1993. <em>See </em>C.A. No. 93-7401.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">Martin returned to the District Court yet a second time on July 24, 2007, once again seeking to have the underlying action reopened. This time Martin argued that reopening was warranted under either Rule 60(b)(4), (5) or (6). While it is less than clear, it appears that the impetus behind Martin\u2019s latest effort to reopen stems from his actions on May 24, 2007, at which time he sought, but was refused, a renewal of his driver\u2019s license from the Delaware Division of Motor Vehicles (\u201cDMV\u201d). Martin asserts that the problem he experienced at the DMV is a result of the \u201cdocumented misconduct of the parties to this case,\u201d which, Martin claims, has not been \u201ccorrected despite the passage of more than twenty-five (25) years.\u201d <em>See </em>Motion to Reopen at 1-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Martin\u2019s Reopen Motion fared no better than his first one. In a Memorandum Opinion entered on June 6, 2008, 2008 WL 2358686, the District Court concluded that the grounds asserted in Martin\u2019s motion were nothing more than a \u201clegally frivolous attack\u201d on the decisions of the District Court judge who originally heard the case and disposed of the initial reopen motion filed in 1993. Moreover, the District Court concluded that the motion was \u201cbrought well beyond the bounds of the \u2018reasonable time\u2019 requirement imposed by Rule 60(c).\u201d <em>See </em>District Court Mem. Opin. at 2. To the extent Martin intended to rely on Rule 60(b)(4) in an attempt to avoid a timeliness problem, the District Court concluded that Martin\u2019s efforts proved unsuccessful under the circumstances presented, i.e., where he was using Rule 60(b) merely as a mechanism to \u201cwast[e] the judicial system\u2019s time and resources with successive motions arguing identical issues.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3. Accordingly, the District Court issued an Order denying Martin\u2019s motion to reopen. A subsequent order was entered denying Martin\u2019s request seeking reconsideration of that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">This timely appeal followed. We have jurisdiction over the instant appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and review the District Court\u2019s orders denying Martin\u2019s motions filed under Rule 60(b) and Rule 59(e) for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Brown v. Phila. Hous. Auth., </em>350 F.3d 338, 342 (3d Cir.2003); <em>Max\u2019s Seafood Caf\u00e9 v. Quinteros, </em>176 F.3d 669, 673 (3d Cir. 1999). Martin has filed a motion asking us to summarily reverse the District Court\u2019s decision to deny him relief in accordance with Rule 60(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">Summary action is warranted if an appeal presents no substantial question. <em>See </em>Third Circuit LAR 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6. While we agree with Martin\u2019s general contention that this appeal is appropriate for summary disposition, we do not agree that such action is warranted in favor of a summary reversal of the District Court\u2019s post-judgment decision. Rather, after careful review of the record in this case together with Martin\u2019s submissions, and for essentially the same reasons set forth by the District Court, we will summarily affirm its denial of Rule 60(b) relief. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>do not hesitate to conclude \u2014 and do so without further discussion \u2014 that the District Court acted within its discretion in denying Martin\u2019s post-judgment motion. Martin\u2019s motion for recusal is denied as moot. None of the circuit judges he seeks to have recused are members of the panel that entertained this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
