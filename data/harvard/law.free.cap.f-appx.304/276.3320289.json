Boone filed his \u00a7 1983 complaint following the dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 application as time-barred. Boone argues that the time limitations period set forth in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d) is unconstitutional because it prevents him from petitioning the Government for a redress of grievances.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-20\">We review a dismissal as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A for abuse of discretion. <em>Martin v. Scott, </em>156 F.3d 578, 580 (5th Cir.1998). A dismissal for failure to state a claim under \u00a7 1915A is reviewed under the same de novo standard as dismissals under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). <em>Bazrowx v. Scott, </em>136 F.3d 1053, 1054 (5th Cir.1998). Because the district court found that Boone\u2019s complaint was both frivolous and failed to state a claim, review is de novo. <em>See Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-21\">Despite Boone\u2019s argument to the contrary, he is making a Suspension Clause argument. Boone\u2019s argument is unavailing. The limitations period found in \u00a7 2244(d) does not unconstitutionally suspend the writ. <em>See Turner v. Johnson, </em>177 F.3d 390, 392-93 (5th Cir.1999); <em>Molo v. Johnson, </em>207 F.3d 773, 775 (5th Cir. 2000). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed. Our affirmance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>of the district court\u2019s dismissal counts as one strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Boone is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes, he will no longer be allowed to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is detained or incarcerated in any facility unless he is in imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">AFFIRMED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b300-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
