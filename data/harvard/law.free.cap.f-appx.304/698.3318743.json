We dismiss in part, and affirm in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-24\">Plaintiff Leonard Baldauf, a prisoner of the State of Colorado appearing pro se, brought suit under \u00a7 1983, alleging that his constitutional rights had been violated. Initially, the district court dismissed the complaint, in part for lack of jurisdiction under the <em>Heck </em>doctrine, <em>see Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). R., Doc. 30, at 6-7, Doc. 32. Plaintiff appealed, and we remanded for the district court to conduct additional proceedings to resolve whether it had jurisdiction. <em>Baldauf v. Hyatt, </em>120 Fed.Appx. 288 (10th Cir.2005). On remand, the district court concluded that it did have jurisdiction to proceed, <em>see </em>R., Docs. 71, 75, and, on defendants\u2019 renewed motion to dismiss, dismissed all of plaintiffs claims on the merits except for his first claim for relief against defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>Fahey, Hyatt, other unnamed officers, Carreras, Davis, Fulton, Maestas, Garcia, and Archuleta, <em>id., </em>Doc. 92, at 10-13, Doc. 103, at 3. We dismissed plaintiffs interlocutory appeal from the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">Proceedings then continued in the district court on plaintiffs remaining claim against the remaining parties. The district court granted plaintiffs motion for appointment of counsel. <em>Id., </em>Doc. 130. After some discovery, defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. <em>Id., </em>Doc. 146. Plaintiffs counsel filed a brief in response, <em>id., </em>Doc. 153, but failed to object to the magistrate judge\u2019s subsequent recommendation to grant summary judgment, <em>id., </em>Doc. 161. The district court adopted the recommendation on January 31, 2008, 2008 WL 280839, <em>id., </em>Doc. 162, and entered judgment on February 21, 2008, <em>id., </em>Doc. 163.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">On March 11, 2008, plaintiffs counsel filed a motion for relief, arguing that his failure to file objections was due to excusable neglect because he did not receive the order referring the matter to the magistrate judge or the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation. <em>Id., </em>Doc. 167. The district court considered the motion for relief under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b), but denied it on April 8, 2008, 2008 WL 961572, because counsel had admitted that his office had had problems in the past receiving court filings through the electronic case management system, including in this case; because counsel did not move for relief promptly upon receiving the district court\u2019s January 31 order adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation; and because counsel \u201cfailed to present any argument suggesting that plaintiff may have one or more meritorious objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation.\u201d R., Doc. 176, at 2-3. The district court reasoned that counsel should have been more vigilant. <em>Id. </em>at 3. Plaintiff filed this appeal pro se, designating the order granting summary judgment and the order denying relief from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">We lack jurisdiction over the order granting summary judgment because plaintiffs notice of appeal was untimely as to that order. The judgment was entered on February 21, 2008. <em>See id., </em>Doc. 163. Plaintiff filed his notice of appeal on April 28, 2008, <em>see id., </em>Doc. 177, more than thirty days after the judgment was entered, and the notice of appeal was therefore untimely. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A). His motion for relief was not filed within ten days of the judgment, so it did not toll the time to file an appeal. <em>See </em>Rule 4(a)(4)(A)(vi). To the extent that plaintiff challenges the grant of summary judgment, we dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">We have jurisdiction to review the denial of plaintiffs motion for relief because plaintiffs April 28, 2008, notice of appeal was filed within thirty days of the district court\u2019s April 8, 2008, order denying that motion. <em>See </em>Rule 4(a)(1)(A). Plaintiff raises no arguments as to the denial of his motion for relief, however; all of his arguments on appeal relate to the grant of summary judgment. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s denial of the motion for relief without further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">The appeal is DISMISSED in part and the judgment of the district court is otherwise AFFIRMED. Appellant\u2019s motion for leave to proceed in this court without prepayment of costs and fees is DENIED. Appellant shall pay the fees within thirty days of the date of this order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b723-16\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
