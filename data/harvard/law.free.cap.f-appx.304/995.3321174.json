Branch pleaded guilty to a one-count information charging him with possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), and was sentenced to 210 months incarceration, fees and fines of $1,500, and three years of supervised release. Branch raises two contentions on appeal: (1) the District Court, by misappreciating the advisory nature of the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 100:1 crack/powder cocaine disparity, imposed an unreasonable sentence, and (2) the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 career offender enhancement was improperly applied because his violation of Pennsylvania\u2019s reckless endangerment statute does not qualify as a predicate \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1021-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-5\">Branch contends the District Court failed to recognize its <em>post-Booker </em>sentencing discretion with regard to the Guidelines\u2019 100:1 crack/powder cocaine disparity when it refused to grant his request for a downward variance. He further contends this refusal rendered his sentence longer than necessary to \u201cpromote the purposes of sentencing under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2).\u201d Appellant Br. 17. We review a sentencing court\u2019s decision for reasonableness under a two-step analysis, <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), and apply an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>United States v. Wise, </em>515 F.3d 207, 217 (3d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-8\">In the first step of our analysis, we must \u201censure that the district court committed no significant procedural error in arriving at its decision, \u2018such as ... treating the Guidelines as mandatory.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 217 (quoting <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597). In <em>United States v. Gunter, </em>we recognized \u201ca sentencing court errs when it believes that it has no discretion to consider the crack/powder cocaine differential incorporated in the Guidelines ... as simply advisory.\u201d 462 F.3d 237, 249 (3d Cir.2006). Our view of the advisory nature of the crack/powder disparity was later endorsed by the Supreme Court in <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 575, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007) (deciding \u201cit would not be an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude ... that the crack/powder disparity yields a sentence \u2018greater than necessary1 to achieve \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s purposes\u201d). If we determine a sentencing court \u201cbelieved it was bound to follow the Guidelines for crack offenses,\u201d we will vacate the defendant\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing. <em>Wise, </em>515 F.3d at 222. However, \u201cthe District Court is under no obligation to impose a sentence below the applicable Guidelines range solely on the basis of the crack/powder cocaine differential.\u201d <em>Gunter, </em>462 F.3d at 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-14\">There is ample proof the District Court fully appreciated its freedom to consider the crack/powder disparity when imposing the sentence. During sentencing, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1021-15\">[W]ith respect to your objection specifically to the disparity and treatment between cocaine and cocaine base, the court, this court believes it is bound by the Third Circuit precedent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1021-16\">The Third Circuit has spoken to this issue several times, and <em>although it is within the court\u2019s discretion to take the disparity into consideration, </em>the court will decline to stray from that Third Circuit precedent. I refer counsel to the Third Circuit\u2019s most recent decision in <em>United States v. Scott, </em>[178 Fed.Appx. 140 (3d Cir.2006) ], which is a 2006 case, and to <em>United States v. Watkins, </em>[66 Fed.Appx. 325 (3d Cir.2003) ], which is a 2003 Third Circuit decision ... and to <em>United States v. Frazier </em>[981 F.2d 92 (3d Cir.1992) ], which is a 1992 Third Circuit decision, and for all of those reasons the objection to that disparity is overruled, or rejected.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1021-17\">(App.32-33) (emphasis added). This statement clearly demonstrates the court\u2019s recognition of its discretion to factor the crack/powder disparity into its sentencing decision. Additionally, because the disparity does not create an \u201cobligation to impose a [lower] sentence,\u201d <em>Gunter, </em>462 F.3d at 249, our conclusion is not altered by the District Court\u2019s refusal to grant Branch\u2019s request.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As in <em>Wise, </em>\u201cthere is simply no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>indication that the District Court believed it lacked authority to consider the crack/powder cocaine disparity as part of its \u00a7 3553(a) analysis.\u201d <em>Wise, </em>515 F.3d at 222. Accordingly, we find no procedural error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-4\">In the second step of our analysis, we review for substantive reasonableness: a sentence must be \u201cpremised upon appropriate and judicious consideration of the relevant [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) ] factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Schweitzer, </em>454 F.3d 197, 204 (3d Cir.2006). This step is deferential, and \u201c[a]s long as a sentence falls within the broad range of possible sentences that can be considered reasonable in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we must affirm.\u201d <em>Wise, </em>515 F.3d at 218.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">During sentencing, the District Court determined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-6\">[i]t is clear to the court that the defendant has been undeterred by prior terms of imprisonment, and unfortunately there exists a strong likelihood of recidivism. In light of these facts the court finds that a sentence in the mid range of the guidelines is appropriate to meet sentencing objectives ... in light of all the considerations set forth in Section 3553(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1022-7\">App. 42-43. Based on this statement by the District Court, and our recognition that the trial court is \u201cin the best position to determine the appropriate sentence,\u201d <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>437 F.3d 324, 330 (3d Cir.2006), we find Branch\u2019s sentence to be substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-11\">In the second issue on appeal, Branch contends the District Court erred by applying a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 career offender enhancement. To qualify for the enhancement, \u00a7 4B1.1 requires the defendant to have \u201cat least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(a)(3). According to Branch, his conviction for recklessly endangering another person in violation of Pennsylvania statute 18 P.S. \u00a7 2705 is not a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d and, therefore, the \u00a7 4B1.1 career offender enhancement does not apply. Because \u201c[t]he proper construction of the term \u2018crime of violence\u2019 is a question of law, ... our review is plenary.\u201d <em>United States v. McQuilkin, </em>97 F.3d 723, 727 (3d Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-12\">The term \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is defined in \u00a7 4B1.2(a) and the attendant Application Notes. Application Note 1 categorizes offenses as \u201ccrimes of violence\u201d if, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthe conduct set forth in the count of which the defendant was convicted ... by its nature, presented a <em>serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2 Application Note 1 (emphasis added). This definition closely parallels the language of Pennsylvania\u2019s reckless endangerment statute, which defines the offense as \u201crecklessly engaging] in conduct which places or may place an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>other person in danger of death or serious bodily injury.\u201d 18 P.S. \u00a7 2705. Where language of the criminal statute under which the defendant was previously convicted \u201cso closely tracks the language of the Guideline that the defendant\u2019s conviction <em>necessarily </em>meets the Guideline standard, the district court need look no further than the statute and need not inquire into the underlying conduct charged.\u201d <em>United States v. Parson, </em>955 F.2d 858, 872 (3d Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">In violating Pennsylvania\u2019s reckless endangerment statute, Branch \u201crecklessly ... place[d] or may have place[d] another person in danger of death or serious bodily injury.\u201d 18 P.S. \u00a7 2705. Looking no further than the words of the Pennsylvania statute, <em>Parson, </em>955 F.2d at 872, such conduct \u201cpresent[s] a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2 Application Note 1; <em>see also Parson, </em>955 F.2d at 874 (holding violation of Delaware\u2019s reckless endangerment statute constitutes \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 4B1.1). Accordingly, Branch\u2019s violation of 18 P.S. \u00a7 2705 was a crime of violence, and the career offender enhancement was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-7\">Finding no error, we will affirm the judgment of conviction and sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1020-21\">. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1021-11\">. Branch argues the court\u2019s statement that it was \u201cbound by ... Third Circuit precedent,\" indicates a failure to appreciate its authority to consider the crack/powder cocaine dispari<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>ty in fashioning his sentence. This argument is without merit. First, this reading of the court's statement squarely contradicts the court\u2019s unequivocal recognition of its \"discretion to take the disparity into consideration.\u201d App. 32. Second, the court referred specifically to three decisions of this court, none of which suggest the Guidelines are mandatory: <em>Frazier </em>stands for the uncontroversial proposition that the crack/powder disparity is not unconstitutional, 981 F.2d at 96, and <em>Watkins, </em>a non-precedential decision, simply reaffirmed <em>Frazier. </em>66 Fed.Appx. at 326. <em>Scott, </em>another non-precedential decision, echoed <em>Gunter </em>by holding a sentencing court is not <em>required </em>to give a non-Guideline sentence because of the crack/powder cocaine disparity. 178 Fed.Appx. at 145. Because nothing in these decisions suggests mandatory adherence to the Guidelines, we reject Branch\u2019s interpretation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
