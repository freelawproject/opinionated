For the reasons that follow, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-18\">We need not recite a detailed factual or procedural history because we write primarily for the parties who are already familiar with this case. Stephen Puza (\u201cPuza\u201d) committed suicide while in the custody of Lansford Pennsylvania Police at the Carbon County jail. The plaintiffs brought a \u00a7 1983 action against Carbon County and several individual correction officers, and a negligence action against the jail\u2019s architects.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-19\">Appellants make several arguments on appeal. However, the main issue is whether the district court correctly concluded that there was no genuine issue of material fact and that the defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Our review is plenary. <em>Kaucher v. County of Bucks, </em>455 F.3d 418, 422 (3d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-20\">In order to survive summary judgment with regard to the individual defendants, a plaintiff must present evidence that would allow a rational fact finder to conclude, \u201c(1) the detainee had a \u2018particular vulnerability to suicide,\u2019 (2) the custodial officer or officers knew or should have known of that vulnerability, and (3) those officers \u2018acted with reckless indifference\u2019 to the detainee\u2019s particular vulnerability.\u201d <em>Woloszyn v. County of Lawrence, </em>396 F.3d 314, 319 (3d Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Colburn v. Upper Darby Twp., </em>946 F.2d 1017, 1023 (3d Cir.1991) <em>(\u201cColburn II\u201d)).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b72-21\">The district court granted summary judgment to the individual correction officers because the plaintiffs failed to present evidence of their subjective appreciation of a particular vulnerability to suicide. 586 F.Supp.2d at 280-81. The particular vulnerability \u201cspeaks to the degree of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>risk inherent in the detainee\u2019s condition____ [T]here must be a strong likelihood, rather than a mere possibility, that self-inflicted harm will occur.\u201d <em>Colburn II, </em>946 F.2d at 1024 (citation and internal quotations omitted). Plaintiffs point to Puza\u2019s erratic mood swings, his intoxication, and the circumstances that resulted in his arrest in arguing that they have produced evidence of the strong likelihood that Puza intended to harm himself. However, those circumstances \u2014 while prophetic in hindsight \u2014 suggest only the \u201cmere possibility\u201d that Puza posed a suicide risk. <em>See Woloszyn, </em>396 F.3d at 322-23 (finding no genuine issue of material fact as to whether a pre-trial detainee had a particular vulnerability to suicide, despite the detainee\u2019s intoxication, fluctuating mood, and reported distress about his family situation). <em>See also Colburn II, </em>946 F.2d at 1026-27 (holding that intoxication does not create an issue of material fact regarding a particular risk of suicide).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Appellants also argue that the testimony of Officers Gablick and Peck raise a disputed factual issue that should have precluded summary judgment. Estate\u2019s Br. at 21-22. That argument is similarly without merit. The district court realized that the issue of whether Officer Gablick informed Officer Peck that Puza\u2019s mood was erratic and that Puza had been drinking is immaterial because Puza\u2019s conduct was simply insufficient to establish a strong likelihood that he would harm himself. Although we are not unsympathetic to this very tragic incident, the law is clear that the evidence that plaintiffs produced was not sufficient to defeat the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">Moreover, even if plaintiffs could satisfy the first requirement for their cause of action under \u00a7 1983, we agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that the record would still not support a finding that the correction officers \u201cknew or should have known\u201d of Puza\u2019s risk of suicide. <em>See </em>586 F.Supp.2d at 278-81. Plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the officers <em>should have known </em>of Puza\u2019s intent to kill himself is not convincing because the record does not establish that the \u201cstrong likelihood of suicide [was] so obvious that a lay person would easily recognize the necessity for preventative action.\u201d <em>Colburn II, </em>946 F.2d at 1025 (citation and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">A municipality is liable under \u00a7 1983 \u201cwhen execution of a government\u2019s policy or custom ... inflicts the injury....\u201d <em>Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Social Servs., </em>436 U.S. 658, 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978). However, the district court correctly concluded that the conclusory statements in plaintiffs\u2019 expert\u2019s report were insufficient to establish the deliberate indifference of Carbon County. <em>See Woloszyn, </em>396 F.3d at 325.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-11\">We also conclude that the district court was correct in holding that plaintiffs did not establish that CRA had a clear duty to prevent Puza\u2019s suicide. 586 F.Supp.2d at 274-77. Without a clear duty or special relationship, the general rule under Pennsylvania law is that \u201cliability cannot be imposed upon third parties for another\u2019s suicide.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 274 (citing <em>McPeake v. Cannon, </em>381 Pa.Super. 227, 553 A.2d 439, 440-41 (1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-13\">For all of the above reasons, we will affirm the order of the district court granting summary judgment to the defendants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
