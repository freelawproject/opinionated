In a criminal case, a notice of appeal must be filed within ten days after the order appealed from is entered. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A). However, with or without a motion, the district court may extend the time to file a notice of appeal for an additional thirty days upon a finding of excusable neglect or good cause. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4); <em>United States v. Reyes, </em>759 F.2d 351, 353 (4th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">While the district court dismissed Lewis\u2019 motion for sentence reduction on March 12, 2008, the district court identified March 22, 2008, as the \u201ceffective date\u201d of the order. On April 21, 2008, Lewis filed a notice of appeal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> While the notice of appeal was filed after the ten-day appeal period expired, it was filed within the thirty-day excusable neglect period. Therefore, we remand the case to the district court for a determination as to whether Lewis has shown excusable neglect or good cause warranting an extension of the appeal period. The record, as supplemented, will then be returned to this court for further consideration. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">\n<em>REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b236-24\"> <em>See Houston v.
