MURPHY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b710-27\">Defendant-appellant Gregory E. Graham, a federal prisoner proceeding pro se, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion filed pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to modify his sentence based on Amendment 706 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cGuidelines\u201d). Mr. Graham may not seek a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c), however, because his sentence was part of a plea agreement specifying a term of imprisonment pursuant to Rule 11(c)(1)(C) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Accordingly, his case is remanded to the district court with instructions to dismiss his motion for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">The facts leading to Mr. Graham\u2019s arrest and eventual plea agreement are described in his direct criminal appeal. <em>United States v. Graham, </em>466 F.3d 1234, 1235-37 (10th Cir.2006). Therefore, we provide only a brief background to frame the issues presented in the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">Mr. Graham and several others were charged with conspiracy to possess and distribute more than 1.5 kilograms of cocaine base (Count 1), and Mr. Graham was also charged with distribution of 7.1 grams of cocaine base (Count 5). The case proceeded to trial. After six days, during which almost all of the government\u2019s evidence was presented, Mr. Graham decided to enter a guilty plea to Count 5\u2014the distribution charge\u2014by entering an oral plea agreement that included a stipulated twenty-five year sentence. <em>See id. </em>at 1235. His conviction and sentence were affirmed on appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 1241.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">Thereafter, Mr. Graham filed a motion to reduce his sentence. The district court denied the motion, concluding that the amount of crack cocaine attributable to Mr. Graham made him ineligible for relief under Amendment 706. Mr. Graham appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-11\">\n<em>Legal Standards and Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b711-12\">This court has jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s denial of Mr. Graham\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c) motion. <em>United States v. Trujeque, </em>100 F.3d 869, 870-71 (10th Cir.1996) (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291). \u201cWe review de novo the district court\u2019s interpretation of a statute or the sentencing guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Smartt, </em>129 F.3d 539, 540 (10th Cir.1997) (quotation omitted). We construe liberally pleadings filed by pro se litigants. <em>Hall v. Bellmon, </em>935 F.2d 1106, 1110 (10th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-13\">Mr. Graham filed his motion for sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on Amendment 706 to the Guidelines. \u201cThe Guidelines, through Amendment 706, generally adjust downward by two levels the base offense level assigned to quantities of crack cocaine. Amendment 706 took effect November 1, 2007 and was made retroactive as of March 3, 2008.\u201d <em>United States v. Sharkey, </em>543 F.3d 1236, 1237 (10th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-14\">When, as here, a \u201cmotion for sentence reduction is not a direct appeal or a collateral attack under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, the viability of [the] motion depends entirely on 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c).\u201d <em>Smartt, </em>129 F.3d at 540 (quotation and brackets omitted). Section 3582(c) provides that a district court \u201cmay not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed,\u201d unless the request falls within one of three exceptions. \u00a7 3582(c). The first exception requires that the Director of the Bureau of Prisons file the motion based on specified conditions. \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(A). Second, \u201cthe court may modify an imposed term of im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>prisonment to the extent otherwise expressly permitted by statute or by Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\u201d \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(B). The third exception applies to \u201ca defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">Section 3582(c) does not apply to Mr. Graham. First, the motion to reduce his sentence was not filed by the Director of the Bureau of Prisons. Second, he is not eligible for relief \u201cexpressly permitted by statute\u201d or by Rule 35. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 35 (stating relief available to correct clear error within seven days after sentencing, or upon motion filed by the government). Finally, because Mr. Graham\u2019s sentence was stipulated to be twenty-five years under the terms of the plea agreement, pursuant to Rule 11(c)(1)(C), his sentence was not \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission,\u201d \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Consequently, the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider the motion and should have dismissed it \u201cwithout considering its merits.\u201d <em>Trujeque, </em>100 F.3d at 871.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">The district court was without jurisdiction to consider Mr. Graham\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, and the motion should have been dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Therefore, this matter is remanded with instructions to dismiss the motion for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b710-15\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
