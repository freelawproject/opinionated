We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the factual and procedural history of the case, though we revisit key portions of that history here.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-17\">On March 30, 2006, the IRS issued an administrative summons to Navarro and his wife<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to obtain information related to his taxable income for 2001 through 2005. <em>See </em>ROA doc. 1, Ex. 1. Navarro failed to comply with the summons, and on January 19, 2007, the government filed a petition to enforce the summons in the District Court. <em>See </em>ROA doc. 1. In an attached declaration, IRS Revenue Officer Terry H. Cox stated that he was conducting an investigation into Navarro\u2019s tax liability, and that he had issued the summons to Navarro to give testimony and to produce books, papers, records, or other data not in possession of the IRS for examination. <em>See </em>ROA doc. 1, Ex. 1. On January 22, 20007, the District Court entered an order, which was then amended on February 15, 2007, directing Navarro to show cause why he should not be compelled to comply with the summons. <em>See </em>ROA doc. 3, 4. Navarro responded to the order by filing a motion to dismiss the petition, in which he argued that the summons violated his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, as well as a motion to quash the summons, in which he argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that the summons was \u201cnot issued in good faith.\u201d ROA doc. 6, 7. On June 4, 2007, following a hearing, the District Court entered an order granting the government\u2019s petition. <em>See </em>ROA doc. 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>On appeal, Navarro argues that the District Court erred by (1) presuming that he is a \u201ctaxpayer\u201d; (2) not allowing him to represent his wife at the hearing as there is no evidence that the Constitution meant for the term \u201ccounsel\u201d to apply only to licensed attorneys; (3) presuming that 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7602 is applicable to the investigation of income tax matters; (4) presuming that \u201cthere was both law and authoritative or legislative regulation\u201d that made him, an \u201cAmerican[] working in the private sector of the American economy, subject to some unstated \u2018income tax\u2019 matters\u201d; (5) failing to answer questions that Navarro put forth to the District Court during the hearing; (6) claiming to be an Article III Court, when the District Court is, according to Navarro, truly an Article IV Court without jurisdiction in this matter; and (7) not making any findings of fact or conclusions of law to deny Navarro\u2019s motions. <em>See </em>Appellant Br. at 8-9. Furthermore, Navarro asserts that \u201cno evidence was produced\u201d to prove that the government has standing to bring this suit, nor that the IRS is an established agency of the government. <em>Id. </em>at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">When reviewing an order enforcing an IRS summons, we review the District Court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its conclusions of law <em>de novo. See Mollison v. United States, </em>481 F.3d 119, 122 (2d Cir.2007) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">The IRS has authority to issue summonses to ascertain the liability \u201cof any person for any internal revenue tax\u201d and to \u201cexamine any books, papers, records, or other data which may be relevant or material to such inquiry.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7602. However, \u201cIRS summonses have no force or effect unless the [IRS] seeks to enforce them through a [26 U.S.C.] \u00a7 7604 proceeding.\u201d <em>Schulz v. Internal Revenue Serv., </em>395 F.3d 463, 464 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">For a District Court to enforce a summons, the IRS must demonstrate that: (1) the summons was issued for a legitimate purpose; (2) the summoned data may be relevant to that purpose; (3) the information is not already in the IRS\u2019s possession; and (4) the administrative procedures required by the Internal Revenue Code for issuance and service have been followed. <em>See United States v. Powell, </em>379 U.S. 48, 57-58, 85 S.Ct. 248, 13 L.Ed.2d 112 (1964). It is well established that an affidavit from a government official, attesting that each of the <em>Powell </em>requirements has been met, is sufficient to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case. <em>See, e.g., Mollison, </em>481 F.3d at 123 (internal citations and quotations omitted). Once the <em>prima facie </em>case is established, \u201cthe burden shifts to the taxpayer to disprove one of the four <em>Powell </em>criteria, or to demonstrate that judicial enforcement would be an abuse of the court\u2019s process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-7\">In the present case, IRS Revenue Officer Cox\u2019s declaration accompanying the petition established a <em>prima facie </em>case for the issuance of the summons. In response, Navarro has offered no evidence to show that the summons was not issued for a legitimate purpose, or that any of the other <em>Powell </em>factors have not been met, or that enforcing the summons would be an abuse of the District Court\u2019s process. Accordingly, he has failed to meet his burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-8\">Navarro\u2019s remaining claims are wholly frivolous, and he provides no valid authority for his contentions and has identified no errors of law or clearly erroneous findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-9\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b934-10\">We reject all of defendant\u2019s claims on appeal. Accordingly, the June 4, 2007 fi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>nal order of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b933-13\">. Navarro's wife filed an appeal from the District Court\u2019s order, which she then withdrew. <em>See </em>U.S.C.A. Dkt. Sht. (No. 07-2711-cv) at 9/14/2007 Entry (Order).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
