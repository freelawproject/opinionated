The first issue is whether the District Court erred in precluding Kamara\u2019s defense of justification. The second issue is whether the District Court erred when it refused to reveal the contents of three jury questions to Kamara. For the reasons discussed below, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-7\">I. <em>Background and Procedural History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b984-8\">Because the facts are well known to the parties, we will discuss them only briefly. A jury empaneled in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania convicted Oumar Kamara of preventing and hampering his departure from the United States. The District Court then imposed a sentence of twenty-four months\u2019 imprisonment, a term of supervised release of three years, a $2,500 fine, and a special assessment of $100.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-9\">Before trial, Kamara indicated his intent to present a justification defense. The government, in response, filed a motion in limine to preclude that defense. The District Court granted the government\u2019s motion. At the close of the first day of trial, just before closing arguments, the District Court informed the parties that it had received three questions from the jury. It did not share the contents with either party; instead, it sealed the questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-10\">II. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b984-11\">The District Court had jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-12\">Kamara first argues that he presented a <em>prima facie </em>showing on justification and was thus entitled to present it to the jury. We will review the District Court\u2019s ruling on Kamara\u2019s use of the justification defense <em>de novo. See United States v. Alston, </em>526 F.3d 91, 93-98 (3d Cir.2008). We will moreover view the evidence in the light most favorable to Kamara. <em>United States v. Paolello, </em>951 F.2d 537, 542 (3d Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b984-13\">To present a justification defense to the jury, a defendant must satisfy four requirements: (1) he was under unlawful and present threat of death or serious bodily injury, (2) he did not recklessly place himself in a situation where he could be forced to engage in criminal conduct, (3) he had no reasonable legal alternative (to both the criminal act and the avoidance of the threatened harm), and (4) there is a direct causal relationship between the criminal action and the avoidance of the threatened harm. <em>Alston, </em>526 F.3d at 95; <em>Paolello, </em>951 F.2d at 540.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-14\">The District Court found that Kamara may have suffered from the Sierra Leone government in the past, but that he had not adduced sufficient evidence that the political climate in Sierra Leone is still in a condition that he would face imminent harm upon his return. We agree with the District Court that Kamara did not adduce sufficient evidence for prong one. The District Court thus did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-15\">Kamara next argues that the District Court\u2019s decision to seal the jury questions deprived him of his due process rights and his rights under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. Three questions are at issue: (1) \u201cIs U.S. Government responsible for the return of your safety to your country?\u201d; (2) \u201cWhat was he convicted of?\u201d; and (3) \u201cWhat is a habeas corpus appeal? Regarding N.Y. Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>decision?\u201d The government concedes that the District Court erred. It, however, argues that the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">A defendant\u2019s constitutional right to be present at every stage of his criminal proceeding is grounded in the Confrontation Clause and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. <em>United States v. Toliver, </em>330 F.3d 607, 611 (3d Cir.2003); <em>see United States v. Gagnon, </em>470 U.S. 522, 526, 105 S.Ct. 1482, 84 L.Ed.2d 486 (1985). The right is also mandated by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 43. <em>Toliver, </em>330 F.3d at 611. The harmless-error standard applies to Rule 43 violations; this standard requires that the \u201cgovernment prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was uninjured by the error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 613. That means that \u201cthere must be \u2018no reasonable possibility5 of prejudice for an error to be deemed harmless.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Alessandrello, </em>637 F.2d 131, 139 (3d Cir.1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">Kamara argues that he was harmed when the District Court withheld question one because the jury concluded that he was not a credible witness. But the District Court did instruct the jury, after telling it that it would not answer the three questions, that \u201c[y]ou are the sole judges of the credibility of each .witness.\u201d We have long \u201cpresum[ed] that juries follow the instructions given by district courts.\u201d <em>United States v. Hakim, </em>344 F.3d 324, 330 (3d Cir.2003) (citing <em>United States v. Newby, </em>11 F.3d 1143, 1147 (3d Cir.1993)). Kamara\u2019s credibility was thus not harmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-7\">Kamara\u2019s arguments for questions two and three also fail. His argument for both of these questions is the same: He was harmed because the jury might have researched the answers to these questions on its own and found prejudicial information. But the District Court twice instructed the jury not to consult outside sources. The jury is, of course, presumed to have not strayed from the District Court\u2019s mandate. <em>See Hakim, </em>344 F.3d at 330. There was no reasonable possibility of prejudice for Kamara. The government therefore carried its burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Kamara was uninjured by the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-9\">III. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b985-10\">For the reasons set forth above, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
