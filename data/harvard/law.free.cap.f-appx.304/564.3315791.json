Because the facts are known to the parties, we will not repeat them here. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Golden Gate Restaurant Ass\u2019n v. City and County of San Francisco, </em>512 F.3d 1112, 1116 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-24\">The district court properly granted summary judgment, as the settlement agreement entered into by the Union on Ramos\u2019s behalf clearly released TCC and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>Bosanko from all claims and causes of action relating to Ramos\u2019s employment. In addition, Ramos cannot establish that the Union acted arbitrarily or in bad faith in accepting the settlement agreement without her consent because she received pay until the end of the contract term and the termination letter was rescinded. Therefore, the settlement agreement bars Ramos\u2019s claims because the Union had authority to enter into the agreement on her behalf, despite her objections thereto. <em>See Shane v. Greyhound Lines, Inc., </em>868 F.2d 1057, 1061 (9th Cir.1989); <em>Mahon v. NLRB, </em>808 F.2d 1342, 1345 (9th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b588-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
