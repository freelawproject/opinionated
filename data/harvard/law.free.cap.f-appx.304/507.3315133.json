We affirm the denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-20\">The ALJ gave specific and legitimate reasons for discounting the limitations identified in the 2004 questionnaire by Dr. Saadi. The ALJ was not required to give Dr. Saadi\u2019s opinion controlling weight because it was not well-supported by objective medical evidence and conflicted with other medical opinions. <em>Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 830 (9th Cir.1995); <em>cf. </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(2) (2007); Soc. Sec. Ruling 96-2p. Since the ALJ found Giordano \u201cnot fully credible,\u201d he was entitled to reject Dr. Saadi\u2019s assessment to the extent that it was based on Giordano\u2019s self-reported limitations. <em>Tommasetti v. Astrue, </em>533 F.3d 1035, 1040-41 (9th Cir.2008). Given that Dr. Saadi identified an onset date of which he had no firsthand knowledge, the ALJ could reasonably infer that Dr. Saadi relied on her subjective complaints when determining other limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-21\">The ALJ\u2019s conclusions were not based on a selective analysis of the record. Rather, the ALJ comprehensively discussed the evidence that supported and undermined Giordano\u2019s claims before mak<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>ing his determinations at each step. Nothing more was required. In evaluating the evidence, the ALJ was not required to discuss every treatment note. <em>Vincent v. Heckler, </em>739 F.2d 1393, 1394-95 (9th Cir. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">The ALJ and Appeals Council did not err in finding any alleged mental-impairment not severe. Giordano failed to meet her burden of proving that her alleged mental impairments \u201csignificantly limit[] [her] physical or mental ability to do basic work activities.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(c) (2007); <em>see also Burch v. Barnhart, </em>400 F.3d 676, 682-83 (9th Cir. 2005). It was not unreasonable for the Appeals Council to accord Dr. Devine\u2019s letter and assessment little weight, since he was not a treating source, <em>see </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d) (2007), and his opinion was unsupported by any objective medical evidence. <em>See Ukolov v. Barnhart, </em>420 F.3d 1002, 1005 (9th Cir.2005) (\u201c[Rjegardless of how many symptoms an individual alleges, or how genuine the individual\u2019s complaints may appear to be, the existence of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment cannot be established in the absence of objective medical abnormalities .... \u201d (alteration in original) (quoting Soc. Sec. Ruling 96-4p)); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1528(a) (2007) (\u201c[Statements alone are not enough to establish that there is a physical or mental impairment.\u201d). The ALJ was not required to undertake a functional assessment of Giordano\u2019s depression since Giordano did not meet her burden of showing a medically determinable impairment at step two. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520a(b) (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">The ALJ gave clear and convincing reasons for rejecting Giordano\u2019s testimony to the extent that her complaints would make her incapable of performing even light work. It was reasonable for the ALJ to conclude that Giordano\u2019s testimony overstated her actual limitations, based on Giordano\u2019s failure to follow recommended medical treatment, inconsistency with the objective medical evidence, and effective pain management with relatively conservative treatment. <em>See Thomas v. Barnhart, </em>278 F.3d 947, 958-59 (9th Cir.2002); Soc. Sec. Ruling 96-7p. These significant inconsistencies constitute substantial evidence. <em>Burch, </em>400 F.3d at 681.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">The ALJ did not err in finding that Giordano was \u201cnot disabled\u201d at step four. The assessment was supported by substantial evidence, including objective medical evidence and the report by the state agency physicians. In making this determination, the ALJ was entitled to give less weight to the portions of Giordano\u2019s testimony that the ALJ had found not credible. <em>Bayliss v. Barnhart, </em>427 F.3d 1211, 1216 (9th Cir.2005); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1529(c)(4), (d)(4) (2007); Soc. Sec. Ruling 96-7p. It was also reasonable for the ALJ to conclude that Giordano could return to her past relevant work, given that Giordano\u2019s own description of her past jobs accommodated all of the limitations. <em>See Magallanes v. Bowen, </em>881 F.2d 747, 756 (9th Cir.1989). It was not error to omit limitations that the ALJ properly found not credible. <em>Bayliss, </em>427 F.3d at 1217; <em>see also Fair v. Bowen, </em>885 F.2d 597, 605 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b532-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
