The hearing officer determined Whyne had not engaged in substantial gainful employment since October 1995 and that he suffers from hearing loss and \u201ca severe exertional impairment which significantly affects his capacity for normal work activity.\u201d The hearing officer concluded, however, that Whyne was not disabled because his impairments would not prevent him from functioning in his regular occupation \u2014 the sedentary train dispatcher job he last held in 1995. The Railroad Retirement Board affirmed the hearing officer\u2019s denial of claims, and Whyne filed a petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-14\">We have jurisdiction under 45 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 231g and 355(f). Our review is limited to deciding whether the record contains substantial evidence supporting the Board\u2019s finding that Whyne could work in the sedentary job he left in 1995. <em>See Carter v. R.R. Ret. Bd., </em>834 F.2d 62, 64 (3d Cir.1987). Substantial evidence consists of evidence \u201ca reasonable mind would accept as adequate to support the result.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1024-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-16\">In support of his findings, the hearing officer drew on the reports of multiple doctors. Every doctor who examined Whyne from the middle of 1993 to 2005 diagnosed a back condition or some hearing loss or both, but nonetheless indicated Whyne could engage in work requiring at least a light level of exertion. Additionally, doctors examining Whyne in 2005 concluded he could sit for long periods of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-17\">Following a 1993 examination, Dr. Lin reported that Whyne could do work at a light level of exertion. After a 1994 evaluation, Dr. Lin concluded Whyne could engage in work at a light or medium level of exertion. In 1996, Dr. Lin noted Whyne could not engage in heavy work but did not revise his earlier conclusions about light and medium work. An orthopedic evaluation in 2005 by Dr. Wolk concluded Whyne retained \u201csignificant residual fune<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>tioning capacity.\u201d Dr. Wolk indicated Whyne was capable of light duty and capable of both standing and sitting for long periods of time \u2014 findings supporting a conclusion Whyne could engage in sedentary work.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A 2005 neurological evaluation by Dr. Aslam found Whyne could lift up to fifty, pounds frequently, a finding consistent with medium-exertion work, light-exertion work, and sedentary work.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Dr. Hong\u2019s 2005 examination for hearing loss confirmed Whyne suffered some hearing loss, but not enough to interfere significantly with Whyne\u2019s employment. Accordingly, substantial evidence of record supports the hearing officer\u2019s conclusion that Whyne could engage in his regular occupation, the sedentary train dispatcher job.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-6\">Whyne contends the hearing officer failed to give due weight to his subjective evidence of pain, which he describes as \u201cpillow biting\u201d \u2014 so severe he cannot work even at a sedentary job. Although \u201can [administrative law judge] must give serious consideration to a claimant\u2019s subjective complaints of pain,\u201d subjective evidence may be discounted in light of contrary medical evidence. <em>Mason v. Shalala, </em>994 F.2d 1058, 1067-68 (3d Cir.1993) <em>(citing Carter, </em>834 F.2d at 65). In this case, the hearing officer discounted Whyne\u2019s description of pain because medical reports suggested it was disproportionate to his medical condition. Based on their examinations, Doctors Lin, Wolk, and Aslam concluded Whyne could engage in work at either light or medium levels of exertion. Additionally, Doctors Wolk and Aslam concluded Whyne could sit for long periods of time. Because of this contrary medical evidence, the hearing officer\u2019s decision to discount Whyne\u2019s subjective evidence of pain was not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-11\">Because the Board\u2019s reasons for denying the claim are supported by substantial evidence, we will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1024-12\">.
