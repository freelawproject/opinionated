He was sentenced to 84 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">Aguilar argues that the district court clearly erred in reducing his base offense level by two levels for his minor participation in the offense rather than by three- or four-levels for his minimal or less than minor participation in the offense. The advisory Sentencing Guidelines provide for a reduction in the base offense level of a \u201cminor\u201d or a \u201cminimal\u201d participant and a participant who falls between a \u201cminor\u201d and \u201cminimal\u201d participant. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. To merit a reduction under \u00a7 3B1.2, the defendant must have been \u201csubstantially less culpable\u201d than the average participant. \u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 3(A). The role of a defendant in the offense is a factual determination that we review for clear error. <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 <em>&amp; </em>n. 9 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Aguilar\u2019s suggestion that he was entitled to a three- or four-level adjustment because he was involved in only one drug delivery is faulty. This court has upheld the denial of minimal role status where the defendant was recruited as a courier for a single shipment of a large quantity of drugs. <em>See United States v. Gallegos, </em>868 F.2d 711, 713 (5th Cir.1989); <em>United States v. Rojas, </em>868 F.2d 1409, 1410 (5th Cir. 1989). Aguilar was apprehended with 378.3 grams of heroin. Although he was involved in a purportedly single instance of drug trafficking, the relatively large quantity of heroin represents a serious crime \u201cwith serious consequences for the public.\u201d <em>Gallegos, </em>868 F.2d at 713; <em>see also United States v. Buenrostro, </em>868 F.2d 135, 138 (5th Cir.1989). Moreover, Aguilar provided no evidence, apart from his own self-serving statements, showing that he was substantially less culpable than other participants. The district court did not clearly err in denying him a more generous role adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b301-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
