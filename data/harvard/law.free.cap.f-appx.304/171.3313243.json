Kerns\u2019 counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious issues for appeal but questioning whether the district court erred by applying a four-level enhancement under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) (2005), for possession of a weapon in connection with another felony offense. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-25\">Counsel questions whether the district court erred by enhancing Kerns\u2019 offense level under USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6). In order for the enhancement to apply, \u201cthe district court must find both that a firearm was used (or that the defendant possessed ... the firearm expecting that it would be used) and that such use was in connection with another felony offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Garnett, </em>243 F.3d 824, 828 (4th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Our review of the record convinces us that the district court did not clearly err in applying the enhancement in USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6). <em>See id. </em>(stating standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-26\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record for any meritorious issues for appeal and have found none. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>Thus, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
