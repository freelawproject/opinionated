He was sentenced to 96 months imprisonment, a term of supervised release of three years, a fine of $7,500.00, and a special assessment of $100.00. Shedrick contends that the District Court abused its discretion by granting an upward departure of eight offense levels, and that it imposed an unreasonable sentence. We disagree and will affirm the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-15\">I. JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b80-16\">This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, as this matter comes before the Court due to a timely appeal from the order of judgment in a criminal case entered on November 13, 2007. Additionally, this Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 to review the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-17\">II. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b80-18\">The underlying conduct that gave rise to the initial indictment occurred on July 11, 2002. On that date, police officers arrived at 64th Street and Greenway Avenue in Philadelphia, PA, in response to 911 emergency calls reporting a man with a gun. Shortly thereafter, Officer Pembrook spotted Appellant Shedrick standing in the middle of the street with a large silver revolver. He radioed for backup, and was quickly joined by Officers Mason, Rutter, and Gallen-Ruiz. All officers then instructed Appellant to drop his weapon. Appellant chose not cooperate; he unsuccessfully attempted to fire his revolver into the air three times. Appellant then opened the cylinder of the revolver, and six empty shell casings dropped to the ground. While Appellant checked his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>weapon, the officers tackled him and placed him under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Before moving on, it is important to note that Appellant discharged his firearm pri- or to the officers\u2019 arrival. Two shots hit a moving van with two passengers inside. The first shot hit the top of the hood, and the second hit the middle of the windshield-just missing driver Lay Nguyen and his passenger-employee Patricia Edwards. (App.45.) Neither of the passengers sustained any injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">This case originally came before the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, when on August 27, 2002, the grand jury returned an indictment for Appellant James Shedrick. Appellant was charged with one count of possession of a firearm by a felon pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). On November 8, 2002, Appellant pleaded guilty to that charge. He stipulated to the following facts: (1) possession of a Smith &amp; Wesson .357 magnum caliber revolver; (2) previous conviction of a crime punishable by imprisonment for more than one year; and (3) the relevant firearm affected interstate commerce as it was manufactured outside Pennsylvania. (Suppl.App.3.) Appellant further stipulated that \u201cthe Court may make factual and legal determinations that differ from these stipulations and that may result in an increase or decrease in the Sentencing Guidelines range and the sentence that may be imposed.\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">The plea acknowledged that Appellant\u2019s maximum statutory sentence under \u00a7 922(g)(1) could be as much as ten years\u2019 imprisonment, including three years\u2019 supervised release, a $250,000.00 fine, and a $100.00 special assessment. <em>(Id. </em>at 2.) Notably, the parties agreed that each was \u201cfree to argue the applicability of any other provision of the Sentencing Guidelines, including offense conduct, offense characteristics, criminal history, adjustments and departures ...\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 3.) Finally, relevant portions of the plea agreement also included the following waiver provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-9\">10. In exchange for the undertakings made by the government in entering this plea agreement, the defendant voluntarily and expressly waives all rights to appeal or collaterally attack the defendant\u2019s conviction, sentence, or any other matter relating to this prosecution, whether such a right to appeal or collateral attack arises under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, or any other provision of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-10\">(A) Notwithstanding the waiver provision above, if the government appeals from the sentence, then the defendant may file a direct appeal of his sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-11\">(B) If the government does not appeal, then notwithstanding the waiver provision set forth in paragraph 10 above, the defendant may file a direct appeal but may raise only claims that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-12\">(i) if the sentence exceeded the statutory maximum; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-13\">(ii) if the judge erroneously departed upward from the otherwise applicable sentencing guideline range.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-14\">(Suppl.App.4.) During an extensive plea colloquy with Judge Davis, Appellant confirmed in open court that he fully understood the terms of the plea agreement. <em>(See </em>App. 21-35.)</p>\n<p id=\"b81-15\">Two weeks prior to the sentencing hearing, the Government filed a sentencing memorandum containing two recommendations: (1) Appellant should be subject to a four-level enhancement for possessing a firearm in connection with a felony offense (drug dealing); and (2) the District Court should depart upward eight levels from the Guidelines range because Appellant fired <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>the weapon during the commission of his offense (shooting at the passenger van). Consistent with these recommendations, the applicable Guidelines\u2019 range became 87 to 108 months. (Suppl.App.18.) Appellant objected to these recommendations, instead contending that he was subject to a 46 to 57 month range.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (App.72-73.)</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">The sentencing hearing was thereafter held on February 21, 2003. The District Court heard testimony from Lay Nguyen (the driver of the van), Aki Brickhouse (the man responsible for transferring possession of the gun to Appellant\u2019s brother), Detective Missimer (the detective who interviewed Appellant\u2019s brother \u2014 Tarik Robinson), Rachel Jacobs (Appellant\u2019s mother), and Appellant himself, who made a statement from counsel\u2019s table.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">The Court ultimately accepted as credible the testimony from Brickhouse that Appellant carried the weapon in connection with \u201chustling\u201d, that is, dealing cocaine on the streets. (App.56, 91.) The Court also accepted as credible the testimony of Nguyen, who testified that Appellant was the person who shot twice at her van. (App.51, 93.) In fact, Judge Davis recalled Nguyen to directly answer questions so as to verify that Appellant was properly identified.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As Judge Davis told Nguyen, \u201cI\u2019m asking you these questions because it\u2019s very important to me as a judge that I know what the facts are and that I do the right thing.\u201d (App.87.)</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">The District Court ultimately applied the four-level enhancement associated with carrying the weapon in connection with dealing drugs and the eight-level upward departure for shooting at the passenger van. (Suppl.App.18.) The Court then adjusted downward three levels for Appellant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility, which brought the total to 29. (App.94.) With the appropriate sentencing range at 87 to 108 months, the Court imposed a sentence of 96 months, including three years\u2019 supervised release, a $7,500 fine, and the mandatory $100 special assessment. <em>(Id. </em>at 95-96.)</p>\n<p id=\"b82-10\">Shedrick received court-appointed counsel for purposes of appeal. Six months after the sentencing, counsel filed a motion for enlargement of time to enter a notice of appeal <em>nunc pro tunc. </em>(Suppl.App. p. 18.) That motion was denied as untimely on August 27, 2003, and we dismissed the appeal as untimely on November 25, 2003. <em>(Id. </em>at 19.) Appellant thereafter (through counsel) filed a \u00a7 2255 habeas petition for ineffective assistance of counsel, which again was denied by the District Court. A <em>pro se </em>petition for a certificate of appealability was then filed before this Court, which was granted for two issues: \u201cwhether counsel was ineffective for failing to advise [Appellant] of a possible upward <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>departure at sentencing; and whether counsel was ineffective for filing an untimely appeal.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 19.)</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">In a precedential opinion, <em>see, generally, United States v. Shedrick, </em>493 F.3d 292 (3d Cir.2007), we answered in the negative as to the first issue, but found in favor of Appellant as to the second. We also stated that the only issue preserved for appeal was whether the eight-level upward departure was erroneous. <em>Id. </em>at 303. Because that issue was extensively briefed, this Court decided it on the merits, finding that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in imposing the sentence. (Suppl.App.31-33.) Appellant then filed a motion for rehearing, contending that it was improper for this Court to rule on that issue. We agreed, noting that the usual rule of thumb on a \u00a7 2255 case is to remand to the District Court so as to allow Appellant to be in the same position as if he had effective counsel. <em>See Shedrick, supra, </em>at 303. Thus, we vacated that portion of the opinion and remanded</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1\">for re-entry of the initial sentence so that there can be a timely appeal ... This ... will give [Appellant] the opportunity properly to raise the issue that he had previously expressed a desire for this Court to review and which he explicitly preserved in his plea agreement and colloquy: the propriety of his upward departure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">On remand, the District Court followed our directive, imposing the same sentence it deemed appropriate at the February 2003 sentencing hearing. This sentence was re-imposed notwithstanding Appellant\u2019s contention that the District Court should conduct a <em>de novo </em>sentencing hearing consistent with the demands of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), decided two years after Appellant\u2019s initial sentencing, <em>and </em>notwithstanding an extensive colloquy between Judge Davis and Appellant regarding Appellant\u2019s certificates of merit attained in prison. Judge Davis explained that he was bound by our directive, and that, in any event, he would impose the same sentence even if <em>Booker </em>governed the case. (App.121-22.)</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">III. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b83-10\">The standard for reviewing whether an upward departure was permissibly granted under the sentencing guidelines is plenary. <em>See United States v. Himler, </em>355 F.3d 735, 741 (3d Cir.2004). This Court then reviews the reasonableness of the departure for an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Yeaman, </em>194 F.3d 442, 456 (3d Cir.1999). Factual determinations regarding sentencing are reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Beckett, </em>208 F.3d 140, 148 (3d Cir.2000). Finally, the standard for reviewing whether an appellate waiver is enforceable is <em>de novo. See United States v. Jackson, </em>523 F.3d 234, 237 (3d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-11\">IV. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b83-12\">A. The Upward Departure</p>\n<p id=\"b83-13\">Appellant first contends that the evidence was insufficient to warrant an upward departure in this case. In Appellant\u2019s words, \u201c[t]he evidence presented at sentencing was <em>far from, overwhelming.\u201d </em>(Appellant Br., p. 13.) (emphasis added). Pointedly, this Circuit has never required such a high burden of proof at sentencing. Indeed, we have held that a district court applies the preponderance of the evidence standard when determining facts relevant to sentencing. <em>See United States v. Grier, </em>475 F.3d 556, 568 (3d Cir.2007) (en banc); <em>and United States v. Cooper, </em>437 F.3d 324, 330 (3d Cir.2006). Those factual determinations are then reviewed using the defer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>ential clear error standard. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2471, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">Here, the District Court did not commit clear error when it concluded that Appellant fired the gun at the passenger van. While there may have been a discrepancy with respect to the shirt Appellant wore at the relevant time, that discrepancy was resolved by the Court after recalling Nguyen to testify. (App.93-94.) The following colloquy between the Court and Nguyen took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-5\">Court: [Y]ou took them back to where you were being shot at?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-6\">Witness: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-7\">Court: Okay. And that\u2019s when you saw the man that they tackled, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-8\">Witness: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-9\">Court: Okay. So the man that they tackled, where was he standing in relation to where the man who shot at you was standing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-10\">Witness: Same place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-11\">Court: Same place?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-12\">Witness: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-13\">When this colloquy is juxtaposed with the facts that: (1) the police station was only a two blocks from the scene of the shooting, (2) Appellant\u2019s gun had six empty shell casings when he was arrested, and (3) the Court found Nguyen\u2019s testimony credible, it is evident that the Court\u2019s finding that Appellant fired the gun was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-15\">Appellant further contends that \u201c[a] jury finding was necessary to determine\u201d whether Appellant shot at the van. The question of whether a jury finding was necessary to determine the factual basis for Appellant\u2019s sentencing was answered by the Supreme Court in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). In that case, the Supreme Court held in part that the Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury is not implicated during sentencing unless the sentence exceeds the statutory maximum. <em>Id. </em>at 259, 125 S.Ct. 738. Whereas here, the statutory maximum for Appellant\u2019s offense was ten years and the range recommended was 87 to 108 months, Appellant was not entitled to a jury finding at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-17\">Appellant\u2019s next contention is that, even if it is true that he fired the gun at the moving passenger van, that fact alone does not make this case sufficiently \u201cspecial\u201d or \u201cunusual\u201d to warrant an upward departure of eight levels. In making this argument, Appellant does himself no favor by citing two key provisions of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines. First, Appellant cites \u00a7 5K2.0, and states that \u201ca district court may grant an upward departure where circumstances exist that the guidelines do not adequately take into consideration.\u201d (Appellant Br., p. 15.) Second, Appellant cites U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5k2.6 which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-18\">If a weapon or dangerous instrumentality was used or possessed in the commission of the offense[,] the court may increase the sentence above the authorized guidelines range. The extent of the increase ordinarily should depend on the dangerousness of the weapon, the manner in which it was used, and the extent to which its use endangered others. The discharge of a firearm might warrant a substantial sentence increase.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-19\">(Appellant Br., p. 16.) Appellant then asserts, \u201c[ajlthough a firearm is a dangerous weapon, its dangerousness is taken into account under 18 U.S.C. 922(g)(1), felon in possession of a firearm.\u201d (Appellant Br., p. 16.) Appellant disregards the finding that he discharged the firearm twice, and instead contends that the weapon was used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>only \u201cin conjunction with a drug crime\u201d, which already provided a four-level sentence enhancement. <em>(Id.) </em>When Appellant does address the firearm discharge, he asserts that \u201cno one was injured\u201d and that \u201cno one was endangered\u201d. (App.16-17.) Appellant is correct that neither occupant of the van was injured, but it flies in the face of common sense to say that \u201cno one was endangered\u201d when Appellant fired twice at a moving van, once hitting the hood, and once hitting the windshield. Indeed, this situation is not one typically contemplated by the guidelines. In such a case, the District Court was authorized to impose \u201ca substantial sentence increase\u201d pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Finally, Appellant contends that the extent of the departure was unreasonable. (Appellant Br., p. 17.) He specifically argues that an eight-level departure was \u201ctoo large\u201d, and that the District Court improperly calculated the departure. <em>(Id.) </em>If a District Court \u201cfinds that there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration ... by the guidelines\u201d, then the court may depart from the \u201crelevant guideline range\u201d.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Queensborough, </em>227 F.3d 149, (3d Cir.2000) (citing <em>United States v. Kikumura, </em>918 F.2d 1084, 1098 (3d Cir.1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Here, the Government analogized Appellant\u2019s conduct to attempted murder, and recommended an offense level of 33. (App.91.) At the sentencing hearing, the Government remarked that the same offense level would result if the Court added four levels for each victim who was assaulted when Appellant fired twice at the van. (App.91-92.) We have held that, where an appropriate circumstance exists, reasoning by analogy \u201cto the guidelines ... is a useful and appropriate tool for determining what offense level a defendant\u2019s conduct most closely approximates.\u201d <em>Queensborough, </em>227 F.3d at 160. Because Appellant fired his weapon twice at a moving vehicle with two passengers, his conduct does approximate that of attempted murder. Murder is defined as \u201cthe unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1111(a). Malice aforethought \u201cis not synonymous with premeditation ... but may also be inferred from circumstances which show a wanton and depraved spirit, a mind bent on evil mischief without regard to its consequences.\u201d <em>Gov\u2019t of Virgin Islands v. Lake, </em>362 F.2d 770, 774 (3d Cir.1966). Here, Appellant\u2019s conduct epitomizes a \u201cwanton and depraved spirit.\u201d Moreover, as Judge Davis told Appellant at the re-sentencing, \u201cwhen you fire two bullets, that becomes an element of premeditation.\u201d (App.118.)</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">Appellant refutes the analogy to attempted murder, instead contending that a four-level upward departure consistent with aggravated assault is the proper cross-reference. (Appellant Br., p. 18.) He cites <em>United States v. Corbin, </em>998 F.2d 1377 (7th Cir.1993), and notes that the Seventh Circuit affirmed a sentence based on a violation of \u00a7 922(g)(1) \u2014 which was then cross-referenced with the applicable guideline for aggravated assault. <em>(Id.) </em>Appellant\u2019s reliance on that case is misguided, however, because the facts in <em>Corbin </em>are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>inapposite to the present case. In <em>Corbin, </em>the appellant never fired his weapon. He did press it against his ex-girlfriend\u2019s head, though, which subsequently caused a \u201cround reddened spot\u201d. <em>Corbin, </em>998 F.2d at 1380. Such an act is plainly consistent with horn book aggravated assault, as the appellant caused bodily injury with a deadly weapon. Wayne R. Lafave &amp; Austin W. Scott, Jr., Criminal Law 608 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">By contrast, Appellant in this case actually discharged his weapon twice, each time aiming at a moving van with two passengers, and each time hitting the van. As such, the two cases are inapposite. In any event, it cannot be said that the District Court abused its discretion when it departed upward eight levels. This conclusion is buttressed by that notion that \u201c[t]he sentencing judge has access to, and greater familiarity with, the individual case and the individual defendant before him than the Commission or the appeals court.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2469, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">B. Reasonableness of the Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">The second issue presently before this Court is whether Appellant\u2019s sentence was unreasonable. Because we hold that Appellant waived this ground for appeal in his plea agreement, we need not reach the merits of this argument. As noted above, Appellant\u2019s plea agreement contained the following relevant terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-7\">(A) Notwithstanding the waiver provision above, if the government appeals from the sentence, then the defendant may file a direct appeal of his sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-10\">(B) If the government does not appeal, then ... the defendant may file a direct appeal but may raise only claims that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-11\">(i) if the sentence exceeded the statutory maximum; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-12\">(ii) if the judge erroneously departed upward from the otherwise applicable sentencing guideline range.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-13\">Here, the District Court did not exceed the statutory maximum (ten years) when it sentenced Appellant to 96 months, nor did the Government appeal the sentence. Appellant\u2019s only valid ground for appeal, therefore, is whether the District Court erroneously departed upward from the otherwise applicable sentencing guideline range, pursuant to 10(B)(ii) of the plea agreement. We addressed that argument above, and concluded that the District Court did not erroneously depart upward.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-14\">Waivers of appeals are generally \u201cpermissible and enforceable.\u201d <em>See United States v. Khattak, </em>273 F.3d 557, 560 (3d Cir.2001).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> When waivers of appeal are entered into \u201cknowingly and voluntarily,\u201d they are presumed valid <em>\u201cunless they work a miscarriage of justice.\u201d See United States v. Lockett, </em>406 F.3d 207, 213 (3d Cir.2005) (emphasis added). <em>Lockett </em>is similar to the case before us. The appellant in that case pleaded guilty and was sentenced <em>pre-Booker. Id. </em>He thereafter filed an appeal, challenging his sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number><em>post-Booker. Id. </em>Specifically, he argued that the subsequent development in the law invalidated the appeal waiver contained in his plea agreement, thereby giving him the right to appeal his sentence. <em>Id. </em>This Circuit rejected that argument, holding that \u201cwhere a criminal defendant has voluntarily and knowingly entered into a plea agreement in which he or she waives the right to appeal, the defendant is not entitled to resentencing in light of <em>Booker.\u201d Id. </em>Here, Appellant waived his right to appeal and was sentenced pre<em>Booker. </em>As a result, he is not entitled to a <em>de novo </em>sentencing hearing in light of <em>Booker, </em>nor can he now challenge his sentence as unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">For whatever reason, Appellant does not address this waiver issue in his brief. As a result, there is no dispute as to whether enforcement of the waiver results in a miscarriage of justice. The Government contends that it would not, and cites our decision in <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>523 F.3d 234, 244 (3d Cir.2008) to substantiate its contention. Like the situation here, the appellant\u2019s appeal in that case relied wholly on the claim that the underlying sentence was unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZc\">In light of <em>Gall\u2019s </em>deferential abuse-of-discretion standard for reviewing sentence appeals, it will be a rare and unusual situation when claims of an unreasonable sentence, standing alone, will be sufficient to invalidate a waiver because of a miscarriage of justice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-6\"><em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 600, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">Even though Appellant does not address the waiver argument, our reasoning in <em>Jackson </em>applies squarely to the case before the Court. Appellant stated that he understood the terms of the plea agreement, and he has alleged nothing more on this second ground than mere unreasonableness. As for whether this case constitutes one of the \u201crare and unusual\u201d situations where the claim of unreasonableness alone could invalidate a waiver, we hold that it does not. The District Court was within its discretion when it analogized Appellant\u2019s conduct to attempted murder under the guidelines. The subsequent sentence was consistent with the plea agreement, which stated that \u201cthe Court may make factual and legal determinations that differ from these stipulations and that may result in an increase or decrease in the Sentencing Guidelines range and the sentence that may be imposed.\u201d (Suppl.App.3.) In sum, Appellant has waived his statutory right to appeal on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-11\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b87-12\">For the above reasons and the reasons the District Court set forth, we affirm the sentence of James Shedrick re-ordered on November 13, 2007.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b82-6\">. The P.S.R. calculated Appellant\u2019s base offense level at 20. Due to Appellant\u2019s prior felony conviction for a controlled substance offense, the calculation was subject to a four-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5). The resultant 24 was then subject to a three-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. These adjustments finally resulted in a combined point total of 21. (App.15-16.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b82-7\">. There was one discrepancy in Nguyen\u2019s testimony. Appellant was arrested wearing a black t-shirt. According to Nguyen, the shooter wore a white t-shirt. When Nguyen was confronted with that discrepancy, he answered that he was focused on the gun more than the particular clothes of the defendant. Significantly, Nguyen testified that the gun was chrome, and the Smith <em>&amp; </em>Wesson seized from Appellant was indeed chrome. Additionally, because the police station Nguyen went to after the shooting was only two blocks away, Nguyen returned to the scene quickly and witnessed Appellant being tackled in the \"same place\u201d where the shooting had occurred. (App.88.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b85-7\">. Parties are entitled reasonable notice as to the grounds for departure. <em>Burns v. United States, </em>501 U.S. 129, 138-39, 111 S.Ct. 2182, 115 L.Ed.2d 123 (1991). As the U.S. Probation Officer informed the District Court that it \"could upwardly depart because [Appellant] discharged a firearm during the offense striking a vehicle containing two passengers\u201d, <em>see </em>P.S.R., Part.E, \u00b6 63, and the Government submitted a sentencing memorandum to the Court and Appellant which expressly called for an upward departure of eight levels, (Appellee Br., p. 9.), notice was properly given.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b86-8\">. In <em>Khattak, </em>we noted that ten other Courts of Appeals have held waivers of appeal generally permissible and enforceable. <em>Id. </em>at 560-61 (citing <em>United States v. Teeter, </em>257 F.3d 14, 21 (1st Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Fisher, </em>232 F.3d 301, 303 (2d Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Brown, </em>232 F.3d 399, 403 (4th Cir.2000); <em>United States v.

Jemison, </em>237 F.3d 911, 916-18 (7th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Estrada-Bahena, </em>201 F.3d 1070, 1071 (8th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Nguyen, </em>235 F.3d 1179, 1184 (9th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Rubio, </em>231 F.3d 709, 711 (10th Cir.2000); <em>United States v.
