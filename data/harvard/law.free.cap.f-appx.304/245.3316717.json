Construing Perot\u2019s complaint liberally, the district court correctly found it presented two claims: one appealing the Medicare Appeals Council\u2019s decision that SelectCare correctly denied him coverage under its Medicare + Choice plan and another seeking damages under Texas and other unspecified law for injuries arising out of this denial of coverage. The district court granted SelectCare\u2019s and the Department of Health and Human Service\u2019s motions to dismiss because Perot\u2019s coverage claim was time-barred and his damages claim sought relief not available under the Medicare Act. Mindful that this Court must construe briefs from <em>pro se </em>parties liberally, we nevertheless affirm. <em>See Oliver v. Scott, </em>276 F.3d 736, 740 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">On appeal, Perot argues that his suit, filed two days late, should not have been dismissed as untimely. Perot had 60 days to file suit after receiving notice of a final adverse decision. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (incorporated by the Medicare Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395w-22(g)(5)); 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.1130. HHS regulations create a rebutable presumption that notice is received five days after mailing. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.1136(c)(2). The Medicare Appeals Council mailed Perot a final adverse decision on January 27, 2006, making February 1 the presumptive date of receipt. Counting 60 days, Perot had until April 3 to file suit, because April 2 was a Sunday. He filed his complaint on April 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-14\">Perot argues that his complaint should not have been dismissed because he did not actually receive notice until February 6. He offered no evidence other than a sworn statement. This court has held that a sworn statement claiming notice was not received is not sufficient to rebut the five-day presumption. <em>Kinash v. Callahan, </em>129 F.3d 736, 738 (5th Cir.1997) (interpreting an analogous regulation also promulgated under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g)). Accordingly, the district court correctly ruled that Perot\u2019s allegations were not sufficient to rebut the presumptive filing deadline, and his claim seeking coverage under the Medicare Act is time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-15\">Perot also sought damages under Texas and other unspecified law for injuries arising out of SelectCare\u2019s refusal to pay for out-of-network care. By not mentioning this issue until his reply brief, he has waived this claim. Even a <em>pro se </em>appellant must raise an argument in his initial brief to avoid waiving it. <em>Hannah v. United States, </em>523 F.3d 597, 599 n. 1 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-16\">The judgment of the district court is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b270-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
