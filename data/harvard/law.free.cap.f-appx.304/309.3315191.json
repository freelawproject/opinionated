Momin contends that the BIA\u2019s decision is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">When the BIA affirms without opinion, as it did here, this court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Eduard v. Ashcroft, </em>379 F.3d 182, 186 (5th Cir.2004). The BIA\u2019s factual findings are reviewed for substantial evidence. <em>Id. </em>Under the substantial evidence standard, this court will affirm the BIA\u2019s decision unless the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>Chen v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d 1131, 1134 (5th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">The record does not compel the conclusion that Momin has an objectively reasonable fear of individualized persecution. <em>See Tesfamichael v. Gonzales, </em>469 F.3d 109, 116 (5th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 353, 169 L.Ed.2d 10 (2007). Likewise, Momin\u2019s reliance on reports of violence against Muslims in the state of Gujarat and on general statements that conflict exists between Hindus and Muslims in India is not sufficient to compel the conclusion that a pattern or practice of persecution exists in India against Muslims. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)(iii); <em>Chen v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d at 1137-38. Momin cannot meet the more demanding standard for withholding of removal given that she cannot satisfy the standard for asylum. <em>See Chen, </em>470 F.3d at 1138; <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(2)(i)-(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b333-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
