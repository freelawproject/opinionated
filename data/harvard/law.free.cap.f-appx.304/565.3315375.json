We have jurisdiction un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>der 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253(a), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">Lanosa\u2019s habeas petition was filed on March 5, 2007, after the effective date of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996); therefore, AEDPA\u2019s provisions apply. <em>See Delgado v. Lewis, </em>223 F.3d 976, 979 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">1. Lanosa first argues that the Hawaii Supreme Court unreasonably applied <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), and <em>Edwards v. Arizona, </em>451 U.S. 477, 101 S.Ct. 1880, 68 L.Ed.2d 378 (1981), when it held that Lanosa\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights were not violated by the state trial court\u2019s admission of Lanosa\u2019s uncounseled statements to the Maui Police Department (MPD). Lanosa argues that he invoked his right to counsel by refusing to sign a waiver of his right to counsel and right to silence, and that the MPD violated his <em>Miranda </em>rights by continuing to question Lanosa after he made this alleged invocation. It was not unreasonable for the Hawaii Supreme Court to determine that Lanosa\u2019s refusal to sign the waiver, without more, was not \u201can expression of a desire for the assistance of an attorney.\u201d <em>Davis v. United States, </em>512 U.S. 452, 459, 114 S.Ct. 2350, 129 L.Ed.2d 362 (1994) (quotation marks and citation omitted). <em>Edwards\u2019 </em>requirement that police immediately cease questioning after an invocation of the right to counsel thus does not apply to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">The Hawaii Supreme Court\u2019s decision therefore was not an unreasonable application of <em>Miranda </em>or <em>Edwards, </em>and we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">2. Lanosa next argues that the Hawaii Supreme Court\u2019s determination that his <em>Miranda </em>rights were not violated was based on an unreasonable application of <em>Miranda </em>and <em>Michigan v. Mosley, </em>423 U.S. 96, 96 S.Ct. 321, 46 L.Ed.2d 313 (1975). He argues that, unlike the police in <em>Mosley, </em>the MPD failed to \u201cscrupulously honor\u201d Lanosa\u2019s right to silence after he invoked that right. In <em>Mosley, </em>the Supreme Court held that although the police in that case questioned Mosley after he invoked his right to silence, the police had nonetheless scrupulously honored Mosley\u2019s right to silence. <em>Id. </em>at 104, 96 S.Ct. 321.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">Here, Lanosa argues that the MPD failed to \u201cscrupulously honor\u201d his right to silence because the MPD attempted to question him only ten minutes after he invoked his right to silence and because he reasonably could have perceived that the MPD was attempting to question him again about the crime that was the subject of the earlier attempted interrogation. Lanosa, however, made the disputed incriminating statements approximately two hours after he invoked his right to silence. Moreover, the MPD immediately ceased questioning after Lanosa invoked his right to silence and provided fresh <em>Miranda </em>warnings to Lanosa each time officers re-initiated questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-10\">In light of these circumstances, we hold that the Hawaii Supreme Court\u2019s decision was not an unreasonable application of <em>Miranda </em>or <em>Mosley </em>and affirm the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-11\">3. Lanosa finally argues that the Hawaii Supreme Court\u2019s decision was based on \u201can unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(2). He challenges the court\u2019s determination that, when questioned a second time, he had made a \u201cseparate statement\u201d about a \u201cdifferent matter\u201d than the matter at issue in the MPD\u2019s previous attempt to question him. <em>See State v. Lanosa, </em>110 Hawai\u2019i 171, 130 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>P.3d 554, 2006 WL 574456, at *1 (Haw. Mar.10, 2006). The Hawaii Supreme Court\u2019s determination, however, is supported by evidence in the record that the second attempt to question Lanosa concerned a different matter than the MPD\u2019s first attempt to question Lanosa.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Lanosa also challenges the Hawaii Supreme Court\u2019s determination that his incriminating statements were elicited by a different detective than the detective who had been present when Lanosa invoked his right to silence. <em>See Lanosa, </em>2006 WL 574456, at *1. Again, the state court\u2019s determination is supported by evidence in the record that the MPD officers who elicited Lanosa\u2019s incriminating statements were not present when Lanosa invoked his right to silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">We therefore hold that the Hawaii Supreme Court\u2019s decision was not based on an unreasonable determination of the facts and affirm the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b589-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>by 9th Cir.
