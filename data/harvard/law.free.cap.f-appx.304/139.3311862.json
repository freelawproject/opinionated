We have fully considered Gonzales-Silva\u2019s contentions, and conclude that we are without jurisdiction to review the Board\u2019s order affirming the discretionary denial of adjustment of status. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) (2006). Next, we have reviewed Gonzales-Silva\u2019s arguments and find no abuse of discretion in the Board\u2019s orders denying Gonzales-Silva\u2019s motions to reopen and reconsider. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2008); <em>Afanwi v. Mukasey, </em>526 F.3d 788 (4th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">Accordingly, we dismiss in part and deny in part the petitions for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-10\">\n<em>PETITIONS DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
