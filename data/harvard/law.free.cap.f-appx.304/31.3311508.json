On May 23, 2004, he was sentenced as a career offender to a term of 240 months of imprisonment. We affirmed the judgment of conviction and sentence on June 12, 2006, in <em>United States v. Hight, </em>No. 05-2792, and Hight did not petition the United States Supreme Court for certiorari. On March 12, 2007, Hight filed a motion to vacate sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, wherein he claimed a denial of effective assistance of counsel. The District Court adopted Magistrate Judge Jacob P. Hart\u2019s report and recommendation, and denied relief by order dated April 21, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">Instead of appealing from that order, Hight filed two motions, on June 27 and June 30, 2008, respectively. In the first motion, which the District Court docketed as \u201cMotion to Dismiss Count Three of the Indictment and Vacate the Conviction and Sentence for Lack of Federal Subject Matter Jurisdiction,\u201d Hight challenged the constitutionality of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) as an unlawful exercise of Congress\u2019 Commerce Clause powers. In the second motion, which the District Court docketed as \u201cMotion of Pro Se Defendant Steven Hight for Modification of an Imposed Term of Imprisonment Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(B)(2) <footnotemark>1</footnotemark>,\u2019 Hight asked for relief under Amendment 709 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines. The District Court denied both motions by order dated July 29, 2008, and Hight timely appealed on August 1, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">As explained below, the District Court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction over Hight\u2019s \u201cMotion to Dismiss Count Three of the Indictment and Vacate the Conviction and Sentence for Lack of Federal Subject Matter Jurisdiction\u201d was improper because the motion was in effect an unauthorized second \u00a7 2255 motion. Therefore, we will construe it as such and deny a certificate of appealability for the claims therein. With respect to Hight\u2019s appeal from the denial of his \u00a7 3582(c) motion, however, we will summarily affirm because it clearly presents no substantial question. <em>See </em>LAR 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6. Our jurisdiction over this appeal is conferred by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">\n<em>Second or Successive \u00a7 2255 motion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AJ\">A \u00a7 2255 motion is the presumptive means by which a federal prisoner can challenge the validity of his conviction or sentence, unless such a motion would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective.\u201d <em>Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117, 120 (3d Cir. 2002). Furthermore, pursuant to the Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), district courts lack jurisdiction over second or successive \u00a7 2255 motions without proper authorization from a panel of the court of appeals. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h). Hight has already filed one \u00a7 2255 motion, which the District Court denied on March 12, 2007. The instant motion challenging the constitutionality of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) is undoubtedly an attack on the validity of Hight\u2019s conviction and sentence, and there is no reason why a \u00a7 2255 motion would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d in advancing that claim. Therefore, because Hight has failed to comply with AEDPA\u2019s stringent gatekeeping requirements for filing a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, and regardless of the District Court\u2019s improper exercise of jurisdiction, we decline to issue a certificate of appealability on his constitutional claim. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>\n<em>Relief Under Amendment 709</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Ahe\">Hight\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c) motion seeks relief pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2), as revised by Amendment 709. That amendment established that effective November 1, 2007, \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2) of the Sentencing Guidelines would thereafter read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-5\">If the defendant has multiple prior sentences, determine whether those sentences are counted separately or as a single sentence. Prior sentences always are counted separately if the sentences were imposed for offenses that were separated by an intervening arrest (i.e., the defendant is arrested for the first offense prior to committing the second offense). If there is no intervening arrest, prior sentences are counted separately unless (A) the sentences resulted from offenses contained in the same charging instrument; or (B) the sentences were imposed on the same day. Count any prior sentence covered by (A) or (B) as a single sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Hight argues that this provision of the Guidelines entitles him to relief \u201con the grounds that [he] was charged as a career offender,\u201d and \u201c[although there was an intervening arrest, [he] was sentenced to all offenses on the same day.\u201d There are two fundamental problems with this argument. First, the fact that there was an \u201cintervening arrest,\u201d which Hight concedes, fatally undercuts his attempt to consolidate two of his prior sentences. Second, and more importantly, even if U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2)(B) counseled that Hight\u2019s prior sentences should be consolidated were he sentenced today, the provision is not retroactively applicable to his pre-amendment sentencing. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(c); <em>see also United States v. Wood, </em>526 F.3d 82, 88 (3d Cir.2008). It follows, then, that this argument must fail. There being no substantial question presented by Hight\u2019s appeal from the denial of his \u00a7 3582(c) motion, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order denying relief.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b56-6\">.
