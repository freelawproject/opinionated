Hudson appeals his conviction for being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">The district court properly admitted Officer James Stradley\u2019s expert testimony, which was relevant to whether Hudson had either direct possession of the Ruger or joint and constructive possession with the other occupants of the van. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 402; <em>United States v. Carrasco, </em>257 F.3d 1045, 1049 (9th Cir.2001). The testimony thus \u201capplied directly to [the defendant\u2019s] motive and preparation\u201d for the charged offense and did not pertain to \u201cany specific, wrongful acts ... that [were] unrelated to\u201d that offense. <em>United States v. Santiago, </em>46 F.3d 885, 889 (9th Cir.1995); <em>see </em>Fed.R.Evid. 404(b). The district court carefully assessed the danger of unfair prejudice posed by Officer Stradley\u2019s testimony and limited the scope of the testimony to those aspects of gang customs, behavior and loyalty that were strongly probative of Hudson\u2019s possession of the firearm. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 403. Furthermore, the district court issued a limiting instruction emphasizing that the jury could not convict Hudson solely on account of his gang affiliation. <em>See United States v. Hollis, </em>490 F.3d 1149, 1153 (9th Cir.2007). In light of these precautions, we conclude that the district court acted within its discretion when it permitted the challenged testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">Hudson also challenges the district court\u2019s admission of Officer Stradley\u2019s testimony under Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993). We have rejected a <em>Daubert </em>challenge to the admission of testimony concerning a defendant\u2019s gang affiliation and gang codes of loyalty proffered by an expert whose qualifications are similar to those of Officer Stradley, and we do so again.here. <em>See United States v. Hankey, </em>203 F.3d 1160, 1167-70 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b535-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
