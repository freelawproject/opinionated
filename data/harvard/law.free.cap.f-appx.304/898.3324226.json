We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and scope of issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-12\">Zito\u2019s main contention is that the District Court\u2019s jury instruction stating Zito had a \u201cdeep personal interest in the outcome of the case\u201d which \u201ccreate[d] a motive for false testimony\u201d was improper in light of our supervening decision in <em>United States v. Brutus, </em>505 F.3d 80 (2d Cir.2007). Zito failed to object to the jury instruction in question. Both Zito and the government acknowledge the continuing existence of uncertainty in our Circuit\u2019s law over whether this failure to object in combination with a relevant supervening decision triggers plain error or modified plain error review.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-13\">On plain error review, a defendant is required to show \u201c(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 466-467, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). If these conditions are met, an appellate court may exercise discretion in recognition of the forfeited error if the error \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 467, 117 S.Ct. 1544 (internal quotation marks omitted). By contrast, on modified plain error review, it is the government, not the defendant, that bears the burden of showing that a substantial right has not been affected by the error. <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>274 F.3d 655, 668 n. 15 (2d Cir.2001). Moreover, if the error is of constitutional magnitude, Zito contends that the government must demonstrate that the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-14\">We need not resolve these review issues at this time because we conclude that under either standard, Zito\u2019s appeal fails. In light of the government\u2019s overwhelming evidence of Zito\u2019s guilt, we are confident that the erroneous jury instruction did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>contribute to the conviction. As a result, the government has met its burden of showing the error did not affect Zito\u2019s substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">At trial, Zito contended that he was \u201crole-playing\u201d and at all times he thought \u201cJulie\u201d was an adult, yet his own words, as captured in the transcripts of the instant messages and the telephone call, show that Zito was seeking to and believed he was communicating with a minor. For example, during his first encounter with \u201cJulie\u201d in the chat room, Zito inquired almost immediately over instant message about \u201cJulie\u2019s\u201d age and whether she had \u201ctits.\u201d He had extensive discussions with \u201cJulie\u201d about her relationship with her parents, and offered counsel on how \u201cJulie\u201d might lie to her mother about the source of gifts that Zito told \u201cJulie\u201d he would give her. Zito asked about and discussed \u201cJulie\u2019s\u201d grades. He asked questions about how much time \u201cJulie\u201d would have for a meeting in light of her school schedule and mother\u2019s activities. He promised to be \u201cJulie\u2019s\u201d friend in addition to her sexual partner. He asked \u201cJulie\u201d to stop using on-line chat rooms to prevent others from interfering with the relationship he sought to create with her. Finally, Zito repeatedly showed concern that his discussion of sex and a sexual encounter and relationship with \u201cJulie\u201d would cause problems for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">Based on the volume of evidence the government adduced that Zito believed he was communicating with a minor, we conclude that the erroneous jury instruction was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. We have considered Appellants\u2019 other contentions and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">The judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
