Korman, Senior United States District Judge for the Eastern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b566-9\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">Pedro Balderamas-Madrid appeals from a judgment of conviction entered in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, convicting him, after a plea of guilty, of one count of being a previously deported alien found in the United States, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. The defendant was sentenced principally to a period of incarceration of fifty-four months, sixteen months below the applicable range provided by the Sentencing Guidelines. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-14\">The applicable range prescribed by the Sentencing Guidelines was seventy to eighty-seven months. This resulted from a sixteen-level enhancement based on the defendant\u2019s conviction of a prior \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d The charging instrument to which he had previously pled alleged a violation of California Penal Code \u00a7 220. Closely tracking the language of \u00a7 220, the information alleged, in relevant part, that the defendant \u201cdid unlawfully assault Donna Ortiz, with the intent to commit rape, sodomy, oral copulation, and a violation of sections 264.1, 288 and 289 [of the California Penal Code].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-15\">The defendant argues that the district court erred in finding that the crime of which he had been convicted previously was a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d warranting such an enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A). The definition of a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d as set out in the Application Note to \u00a7 2L1.2 includes \u201cforcible sex offenses.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. 1(B)(iii) (2003). The force employed to commit such an offense need not be violent in nature. <em>United States v. Bolanos-Hernandez, </em>492 F.3d 1140, 1146 (9th Cir.2007). This definition is sufficient to encompass the offense of assault with the intent to commit specified substantive sex offenses prescribed in \u00a7 220, because \u00a7 220 \u201crequires at least the attempted application of some physical force,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1147, although the force need not be violent. <em>Id.; see also People v. McCoy, </em>25 Cal.2d 177, 153 P.2d 315, 322 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>While the offense in <em>Bolanos-Hemandez </em>involved assault with the intent to commit rape, there is no viable distinction between assault with the intent to commit rape and assault with the intent to commit the other sex offenses specified in \u00a7 220. Indeed, except for the fact that \u00a7 220 requires a specific intent to commit a specified substantive sex offense, <em>People v. Colantuono, </em>7 Cal.4th 206, 26 Cal.Rptr.2d 908, 865 P.2d 704, 710 &amp; n. 6 (1994), the definition of assault in \u00a7 220 is otherwise consistent with the general definition of assault set out in California Penal Code \u00a7 240. <em>See Bolanos-Hernandez, </em>492 F.3d at 1147 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Nor do we find persuasive the defendant\u2019s argument that, because \u201cmany types of rape, oral copulation, sodomy and violations of \u00a7 288 and \u00a7 289 do not require force, \u00a7 220 is not categorically a \u2018forcible\u2019 sex offense.\u201d This argument is predicated on the fact that a person may be convicted of rape and the other specified offenses where the conduct was undertaken with the consent of the victim under circumstances in which the consent is not regarded as valid. This argument ignores the fact that by coupling assault with the specified substantive offenses, \u00a7 220 essentially carved out a categorical group of sex offenses that require \u201cat least the attempted application of some physical force.\u201d <em>Bolanos-Hernandez, </em>492 F.3d at 1147.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">The defendant\u2019s final argument is that the statutory maximum for the offense for which he was convicted is two years. This argument is predicated upon the fact that the holding of the Supreme Court in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), which would compel its rejection, has been overruled. The Supreme Court has never overruled that case. Indeed, the defendant\u2019s argument rests on the fact that in cases in which the specific issue was not directly addressed, five justices expressed doubt about the continuing viability of <em>Almendarez-Torres. </em>This circumstance does not provide any justification for us to hold that a decision of the Supreme Court has been overruled. <em>See Agostini v. Felton, </em>521 U.S. 203, 217, 117 S.Ct. 1997, 138 L.Ed.2d 391 (1997). Indeed, we have already so held. <em>Butler v. Curry, </em>528 F.3d 624, 643-44 (9th Cir.2008). Nor is 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) unconstitutional. <em>United States v. Martinez-Martinez, </em>295 F.3d 1041, 1043 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b566-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
