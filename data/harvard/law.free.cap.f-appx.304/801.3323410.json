As such, both were subject to 120-month mandatory minimum sentences under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Because of the application of the mandatory minimum, the low end of Barraza-Garcia\u2019s Sentencing Guidelines range was reset to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1(c)(2) (prohibiting a guidelines sentence below the statutory mandatory minimum sentence).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But the district court granted the government\u2019s substantial assistance motions, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, and both Appellants were sentenced below the mandatory minimum. \u2018</p>\n<p id=\"b826-17\">In their section 3582(c)(2) motions, Appellants sought sentencing reductions based on Amendment 706 to the guidelines, which retroactively reduced the base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine offenses. The district court determined that Appellants were unentitled to sentencing reductions because \u2014 although Amendment 706 applied to them \u2014 application of the mandatory minimum caused the amendment not to have the effect of lowering their guideline ranges.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>We review for an abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under section 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.2003). On appeal, Appellants argue that the district court had authority to reduce their sentences because Amendment 706 lowered their base offense levels and sentencing ranges.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">When a sentencing guideline is amended and given retroactive effect, the district court, \u201cafter considering the factors set forth in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 ] 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable,\u201d may reduce a previous sentence under the amendment \u201cif such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(1). A reduction of a term of imprisonment is not \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission\u201d \u2014 and is, therefore, unauthorized under section 3582(c)(2) \u2014 if the retroactive amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">Amendment 706 reduced by two the offense levels under section 2D1.1 in crack cocaine cases. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 706 (2007). The Sentencing Commission made this amendment retroactively applicable, effective as of 3 March 2008, by incorporation into U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 713 (Supp. May 1, 2008).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">We have explained that \u201ca reduction under [section] 3582(c)(2) is not authorized where \u2018the amendment ... is applicable to the defendant but the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision (e.g., a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment).\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327-28 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. n. 1(A) (Supp. May 1, 2008)) (omission in original). In <em>Moore, </em>we concluded that Amendment 706 did not have the effect of lowering defendants\u2019 applicable guideline ranges (even though it did lower defendants\u2019 base offense levels under section 2D1.1) because defendants\u2019 guideline ranges were driven by their career offender statuses, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>Id. </em>at 1328; <em>see also United States v. Thomas, </em>545 F.3d 1300, 1302 (11th Cir.2008) (extending <em>Moore\u2019s </em>reasoning to defendant sentenced as armed career criminal, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-12\">We conclude that the district court abused no discretion in denying Appellants\u2019 section 3582(c)(2) motions. While Amendment 706 applied to Appellants and reduced their base offense levels, it did not lower their guideline ranges because of the operation of the applicable statutory mandatory minimum; that is, Appellants\u2019 guideline ranges could not go below 120 months, no matter their base offense levels as calculated based on drug quantity. That Appellants received section 5K1.1 downward departures does not change this outcome. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330 (two defendants who received downward departures despite being labeled career offenders unentitled to sentencing reduction because career offender designation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>drove their final guideline ranges).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ARX\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b826-12\">. Appellants were indicted together on drug conspiracy charges. Here, they appeal from nearly identical district court orders and have raised identical arguments on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b826-13\">. Before application of the mandatory minimum, Appellants' guideline ranges were calculated under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c), based on the amount of drugs involved in their offense. After adjustments, Barraza-Garcia's guideline range was 108 to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment while Moore\u2019s was 140 to 175 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b827-8\">. The 1 March 2008 Supplement has been superseded by the 1 May 2008 Supplement and, when used with the 2007 Manual, constitutes the operative Guidelines Manual effective 1 May 2008. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. Cover (Supp. May 1, 2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b828-16\">. We reject Appellants\u2019 argument that being ineligible to receive additional sentencing reductions penalizes them in comparison to defendants who do not offer substantial assistance: Appellants are ineligible for a reduction because of the mandatory minimum, not because they received section 5K1.1 downward departures. And because Appellants were ineligible for a sentencing reduction, the district court was not required to consider sentencing disparities between crack and power cocaine offenses or other section 3553(a) factors.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
