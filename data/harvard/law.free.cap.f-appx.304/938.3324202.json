Elstein denying petitioner\u2019s applications for asylum, withholding of removal, relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d), and cancellation of removal. <em>In re Jun Jie Lu, </em>No. A70 905 938 (B.I.A. Dec. 31, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A70 905 938 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City, Jan. 27, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-24\">Where, as here, the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s findings and reasoning, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>review the I J\u2019s decision as if it were that of the BIA. <em>See, e.g., Chun Gao v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 122, 124 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 305 (2d Cir.2003). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility findings, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">We conclude that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence. That determination was properly based on a demeanor finding that was tied to the record, internal inconsistencies in Lu\u2019s testimony, and discrepancies between his testimony and the documentary evidence in the record. The agency noted in particular that Lu\u2019s testimony was \u201cpeculiarly unresponsive and evasive,\u201d and that he \u201cinsisted on not responding to questions asked of him\u201d instead following \u201chis own script.\u201d We accord particular deference to such findings. <em>See Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 165-66 (2d Cir.2008); <em>Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 81 n. 1 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-6\">The IJ also based his adverse credibility determination on the internal inconsistencies in Lu\u2019s testimony, as well as discrepancies between that testimony and the documentary evidence Lu submitted. The IJ noted in particular the discrepancies between Lu\u2019s asylum application, in which he stated that he had \u201cexposed\u201d himself to arrest, and affirmed that neither he nor any member of his family had been mistreated, arrested or detained by the Chinese authorities, and his testimony that he was arrested, detained, and tortured after participating in a student protest. In addition, the IJ noted that, at his hearing, Lu provided an internally inconsistent account of his arrest in Changle province for participating in student protests. Finally, the IJ noted that Lu had failed to mention in his asylum application his father\u2019s alleged sterilization, or his family\u2019s other problems with the Chinese family planning authorities. The IJ properly relied on these discrepancies to make an adverse credibility finding. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii); <em>Liang Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>454 F.3d 103, 106-107 (2d Cir.2006). Moreover, while Lu attempts on appeal to provide \u201cplausible\u201d explanations for these inconsistencies, he has failed to demonstrate that a reasonable fact-finder would have been \u201ccompelled\u201d to credit his testimony. <em>Wu Biao Chen v. INS, </em>344 F.3d 272, 275 (2d Cir.2003). Because the IJ properly found Lu not credible, Lu has failed to show the necessary subjective basis for a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)(I); <em>see also Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 183 (2d Cir.2004). Thus, the agency\u2019s denial of asylum was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-8\">Lu argues for the first time on appeal that the excessive delays in the handling of his asylum claim violated his due process rights. While this Court has noted that \u201cthe BIA does not have jurisdiction to adjudicate constitutional issues,\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Roque, </em>301 F.3d 39, 47-48 (2d Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks omitted), the BIA can adjudicate underlying issues concerning fairness of process and statutory interpretation, <em>Theodoropoulos v. INS, </em>358 F.3d 162, 172 (2d Cir.2004). So long as the BIA can provide the possibility of relief, the petitioner must exhaust the issue. <em>Id. </em>at 172-73; <em>cf. Booth v. Churner, </em>532 U.S. 731, 736 &amp; n. 4, 121 S.Ct. 1819, 149 L.Ed.2d 958 (2001) (suggesting, in \u00a7 1983 context, that a party cannot be required to exhaust procedure from which there is no possibility of relief). Here, Lu failed to exhaust his claim that the delay in processing his claim was excessive and prejudicial as required by 8 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1). Accordingly, we decline to review this claim in the first instance. <em>See Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 124 (2d Cir.2007); <em>Theodoropoulos, </em>358 F.3d at 171-172.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">Because Lu\u2019s claims for withholding of removal and CAT relief share the same factual predicate as his asylum claim, the adverse credibility determination as to his asylum claim necessarily precludes success on these claims. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006) (Withholding); <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 523 (2d Cir.2005) (CAT). Additionally, because Lu does not now challenge the agency\u2019s denial of his application for cancellation of removal, we deem that argument waived. <em>Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
