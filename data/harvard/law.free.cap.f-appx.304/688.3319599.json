TYMKOVICH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b713-19\">Dovell B. Battle was convicted of second degree burglary and obstruction of a police officer, and is serving a 30-year sentence in Oklahoma prison. Proceeding pro se,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Battle seeks a certificate of appealability (COA) to challenge the district court\u2019s denial of habeas corpus relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Battle seeks relief on three grounds: (1) un-redacted sentencing information from prior convictions was submitted to the jury, (2) sufficiency of the evidence, and (3) ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-20\">We conclude Battle is not entitled to relief on any claim and therefore DENY his COA request.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">In 2003 two police officers were dispatched to a commercial building in Tulsa, Oklahoma to respond to a tripped alarm in the building. When the officers arrived, they noticed a cut padlock near a rear entry gate, which was open, and a partially open garage door on the rear of the building. The officers then witnessed Battle and another person leaving the building through the partially open garage door. Battle fled, and the officers stopped him after a short chase.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Battle was charged under Oklahoma law with second degree burglary after having been convicted of two prior felonies, and obstructing an officer. After a jury trial, he was convicted on both counts and sentenced to concurrent terms of 30 years imprisonment. Battle unsuccessfully appealed his sentence to the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals (OCCA).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Battle now seeks federal habeas review of his conviction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">To obtain a COA, Battle must make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 327, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). This standard is satisfied by demonstrating that \u201creasonable jurists could debate whether ... the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[A] claim can be debatable even though every jurist of reason might agree, after the COA has been granted and the case has received full consideration, that petitioner will not prevail.\u201d <em>Miller-El, </em>537 U.S. at 338, 123 S.Ct. 1029.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">A. Un-redacted prior sentence information</p>\n<p id=\"b714-10\">Battle first claims the trial court wrongly refused to order a redaction of his prior sentence information in copies of pri- or judgments and sentences provided to the jury. The OCCA rejected the claim on direct appeal. The OCCA\u2019s analysis was based entirely on state law regarding the requirements for proving former convictions and what information may be considered by a jury. On habeas review, we have no authority to review a state court interpretation or application of its own law. <em>Estelle v. McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 67-68, 112 S.Ct. 475, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991) (\u201c[I]t is not the province of federal habeas court[s] to reexamine state-court determinations on state-law questions.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-11\">In light of this obstacle, Battle attempts to recast his claim based on federal due process principles. He also claims that the un-redacted documents could have tainted the jury, thereby violating his Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial by an impartial jury. State evidentiary rulings may be subject to habeas review if the rulings \u201crendered the trial so fundamentally unfair that a denial of constitutional rights results.\u201d <em>Duckett v. Mullin, </em>306 F.3d 982, 999 (10th Cir.2002). \u201cIn engaging in this fundamental fairness analysis, we reiterate that we must examine the proceedings as a whole.\u201d <em>Parker v. Scott, </em>394 F.3d 1302, 1317 (10th Cir.2005) (citation omitted). For several reasons, Battle\u2019s claim does not rise to the level of rendering his trial fundamentally unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-12\">First, Battle did not raise his claim as a federal constitutional claim before the OCCA. Thus, any federal due process claims related to Battle\u2019s claim are unexhausted. But even though Battle failed to exhaust, the district court declined to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>him return to state court, because the claims lacked merit. <em>See </em>R., Doc. 17 at 6 (relying on \u00a7 2254(b)(2) for authority to deny a habeas claim on the merits \u201cnotwithstanding the failure of the applicant to exhaust\u201d the claim). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">After reviewing the record, we find the failure to redact sentencing information from the list of prior convictions placed before the jury to fall short of implicating fundamental trial fairness. Battle was sentenced below the maximum sentence allowed under state law, even with all of the un-redacted sentencing information before the jury. In essence, Battle argues that the prior sentence information was prejudicial because the jury could have inferred Battle was released on parole before serving the full length of his sentences, and thus, jurists could have speculated that he should be given a longer sentence because he might be released early on parole. This argument requires extensive speculation\u2014which we decline to do\u2014and ignores the wealth of facts from trial, which as a whole supported the jury\u2019s ultimate decision at sentencing. We have found much more inflammatory material placed before the juries not to have rendered trials fundamentally unfair. <em>See Wilson v. Sirmons, </em>536 F.3d 1064, 1113 (10th Cir.2008) (collecting cases). And, in any event, the jury did not give Battle the maximum sentence allowed, supporting the OCCA\u2019s conclusion that the information before the jury was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">Accordingly, we deny Battle a COA on his first claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">B. Sufficiency of the evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">Battle also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence for his burglary conviction. \u201cSufficiency of the evidence is a mixed question of law and fact.\u201d <em>Maynard v. Boone, </em>468 F.3d 665, 673 (10th Cir.2006). It requires that we ask whether \u201cafter viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). If facts in the record support conflicting inferences, we must presume \u201cthat the trier of fact resolved any such conflicts in favor of the prosecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 326, 99 S.Ct. 2781.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-10\">Battle\u2019s numerous arguments about the insufficiency of the evidence leave much to be desired. The arguments merely assert Battle\u2019s version of events, and his unsurprising skepticism toward the state\u2019s evidence. For example, he argues \u201cno physical evidence supported any evidence that the appellant had entered inside of the alleged building.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 10. But two officers testified they saw Battle leaving the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-11\">Battle also makes much of the lack of additional evidence of his guilt, such as the \u201cabsence of [him] being in possession of any tools or property\u201d or any \u201cfingerprints on any items inside or outside of the overhead door,\u201d a lack of videotape, and the lack of \u201cDNA, or proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 14. But the lack of some evidence says nothing about the evidence actually presented. Battle also makes an \u201cadamant assertion that [he] never entered the alleged building, with all due respect, challenges any rational trier of fact to prove otherwise.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 15. But this was Battle\u2019s defense at trial, and the jury found otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-12\">When Battle presented his sufficiency of the evidence challenge before the OCCA, it was rejected. In applying 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), we focus on whether the state court\u2019s result contravenes or unreasonably applies clearly established federal law, not on the extent of the reasoning followed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>the state court in reaching its decision. <em>See Aycox v. Lytle, </em>196 F.3d 1174, 1177-78 (10th Cir.1999) (\u201c[W]e owe deference to the state court\u2019s <em>result, </em>even if its reasoning is not expressly stated____ [W]e cannot grant relief unless the state court\u2019s result is legally or factually unreasonable.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Here, while the OCCA\u2019s summary opinion offers sparse analysis of Battle\u2019s sufficiency challenge, the district court\u2019s review of the evidence presented at trial illustrates the strength of the state\u2019s case. Two police officers arrived at the building in question after an alarm was tripped, late at night. The officers found the padlocked gate surrounding the outside of the building open, and the padlock cut. The officers observed Battle and a cohort exiting the building from underneath a partially opened garage door. The officers then apprehended Battle as he fled the scene. The owner of the building testified that some computers and other valuable equipment had been moved from their normal location to a location near the partially opened door. This evidence, and any reasonable inference drawn from it, was sufficient for a juror to find Battle had burglarized the building, and specifically that he had broke and entered, and had an intent to steal. We agree with the district court, the evidence was sufficient to support Battle\u2019s conviction for second degree burglary under Oklahoma law.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">We decline to grant Battle a COA on his second claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">C. Ineffective assistance of counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">Lastly, Battle claims his trial counsel was ineffective for two reasons: (1) failure to accept the trial court\u2019s offer to hold a hearing under <em>Jackson v. Denno, </em>378 U.S. 368, 84 S.Ct. 1774, 12 L.Ed.2d 908 (1964), to determine the voluntariness of his confession; and (2) failure to allow him to testify in his own defense. Both claims were rejected by the OCCA. Thus, Battle must show that the OCCA\u2019s adjudication of his claim was an unreasonable application of Supreme Court precedent. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). Battle must demonstrate that (1) counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness; and (2) counsel\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced the defendant so that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, there was a reasonable probability the result of the proceeding would have been different. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-88, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-10\">We address Battle\u2019s two arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-11\">\n<em>Failure to request a voluntariness hearing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b716-12\">Battle claims his counsel was ineffective for failing to agree to holding a specific evidentiary hearing after trial related to his statement he now characterizes as a \u201cconfession.\u201d When a defendant challenges the voluntariness of a confession, the Supreme Court has determined the voluntariness issue should be decided by a separate hearing, instead of being determined by the jury charged with determining guilt. <em>See Jackson, </em>378 U.S. at 376, 84 S.Ct. 1774. These are commonly known as <em>Jackson v. Denno </em>hearings. <em>See generally </em>2A Charles Alan Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal \u00a7 414, at 117-22 (3d ed.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-14\">The \u201cconfession\u201d statement in question came from the owner of the burgled business, who testified that he heard the apprehended Battle say to him, \u201cI know it doesn\u2019t mean anything, but I\u2019m sorry.\u201d R., Doc. 17 at 11. Battle\u2019s counsel objected at trial to the admission of the statement, but was overruled. At sentencing, the trial court recognized that the defendant had no opportunity to challenge the voluntariness of the statement outside the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>jury\u2019s presence. The judge explained how the lack of any custodial interrogation during the time of the alleged statement, as well as the apparent voluntariness of the statement, both accounted for the failure to conduct a hearing. However, the trial judge ultimately offered to have a <em>Jackson v. Denno </em>hearing, \u201cpostmortem.\u201d R., Doc. 10, Ex. 8 at 3. Battle\u2019s counsel declined the trial judge\u2019s offer to hold a <em>Jackson v. Denno </em>hearing, \u201cI don\u2019t think it would be appropriate for me to suggest that we have a Jackson/Denno hearing now, and so I would object to a[] postmortem Jackson/Denno hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5. The trial court subsequently ruled on all Battle\u2019s post-trial motions and sentenced him. Battle now claims his counsel\u2019s failure to request a post-trial <em>Jackson v. Denno </em>hearing was ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">The OCCA rejected Battle\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim largely because he did not show prejudice. If the OCCA properly decided Battle failed to establish prejudice, it is unnecessary for us to evaluate the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 697, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (\u201c[I]f it is easier to dispose of an ineffectiveness claim on the ground of lack of sufficient prejudice ... that course should be followed. Courts should strive to ensure that ineffectiveness claims not become so burdensome to defense counsel that the entire criminal justice system suffers as a result.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">We agree with the OCCA. Battle has not shown prejudice. He makes no showing on appeal that his statement was involuntary, and the record points quite to the contrary. Absent any evidence of an involuntary custodial interrogation, we decline to grant Battle a COA for ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">\n<em>Failure to allow Battle to testify</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AEv\">Finally, Battle claims his counsel refused to allow him to testify in his own defense. Due process of law protects the right to testify on one\u2019s own behalf at a criminal trial. <em>Rock v. Arkansas, </em>483 U.S. 44, 51, 107 S.Ct. 2704, 97 L.Ed.2d 37 (1987). \u201cThe decision whether to testify lies squarely with the defendant; it is not counsel\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Cannon v. Mullin, </em>383 F.3d 1152, 1171 (10th Cir.2004). If Battle were prevented from testifying in his own defense by counsel, he would satisfy the <em>Strickland </em>deficient performance prong. But he must also show prejudice to satisfy <em>Strickland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">The OCCA found that Battle had not established prejudice. The state produced strong evidence of Battle\u2019s guilt at trial, including the testimony of two police officers and the business owner. Upon a review of the record, we see no suggestion the result of Battle\u2019s trial would have been different had he testified. To counter the overwhelming weight of the evidence presented against him, Battle argues that his testimony would have explained away all of the state\u2019s evidence. Even if we entertain Battle\u2019s arguments presented in brief, which reflect the 20/20 wisdom of hindsight, we cannot find prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">While we make all presumptions in favor of Battle, the arguments remain unavailing. For example, to counter the two police officers who testified to have actually seen Battle exit the burglarized building (around midnight, with a gate opened and padlock cut), Battle asserts,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-10\">[The Officer] testified that he observed two (2) individuals exiting the building from \u201cbeneath\u201d the west overhead door\u2014a door (by his own testimony) only raised a mere THREE (3) to FOUR (4) feet above the ground. The district [court judge] erroneously did not take into consideration that the Appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>lant is 6' [foot 1\" inch] in height and weighed approximately 230 pounds at the time of this alleged offense. Even in his best physical condition, the Appellant could not have run, walk[ed] or even crawl[ed] underneath a three to four foot raised door. Not by any stretch of the imagination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">Aplt. Br. at 26. But it is not hard to imagine a jury, healing the officer\u2019s testimony, would conclude that Battle could have easily exited from under a four foot opening in a door.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">We have carefully reviewed all of Battle\u2019s arguments for how his testimony might have persuaded the jury of his innocence, and we agree with the OCCA: Battle was not prejudiced by his failure to testify in his own defense. Thus, he has not shown the OCCA\u2019s determination was an unreasonable application of Supreme Court precedent. Accordingly, we do not grant a COA on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">For the reasons set forth above, we DENY Battle\u2019s petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b713-12\"> This order is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b713-22\">.
