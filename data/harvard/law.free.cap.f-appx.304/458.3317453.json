United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). <em>Cavett v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 878, 169 L.Ed.2d 718 (2008). The parties have filed statements of position under Circuit Rule 54. Defendant Theodore Cavett has asked for a remand for resentencing. The government argues that Cavett waived the <em>Kimbrough </em>issue by not adequately developing an argument about the sentencing guidelines\u2019 100:1 crack/powder disparity before the district court or on appeal. As such, the government maintains that no remand is necessary and asks that we affirm Cavett\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-15\">Cavett mentioned the 100:1 crack/powder ratio twice in his appellate brief: once in his statement of the case and once in his challenge to the reasonableness of the district court\u2019s exercise of <em>Booker </em>discretion. Beyond referring generally to the unfairness of the disparity, however, he did not develop a <em>Kimbrough </em>\u2014 type argument on appeal. In the district court, he initially objected to the amount of crack cocaine attributed to him by the Presentence Report (\u201cPSR\u201d), but later reached a compromise with the government on that issue. AVhen asked at sentencing whether he had any other objections to the PSR, his counsel answered: \u201cJust the standard objections to the guidelines as a whole.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-17\">Cavett\u2019s \u201comnibus\u201d sort of objection in the district court probably limits our review to the plain-error standard, although we have been very forgiving in our consideration of <em>Kimbrough </em>forfeitures; Cavett\u2019s appellate reference to the 100:1 crack/powder disparity might be enough to justify at least a limited remand to determine whether the district court would be inclined to resentence him in light of <em>Kimbrough. See United States v. Bruce, </em>550 F.3d 668, 673-76 (7th Cir.2008) (discussing whether the defendant adequately raised the <em>Kimbrough </em>issue in the district court and on appeal and describing our circuit\u2019s treatment of preserved, forfeited, and waived <em>Kimbrough </em>arguments); <em>United States v. Padilla, </em>520 F.3d 766, 774 (7th Cir.2008) (defendant\u2019s \u201coblique\u201d reference to the crack/powder issue in the district court sufficient for full remand for resentencing in light of <em>Kimbrough)-, United States v. Taylor, </em>520 F.3d 746, 747 (7th Cir.2008) (establishing limited remand procedure for plain-error <em>Kimbrough </em>cases); <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>520 F.3d 729, 737 (7th Cir.2008) (defendant\u2019s failure to advance an argument about the 100:1 crack/powder ratio in the district court or on appeal is a waiver of <em>Kimbrough </em>issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>But there is a separate reason Cavett is not entitled to either a full remand for resentencing <em>or </em>a limited remand under <em>Taylor. </em>Cavett\u2019s base offense level of 37 was based on his status as a career offender, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, not the quantity of crack cocaine attributed to him. We have held that \u201ca sentence entered under the career offender guideline, \u00a7 4B1.1, raises no <em>Kimbrough </em>problem because to the extent it treats crack cocaine differently from powder cocaine, the disparity arises from a statute, not from the advisory guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Harris, </em>536 F.3d 798, 812-13 (7th Cir.2008); <em>see also United States v. Liddell, </em>543 F.3d 877, 883-85 (7th Cir.2008). Accordingly, Cavett\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
