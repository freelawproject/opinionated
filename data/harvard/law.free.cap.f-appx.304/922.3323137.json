On appeal, Mammedov contends that the Government breached the plea agreement and that the District Court\u2019s restitution order was improper on several grounds. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">I. The Plea Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">Even where, as here, a defendant waives his right of appeal as part of a plea agreement, the defendant may appeal his sentence if he can show that the government has breached its contractual obligations. <em>United States v. Rosa, </em>123 F.3d 94, 98 (2d Cir.1997). \u201cWe review interpretations of plea agreements <em>de novo </em>and in accordance with principles of contract law.\u201d <em>United States v. Griffin, </em>510 F.3d 354, 360 (2d Cir.2007) (citation omitted). Any ambiguities in a plea agreement are resolved against the Government. <em>United States v. Altro (In re Grand Jury Witness Altro), </em>180 F.3d 372, 375 (2d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-7\">Mammedov\u2019s plea agreement estimated that his total adjusted offense level would be 30, and stated that \u201c[t]his level carries a range of imprisonment of 97 to 121 months, assuming that the defendant will be sentenced within Criminal History Category I.\u201d App. 12. This estimate included, <em>inter alia, </em>a two point \u201cvulnerable victim\u201d enhancement. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.1(b)(1). It did <em>not </em>include a \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d enhancement. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2A3.1(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-9\">The agreement made clear that \u201c[t]he Guidelines estimate set forth in paragraph 2 is not binding on the [United States Attorney\u2019s] Office, the Probation Department or the Court.\u201d App. 12. Further, it stated that \u201c[i]f the Guidelines offense level advocated by the Office, or determined by the Probation Department or the Court, is different from the estimate, the defendant will not be entitled to withdraw the plea.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, the agreement provided that \u201cbased upon information now known to the Office, [the Office] will ... not seek a sentence above the high end of the Guidelines range set forth in paragraph 2 [, <em>i.e., </em>97 to 121 months].\u201d <em>Id. </em>14. At the plea proceeding, the District Court emphasized the non-binding nature of the estimate in the plea agreement, calling it an \u201ceducated guess\u201d and stating that \u201cI will not know for sure what your sentence will be until after I\u2019ve had an opportunity to study a presentence report.\u201d <em>Id. </em>30.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-11\">The Probation Department\u2019s Guidelines calculation yielded the same total adjusted offense level as the plea agreement estimate, but differed in that Probation (1) declined to apply the two point \u201cvulnerable victim\u201d enhancement, and (2) applied a two level enhancement for \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d to the third victim, which was not included in the plea agreement. The Government objected to the presentence report, arguing that a \u201cvulnerable victim\u201d enhancement was warranted. The Probation Department disagreed and did not add the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-12\">At sentencing, Mammedov did not object to the presentence report, and the Government did not argue for a \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d enhancement. As contemplated by the plea agreement, however, the Government did seek, over Mammedov\u2019s objection, the application of the \u201cvulnerable victim\u201d enhancement. The District Court found the \u201cvulnerable victim\u201d enhancement appropriate, resulting in a total adjusted offense level of 32, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>carries a Guidelines range of 121 to 151 months.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Government agreed with the increased offense level. The District Court then sentenced Mammedov to a term of imprisonment of 124 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">Mammedov argues that the Government breached his plea agreement by advocating a \u201cvulnerable victim\u201d enhancement at sentencing, thereby seeking \u201ca higher Guidelines range than the agreed-upon range of the plea agreement.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. 11-12. We have already rejected \u201ca broad rule, categorically prohibiting the government from deviating from a <em>Pimentel </em>estimate, <em>[i.e., </em>the Guidelines range estimated by a plea agreement,] absent newly discovered facts.\u201d <em>United States v. Habbas, </em>527 F.3d 266, 272 (2d Cir.2008) (discussing <em>United States v. Pimentel, </em>932 F.2d 1029 (2d Cir.1991)). Instead, when determining whether the Government has breached a plea agreement, we have stated that \u201c[e]ach case turns on its facts, and the number of significant variables potentially in play in such an inquiry is enormous.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">In the case at bar, the plea agreement makes clear that the estimated offense level was only the <em>\u201clikely </em>adjusted offense level,\u201d which was \u201cnot binding on the Office, the Probation Department or the Court.\u201d App. 11-12 (emphasis added). Though the agreement provides that \u201cbased upon information now known to the Office, it will ... not seek a <em>sentence </em>above the high end of the Guidelines range set forth in paragraph 2 [, <em>i.e., </em>97 to 121 months],\u201d <em>id. </em>14 (emphasis added), the agreement does not say that the Government cannot seek a higher <em>Guidelines range </em>based upon enhancements expressly contemplated by the plea agreement. Indeed, paragraph 3 unambiguously permits the Government to do so: \u201cIf the Guidelines offense level <em>advocated by the Office, </em>or determined by the Probation Department or the Court, is different from the estimate [provided in the plea agreement], the defendant will not be entitled to withdraw the plea.\u201d <em>Id. </em>12 (emphasis added). By advocating for a \u201cvulnerable victim\u201d enhancement, the Government sought to increase Mammedov\u2019s Guidelines range from 97 to 121 months to a range of 121 to 151 months. At no point, however, did the Government urge the District Court to impose a sentence greater than 121 months. As required by paragraph 5.b of the plea agreement, the Government took no position concerning where within the Guidelines range determined by the District Court the sentence should fall. Thus, the Government did not breach Mammedov\u2019s plea agreement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b949-10\">Mammedov\u2019s reliance on <em>United States v. Palladino, </em>347 F.3d 29 (2d Cir.2003), is misplaced. In that case, we held that \u201cthe Government breached the plea agreement by advocating a six-level sentencing enhancement on the basis of information that was known to the Government at the time of the agreement, but was not reflected in the estimated offense level in the plea agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 34; <em>see also Habbas, </em>527 F.3d at 272 n. 1 (\u201cThe problem in <em>Palladino </em>was ... the combination of the passages of the plea agreement conferring assurance that the government would not advocate for a sentence higher than the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>est\u00edmate, with the aura of unfair dealing that underlay the government\u2019s change of position\u201d and the court would have \u201creached the opposite result ... if the change had resulted from a good-faith, understandable oversight.\u201d). Here, unlike in <em>Palladino, </em>there was no change of position by the Government. The Government advocated for the \u201cvulnerable victim\u201d enhancement that Mammedov had stipulated to in the plea agreement. The unanticipated increase in Mammedov\u2019s offense level did not come from a change of position by the Government, but rather from the position taken by the Probation Department. Further, this scenario was contemplated by the plea agreement, which expressly provides that the offense level estimated in the plea agreement is not binding on the Office, the Probation Department or the District Court. Thus, <em>Palladino </em>is inapposite.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, Mammedov\u2019s conviction and sentence of imprisonment are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">II. The Restitution Order</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">When the District Court addressed restitution at sentencing, Mammedov\u2019s counsel stated that Mammedov was \u201cpenniless\u201d and \u201cgoing to be deported,\u201d and that it was not \u201cpractical or necessary that restitution be provided for\u201d because \u201c[i]t will never be accomplished.\u201d App. 62. Mammedov did not present the arguments he now raises on appeal. Thus, we review the District Court\u2019s award of restitution for plain error. <em>See United States v. Nucci, </em>364 F.3d 419, 421 (2d Cir.2004) (\u201cBecause Nucci failed to object to any aspect of the order of restitution in the court below, we review his arguments on appeal for plain error.\u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-9\">Mammedov raises two objections to the District Court\u2019s award of $325,000 in restitution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> First, Mammedov argues that the District Court\u2019s award of restitution was improper because the money earned by Mammedov\u2019s victims, and for which the District Court ordered restitution, was the result of illegal conduct, <em>i.e., </em>prostitution. This argument lacks merit for two reasons. First, this argument ignores that, either through force, fraud or coercion, or the inducement of a minor, Mammedov <em>caused </em>his victims to engage in illegal conduct. Given Mammedov\u2019s guilty plea, he knew that \u201cforce, fraud or coercion\u201d was \u201cused to cause [a] person to engage in a commercial sex act, or that [a] person ha[d] not attained the age of 18 years and [was] caused to engage in a commercial sex act.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1591(a). Even if they engaged in illegal conduct, the women involved here were still Mammedov\u2019s victims. Second, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1593(a) provides that the court <em>\u201cshall </em>order restitution for any offense under this chapter,\u201d which includes sex trafficking as proscribed by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1591. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1593(a) (emphasis added). \u201cThe order of restitution under this section shall direct the defendant to pay the victim ... the full amount of the victim\u2019s losses,\u201d <em>id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>\u00a7 1593(b)(1), and those losses \u201cshall ... include the greater of the gross income or value to the defendant of the victim\u2019s services or labor or the value of the victim\u2019s labor as guaranteed under the minimum wage and overtime guarantees of the Fair Labor Standards Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1593(b)(3). The term \u201cvictim\u201d is defined as \u201cthe individual harmed as a result of a crime under this chapter,\u201d including sex trafficking. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1593(c). Thus, the express terms of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1593 require that the victims in this case, <em>i.e., </em>persons who engaged in commercial sex acts within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1591, receive restitution, notwithstanding that their earnings came from illegal conduct. There was no plain error here.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">Mammedov\u2019s second argument is that there is insufficient basis in the record to find that the District Court considered the statutorily mandated factors when setting a restitution payment schedule. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(f)(2) requires a district coui\u2019t to \u201cspecify in the restitution order the manner in which, and the schedule according to which, the restitution is to be paid, in consideration of \u2014 (A) the financial resources and other assets of the defendant ...; (B) projected earnings and other income of the defendant; and (C) any financial obligations of the defendant....\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(f)(2). The District Court has discretion to craft an appropriate payment schedule, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3664(f)(3)(A), and a</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-6\">restitution order may direct the defendant to make nominal periodic payments if the court finds from facts on the record that the economic circumstances of the defendant do not allow the payment of any amount of a restitution order, and do not allow for the payment of the full amount of a restitution order in the foreseeable future under any reasonable schedule of payments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b951-7\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3664(f)(3)(B). Although a district court is not required to state on the record that it has considered the mandatory factors in \u00a7 3664(f)(2), <em>United States v. Walker, </em>353 F.3d 130, 134 (2d Cir.2003), if \u201cthe record does not establish that the sentencing judge considered the factors, we must vacate the restitution order and remand the case for resentencing,\u201d <em>United States v. Harris, </em>302 F.3d 72, 75 (2d Cir.2002). Further, if \u201cwe are satisfied that the required factors were considered, we then review any findings resulting therefrom for clear error, and we review the district court\u2019s choice of a restitution payment schedule for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, if a district court abuses its discretion by fashioning a restitution order that is unsupported by the record, this \u201cconstitutes an illegal sentence and amounts to plain error.\u201d <em>United States v. Mortimer, </em>52 F.3d 429, 436 (2d Cir.1995) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-8\">The District Court failed to provide a payment schedule for the $325,000 award of restitution, and, at least implicitly, ordered that amount paid immediately. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3572(d)(1) (\u201cA person sentenced to pay ... restitution, shall make such payment immediately, unless, in the interest of justice, the court provides for payment on a date certain or in installments.\u201d); <em>Nucci, </em>364 F.3d at 421. The District Court\u2019s apparent decision to require immediate payment of a $325,000 restitution award is not supported by, and is inconsistent with, the Court\u2019s findings regarding Mammedov\u2019s ability to pay. The District Court adopted the findings of the presentence report with respect to Mammedov\u2019s lack of financial assets, App. 75; PSR \u00b6\u00b6 53-57, seemed to accept Mammedov\u2019s assertion that he was \u201cpenniless,\u201d App. 62, and as a result, declined to impose a fine because of Mammedov\u2019s inability to pay, <em>Id. </em>at 60, 75. The District Court nonetheless decided to require immediate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>payment of restitution for \u201csymbolic\u201d reasons. App. 62. We have previously found that requiring the immediate payment of restitution when nothing suggests that a defendant can pay such restitution constitutes an abuse of discretion. <em>Mortimer, </em>52 F.3d at 436 (\u201c[T]he court abused its discretion in requiring that Mortimer-who filed a personal financial statement listing no assets-pay the restitution immediately.... [Njothing before the district court suggested that Mortimer would be able to pay this significant amount immediately.\u201d (citation omitted)). Thus, requiring the immediate payment of $325,000 restitution despite the District Court\u2019s finding that Mammedov lacked the ability to pay was an abuse of discretion that constitutes plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">The Government suggests that there was a basis in the record to infer that Mammedov had access to at least some financial resources, <em>i.e., </em>he supported himself with the proceeds of the prostitution business for four years and could, with the assistance of his wife, afford retained counsel. PSR \u00b6\u00b6 48, 56. But the District Court made no such findings, accepted the presentence report\u2019s finding that Mammedov lacked the ability to pay a fine, and appeared to order restitution irrespective of Mammedov\u2019s ability to pay. App. 62, 75; PSR \u00b6 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">When fashioning a payment schedule on remand, the District Court should take account of the mandatory factors laid out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(f)(2) and construct a payment schedule that is supported by the record and the District Court\u2019s findings, including additional findings it may deem appropriate, regarding Mammedov\u2019s ability to pay restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b952-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM Mammedov\u2019s conviction and sentence of imprisonment, but VACATE the District Court\u2019s restitution order and remand for proceedings consistent with this order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b949-7\">. The District Court\u2019s statement of reasons lists the total offense level as 30, App. 75, but this was clearly an error. At sentencing, the Court stated, \u201d[t]hat makes the guideline or the total offense level a 32, I believe,\u201d with both parties indicating their agreement. App. 58.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b949-11\">. It should be noted that Mammedov\u2019s sentence of 124 months, which the Government did not advocate for, was only three months above the upper range of the <em>Pimentel </em>estimate in the plea agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b950-6\">. Mammedov cites <em>United States v. Camarillo-Tello, </em>236 F.3d 1024 (9th Cir.2001), for the proposition that the Government may not change a position it has committed to in a plea agreement at the behest of a recommendation from Probation. This is true enough, but in <em>Camarillo-Tello </em>the Government failed to recommend a downward departure to the sentencing court despite having promised to do so in a plea agreement. <em>Camarillo-Tello, </em>236 F.3d at 1025, 1027. In the case at bar, the Government did not breach the requirement that it \"not seek a <em>sentence </em>above the high end of the Guidelines range set forth in paragraph 2 [, <em>i.e., </em>97 to 121 months].\u201d App. 14 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b950-11\">. Although Mammedov\u2019s briefing raises a third argument, that two of the three victims to whom restitution was awarded were not part of the count of conviction, Mammedov's counsel waived this claim at oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
