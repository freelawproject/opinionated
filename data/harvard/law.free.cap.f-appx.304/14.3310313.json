A jury found each defendant guilty of Hobbs Act extortion and conspiring to commit Hobbs Act extortion. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.1951. The jury also found Romero guilty of conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of methamphetamine. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. We assume parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">Defendants raise several claims on appeal. Ferrerio argues that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to sustain his convictions and that his sentence was both procedurally and substantively unreasonable. Both Ferrerio and Romero contend that the District Court\u2019s instruction to the jury concerning the interstate commerce element of a Hobbs Act violation amounted to reversible error. Romero posits also that the District Court erred in (1) admitting into evidence certain of his victim\u2019s out-of-court statements, (2) limiting his cross examination of certain government witnesses, and (3) instructing the jury that the victim of Romero and Ferrerio, Anna Kontakosta, who did not testify but invoked her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, was \u201cequally unavailable\u201d to all parties. Romero further argues that his due process rights were violated when the government declined to grant immunity to the victim and when, according to Romero, the government improperly vouched for a government witness during its closing argument. Finally, Romero contends, and the government agrees, that his case should be remanded so that the District Court may consider whether the $10,000 fine it imposed was appropriate in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">Ferrerio\u2019s insufficiency claim, which hinges on the contention that the jury could not have found that he helped Romero hold the victim as part of an extortion scheme to recover Romero\u2019s property, is without merit. In seeking to overturn a conviction on the grounds that evidence was insufficient, a defendant bears the \u201cheavy burden,\u201d <em>United States v. Cruz, </em>363 F.3d 187, 197 (2d Cir.2004), of demonstrating that, \u201cviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, ... no reasonable trier of fact could have found all of the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Desinor, </em>525 F.3d 193, 202 (2d Cir.2008). Viewed in the light most favorable to the government, the evidence easily demonstrated that Ferrerio and Romero agreed to hold their victim hostage in Ferrerio\u2019s apartment while employing threats of physical harm to her to extort property from Torres, the victim\u2019s boyfriend. That Ferrerio might also have wanted to hold the victim hostage because of sexual designs on her, <em>see </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. at 32, does not negate the evidence which supported the jury\u2019s finding that he agreed to join and further Romero\u2019s extortion scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-10\">The District Court\u2019s instructions on the interstate commerce element of the Hobbs Act, to which defendants failed to object at trial, did not amount to plain error. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Villafuerte, </em>502 F.3d 204, 207 (2d Cir.2007) (\u201cIssues not raised in the trial court ... are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>normally deemed forfeited on appeal unless they meet our standard for plain error.\u201d); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b) (\u201cA plain error that affects substantial rights may be considered even though it was not brought to the court\u2019s attention.\u201d). Defendants correctly observe that in <em>United States v. Parkes, </em>which we decided after the trial in this case, held that a Congressional finding that local drug trafficking had a substantial effect on interstate commerce did not \u201cdispense with the need for a jury finding that each element of the Hobbs Act has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 497 F.3d 220, 229 (2d Cir.2007). Assuming, for the sake of argument, that the instruction at issue amounted to \u201cerror\u201d that was \u201cplain,\u201d we may not exercise our discretion to notice it because the government has demonstrated that the putative error does not affect the defendants\u2019 substantial rights, <em>see Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 466-67, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 <em>(1997)</em>\u2014ie., it has not \u201caffected the outcome of the district court proceedings,\u201d <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>274 F.3d 655, 667 (2d Cir.2001)\u2014 and that it has not \u201cseriously affect[ed] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings,\u201d <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">We hold that the District Court did not err in admitting into evidence certain out-of-court statements \u2014 namely, those of the victim (Kontakosta), government witness Daniel Macias, and Detective Mark Fishstein. The admission of these statements violated neither Romero\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights under the Confrontation Clause, nor the Federal Rules of Evidence. As a general rule, \u201c[ejvidentiary rulings are reversed only if they are \u2018manifestly erroneous,\u2019 such that the admission constitutes an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>See United States v. SKW Metals &amp; Alloys, </em>195 F.3d 83, 87-88 (2d Cir.1999). Here, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in determining that some of the victim\u2019s statements were admissible as excited utterances, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Evid. 803(2), statements for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Evid. 803(4), or statements against interest, <em>see </em>Fed. R.Evid. 804(b)(3). Furthermore, none of the victim\u2019s challenged out-of-court statements were testimonial, <em>see Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 68, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004); <em>United States v. Saget, </em>377 F.3d 223, 228 (2d Cir.2004) (observing that <em>Crawford </em>suggests the determinative factor in deciding whether a declarant\u2019s statement is testimonial is the \u201cdeclarant\u2019s awareness or expectation that his or her statements may later be used at trial\u201d), and therefore were not barred by the Confrontation Clause, <em>see United States v. Feliz, </em>467 F.3d 227, 231 (2d Cir.2006) (noting that the Confrontation Clause \u201csimply has no application to nontestimonial statements\u201d). The challenged out-of-court statements of government witness Macias were admissible as prior consistent statements introduced to rebut a claim of recent fabrication. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(1)(B). Finally, Detective Fishstein\u2019s statements were not hearsay and, in any event, Romero has failed to explain how they may be regarded as prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">The Court did not abuse its discretion in limiting Romero\u2019s cross-examination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>certain government witnesses, as the evidence excluded \u2014 to wit, several unadjudicated offenses \u2014 was of marginal relevance, at most. <em>See United States v. Elfgeeh, </em>515 F.3d 100, 124 (2d Cir.2008) (noting that a \u201cdistrict court has wide latitude insofar as the Confrontation Clause is concerned to impose reasonable limits on ... cross-examination based on concerns about, among other things, harassment, prejudice, confusion of the issues ... or interrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted))</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">Romero\u2019s due process claims are without merit. First, as Romero never requested that Kontakosta be immunized, he has no claim on appeal that his rights were violated by the government\u2019s failure to immunize her. <em>Cf. United States v. Ebbers, </em>458 F.3d 110, 118 (2d Cir.2006) (noting that the government \u201cis under no general obligation to grant use immunity to witnesses the defense designates as potentially helpful to its cause, but who will invoke the Fifth Amendment if not immunized\u201d). Second, the government\u2019s remarks concerning the credibility of a key government witness were not improper because it was clear in context that the prosecutor was explaining how the evidence justified the jury in believing the witness\u2019s testimony. This was not an instance of asking the jury to trust the prosecutor\u2019s assurance of a witness\u2019s honesty. <em>See United States v. Carr, </em>424 F.3d 213, 227 (2d Cir.2005) (\u201cIt is well established that prosecutors may not vouch for their witnesses\u2019 truthfulness.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">The District Court did not err in instructing the jury that the victim \u2014 who, as noted, invoked her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination \u2014 was equally unavailable to all parties. On appeal, Romero argues that he was entitled to a \u201cmissing witness\u201d instruction. However, our precedents do not generally compel such an instruction when a potential witness invokes her Fifth Amendment privilege, <em>see United States v. Myerson, </em>18 F.3d 153, 158 (2d Cir.1994) (observing that \u201cdespite the government\u2019s power to grant immunity, a witness invoking his constitutional rights is unavailable to the government as well as the defense, and no missing witness charge need be given\u201d), and we hold that the \u201cmissing witness\u201d instruction was not warranted under the circumstances presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">Notwithstanding Ferrerio\u2019s contentions to the contrary, his 87-month sentence \u2014 the bottom of the applicable Guidelines range \u2014 was not procedurally unreasonable, and was not substantively unreasonable insofar as it did not reflect an abuse of the District Court\u2019s discretion in applying the factors outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 600, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) (holding that if a sentence is \u201cprocedurally sound\u201d a reviewing court must consider \u201csubstantive reasonableness\u201d by considering \u201cwhether the District Court abused his discretion in determining that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors supported\u201d the sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-12\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-13\">Finally, we agree with Romero, as does the government, that remand is appropriate for the District Court to consider whether to impose a fine in this case. In imposing a fine, the Court erroneously observed that the debt would \u201cmake [Romero] eligible for obtaining a job during ... incarceration.\u201d In fact, a fine is not a prerequisite for obtaining employment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>during incarceration, though it may result in priority for an individual. <em>See </em>28 C.F.R. \u00a7 345.33(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the March 3, 2006 and May 17, 2007 judgments of the District Court are AFFIRMED, except with respect to the fine imposed on Romero. By agreement of the parties, we REMAND Romero\u2019s cause solely for the purpose of requiring the District Court to reconsider whether to impose a fine.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b41-7\">. Since the government has made this demonstration, we need not determine if the \"modified\u201d plain error standard previously employed by this court survives after <em>Johnson, </em>520 U.S. at 466-67, 117 S.Ct. 1544. <em>See, e.g., Thomas, </em>274 F.3d at 668 n. 15 (leaving this question open).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
