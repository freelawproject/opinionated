Wilmot argues that the Board erred in determining that substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that the settlement payment was compensation entirely for permanent partial disability. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">The facts and procedural history of this case are familiar to the parties and we do not repeat them here. We review the Board\u2019s decision \u201cfor errors of law and adherence to the substantial evidence standard.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Dir., OWCP, </em>201 F.3d 1234, 1238 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">An analysis of the settlement agreement reveals substantial evidence in the record on which the ALJ (and the Board) could have decided that the entire $37,500 payment was compensation for Wilmot\u2019s permanent partial disability. The agreement noted that Wilmot had reached maximum medical improvement and that he had returned to work \u2014 the very definition of a permanent partial disability. <em>See Gen. Constr. Co v. Castro, </em>401 F.3d 963, 968-69 (9th Cir.2005). The agreement explicitly (and separately) disposed of any temporary disability benefits. The agreement also expressly noted that all medical benefits would be calculated separately. Although the agreement stated that a \u201cscheduled award for permanent partial disability of the right leg at 10%\u201d would equal $14,781.60, less than half the amount actually paid, it also noted that \u201cthe nature and the extent of the permanent impairment\u201d were in dispute and that Wilmot\u2019s examining physician rated the impairment at \u201c25-30% disability.\u201d Finally, the payment form listed the $37,500 as payment for \u201cpermanent partial (non-schedule[d])\u201d disability. Although Wilmot\u2019s injury was a scheduled one, and thus the payment form incorrectly categorized the injury as \u201cnonsehedule[d],\u201d the classification of the payment as for \u201cpermanent-partial\u201d disability, rather than for temporary partial, temporary total, or permanent total disability, is persuasive evidence of the nature of the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b539-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
