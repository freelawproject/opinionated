Because Ivey failed to rebut by clear and convincing evidence the presumption of correctness due the state court\u2019s factual findings that a disputed juror was qualified to be empanelled, and that his trial counsel had no actual conflict of interest, and because the state court\u2019s determination that Ivey\u2019s appellate counsel was not ineffective was not an unreasonable application of clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court, we affirm the judgment of the district court dismissing the petition with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-16\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-17\">In January 1993, Ivey and Vincent Neumon escaped from jail in Alabama, stole a vehicle, and drove to Neumon\u2019s hometown of Columbia, South Carolina. They then abducted Robert Montgomery in his minivan and, according to Neumon, Ivey later shot Montgomery to death. They subsequently drove to Atlanta with Patricia Perkins, where they stole another car. The trio then drove to a mall in Orangeburg, South Carolina, where Perkins and Neumon aroused suspicion by attempting to buy several hundred dollars of merchandise with checks and identification taken from the latest stolen car. During a confrontation with Sergeant Thomas Harrison, an Orangeburg police officer, Ivey shot Harrison to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-18\">Neumon subsequently confessed to his role in these crimes and entered into a plea agreement requiring him to testify against Ivey. The Harrison case was prosecuted first and Ivey was found guilty of Harrison\u2019s murder and sentenced to death. Neumon testified in both the guilt and penalty phases of that trial. Ivey was subsequently prosecuted for Montgomery\u2019s kidnapping, robbery, and murder. In July 1995, he was convicted of these offenses and again sentenced to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-19\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-20\">Kawiana Young was a member of the venire for the Montgomery trial. During <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>voir dire, Young stated at times that she would always vote to impose the death penalty upon a defendant convicted of murder. However, during other portions of her voir dire, Young stated that she would keep an open mind, listen to both sides, and determine the best outcome for that particular case. Ivey moved to strike Young for cause but the state trial court found \u201cshe\u2019s a qualified juror given the totality of her responses.\u201d (J.A. 41-61.)</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Although he had already testified against Ivey in the guilt and sentencing phases of the Harrison trial and the guilt phase of the Montgomery trial, Neumon refused to testify during the sentencing phase of the Montgomery trial. The trial court granted the prosecution\u2019s motion to call Neumon as a court\u2019s witness. Neumon continued to refuse to testify, whereupon the court cited him for contempt, declared him an unavailable witness, and allowed the prosecution to read portions of his testimony from the Harrison trial. Ivey objected that reading Neumon\u2019s testimony from the Harrison trial would prevent Ivey from cross-examining him \u2014 that his cross-examination might be substantially different than that in the Harrison trial and that this process was prejudicial. The trial court overruled the objection and Neumon\u2019s testimony from the Harrison trial was read into the record in the sentencing phase of the Montgomery trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">On direct appeal to the Supreme Court of South Carolina for his convictions and death sentence in the Montgomery trial, Ivey was represented by Joseph Savitz, deputy chief attorney in the state\u2019s Office of Appellate Defense. Savitz argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that juror Young should not have been seated and that the trial court unduly influenced the jury by calling Neumon as a court\u2019s witness. Savitz did not raise a Confrontation Clause challenge to the admission of Neumon\u2019s testimony from the Harrison trial. In <em>South Carolina v. Ivey, </em>331 S.C. 118, 502 S.E.2d 92, 95 (1998), <em>cert. denied, </em>525 U.S. 1075, 119 S.Ct. 812, 142 L.Ed.2d 671 (1999), the Supreme Court of South Carolina affirmed Ivey\u2019s convictions and death sentence from the Montgomery trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-10\">In the Montgomery trial, Ivey was represented by Doyet \u201cJack\u201d Early, court-appointed counsel, and Michael Culler, a public defender. In 2001, while pursuing his state collateral review, Ivey discovered that Culler had been appointed to represent Perkins in proceedings related to the earlier Harrison trial. However, Culler had been permitted to withdraw from representing Perkins based on a letter he \u2022wrote to the trial court stating that he had a \u201cconflict of interest\u201d because \u201cOfficer Tom Harrison, who was killed in this incident, was a personal friend.\u201d (J.A. 310.) When Ivey then raised the issue of Culler\u2019s conflict of interest during trial in the state collateral proceeding, Culler confirmed that he had written the letter but denied any personal relationship with Harrison or that any conflict had, in fact, existed. Culler testified that his relationship with Harrison was merely professional and tangential, that the letter was inaccurate, and that he had no explanation for how it had come to be written. In addition, Early testified that \u201cCuller never acted less than zealous in Ivey\u2019s defense and he appeared to be absolutely interested in saving Ivey\u2019s life.\u201d (JA. 481.)</p>\n<p id=\"b170-11\">F.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-12\">Among the grounds for relief raised in his petition for state collateral review, Ivey <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>alleged (1) that Culler\u2019s recently discovered withdrawal from representing Perkins reflected an actual conflict of interest that deprived Ivey of effective assistance of trial counsel, and (2) that Savitz deprived him of effective assistance of appellate counsel by failing to challenge Young\u2019s inclusion on the jury and failing to challenge the admission of Neumon\u2019s testimony from the Harrison trial on Confrontation Clause grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">After comparing the contents of Culler\u2019s withdrawal letter with Culler and Early\u2019s testimony, the state court found that the letter\u2019s contents were factually inaccurate, that Culler \u201chad no personal relationship with Officer Harrison,\u201d and \u201cno conflict of interest existed\u201d in Culler\u2019s representation of Ivey. (J.A. 482.) The state court also determined that Savitz had not been ineffective because the use of Neumon\u2019s prior testimony from the Harrison trial did not violate the Confrontation Clause. Finally, the court ruled that Ivey did not prove that Savitz had been ineffective for failing to challenge Young\u2019s inclusion on the jury because Savitz <em>had </em>raised that challenge on appeal. Accordingly, the state court denied Ivey\u2019s petition for post-conviction collateral relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">In a federal habeas petition in the district court, Ivey renewed his claims that Culler had an actual conflict of interest that deprived Ivey of effective assistance of counsel at trial and that Savitz\u2019s failure to challenge Neumon\u2019s testimony on Confrontation Clause grounds deprived him of effective assistance of counsel on appeal. Ivey also challenged on the merits the trial court\u2019s inclusion of Young on the jury. The district court denied Ivey\u2019s petition. Ivey timely filed a notice of appeal and the district court granted a certificate of appealability pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-12\">Ivey contends the district court erred in denying his \u00a7 2254 petition because (1) Young\u2019s responses to questions during voir dire show that she was not impartial about the application of the death penalty, (2) Culler\u2019s letter requesting withdrawal from representation of Patricia Perkins demonstrates that Culler had an actual conflict of interest adversely affecting his performance at trial, and (3) Savitz\u2019s failure to raise a Confrontation Clause challenge to the use of Neumon\u2019s prior testimony constituted ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-13\">This Court reviews the denial of a \u00a7 2254 petition de novo, applying the same standards applicable in the district court. <em>Jackson v. Johnson, </em>523 F.3d 273, 276 (4th Cir.2008). \u201cAn granted\u201d on any claim adjudicated in state proceedings unless that adjudication:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-14\">(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or (2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-15\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) (2000). When assessing whether the state court\u2019s determination of facts is unreasonable, we presume those determinations are correct unless the applicant rebuts \u201cthe presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1) (2000); <em>Lenz v. Washington, </em>444 F.3d 295, 300-01 (4th Cir.2006).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">Ivey contends that Young\u2019s responses to questioning during voir dire established that she believed death to be the only appropriate sentence for a person convicted of murder. Because this issue was considered during Ivey\u2019s direct appeal,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> it \u201cwas adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The Sixth Amendment guarantees the accused a right to trial by an impartial jury, <em>Fullwood v. Lee, </em>290 F.3d 663, 677 (4th Cir.2002), which precludes the qualification of a juror predisposed in all cases to impose the death penalty:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-6\">A juror who will automatically vote for the death penalty in every case ... has already formed an opinion on the merits^] the presence or absence of either aggravating or mitigating circumstances is entirely irrelevant to such a juror.... If even one such juror is empaneled and the death sentence is imposed, the State is disentitled to execute the sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AdD\"><em>Morgan v. Illinois, </em>504 U.S. 719, 729, 112 S.Ct. 2222, 119 L.Ed.2d 492 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">However, the question of Young\u2019s impartiality is a question of fact and the state court\u2019s determination of that issue is entitled to the \u00a7 2254(e)(1) statutory presumption of correctness, <em>see Wainwright v. Witt, </em>469 U.S. 412, 429, 105 S.Ct. 844, 83 L.Ed.2d 841 (1985), which Ivey has not overcome by clear and convincing evidence. Ivey does nothing more than point to that portion of Young\u2019s voir dire, already considered by the trial court, where she stated a preference for the death penalty. However, Ivey\u2019s argument ignores the totality of Young\u2019s voir dire testimony, particularly those portions where she indicated she would obey the court\u2019s instructions, \u201ccould vote for a life sentence,\u201d and would consider all the evidence during the sentencing phase to arrive at what was \u201cappropriate, given the circumstances of a particular case.\u201d (J.A.48.) Accordingly, the state courts\u2019 determination that Young was a qualified juror was not \u201can unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented.\u201d Thus, we find no error in the district court\u2019s denial of Ivey\u2019s petition on this ground.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Ivey also contends that Culler\u2019s letter requesting withdrawal from representation of Perkins in the Harrison trial proves an actual conflict of interest on the part of his trial counsel, which deprived Ivey of the effective assistance of counsel. Because this issue was considered during Ivey\u2019s state habeas review, it \u201cwas adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-6\">The Sixth Amendment guarantees an accused the right to effective assistance of counsel, <em>see Strickland v. Washington, </em>[466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984)], and an essential aspect of this right is a lawyer unhindered by conflicts of interest. In general, to prevail on an ineffective assistance claim, a petitioner must establish (1) that his lawyer\u2019s performance was deficient by showing that his performance fell below an objectively reasonable standard, and (2) that his deficient performance prejudiced the petitioner\u2019s case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-7\">We have recognized that, as a general proposition, the effective performance of counsel requires meaningful compliance with the duty of loyalty and the duty to avoid conflicts of interest, and a breach of these basic duties can lead to ineffective representation. When a petitioner premises his ineffective assistance claim on the existence of a conflict of interest, the claim is subjected to the specific standard spelled out in <em>Cuyler v. Sullivan, </em>[446 U.S. 335, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 64 L.Ed.2d 333 (1980)], instead of that articulated in <em>Strickland. </em>To establish that a conflict of interest resulted in ineffective assistance, more than a mere possibility of a conflict must be shown. The petitioner must show (1) that his lawyer was under an actual conflict of interest and (2) that this conflict adversely affected his lawyer\u2019s performance. If the petitioner can show an actual conflict, and that it adversely affected his lawyer\u2019s performance, prejudice is presumed and there is no need to demonstrate a reasonable probability that, but for the lawyer\u2019s conflict of interest, the trial or sentencing outcome would have been different. [A]n adverse effect is not presumed from the existence of an actual conflict of interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-11\"><em>United States v. Nicholson, </em>475 F.3d 241, 248-249 (4th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks, alterations, and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-12\">\u201cThe question whether a conflict of interest impermissibly tainted an attorney\u2019s performance is a mixed question of law and fact ... that calls for \u2018the application of legal principles to the historical facts of [a given] case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Familia-Consoro v. United States, </em>160 F.3d 761, 764 (1st Cir. 1998) (quoting <em>Cuyler, </em>446 U.S. at 342, 100 S.Ct. 1708). Nevertheless, the state habeas court\u2019s findings of those historical facts are entitled to the statutory presumption of correctness, <em>Freund v. Butterworth, </em>165 F.3d 839, 862 (11th Cir.1999), which Ivey has again faded to overcome by clear and convincing evidence. Ivey has done little more than point to Culler\u2019s letter, already determined by the state habeas court not to have created a conflict of interest because its contents were inaccurate. On that basis, Ivey has fallen far short of rebutting by clear and convincing evidence the state court\u2019s determination that Culler had no personal relationship with Harrison, and therefore no actual conflict of interest. The state habeas court\u2019s determination was thus not \u201can unreasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented.\u201d Accordingly, we find no error in the district court\u2019s denial of Ivey\u2019s petition on ground of conflict of interest by Culler.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Ivey further contends that Savitz\u2019s failure to challenge the admission of Neumon\u2019s prior testimony on Confrontation Clause grounds constituted ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. Because this issue was considered during Ivey\u2019s state habeas review, it \u201cwas adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-6\">.... Th[e] right to effective assistance of counsel extends to require such assistance on direct appeal of a criminal conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-7\">In order to establish a claim that appellate counsel was ineffective for fading to pursue a claim on direct appeal, the applicant must normally demonstrate (1) that his counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness in light of the prevailing professional norms, and (2) that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-8\">In applying this test to claims of ineffective assistance of counsel on appeal, however, reviewing courts must accord appellate counsel the presumption that he decided which issues were most likely to afford relief on appeal. Counsel is not obligated to assert all nonfrivolous issues on appeal, as there can hardly be any question about the importance of having the appellate advocate examine the record with a view to selecting the most promising issues for review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-12\"><em>Bell v. Jarvis, </em>236 F.3d 149, 164 (4th Cir. 2000) (internal quotation marks, alterations, and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-13\">The state habeas court determined that the Confrontation Clause jurisprudence flowing from <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980), applicable at the time of Ivey\u2019s appeal,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> would not have barred the use of Neumon\u2019s prior testimony. For that reason, the state court concluded that Ivey could not meet the second prong of the ineffectiveness analysis because the results of his direct appeal would not have been different even if Savitz had raised the issue.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b174-14\">In <em>Roberts, </em>the Supreme Court stated that the Confrontation Clause was not offended when the prior testimony of an unavailable witness was admitted with \u201cindicia of reliability\u201d allowing the fact-finder to evaluate the truth of the prior statement. 448 U.S. at 65-66, 100 S.Ct. 2531. The Supreme Court ultimately held that where \u201cthere was an adequate opportunity to cross-examine [the witness], and counsel ... availed himself of that opportunity, the transcript ... bore sufficient indicia of reliability and afforded the trier of fact a satisfactory basis for evaluating the truth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>of the prior statement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 73, 100 S.Ct. 2531 (internal quotation marks omitted). <em>Roberts </em>therefore did not bar Neumon\u2019s prior testimony from the Harrison trial, where Neumon had been available for and subjected to cross-examination by Ivey in that proceeding.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>, <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Consequently, Ivey\u2019s claim does not meet the requirements of \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">The state court\u2019s determination that Savitz was not ineffective because the outcome of Ivey\u2019s direct appeal would not have been different had Savitz raised the issue was not \u201ca decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law.\u201d Thus, we find no error in the district court\u2019s denial of Ivey\u2019s petition on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b171-7\">. Ivey contends that \"some tension appears to exist between \u00a7 2254(e)(1), under which state court factual findings are presumed to be correct, and \u00a7 2254(d)(2), which can only be read as requiring federal habeas courts to look beneath a state court's factual findings to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>assess their reasonableness in light of the record that was before the state court.\u201d (Br. Appellant 15.) Ivey argues that the district court should have undertaken the latter approach in his case and determined de novo whether the state court\u2019s factual findings are reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">A similar argument was made by the applicant in <em>Lent. </em>In that case, this Court, relying in part on <em>Miller-El v. Dretke, </em>545 U.S. 231, 125 S.Ct. 2317, 162 L.Ed.2d 196 (2005), held that a state court's factual findings are presumed to be sound in a \u00a7 2254(d)(2) review for reasonableness unless rebutted by clear and convincing evidence as required by \u00a7 2254(e)(1). 444 F.3d at 300-01. Our precedent in <em>Lenz, </em>which the district court applied below, controls here. <em>See, e.g., McMellon v. United States, </em>387 F.3d 329, 334 (4th Cir. 2004) (restating the well-established rule that one panel of this Court may not overrule another).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b172-10\">. Because Ivey raised the issue of Young's impartiality on the merits at trial and in the state supreme court on direct appeal, his failure to present that issue in his state habeas petition does not preclude our consideration of the issue here. <em>See Woodford v. Ngo, </em>548 U.S. 81, 92, 126 S.Ct. 2378, 165 L.Ed.2d 368 (2006) (\u201cA state habeas petitioner is generally barred from obtaining federal habeas relief unless the prisoner has presented his or her claims through one \u2018complete round of the State's established appellate review process.\u2019 \" (quoting <em>O\u2019Sullivan v. Boerckel, </em>526 U.S. 838, 845, 119 S.Ct. 1728, 144 L.Ed.2d 1 (1999))).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b172-11\">. Because we conclude that the state court's determination, based upon the totality of the voir dire testimony, was not an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented, we need not consider Ivey's additional claim that the district court erred, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>under <em>Snyder v. Louisiana, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 1203, 170 L.Ed.2d 175 (2008), in relying on the trial court\u2019s ability to observe the juror\u2019s demeanor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b174-9\">. The state court correctly noted that <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), does not apply retroactively and was not applicable during the Montgomery trial. <em>See Whorton v. Bockting, </em>549 U.S. 406, 421, 127 S.Ct. 1173, 1184, 167 L.Ed.2d 1 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b174-15\">. The state habeas court also found that the Confrontation Clause issue had not been preserved for appeal as a matter of state law. Because we dispose of this issue under 28 U.S.C. 2254(d)(1), we need not consider the state\u2019s argument that Ivey procedurally defaulted habeas review of this claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b175-10\">. The fact that Ivey had different counsel in the Harrison trial is immaterial. <em>See id. </em>at 72, 100 S.Ct. 2531 (\"Nor does it matter that ... respondent had a different lawyer____ Indeed, if we were to accept this suggestion ... a defendant could\u201d evade the rule merely by changing counsel.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b175-13\">. The <em>Roberts </em>Court also stated that \u201d[r]eliability can be inferred without more in a case where the evidence falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 66, 100 S.Ct. 2531. Clinging to this statement, Ivey argues that Neumon\u2019s testimony was improperly admitted based on <em>state </em>evidentiary rules proscribing hearsay. Because our review is limited to \"clearly established <em>Federal </em>law\u201d and because <em>Roberts </em>supports the use of Neumon\u2019s testimony, we do not consider this argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
