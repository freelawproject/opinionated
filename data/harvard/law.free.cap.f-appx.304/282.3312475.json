Duong untimely appeals his sentence, arguing that the district court erred by assessing a two-level enhancement pursuant to the United States Sentencing Guidelines for his leadership role in the drug conspiracy. Finding no error, we affirm Duong\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-18\">On June 15, 2006, a Grand Jury sitting in the Eastern District of Louisiana returned a four-count Indictment, charging Duong and two co-conspirators with various drug-related crimes. The Indictment specifically charged Duong with Conspiracy to Possess With Intent To Distribute quantities of 3.4-methylenedioxy-n-meth-lyamphetamine (\u201cMDMA\u201d), in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, and Possession with Intent to Distribute MDMA, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and 841(b)(1)(C). On September 25, 2006, Duong pleaded guilty to both counts. At a sentencing hearing on January 9, 2007, the district court overruled Duong\u2019s objections regarding the sentence enhancement and sentenced Duong to 108 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-19\">On August 20, 2007, Duong filed his Pro Se Notice of Appeal. In his Notice, Duong argued that his attorney agreed to file an appeal on his behalf but never did so. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>December 27, 2007, a Federal Public Defender was appointed to represent Duong. Duong\u2019s new counsel subsequently filed a habeas corpus petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The \u00a7 2255 motion was stayed pending the outcome of Duong\u2019s direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4 states in relevant part that \u201c[i]n a criminal case, a defendant\u2019s notice of appeal must be filed in the district court within 10 days after ... the entry of ... judgment[.]\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A). Duong filed his notice of appeal more than six months after the district court\u2019s entry of judgment, making his appeal untimely. However, Rule 4(b)(1)(A)\u2019s time limit \u201cis mandatory, but not jurisdictional, because it does not derive from a statute.\u201d <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>496 F.3d 387, 388 (5th Cir.2007) (citing the analysis of Rule 4(a) in <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, ---, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 2364-66, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007)). Accordingly, Rule 4(b)\u2019s time-limit may be waived. <em>See id. </em>(citing <em>Bowles, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2365).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">Duong argues that the Government waived its timeliness objection to Duong\u2019s appeal because the Government did not make its objection before the Government filed its appellate response brief. Duong concedes that this Court has never held that an appellee waives a timeliness objection pursuant to Rule 4(b) when it does not raise the objection until its response brief. However, Duong urges this Court to adopt such an interpretation of Rule 4(b). He argues that doing so would save judicial resources and prevent potential conflicts of interest for defense counsel, who may be forced to raise and defend against a timeliness deficiency in an initial brief that may otherwise be overlooked by the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-11\">We acknowledge the potential economy of judicial resources that may result from Duong\u2019s proposed interpretation, as well as the Gordian knot the current interpretation may at times create for defense counsel.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, nothing in Rule 4(b) or in this Court\u2019s precedents requires an appellee to file a motion to dismiss based on timeliness before filing a brief on the merits. In addition, several other circuits have held that an appellee does not waive its right to object to an appeal\u2019s timeliness by including the objection in its brief on the merits. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Garduno, </em>506 F.3d 1287, 1292 n. 7 (10th Cir.2007) (failure to raise timeliness issue \u201cdoes not constitute forfeiture where, as here, appellee seeks dismissal for failure to timely appeal in its response brief.\u201d); <em>United States v. Sadler, </em>480 F.3d 932, 941 (9th Cir.2007) (\u201c[n]o rule exists in this circuit ... <em>requiring </em>an appellee to raise any objection to the timeliness of the appeal prior to briefing.\u201d) (emphasis in original); <em>United States v. Singletary, </em>471 F.3d 193, 196 (D.C.Cir.2006) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-12\">Given the absence of authority or precedent for Duong\u2019s interpretation of Rule 4(b), we decline to adopt it. Accordingly, we hold that the Government did not waive its objection to the timeliness of Duong\u2019s appeal by raising it for the first time in its brief on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-13\">In the alternative, Duong argues that even if the Government did not waive its timeliness objection to Duong\u2019s appeal, the ten-day deadline should be equitably tolled under his circumstances. Duong argues that, even though he specifically requested an appeal, his attorney failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>file an appeal on his behalf after stating that he would, and failed for months to tell him that no appeal had been filed. For our purposes today, we will not question that these circumstances justify an out-of-time appeal. The appeal nonetheless fails. Duong argues that the district court erred when it assessed a two-level enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 3B1.1(c) of the United States Sentencing Guidelines for Duong\u2019s leadership role in the drug conspiracy. Duong further argues that the factual basis to which he pleaded shows only a buyer-seller relationship. Having reviewed the record, we find no error in the district court\u2019s assessment of a two-level sentence enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b307-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b308-8\">. We also note, however, that the potential conflict of interest does not arise in the instant case because Duong\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion already informed the Government of his lawyer\u2019s failure to timely file a notice of appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
