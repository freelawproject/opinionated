After the United States Attorney certified that Donelan was acting within the scope of her employment at the time of the conduct alleged in the complaint, the United States, pursuant to the Federal Employees Liability Reform and Tort Compensation Act of 1988, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679 (2000), substituted itself as defendant in Childress\u2019s action, removed the action to federal court, and then moved pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1) to have Childress\u2019s action dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-25\">Although Childress opposed the United States\u2019 substitution, the district court determined that Donelan was acting within the scope of her employment at the time of the conduct alleged in Childress\u2019s complaint, denied Childress\u2019s motion to deny the United States\u2019 substitution, and grant<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>ed the United States\u2019 motion to dismiss Childress\u2019s state law tort claims.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Childress v. United States, </em>No. 3:07-cv-03312-RJC (D.S.C. filed Mar. 13, 2008; entered Mar. 14, 2008). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b194-15\"> It was undisputed that if the United States was correctly substituted as defendant in Childress\u2019s action, the action was subject to Rule 12(b)(1) dismissal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(h) (2000); <em>Goldstar (Panama) </em>S.A. <em>v.
