For the reasons that follow, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">Inasmuch as we are writing primarily for the parties who are familiar with this case, we need not set forth the factual or procedural background of this appeal except insofar as may be helpful to our brief discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">We have reviewed the thorough and thoughtful Memorandum of the district court dated November 30, 2007, in which the court explains its reasoning for granting summary judgment and dismissing the complaint. We have also reviewed the equally thoughtful and thorough Memorandum dated August 4, 2006, in which the district court explains its consideration of counsel\u2019s motion for recusal, the application of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455, and its reasons for imposing sanctions on counsel pursuant to Rule 11(b). We will affirm both orders substantially for the reasons set forth in those Memorandum Opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">This record clearly supports the court\u2019s conclusion that sanctions were appropriate because lesser sanctions \u201cwere clearly insufficient to curb Attorney Bailey\u2019s actions.\u201d App. 76. We pause only to note that, far from evidencing the bias that counsel attempted to establish, this record reflects that Hon. Christopher C. Conner acted with fairness and admirable patience and in presiding over this suit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
