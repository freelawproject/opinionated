May 12, 2008), <em>aff'g </em>No. A99 538 153 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Dec. 12, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">When the BIA affirms the IJ\u2019s decision in some respects but not others, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as modified by the BIA decision, <em>i.e., </em>minus the arguments for denying relief that were rejected by the BIA. <em>See Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005). Moreover, when the IJ\u2019s decision rests on multiple alternate grounds and the BIA adopts and affirms that decision without expressly addressing each of the grounds, we may review the entire IJ decision and need not confine our review to the grounds expressly addressed by the BIA. <em>See Ming Xia Chen v. BIA, </em>435 F.3d 141, 144 (2d Cir.2006). Here, the IJ made an adverse credibility determination and an alternate burden of proof finding. The BIA, in turn, \u201cadopt[ed] and affirm[ed]\u201d the IJ\u2019s decision, rejected two of the IJ\u2019s credibility findings, and did not address the IJ\u2019s burden of proof finding. In such circumstances, we review the IJ\u2019s decision, minus the two findings the BIA rejected. <em>See Xue Hong Yang, </em>426 F.3d at 522; <em>Ming Xia Chen, </em>435 F.3d at 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">In support of his decision, the IJ found that Chen failed to meet his burden in establishing eligibility for the relief he requested. As the Government asserts, Chen failed to challenge that finding before the BIA, thus failing to exhaust any such argument. <em>See Foster v. INS, </em>376 F.3d 75, 78 (2d Cir.2004) (holding that petitioners must raise to the BIA the specific issues they later raise in this Court); <em>Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 119-20, 124 (2d Cir.2007) (stating that while not a jurisdictional issue, this judicially imposed exhaustion requirement is mandatory and an \u201caffirmative defense-subject to waiver\u201d). Because the IJ\u2019s burden of proof finding was alone dispositive of each of Chen\u2019s claims, the petition for review must be denied regardless of whether the IJ\u2019s credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
