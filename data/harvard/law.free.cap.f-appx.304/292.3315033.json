(the Fair Housing Act, or \u201cFHA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and parallel state law in connection with Ali\u2019s eviction action against Wells. Cavanaugh and Hanlon moved for dismissal, and Ali moved for summary judgment. United States District Judge John V. Parker dismissed with prejudice the claims against Cavanaugh on March 29, 2007, pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), and dismissed Hanlon from the suit without prejudice on October 26, 2007, pursu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>ant to Rule 4(m), on the grounds that Wells failed to serve him properly. Wells appealed, but at that time, no judgment had yet been rendered below on one of his claims (the one against Ali), so we dismissed all claims without prejudice for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See Wells v. Ali, </em>No. 07-31059, slip op. (5th Cir. Jan. 8, 2008) (citing <em>Thompson v. Betts, </em>754 F.2d 1243, 1245 (5th Cir.1985)). The district court granted summary judgment in Ali\u2019s favor on May 13, 2008. Wells now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">In substance, Wells\u2019s pleadings contend that defendants racially discriminated against him in violation of the above-mentioned federal statutes. Wells failed to brief his state-law claims; accordingly, they are waived.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> <em>Ruiz v. United States, </em>160 F.3d 273, 275 (5th Cir.1998). We affirm the judgments of the district court in their entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">I. Wells\u2019s Claims against Cavanaugh</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">Wells claimed that Cavanaugh, a Justice of the Peace in East Baton Rouge Parish in Louisiana, violated his rights under \u00a7 1983 and the FHA in connection with his eviction. Specifically, Wells\u2019s complaint alleges that Cavanaugh \u201chad plaintiff evicted\u201d and \u201cis still holding monies\u201d related to those eviction proceedings. In addition, his brief claims she called Wells, who is African-American, a repugnant racial epithet and \u201cattack[ed] him [and] snatch[ed] [sic] the door as he was leaving [her office] during her tirade.\u201d Wells\u2019s claims against Cavanaugh were dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, and on the basis of judicial and Eleventh Amendment immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">We review dismissals under Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) <em>de novo, </em>and according to the same standard. <em>Fernandez-Montes v. Allied Pilots Ass\u2019n, </em>987 F.2d 278, 284 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Benton v. United States, </em>960 F.2d 19, 21 (5th Cir.1992). That standard requires us to take the factual allegations of the complaint as true and resolve ambiguities in the plaintiffs favor. <em>Benton, </em>960 F.2d at 21. \u201c[C]onclusory allegations or legal conclusions masquerading as factual conclusions will not suffice to prevent a motion to dismiss,\u201d however. <em>Fernandez-Montes, </em>987 F.2d at 284. We construe pro se litigants\u2019 pleadings liberally, <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983), but pro se litigants are not exempt from compliance with the relevant rules of procedure and substantive law, <em>Birl v. Estelle, </em>660 F.2d 592, 593 (5th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-11\">\n<em>A. Judicial Immunity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b317-12\">Even taking Wells\u2019s bare, unsupported allegations against Cavanaugh as true, his suit against her would be barred. Judges enjoy absolute immunity from suit for acts undertaken in their judicial capacity. <em>Mireles v. Waco, </em>502 U.S. 9, 10, 112 S.Ct. 286, 116 L.Ed.2d 9 (1991) (finding judicial immunity to be absolute and \u201cnot overcome by allegations of bad faith or malice\u201d or corruption). Because Wells alleges conduct in connection with Cavanaugh\u2019s official acts, his claims trigger judicial immunity. The Supreme Court has explained that two limited exceptions to this doctrine exist: acts the judge takes in a non-judicial capacity, and \u201cactions, though judicial in nature, taken in the complete absence of all jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11-12, 112 S.Ct. 286. Neither exception applies here.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>According to Wells\u2019s pleadings, Cavanaugh (1) ordered him evicted and held money relating to the eviction proceeding, and (2) slammed shut the door to her chambers and hurled a racist epithet at him while ordering him out of her chambers. The first pair of Cavanaugh\u2019s actions appear to have been a plain exercise of Cavanaugh\u2019s judicial authority. Although he claims her acts exceeded her jurisdiction (he does not specify which acts, but we will consider him to have alleged that all did), Wells offers no legal support whatsoever for that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">The district court properly found that the second pair also constituted official acts because they allegedly arose out of Wells\u2019s visit to Cavanaugh\u2019s official chambers. As a result, the repugnant nature of the word Wells claims Cavanaugh used and her alleged slamming of the door would not strip her of judicial immunity, as Wells claims both acts occurred in the course of his visit to the judge\u2019s chambers about his case before her, and arose from that visit. They therefore satisfy this circuit\u2019s four-part judicial immunity test. <em>See Ammons v. Baldwin, 705 </em>F.2d 1445, 1447 (5th Cir.1983). This is so even though the use of a racial epithet by a sitting judge would be outrageous and an insult to both a litigant and the judge\u2019s own office. In addition, although threats of physical force by a judge do not constitute a normal judicial function entitled to immunity, slamming a door falls far short of such a threat. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 1448 (affirming dismissal of \u00a7 1983 action because plaintiff failed to allege the judge placed him \u201cin fear of imminent harm, or that [the judge] took any actions indicating an immediate intent to carry out the alleged threats\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Wells\u2019s citation to <em>Hafer v. Melo, </em>502 U.S. 21, 31, 112 S.Ct. 358, 116 L.Ed.2d 301 (1991) for the proposition that Cavanaugh may be sued notwithstanding the Eleventh Amendment\u2019s grant of immunity is inapposite. <em>Hafer </em>states that, in contrast to the executive officers whose Eleventh Amendment immunity Congress abrogated in some circumstances under \u00a7 1983 (pursuant to \u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment), \u201cjudges carrying out their judicial functions\u201d enjoy \u201cabsolute immunity ... for their official actions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29, 112 S.Ct. 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">\n<em>B. Other Mandatory Grounds for Dismissal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">Even if judicial immunity did not require dismissal, however, this court would have no choice but to dismiss Well\u2019s attempt to relitigate his eviction-related claims in federal court under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, and all claims against her on grounds of Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity, for reasons explained in the Magistrate Judge\u2019s thorough report of December 6, 2006, which the district court adopted. <em>See Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Industries Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 283, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005) (holding that federal district courts are barred by the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine from hearing cases, like Wells\u2019s, that are \u201cbrought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments\u201d) (applying <em>District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983) and <em>Rooker v. Fidelity Trust, </em>263 U.S. 413, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923)); <em>Will v. Michigan Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>491 U.S. 58, 71, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989) (holding that a suit against a state official acting in her official capacity constitutes a suit against the state and is therefore barred by the Eleventh Amendment, even if brought pursuant to \u00a7 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>For these reasons, the district court was correct to dismiss all claims against Cavanaugh.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">II. Wells\u2019s Claims against Hanlon</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">The district court dismissed all claims against Hanlon because he was not properly served. Although Wells claims this dismissal was erroneous because \u201cFederal Marshals did not complete [their] mission when their orders were to serve Tom Hanlon,\u201d and because \u201cthey [presumably the district court] ha[d] an affidavit confirming service\u201d on Hanlon, these claims are unavailing. A review of Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which prescribes the procedure for properly serving a defendant with process, reveals that the district court had no choice but to reach this result. The requirements of Rule 4 are phrased in plainly mandatory language. To comply, the plaintiff must ensure that the summons be signed by the clerk of the court and bear the court\u2019s seal (Rule 4(a)(1)(F-G)); state the time within which the defendant must appear and defend the allegations (Rule 4(a)(1)(D)); and name the court and the parties (Rule 4(a)(1)(A)). Although, as Wells contends, he satisfied some of the other conditions of service of process, he failed to satisfy these requirements. He complains of insufficient help from the U.S. Marshals, but the ultimate obligation to comply with Rule 4 lies with him, not the Marshals. Therefore the district court\u2019s dismissal of all claims against Hanlon was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">III. Wells\u2019s Claims against Ali</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">Wells\u2019s claims against Ali were dismissed by summary judgment. Ali, like Wells, proceeds pro se. We will treat Ali\u2019s papers, titled \u201cAppellee\u2019s Brief and Motion to Dismiss the Case,\u201d as a response to Wells\u2019s appeal of the grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">The court \u201creview[s] grants of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same legal standard used by the district court.\u201d <em>Chacko v. Sabre, Inc., </em>473 F.3d 604, 609 (5th Cir.2006). Summary judgment is proper \u201cif the pleadings, discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). \u201cAfter adequate time for discovery and upon motion,\u201d summary judgment is appropriate \u201cagainst a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party\u2019s case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\u201d <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986); <em>see also Gunaca v. Texas, </em>65 F.3d 467, 469 (5th Cir.1995). The moving party \u201cmust \u2018demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact,\u2019 but need not negate the elements of the nonmovant\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Little v. Liquid Air Corp., </em>37 F.3d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc) (quoting <em>Celotex, </em>477 U.S. at 323-25, 106 S.Ct. 2548). If the moving party \u201cfails to meet this initial burden, the motion must be denied, regardless of the nonmovant\u2019s response.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1075.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">Wells claims Ali discriminated against him because of his race and disability in the provision of housing, in violation of the FHA. The evidence offered below revealed the following. Wells rented an apartment from Ali in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, first by written lease (from January 11, 2005 until June 30, 2005) and then on a month-to-month basis. The lease stipulated that Wells would have two parking places on the premises. After the lease was signed, Wells began parking three vehicles there. In addition, Wells requested at some point that Ali make repairs to Wells\u2019s apartment (specifically, that he ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>range for mold to be removed), which Ai appears to have done but not to Wells\u2019s satisfaction. Wells failed to pay his September 2005 rent on time and failed to pay an assessed late fee. Ai notified Wells in writing that he was not renewing his lease, and gave him a 30-day Notice to Vacate by November 1, 2005. The reasons given were Wells\u2019s violation of the lease\u2019s provision regarding the number of parking places and his non-payment of the late fee. Wells responded that he would not remove the third vehicle under any circumstances. He also claimed that Ai had made disparaging comments to him about his disability (namely, that he did not look disabled) and had called him by the same racial epithet as Cavanaugh.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">On November 4, 2005, Ai filed a Petition of Eviction and Order; ten days later, a judgment of eviction was granted, though it was later reversed. Wells also filed an FHA complaint with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (\u201cHUD\u201d) on June 14, 2006. After conducting an investigation, HUD issued a \u201cDetermination of No Reasonable Cause\u201d letter, notifying Wells that the agency had no reasonable cause to believe that a discriminatory housing practice had occurred.<footnotemark>***</footnotemark> HUD found that between June 2005 and June 2007, Ai had thirteen tenants, all Mrican-Ameriean, of whom eight were evicted for non-payment of rent, four voluntarily moved out, and one failed to sign the lease. In addition, at the time of HUD\u2019s report, Ai was renting to three individuals; all were African-American, all were disabled, and all paid their rents on time. HUD further found that there were no disinterested witnesses to the events of which Wells had complained. On these facts, the district court found that Wells had failed to offer evidence of a genuine issue of material fact on his FHA claim against Ai sufficient to withstand summary judgment. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">For the reasons stated above, the judgments of the district court are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b316-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b317-8\"> Even if Wells\u2019s brief were understood to appeal the adverse judgments on his parallel state-law claims, the same immunity doctrines, defects in subject matter jurisdiction and service of process, and factual insufficiencies that bedeviled Wells below, <em>see infra, </em>would require dismissal of those state claims in this court as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b320-5\"> Although this court is not reviewing HUD's decision here, this letter is part of the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
