On appeal, Crossley argues that the district court erred by not suppressing the evidence the officials seized at his house, because his consent was the product of an illegal detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-22\">In reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress, we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error, and review <em>de novo </em>the application of the law to the facts. <em>United States v. Perez, </em>443 F.3d 772, 774 (11th Cir.2006). The facts are construed in the light most favorable to the party that prevailed below. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b848-23\">The Fourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures. U.S. Const, amend. IV. A seizure occurs \u201c \u2018when the officer, by means of physical force or show of authority, has in some way restrained the liberty of a citizen.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Franklin, </em>323 F.3d 1298, 1301 (11th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 19 n. 16, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1879 n. 16, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968)). The Supreme Court has held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-24\">Law enforcement officers do not violate the Fourth Amendment\u2019s prohibition of unreasonable seizures merely by approaching individuals on the street or in other public places and putting questions to them if they are willing to listen. Even when law enforcement officers have no basis for suspecting a particular individual, they may pose questions, ask for identification, and request consent to search [propertyj-provided they do not induce cooperation by coercive means. If a reasonable person would feel free to terminate the encounter, then he or she has not been seized.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b849-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number><em>United, States v. Drayton, </em>536 U.S. 194, 200-01, 122 S.Ct. 2105, 2110, 153 L.Ed.2d 242 (2002) (internal citations omitted). We have held that the following factors are relevant in determining whether a seizure occurred include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-5\">whether a citizen\u2019s path is blocked or impeded; whether identification is retained; the suspect\u2019s age, education and intelligence; the length of the suspect\u2019s detention and questioning; the number of police officers present; the display of weapons; any physical touching of the suspect, and the language and tone of voice of the police.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b849-6\"><em>Perez, </em>443 F.3d at 778 (quotations omitted). An officer\u2019s statement that an individual is the focus of an investigation also is a relevant factor. <em>See United States v. Puglisi, </em>723 F.2d 779, 783 (11th Cir.1984). However, an officer\u2019s statement that he believes that the defendant is involved in drug activity, without more, is insufficient to establish that the defendant was seized. <em>See United States v. Berry, </em>670 F.2d 583, 597 n. 13 (5th Cir. Unit B 1982) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">In <em>United States v. De La Rosa, </em>922 F.2d 675 (11th Cir.1991), the district court determined that the initial encounter between the defendant and the officers was a non-coercive encounter to which the Fourth Amendment did not apply. <em>Id. </em>at 678. In <em>De La Rosa, </em>an officer (1) blocked the defendant\u2019s car, which was parked in front of his apartment, (2) identified himself to the defendant, who was exiting the car after returning to his apartment, (3) requested and received the defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license, and (4) elicited permission to search the defendant\u2019s car before returning the license. <em>Id. </em>at 677-78. We held that, under the totality of the circumstances, a reasonable person would have felt free to leave, and thus, the officer did not seize the defendant within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 678.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">Base on our review of the record, we conclude that the district court did not err in denying Crossley\u2019s motion to suppress, based on its finding that, under the totality of the circumstances, a reasonable person would have felt free to leave. Accordingly, we affirm Crossley\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
