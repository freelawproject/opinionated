(\u201cTrumble\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. Trumble contends that the court erred when it ruled that Trumble had failed to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact on the basis of which a reasonable jury could find that Trumble\u2019s insurer, Special Risk Services Group, L.L.C., as Managing General Underwriter on Behalf of Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s of London (\u201cSRS\u201d), suffered material prejudice as a result of not receiving timely notification from Trumble of a fatal crane accident. SRS, now standing in the shoes of Trumble by virtue of subrogation, contends that untimely notice caused it prejudice by preventing it from conducting a so-called \u201cshock-loss investigation.\u201d Concluding that Trumble\u2019s summary judgment evidence does not establish a genuine issue of material fact regarding prejudice, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b261-13\">I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b261-14\">On September 26, 2003, a portion of a crane operated by Trumble on the campus of Texas Tech University came in contact with an electric power line. This resulted in the electrocution death of Richard Tankersley when he reached out to steady a bucket suspended on the end of the crane\u2019s cable. Trumble\u2019s crane operation was part of its work as a subcontractor for Deer-wood Construction, Inc. At the time of the accident, Trumble was insured by SRS. The insurance policy required that SRS receive notice of \u201coccurrences\u201d like the Tankersley accident \u201cas soon as practicable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-15\">On the day of this accident, three entities \u2014 Texas Tech University Police Department, Lubbock Power and Light, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d) \u2014 conducted independent investigations that included photographing the scene and taking witness statements. OSHA eventually cited Trumble for operating its crane too close to power lines, in violation of OSHA crane-operation regulations. During his deposition, Trumble\u2019s president, Charles Trum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>ble, conceded that the crane was located too close to the power lines. SRS did not conduct an immediate investigation of its own because it was unaware of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">As a regular practice, Trumble presents a daily work ticket to its customers for signature before starting work. Trumble\u2019s work tickets contain a \u201chold harmless clause\u201d specifying that the customer will indemnify Trumble against a variety of possible claims (not including Trumble\u2019s own negligence). For some unknown reason, Trumble did not have Deerwood sign a work ticket for the day and job in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">As soon as he learned of the accident, Charles Trumble called his insurance agent, defendant-appellee Johnny Moss, an employee of defendant-appellee White Hill Plaza, Inc. d/b/a/ K &amp; S Insurance Agency, who had placed Trumble\u2019s SRS policy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The K &amp; S Defendants did not notify SRS of the crane accident at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Less than three months after the crane accident, Tankersley\u2019s estate and survivors filed suit against Trumble and Deerwood for Tankersley\u2019s death. It was not until December 31, 2003, after the K <em>&amp; </em>S Defendants received word of the Tankersley suit, that they notified SRS of the accident. The district court set an intended trial date of early August 2005, some eighteen months after SRS first received notice of the occurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">This suit originated as a declaratory judgment action in district court brought by SRS against Trumble to determine whether SRS had a duty to defend or indemnify Trumble in the Tankersley suit, given Trumble\u2019s alleged failure to provide timely notice to SRS. Trumble then filed the instant third-party claim against the K &amp; S Defendants for their alleged negligence and breach of contract in failing to forward timely notice to SRS.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-13\">Late in 2005, SRS and Trumble reached a settlement regarding their liability vis-avis each other and agreed that the declaratory judgment action was moot. They also agreed that SRS would assert its contractual subrogation rights to step into the shoes of Trumble and continue the third-party claim that Trumble had asserted against the K &amp; S Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-14\">Trumble and the K &amp; S Defendants filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The district court granted the K &amp; S Defendants\u2019 motion and denied Trumble\u2019s. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-15\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b262-16\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b262-17\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Summary judgment is appropriate only if there is no genuine issue of material fact.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In determining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists, courts view all facts and draw all inferences therefrom in favor of the non-moving party.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court\u2019s role at the summary judgment stage is not \u201cto weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter but to determine whether there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In a diversity case like this one, the substantive law of the forum state, here Texas, controls.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">B. Whether SRS Made a Sufficient Prejudice Showing</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">1. Applicable Law</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">Under Texas law, when an insurance policy requires that the policyholder notify its insurer of any claim or suit \u201cas soon as practicable,\u201d the policyholder\u2019s \u201cfailure to timely notify its insurer of a claim or suit does not defeat coverage if the insurer was not <em>prejudiced </em>by the delay.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> And, \u201c[i]n many instances of untimely notice of a claim, the insurer is not prejudiced at all.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The prejudice requirement is consistent with the general principle \u201cthat an immaterial breach does not deprive the insurer of the benefit of the bargain and thus cannot relieve the insurer of the contractual coverage obligation.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The converse is also true: \u201c[Wjhen one party to a contract commits a material breach of that contract, the other party is discharged or excused from any obligation to perform.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u201cWhether an insurer is prejudiced by delayed notice is generally a question of fact____\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Courts may determine the issue as a matter of law, however, when the material facts are undisputed.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-17\">\u201cPrejudice\u201d is the loss of a valuable right or benefit.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Such a loss may be described as suffering a material \u201cadverse change in position due to the delay.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Because of the inherently uncertain nature of its burden \u2014 demonstrating how events may have differed under a different set of facts \u2014 an insurer need not \u201cshow precisely what the outcome would have been had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>timely notice been given.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Additionally, \u201c[t]his uncertainty ... is the result of the failure of the insured to comply with the policy, and it should not be permitted to use that uncertainty as a weapon against the insurer.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Uncertainty does not, however, relieve the insurer of the burden to \u201cshow the <em>precise manner </em>in which its interests have suffered.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Further, the insurer must prove more than \u201cprejudice that is only theoretical or presumed merely from the length of the delay.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> When inquiring into whether an insurer lost a valuable right or benefit, a court should keep in mind the purpose of timely notice requirements: \u201cto enable an insurer to investigate the circumstances of an accident while the matter is fresh in the minds of the witnesses so that it may adequately prepare to adjust or defend any claims that may be then or thereafter asserted against persons covered by its policy.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">Although we know that (1) to mount a successful untimely notice defense, an insurer must establish prejudice and (2) prejudice is the loss of a valuable right or benefit, Texas precedent provides limited practical assistance regarding what constitutes a showing of prejudice <em>sufficient </em>to relieve an insurer of liability.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> When given the opportunity, however, Texas courts have \u201cdefinitively and narrowly defined\u201d sufficient prejudice.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In our instant inquiry, we ask how the Texas Supreme Court would rule on the issue of sufficient prejudice.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In seeking our answer, we may look to the rules of other jurisdictions and to the decisions of Texas intermediate appellate courts.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-11\">2. SRS\u2019s \u201cShock-Loss Investigation\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-12\">As the district court explained, \u201ca summary of [SRS\u2019s] arguments is that SRS would have liked to have had the opportu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>nity on the day of the accident at the accident site to have interviewed witnesses on its own and attempt to get admissions of liability or indemnity from entities or individuals who were not its insureds\u201d and that \u201cSRS did not have the opportunity to conduct and employ its normal \u2018shock loss\u2019 investigative procedures and techniques on the day (o[r] in some circumstances within hours or minutes after) the accident occurred.\u201d In SRS\u2019s view, OSHA\u2019s and the local authorities\u2019 investigations do not alleviate the alleged prejudice because only SRS\u2019s specialized \u201cshock-loss investigation\u201d inquires into essential issues and immediately takes post-accident measures in an effort to decrease liability. Relying on, <em>inter alia, </em>two declarations \u2014 one from Robert Moore, an attorney with vast crane-investigation experience who had helped design SRS\u2019s shock-loss program and another from Sarah Breitmeyer, an SRS risk management coordinator<footnotemark>26</footnotemark>\u2014 SRS advances at least five reasons in support of this view: (1) an SRS investigation \u201cis oriented entirely towards the on-the-spot determination of indemnity and liability responsibilities and focuses on the immediate resolution of any fact issues\u201d in a manner distinct from that of the three investigating entities which had no interest in protecting Trumble from liability; (2) an SRS investigation attempts to present facts to the general contractor in an effort to have it accept responsibility for the loss, thereby mitigating the loss to its subcontractor policy-holder; (3) SRS lost the opportunity to attempt to persuade the contractor, Deerwood, to defend and indemnify Trumble; (4) as part of its investigation, SRS would have questioned Trumble\u2019s crane operator in hopes of emphasizing that he could not have seen the overhead power lines and was wholly reliant on Deerwood signalmen to prevent the crane from contacting the power lines \u2014 a line of questioning that the other investigating entities did not pursue; and (5) SRS would have prevented the crane from being moved so that an accident reenactment could have been performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">Although failure to receive notice timely deprived SRS of its desired shock-loss investigation, SRS had an opportunity to rely on and collaborate with the three other investigating entities and also had the ability to complete its own discovery and investigation soon after Tankersley initiated legal proceedings and well before the trial date. Additionally, at deposition, Timothy Hillegonds, an SRS risk management coordinator testified: \u201cI don\u2019t know what I would have been able to learn had I been able to get my investigation under way\u201d immediately. Hillegonds also conceded that it was possible that the investigation would not \u201chave generated any additional information that would have been helpful to SRS or Trumble.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">3. SRS Failed to Create a Material Fact Issue as to Prejudice</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">Even when we construe all facts and draw all inferences in favor of SRS standing in the shoes of Trumble, we are satisfied that SRS has failed to create a genuine issue of material fact that would have enabled it to withstand the K &amp; S Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. We first evaluate SRS\u2019s assertion that three relevant cases \u2014 (1) our decision in <em>Motiva </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number><em>Enterprises, LLC v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Co.;</em><footnotemark><em>27</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(2) our unpublished decision in <em>Clarendon National Insurance Co. v. FFE Transportation Services, Inc. </em>;<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> and (3) the Texas Court of Appeals decision in <em>Blanton v. Vesta Lloyds Insurance </em>Co.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> \u2014 support a holding in its favor. Rejecting this contention, we then proceed by explaining that, based on persuasive authority, the district court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">Our decisions in <em>Motiva </em>and <em>Clarendon </em>are distinguishable from the instant case. Unlike the instant case, they involved exclusions from <em>settlement. </em>The insurance policy in <em>Motiva </em>contained a consent-to-settle provision that required the insurer\u2019s prior consent to any settlements that it would be asked to fund.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> After a refinery explosion, the policyholder reached a settlement in the underlying litigation without first seeking the insurer\u2019s consent.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> We concluded that \u201c[wjhen ... the insurer is not consulted about the settlement, the settlement is not tendered to it[,] and the insurer has no opportunity to participate in or consent to the ultimate settlement decision, ... the insurer is prejudiced as a matter of law.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> This result is required in settlement-exclusion cases because \u201c[a]n insurer\u2019s right to participate in the settlement process is an essential prerequisite to its obligation to pay a settlement.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Depriving the insurer of this right constitutes a material breach, or prejudice.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b266-15\">In <em>Clarendon, </em>a policyholder waited for over four years to give its insurer notice of an accident.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> By that time, a jury had rendered a verdict of $1.1 million against the insured party who had previously rejected a pre-trial settlement offer of $700,000.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> We held that the insurer had shown actual prejudice as a matter of law \u2014 that, pursuant to <em>Motiva, </em>demonstrating loss of a valuable settlement right constituted sufficient prejudice.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b266-16\">Even though <em>Motiva </em>and <em>Clarendon </em>offer examples of situations when an insurance company suffers prejudice, they do not contradict a determination of <em>no </em>prejudice in the instant case. SRS offers no authority for the proposition that the ability to investigate an occurrence when and how it would like deprives it of an essential benefit of the bargain of its insurance contract in the same manner as exclusion from settlement, a more tangible and quantifiable loss.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b266-17\">In <em>Blanton, </em>the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of an insurer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>holding that it had conclusively established prejudice from untimely notice.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> In that case, appellant Blanton leased his property to an individual, who on many occasions complained that the roof leaked, allegedly causing significant water damage.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> For more than two years, Blanton neglected to notify his insurer of these complaints.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> The lessee eventually sued Blanton, asserting causes of action based on Blanton\u2019s representations of the roofs condition. Only then \u2014 six weeks after he was served with the lessee\u2019s petition \u2014 did Blanton forward notice to the insurer.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Relying on an affidavit from the insurer\u2019s litigation specialist, the court found that the insurer suffered prejudice as a matter of law.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> The litigation specialist averred that the insurer\u2019s \u201cstandard procedure was to record and promptly investigate complaints and occurrences\u201d and that it \u201cwould have followed this procedure and investigated the matter\u201d if it had received timely notice.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Further, the specialist\u2019s affidavit stated that delay prevented the insurer from urging Blanton to correct the premises defects, action that could have avoided the underlying litigation.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Blanton asserted that (1) the insurer had ample opportunity to conduct discovery and defend against the lessee\u2019s suit, and (2) the litigation specialist\u2019s statements were self-serving, conclusional, and speculative.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> The court rejected both of these arguments and held that prejudice may arise from inability to investigate, not just from inability to prepare for trial.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b267-14\">Although similarities exist between <em>Blanton </em>and the instant case, they are distinguishable. First, <em>Blanton </em>involved a <em>chronic </em>problem that presumably could have been resolved prior to the lessee\u2019s decision to sue if only the insurer had received notice of the lessee\u2019s complaints. In contrast, even immediate notice of the accident to SRS would not have prevented Tankersley\u2019s death, the <em>immediate </em>result of an unexpected fatal accident. Second, Blanton withheld notice for over two years \u2014 as he continued to receive complaints from his lessee \u2014 and no other entity had performed a timely investigation. In contrast, the delay here was only three months and SRS had access to three contemporaneous accident investigations. These distinctions demonstrate that <em>Blanton </em>does not provide support to SRS. None of SRS\u2019s three cited cases instruct that inability to conduct its shock-loss investigation creates a genuine issue of material fact as to prejudice.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>In deciding the instant case, we have no occasion to speculate how Texas courts might one day define the contours of what constitutes a showing of sufficient prejudice. Instead, we are persuaded by the straight-forward proposition that an insurer must offer \u201c \u2018more than the mere fact that it cannot employ its normal procedures in investigating and evaluating the claim.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>49</footnotemark> This rule is only an extension of the general rale that \u201ca party cannot defeat summary judgment with conclusory allegations, unsubstantiated assertions, or \u2018only a scintilla of evidence.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Evidence of an inability to investigate when and in the manner that an insurer would have liked merely creates the possibility that prejudice could occur. Yet, inability to investigate \u2014 even if that investigation involves specialized techniques such as shock-loss \u2014 does not in itself constitute material prejudice. Without more specific evidence regarding the prejudice that arose from the insurer\u2019s inability to investigate, courts are powerless to bridge the gap between the creation of an environment in which prejudice <em>could </em>occur and the requisite prejudice showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">In the instant case, the following facts are together dispositive: (1) SRS had access to extensive investigations performed by three other entities; (2) SRS has pointed to no significant deficiencies in those investigations other than that they were presumably objective rather than aimed at decreasing liability; (3) SRS received notice in the relatively short time of three months after the accident and had sufficient time to conduct discovery, settlement negotiations, and independent, albeit delayed, investigation; (4) at his deposition, SRS risk coordinator Timothy Hillegonds was unable to offer a clear indication of how a shock-loss investigation would have improved on the existing investigation information, i.e., how SRS was prejudiced; and (5) SRS presented evidence that delayed notice deprived it only of that which was overly attenuated from demonstrating actual prejudice \u2014 lost opportunities to engage in early settlement talks, to attempt to persuade others to accept responsibility, and to perform its own investigation immediately. These facts are inadequate to defeat the K &amp; S Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">We affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the K &amp; S Defendants because SRS, standing in the shoes of Trumble, did not demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact whether its untimely receipt of notice of the occurrence caused it material prejudice.

SRS did not cite <em>Renner v. State Farm Mutual Auto. Insurance Co., </em>392 F.2d 666 (5th Cir. 1968). There, we said that the district court did not clearly err in finding actual prejudice when delayed notice of an automobile accident deprived the insurer of the ability (1) to photograph the automobiles, (2) to learn about the severity of the collision\u2019s impact, (3) to discuss settlement as soon as possible \u2014 before the parties had a chance to obtain counsel \u2014 and (4) to interview one of the injured persons who died nineteen days after the accident. <em>Id. </em>at 666-68. In the instant case, any Renner-type prejudice was alleviated by SRS\u2019s access to the investigation materials from the three other entities, investigations in which the main \"drawback\u201d was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>that the information was objective rather than obtained in pursuit of a goal to limit liability. Additionally, SRS does not point to specific identifiable harm analogous to the death of one of the injured parties between the time when the insured should have provided notice and when it did. The instant case is thus distinguishable from <em>Renner </em>as any lost opportunity here is more attenuated from material prejudice than were those opportunities lost in <em>Renner.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"49\">\n<p id=\"b268-5\">. <em>Transportes Ferreos de Venezuela II CA v.
