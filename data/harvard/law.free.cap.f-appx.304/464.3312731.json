After the United States Sentencing Guidelines were amended to reduce the penalties for crack cocaine offenses, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Supp. 2007, amend. 706, Johnson asked the district court to reduce his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(C), and the court appointed counsel. His attorney moved for a reduced sentence, and the district court reduced his sentence to 84 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-17\">Johnson does not challenge the district court\u2019s reasoning in imposing this sentence. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A); <em>Anderson v. Hardman, </em>241 F.3d 544, 545-46 (7th Cir.2001). Instead, he argues that his counsel was ineffective for seeking a reduced sentence instead of a full resentencing. We have previously held that a prisoner seeking a sentence reduction does not have a right to appointed counsel. <em>See Pruitt v. Mote, </em>503 F.3d 647, 657 (7th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Tidwell, </em>178 F.3d 946, 949 (7th Cir.1999). But even if Johnson had a right to effective assistance of counsel in his \u00a7 3582(C) proceeding, an attack on counsel\u2019s effectiveness is more properly brought on collateral attack than on direct appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; <em>Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 504, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003); <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>546 F.3d 801, 813-14 (7th Cir.2008). If Johnson wishes to raise that argument he may do so on collateral attack. The appeal is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b489-18\">DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
