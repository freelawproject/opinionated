(\u201cMazda\u201d) and its counsel, Bruce P. Bennett, appeal from the decision of the District Court of the Virgin Islands of the United States affirming a Magistrate Judge\u2019s Order awarding sanctions against Bennett and dismissing all remaining motions in this case without prejudice. Because we conclude that the District Court correctly determined that Mazda lacked standing to appeal the sanctions against Bennett, and we otherwise find no error in the District Court\u2019s decision, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-26\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b90-27\">This case arises out of the settlement of claims stemming from a motor vehicle accident between Voncelle Anthony, who was driving a Mazda B3000 pickup truck, and Richard Abbott. When Anthony\u2019s and Abbott\u2019s vehicles collided, Anthony\u2019s driver\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>side airbag deployed, injuring her and her minor son, Kamari Lewis.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Anthony v. Mazda Motor of America, d/b/a/ Mazda North American Operations, </em>2007 WL 5083835, at *1 (D.V.I. Aug. 20, 2007). Anthony filed suit against Abbott and included a products liability claim against Mazda. Although Abbott settled, it appeared the case would continue to trial on the claim against Mazda. However, during a final mediation on March 30, 2006, Anthony and Mazda reached a settlement (the \u201cSettlement Agreement\u201d), pursuant to which Mazda took responsibility for drafting a \u201cfull release of all claims, with an incorporated confidentiality clause\u201d to be signed by Anthony. (App. at 17.)</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Mazda drafted the release in a fashion that disposed of all of Anthony\u2019s claims against Mazda and purported to do more: it would have discharged any claims Anthony might have against entities that were neither parties to the action nor the Settlement Agreement, including the Tokyo Marine and Nichido Fire Insurance Company, Ltd., TM Claims Service, Inc., the Ford Motor Company, Plaza Motors Corporation, and all suppliers of parts to the subject vehicle. Despite Mazda\u2019s efforts to explain why it considered the form of release necessary to protect its interests, Anthony believed that the release went beyond the Settlement Agreement and refused to sign it.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">When further discussions failed to result in an agreed-upon release, Anthony filed a motion to compel Mazda to redraft the release or, in the alternative, for a trial date. She also filed a motion for sanctions against Mazda\u2019s counsel, Bennett, specifically seeking payment for costs, expenses, and attorneys\u2019 fees in conjunction with the post-settlement motion practice. Mazda opposed the sanctions motion. The District Court docket does not reflect that Bennett himself filed any opposition to the sanctions motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">In a March 9, 2007, Order, a Magistrate Judge directed Mazda to draft a release \u201cexclusive of non-parties\u201d and granted Anthony\u2019s sanctions motion \u201cas it related to the post-settlement motions.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (App. at 21, 22.) Mazda timely appealed that order to the District Court. The District Court then <em>sua sponte </em>raised the issue of Mazda\u2019s standing and concluded that Mazda could not contest the award of sanctions because the sanctions had been imposed on Bennett, not Mazda. In an August 20, 2007, Memorandum Opinion and Order, the District Court dismissed Mazda\u2019s appeal as it related to sanctions. Additionally, the District Court dismissed other pending motions without prejudice. Mazda then timely appealed to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-11\">II. Jurisdiction and Standards of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b91-12\">The District Court exercised jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 and 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1612(a). We have jurisdiction over this appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our review of issues of standing is plenary. <em>See Goode v. City of Philadelphia, </em>539 F.3d 311, 316 (3d Cir.2008). We review a district court\u2019s decision to award sanctions for abuse of discretion. <em>See In re Pruden</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number><em>tial Ins. Co. Sales Practice Litig. Agent Actions, </em>278 F.3d 175, 181 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">The District Court correctly concluded that Mazda does not have standing to challenge the award of sanctions against Bennett.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We generally will not review a party\u2019s challenge to a sanctions order when the sanctions are levied only against the party\u2019s attorney. <em>Bartels v. Sports Arena Employees Local 137, </em>838 F.2d 101, 104 (3d Cir.1988). The attorney him or herself is, in that instance, the party in interest. In this case, it is true that the language used by the Magistrate Judge in his opinion granting Anthony\u2019s sanctions motion is imprecise, as he twice states that \u201cMazda will be sanctioned\u201d (App.21). However, the motion itself only sought sanctions against Bennett. Indeed, the motion invoked 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927, which is strictly a basis for sanctions against an attorney. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927 (applies only to \u201c[a]n attorney or other person admitted to conduct cases in any court of the United States or any Territory thereof.\u201d); <em>In re Prudential, </em>278 F.3d at 188 (stating that \u201c[section] 1927 sanctions are applicable only to an attorney\u201d) (citation omitted). Despite the somewhat confusing prefatory language, it appears that the Magistrate Judge intended to, and did, grant the motion as it was presented. That is how the District Court perceived it as well, since it concluded that the Magistrate Judge\u2019s order imposed sanctions only against Bennett.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">Mazda has no pecuniary interest in the sanctions against Bennett and has no other basis for standing since this is not a circumstance in which Mazda\u2019s rights are inextricably intertwined with Bennett\u2019s so as to imbue Mazda with standing. <em>See Napier v. Thirty or More Unidentified Fed. Agents, Employees or Officers, </em>855 F.2d 1080, 1089 n. 7 (3d Cir.1988) (\u201c[W]here the rights of the lawyer and the client are inextricably intertwined, the client may have standing to appeal a sanction order against the lawyer.\u201d) (citing <em>Johnson v. Trueblood, </em>629 F.2d 302 (3d Cir.1980)). Because Mazda lacks standing to appeal the sanctions order, we do not reach the merits of its argument.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>IY. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b91-7\">. Anthony had initially filed a lawsuit on Lewis\u2019s behalf but, prior to trial, Lewis reached the age of majority and, on a motion by Anthony, the District Court dismissed Lewis from the suit without prejudice on March 30, 2006.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b91-13\"><em>. </em>The Magistrate Judge\u2019s order also awarded Anthony interest on the settlement award. The District Court vacated that portion of the order, but the Court then made a <em>de novo </em>determination that such an award was appropriate. <em>See Anthony, </em>2007 WL 5083335, at *3-4. No part of that determination is before us on this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b92-6\">. While Bennett himself is named as a party to this appeal, he did not appeal the Magistrate Judge\u2019s order to the District Court. Bennett argues that his failure to appeal the sanctions order to the District Court should not prevent him from being a party to this appeal. We need not decide that issue, however, because even if he has a right to be before us, Bennett did not present to the District Court the arguments he now presents to us. The Magistrate Judge's order states that the \u201cplaintiff\u2019s motion for sanctions as it related to the post-settlement motions is granted.\u201d (App.22.) That order put Bennett on notice that the sanctions motion, which by its terms sought sanctions solely against him, had been granted. Even if we were to accept Bennett's premise that he did not understand the Magistrate Judge\u2019s order to impose sanctions only on him, that must have changed once the District Court issued an order denying Mazda standing. At that point, Bennett had the lay of the land and an opportunity to request relief from the District Court, but he failed to do so. There are no exceptional circumstances which persuade us to disregard the general rule that we will not consider on appeal issues that were not raised before the district court. <em>See Continental Cas. Co. v. Dominick D'Andrea Inc., </em>150 F.3d 245 (3d Cir.1998) (declining to hear appeal from magistrate\u2019s sanctions order where party had not appealed that order to the district court.) We therefore have no occasion to opine on whether Bennett\u2019s conduct was sanctionable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b92-11\">. Mazda also contends that the District Court improperly denied its motion for costs and fees as a prevailing party over Anthony\u2019s son, under section 541 of Title 5 of the Virgin Islands Code. Under section 541, a court may award costs or exercise its discretion to award attorney\u2019s fees to a prevailing party. The decision to award costs or attorney's fees is entirely discretionary. <em>See Lucerne Inv. Co. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>v. <em>Estate Belvedere, Inc., </em>411 F.2d 1205, 1207 (3d Cir.1969). We cannot say that the District Court abused its discretion in dismissing Mazda's motion for costs or fees, particularly when Mazda's status as a \"prevailing party\u201d remains open to dispute.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
