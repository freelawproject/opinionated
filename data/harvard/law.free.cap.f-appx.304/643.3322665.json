Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Reviewing for substantial evidence, <em>Abebe v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 1037, 1039-40 (9th Cir.2005) (en banc), we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-12\">Where, as here, the BIA adopts the Id\u2019s decision and cites <em>Matter of Burbano, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 872 (BIA 1994), we review the Id\u2019s decision as if it were that of the BIA. <em>Id. </em>at 1040-41. For this reason, we deny Ledesma\u2019s due process contention that the BIA failed to articulate reasons for its denial of relief, and find unpersuasive the government\u2019s contention that we lack jurisdiction to consider petitioner\u2019s claims. <em>Id. </em>at 1041; <em>see also Arreguin-Moreno v. Mukasey, </em>511 F.3d 1229, 1232 (9th Cir.2008) (\u201cWhen the BIA cites <em>Burbano </em>... all issues presented before the IJ are deemed to have been presented to the BIA.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-13\">The IJ denied Ledesma\u2019s asylum application as time-barred. She does not challenge this finding in her opening brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-14\">Even if Ledesma\u2019s ex-partner targeted her on account of a protected ground, substantial evidence supports the Id\u2019s denial of withholding of removal because she did not show that the government was either unable or unwilling to control her ex-partner. <em>See Castro-Perez v. Gonzales, </em>409 F.3d 1069, 1071-72 (9th Cir.2005) (holding that there is no government persecution where a person suffers abuse by a private actor and does not report it to the police.).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-15\">Substantial evidence also supports the denial of CAT relief because Ledesma did not show it is more likely than not that she will be tortured by, or with the acquiescence of, the Mexican government. <em>See Silaya v. Mukasey, </em>524 F.3d 1066, 1073 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-16\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b668-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
