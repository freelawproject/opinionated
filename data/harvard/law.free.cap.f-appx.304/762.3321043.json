The district court revoked Pollard\u2019s supervised release, imposed a 12-month-and-l-day sentence for the violations, and ordered that the sentence run consecutive to Pollard\u2019s 68-month sentence imposed by the state court. Pollard appeals the district court\u2019s sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b787-8\">Although Pollard objected to the district court\u2019s sentence, his objection was very general. He did not assert the errors that he now alleges on appeal. Accordingly, his claims will be reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Stevenson, </em>68 F.3d 1292, 1294 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-9\">Under plain error review, \u201c(1) there must be error; (2) the error must be plain; and (3) the error must affect substantial rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). If these criteria are met, we may correct the plain error if it \u201cseriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1779, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (citation and quotation marks omitted). But</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-10\">where the effect of an error on the result in the district court is uncertain or indeterminate \u2014 where we would have to speculate \u2014 the appellant has not met his burden of showing a reasonable probability that the result would have been different but for the error; he has not met his burden of showing prejudice; he has not met his burden of showing that his substantial rights have been affected.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b787-11\"><em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1301 (11th Cir.2005) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-12\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b787-13\">Pollard argues that the district court erroneously relied on information in the Supplemental Report because he was not provided with the Report at least 35 days before sentencing and because the Report was not made a part of the record. He argues that the court incorrectly stated that his criminal history category was VI instead of II and that the court\u2019s error led to an unreasonable sentence. He further argues that the court erred by not properly considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in imposing the sentence. For the reasons discussed below, we find no plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-14\">A probation officer must conduct a presentence investigation and submit a report to the court unless \u201c(i) [a] statute requires otherwise; or (ii) the court finds that the information in the record enables it to meaningfully exercise its sentencing authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553, and the court explains its finding on the record.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c)(1)(A). \u201cThe probation officer must give the presentence report to the defendant, the defendant\u2019s attorney, and an attorney for the government at least 35 days before sentencing unless the defendant waives this minimum period.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-15\">The U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual recommends a sentencing range of 6 to 12 months\u2019 imprisonment for a Grade B violation of supervised release and a category II criminal history. U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 7B1.4 (2007). It recommends a range of 21 to 27 months\u2019 imprisonment for a Grade B violation and category VI criminal history. \u00a7 7B1.4. The court determines the appropriate sentencing range by applying \u201cthe [criminal history] category applicable at the time the defendant originally was sentenced to a term of supervision.\u201d \u00a7 7B1.4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>When imposing a sentence, the district court is not required to discuss methodically each factor. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329-30 (11th Cir.2005). If the court imposes a sentence within the guidelines, it is not necessary to give a detailed explanation of its reasons, so long as it \u201cset[s] forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that [it] has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising [its] own legal decision-making authority.\u201d <em>United States v. Agbai, </em>497 F.3d 1226, 1230 (11th Cir.2007) (per curiam) (citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">Here, Pollard specifically asked the court to accept the government\u2019s waiver of the presentence investigation. Pollard accordingly waived his rights under Rule 32(e)(2). According to the Supplemental Report, Pollard had a lengthy criminal history, even before his original sentencing. The district court indicated that Pollard\u2019s record would have qualified him for a category VI criminal history. The court, however, applied a category II criminal history, pursuant to an agreement between the parties. Based on Pollard\u2019s Grade B violation, the court initially imposed a 12-month sentence. The court subsequently modified the sentence to 12 months and 1 day so that Pollard could receive gain time.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">In imposing the sentence, the court noted that Pollard\u2019s criminal history was \u201chorrendous.\u201d It expressed concern that Pollard had failed to comply with the conditions of his release. It also noted that its previous sentences had been relatively lenient and that \u201cthe time for breaks ... is now over.\u201d The court\u2019s remarks indicate that it- had considered Pollard\u2019s history. They also indicate that the court intended that the sentence promote respect for the law, deter future criminal conduct, and protect the public from any of Pollard\u2019s future crimes. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (2)(A)-(C). Although the district court did not explicitly consider each \u00a7 3553(a) factor, it provided \u201ca reasoned basis for exercising\u201d its judgment. <em>Agbai, </em>497 F.3d at 1230.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">In light of the foregoing, the district court did not plainly err in determining Pollard\u2019s sentence. But even if it did, Pollard cannot show that any of the court\u2019s alleged errors affected his substantial rights because he has not shown that his sentence would have been different but for the error. <em>See Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1301.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">The court indicated its intent to sentence Pollard at the high end of the 6 to 12 month guideline range. Pollard\u2019s high-end sentence was not based solely on the court\u2019s perception that he received a \u201cbreak\u201d at his original sentencing. The court noted that Pollard did not receive any jail time for his first supervised release violation and that he subsequently failed to comply with the court\u2019s newly imposed conditions of supervised release. The court also recognized that the state court had given Pollard numerous \u201cbreaks\u201d over the years, even though he had amassed 20 criminal-history points, many of which were based on burglaries and grand thefts. The court\u2019s discussion indicates that Pollard received a high-end sentence based on the cumulative effect of Pollard\u2019s past lenient sentences and his repeated failure to comply with the law. Because it is unlikely that Pollard would have been sentenced differently, any alleged error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b788-10\">After carefully reviewing the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we find no plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
