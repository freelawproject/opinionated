Jenner contends that the proffered reasons for his termination were a pretext for age discrimination. He also appeals the denial of his motion for reconsideration of costs taxed against him. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-16\">I. STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b882-17\">Two standards of review govern this appeal. First, this Court reviews a summary judgment <em>de novo. Damon v. Fleming Supermarkets of Fla., Inc., </em>196 F.3d 1354, 1357 (11th Cir.1999). A district court should enter a summary judgment when \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>see Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2552, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). In examining the record, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>See Damon, </em>196 F.3d at 1358. Second, this Court reviews an award of costs for abuse of discretion. <em>Chapman v. AI Transp., </em>229 F.3d 1012, 1039 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-18\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b882-19\">Our discussion is divided in two parts. We first address Jenner\u2019s contention that the proffered reasons stated for his termination were a pretext for age discrimination. We then address whether the district court abused its discretion when it awarded costs to the Bank as the prevailing party.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>\n<em>A. Age Discrimination</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">To support his claim of age discrimination, Jenner relies on circumstantial evidence and the burden-shifting framework of <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). <em>See Pennington v. City of Huntsville, </em>261 F.3d 1262, 1269 (11th Cir.2001). Under that framework, Jenner established a prima facie case of age discrimination, and the Bank articulated several nondiscriminatory reasons for his termination. Jenner then had to \u201cintroduce significantly probative evidence that the asserted reason is merely a pretext for discrimination.\u201d <em>Brooks v. County Comm\u2019n of Jefferson County, Ala., </em>446 F.3d 1160, 1163 (11th Cir.2006) (citation and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">Jenner attempts to satisfy his burden of proving pretext in two ways. He first contends that \u201ca discriminatory reason more likely motivated\u201d his termination. <em>Texas Dep\u2019t of Community Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 256, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 1095, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981). He also argues that \u201cthe employer\u2019s proffered reason is unworthy of credence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Both arguments fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">Jenner argues that DeGolian\u2019s comment that Jenner should have his photograph airbrushed proves that DeGolian was more likely motivated by discriminatory animus when he agreed with the decision to terminate Jenner, but we disagree. DeGolian\u2019s comment was made about a month after Jenner\u2019s hiring regarding a photograph to accompany a press release about the hiring, and DeGolian\u2019s recommendation was the decisive factor in hiring Jenner. DeGolian\u2019s comment also was made three or four months before Jenner\u2019s termination and was totally unrelated to Jenner\u2019s termination. DeGolian\u2019s remote comment does not suggest anything about his state of mind when he agreed months later with the group decision to terminate Jenner\u2019s employment. Reading this comment \u201cin conjunction with the entire record\u201d and \u201ceonsider[ing][it] together with\u201d the other evidence presented, DeGolian\u2019s isolated and remote comment does not provide substantial evidence of discriminatory animus. <em>Ross v. Rhodes Furniture, </em>146 F.3d 1286, 1291 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-9\">Jenner also contends that the favorable treatment of Lauren Henry, a participant in one of Jenner\u2019s violations of Bank policy, is evidence of pretext, but we disagree. \u201c[T]he Vork rule\u2019 defense is arguably pretextual when a plaintiff submits evidence ... [that] other employees outside the protected class, who engaged in similar acts, were not similarly treated.\u201d <em>Damon, </em>196 F.3d at 1363. \u201cTo satisfy the similar offense prong, the comparator\u2019s misconduct must be nearly identical to the plaintiffs ... to prevent courts from second-guessing employers\u2019 reasonable decisions and confusing apples with oranges.\u201d <em>Silvera v. Orange County Sch. Bd., </em>244 F.3d 1253, 1259 (11th Cir.2001). Although Henry participated in a violation of a Bank policy with Jenner, her participation was minor, and she did not engage in any of Jenner\u2019s other numerous violations of Bank policy. Because Henry and Jenner did not engage in \u201csimilar acts,\u201d evidence that Henry was treated more favorably than Jenner is not evidence of pretext.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-10\">Jenner also contends that the reasons proffered by the Bank are unworthy of credence, but this argument fails. The Bank terminated Jenner for multiple violations of Bank policy, including attempting to provide insurance advice to clients, using planning software and materials without authority, receiving trail commissions from undisclosed sources, sharing private client information with his son and creating marketing materials without authority. Jenner admitted that he had a client sign a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>blank form relating to the client\u2019s insurance, he failed to cancel all appointments with insurance carriers, and he accessed a computer program without authority. We have repeatedly stated that \u201c[a] plaintiff is not allowed to ... substitute his business judgment for that of the employer\u201d and that \u201c[provided that the proffered reason is one that might motivate a reasonable employer, [the plaintiff] must meet that reason head on and rebut it, and [he] cannot succeed by simply quarreling with the wisdom of that reason.\u201d <em>Chapman, </em>229 F.3d at 1030.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">Even if Jenner could establish that he did not engage in the misconduct alleged by the Bank, Jenner has not presented evidence that the Bank did not honestly believe that he violated Bank policy on multiple occasions. \u201cThe factual issue to be resolved is not the ... accuracy of [the employer\u2019s proffered reason.] We are not interested in whether the conclusion is correct one, but whether it is an honest one.\u201d <em>Rojas v. Florida, </em>285 F.3d 1339, 1342 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cWe are not in the business of adjudging whether employment decisions are prudent or fair. Instead, our sole concern is whether unlawful discriminatory animus motivates a challenged employment decision.\u201d <em>Damon, </em>196 F.3d at 1361 (11th Cir.1999). The testimonies of both the decisionmakers and Jenner\u2019s former clients supports the reasons of the Bank for Jenner\u2019s termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">\n<em>B. Costs under Rule 51(d)(1)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">Jenner argues that he is indigent and the district court should not have awarded any costs, but this argument fails. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d)(1) provides that \u201ccosts \u2014 other than attorney\u2019s fees \u2014 should be allowed to the prevailing party.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(d)(1). The rule \u201cestablishes a presumption that costs are to be awarded to a prevailing party, but vests the district court with discretion to decide otherwise.\u201d <em>Chapman, </em>229 F.3d at 1039 (citing <em>Delta Air Lines, Inc. v. August, </em>450 U.S. 346, 351, 101 S.Ct. 1146, 1149, 67 L.Ed.2d 287 (1981)). Although a district court does not have to consider the financial status of a non-prevailing party in its award of costs, if it does so, the court \u201cmay not decline to award any costs at all.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The reduced award was the amount recoverable under the statute, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920, and the court did not abuse its discretion when it awarded costs to the prevailing party.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b884-9\">The summary judgment and award of costs in favor of Bank of America are</p>\n<p id=\"b884-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
