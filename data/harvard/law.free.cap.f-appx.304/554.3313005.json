(\u201cLiveUniverse\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) of its monopolization and attempted monopolization claims under \u00a7 2 of the Sherman Act, as well as its state-law unfair business practices claim. Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>LiveUniverse\u2019s amended complaint does not sufficiently allege exclusionary conduct or causal antitrust injury, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we review de novo the district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). <em>Kendall v. Visa </em>U.S.A., <em>Inc., </em>518 F.3d 1042, 1046 (9th Cir. 2008). \u201cAll allegations of material fact in the complaint are regarded as true and construed in the light most favorable\u201d to the plaintiff. <em>Glen Holly Entm\u2019t, Inc. v. Tektronix, Inc., </em>352 F.3d 367, 368 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">To state a monopolization claim under \u00a7 2 of the Sherman Act, LiveUniverse must sufficiently allege that MySpace \u201c(1) possessed monopoly power in the relevant market, (2) wilfully acquired or maintained that power through exclusionary conduct and (3) caused antitrust injury.\u201d <em>Metro-Net Servs. Corp. v. Qwest Corp., </em>383 F.3d 1124, 1130 (9th Cir.2004). The parties do not dispute the district court\u2019s finding that \u201cLiveUniverse sufficiently alleges that MySpace has monopoly power in the relevant market\u201d of internet-based social networking websites. LiveUniverse has failed, however, sufficiently to allege either exclusionary conduct or causal antitrust injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">\u201cTo safeguard the incentive to innovate, the possession of monopoly power will not be found unlawful unless it is accompanied by an element of anticompetitive <em>conduct.\u201d Verizon Commc\u2019ns Inc. v. Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko, LLP, </em>540 U.S. 398, 407, 124 S.Ct. 872, 157 L.Ed.2d 823 (2004). The conduct element requires \u201cthe use of monopoly power to foreclose competition, to gain a competitive advantage, or to destroy a competitor.\u201d <em>Image Technical Servs., Inc. v. Eastman Kodak Co., </em>125 F.3d 1195, 1208 (9th Cir.1997) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">LiveUniverse\u2019s exclusionary conduct claim is predicated on MySpace\u2019s \u201crefusal to deal\u201d with LiveUniverse. \u201c[A]s a general matter, the Sherman Act does not restrict the long recognized right of a trader or manufacturer engaged in an entirely private business, freely to exercise his own independent discretion as to parties with whom he will deal.\u201d <em>Trinko, </em>540 U.S. at 408, 124 S.Ct. 872 (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., </em>472 U.S. 585, 600, 105 S.Ct. 2847, 86 L.Ed.2d 467 (1985) (\u201c[E]ven a firm with monopoly power has no general duty to engage in a joint marketing program with a competitor.\u201d). This right, however, is not unqualified, and \u201c[ujnder certain circumstances, a refusal to cooperate with rivals can constitute anti-competitive conduct and violate \u00a7 2.\u201d <em>Trinko, </em>540 U.S. at 408, 124 S.Ct. 872.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">LiveUniverse contends a refusal-to-deal claim does not require \u201can affirmative decision or agreement to cooperate\u201d between competitors. LiveUniverse is mistaken. The <em>THnko </em>court highlighted three factors it found significant to <em>Aspen Skiing\u2019s </em>\u201climited exception,\u201d the first of which was the \u201cunilateral termination of a voluntary <em>{and thus presumably </em>profitable) course of dealing [which] suggested a willingness to forsake short-term profits to achieve an anticompetitive end.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 409, 124 S.Ct. 872. This court has since recognized the narrow scope of the refusal to deal exception, which requires, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthe unilateral termination of a voluntary and profitable course of dealing.\u201d <em>MetroNet Servs., </em>383 F.3d at 1132. LiveUniverse has failed to allege either a voluntary arrangement between it and MySpace, or that any such arrangement was profitable to MySpace. <em>See Trinko, </em>540 U.S. at 409, 124 S.Ct. 872.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>LiveUniverse\u2019s only allegation is that, before MySpace redesigned its platform, individual users were able to link to content on vidiLife.com. Though this may indicate a prior course of dealing <em>between MySpace and its users, </em>nothing in the complaint suggests an agreement, or even an implicit understanding, <em>between MySpace and LiveUniverse </em>regarding the functionality of embedded links.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Even if we were to assume a voluntary course of dealing, LiveUniverse has failed to allege that it was profitable to MySpace, such that MySpace\u2019s conduct was contrary to its short-term business interests. <em>See Trinko, </em>540 U.S. at 409, 124 S.Ct. 872; <em>MetroNet Servs., </em>383 F.3d at 1132 (holding that Qwest\u2019s cancellation of its prior course of dealing was not an impermissible refusal to deal because \u201cQwest was not forsaking short-term profits ... but rather was attempting to increase its short-term profits\u201d). LiveUniverse has therefore failed to allege exclusionary conduct, and the district court properly dismissed its complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">LiveUniverse\u2019s failure to allege causal antitrust injury, which \u201cis an element of all antitrust suits,\u201d <em>Rebel Oil Co. v. Atl. Richfield Co., </em>51 F.3d 1421,1433, 1445 (9th Cir.1995), serves as an independent basis for dismissal. Antitrust injury is injury \u201cof the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent,\u201d <em>Glen Holly, </em>352 F.3d at 372, which means harm to the process of competition and consumer welfare, not harm to individual competitors, <em>Cascade Health Solutions v. PeaceHealth, </em>515 F.3d 883, 901 (9th Cir.2008). LiveUniverse\u2019s allegation that MySpace\u2019s conduct in disabling links on MySpace.com to other social networking websites reduces consumers\u2019 choices in the relevant market, thereby diminishing \u201cthe quality of consumers\u2019 social networking experience,\u201d falls short. LiveUniverse does not explain how MySpace\u2019s actions <em>on its own website </em>can reduce consumers\u2019 choice or dimmish the quality of their experience on <em>other </em>social networking websites, which is the relevant market. There is no allegation that MySpace has prevented consumers from accessing vidiLife.com (or any other social networking website). Indeed, it would be impossible for MySpace to do so: any consumer desiring such access need only type \u201cvidiLife.com\u201d into the address bar of his or her web browser, or into a search engine such as Google. All MySpace has done is prevent consumers from accessing vidiLife.com <em>through MySpace. com. </em>Consumers remain free to choose which online social networks to join, and on which websites they upload text, graphics, and other content. LiveUniverse\u2019s failure to allege antitrust injury serves as an independent ground on which we affirm the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">A claim for attempted monopolization requires allegations of anticompetitive conduct and antitrust injury. <em>See Cascade Health, </em>515 F.3d at 893; <em>Image Technical Servs., </em>125 F.3d at 1202. As discussed above, LiveUniverse failed to allege anticompetitive conduct and antitrust injury. Because attempted monopolization requires pleading these same elements, LiveUniverse\u2019s claim necessarily fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">LiveUniverse\u2019s final claim is for unfair competition under California Business and Professions Code \u00a7 17200. Where, however, the same conduct is alleged to support both a plaintiffs federal antitrust claims and state-law unfair competition claim, a finding that the conduct is not an antitrust violation precludes a finding of unfair competition. <em>See, e.g., Carter v. Variflex, Inc., </em>101 F.Supp.2d 1261, 1270 (C.D.Cal.2000) (\u201cThus, in light of the Court\u2019s findings under the Sherman Act, the Court finds that Variflex has failed to produce sufficient evidence to support its California un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>fair competition claim.\u201d); <em>Chavez v. Whirlpool Corp., </em>93 Cal.App.4th 363, 375, 113 Cal.Rptr.2d 175 (2001) (\u201cIf the same conduct is alleged to be both an antitrust violation and an \u2018unfair\u2019 business act or practice for the same reason \u2014 because it unreasonably restrains competition and harms consumers \u2014 the determination that the conduct is not an unreasonable restraint of trade necessarily implies that the conduct is not \u2018unfair\u2019 toward consumers.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">LiveUniverse concedes that its \u201ccause of action for statutory unfair competition relies on its allegations of monopolization and attempted monopolization.\u201d Because LiveUniverse fails to state a claim under the Sherman Act, it also fails to state a claim under \u00a7 17200.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">For the foregoing reasons, LiveUniverse has failed to state a claim for monopolization, attempted monopolization, or unfair competition. The decision of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b579-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
