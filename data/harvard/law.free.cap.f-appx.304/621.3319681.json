We therefore lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s discretionary determination that the evidence was insufficient to establish a prima facie case of hardship. <em>See Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 601-03 (9th Cir.2006). In addition, the female petitioner\u2019s constitutional challenges to the agency\u2019s decision to place her into removal rather than deportation proceedings lack merit. <em>See Vasquez-Zavala v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 1105, 1108 (9th Cir.2003); <em>Hernandez-Mezquita v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 1161, 1163-65 (9th Cir.2002); <em>Jimenez-Angeles v. Ashcroft, </em>291 F.3d 594, 599 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-27\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b645-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
