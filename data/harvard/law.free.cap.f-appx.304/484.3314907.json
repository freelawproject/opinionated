We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-23\">Our prior opinion, 472 F.3d 634 (9th Cir.2006), stated that genuine issues of material fact exist as to two questions: (1) \u201cwhether the United States Postal Service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>[ (\u201cUSPS\u201d) ] was a covered agent of Airborne\u201d and (2) \u201cwhether Airborne retained the responsibility and liability for packages once they were handed off to the USPS for delivery to the final consignee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 635. We clarified that a showing of \u201ccare, custody, and control\u201d is not \u201cdependent on a formal agency relationship between the primary carrier and any independent contractors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 636. Moreover, we observed that the provision of the Insurance Policy, stating that \u201c[ijnsurance is to attach from the moment the Assured becomes responsible and/or liable and continues until such responsibility or liability ceases,\u201d is \u201cconsistent with the common understanding of \u2018care, custody and control\u2019 in a cargo liability policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>On remand, although the district court correctly explained that \u201cwhether Airborne retained responsibility and liability under the Insurance Policy depends on whether the USPS is considered Airborne\u2019s agent under ... Airborne\u2019s Service Guide, as incorporated by the @Home Service Agreements,\u201d it improperly collapsed the two questions into one: whether the USPS acted as Airborne\u2019s \u201cagent\u201d as governed by principles of agency law.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">The parties agree that the USPS did not act as Airborne\u2019s agent under the law of agency and that St. Paul\u2019s coverage extended \u201cfrom the moment [Airborne] becomes responsible and/or liable and continues until such responsibility or liability ceases.\u201d What is in dispute is whether Airborne remained \u201cresponsible and/or liable\u201d during the period when the USPS completed the final leg of the delivery process; i.e., whether Airborne retained <em>legal </em>\u201ccare, custody, and control\u201d of its packages while those were being delivered by the USPS. <em>See Koury v. Providence-Washington Ins. Co., </em>50 R.I. 118, 145 A. 448, 450 (1929) (holding that \u201cthe insured is covered so long as the goods are within his legal custody and control\u201d). Airborne remained liable while \u201cits agents\u201d completed the delivery process. Because Airborne\u2019s liability was fixed by the @Home Service Agreements with NFI and Sur La Table, which expressly incorporate the limitation of liability clause in Airborne\u2019s Service Guide, the meaning of the term \u201cits agents\u201d in that clause is a matter of contract law, not of agency law. <em>See Tanner Elec. Coop. v. Puget Sound Power &amp; Light Co., </em>128 Wash.2d 656, 911 P.2d 1301, 1310 (1996) (en banc) (\u201cThe touchstone of contract interpretation is the parties\u2019 intent.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">Applying principles of contract law, we conclude that genuine issues of material fact remain, precluding summary judgment. First, on the question of Airborne\u2019s continued liability for packages, there is no evidence that the parties to the @Home Service Agreements intended to define \u201cagent\u201d by incorporation of principles of agency law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Some evidence suggests, however, that Airborne interpreted the term \u201cagent\u201d in the Service Guide to include independent contractors, such as the USPS. The record also indicates that Airborne\u2019s insurance broker understood that to be the case; and that he informed St. Paul of the creation of the @Home Service Agreements which would \u201cundoubtedly have an affect [sic] on claims.\u201d Lawsuits by NFI and Sur La Table against Airborne for packages lost by the USPS dem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>onstrate that NFI and Sur La Table also interpreted the @Home Service Agreements to impose liability upon Airborne during the USPS leg of delivery to the final destination.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">Second, as we previously noted, St. Paul conceded that its coverage extended to \u201cAirborne\u2019s legal liability while packages were being processed or delivered by third-party contract agents and common carriers.\u201d <em>Airborne, </em>472 F.3d at 636. The district court has not yet made a finding as to whether the USPS \u201cwas in a fundamentally different position\u201d than these covered entities. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">On remand, the district court should determine whether, in consideration of all the evidence in the record, and applying principles of contract law, the parties to the @Home Service Agreements interpreted the term \u201cagent\u201d to include independent contractors, such as the USPS. If so, then Airborne retained liability for, and, therefore, <em>legal </em>\u201ccare, custody, and control\u201d of its packages while they were being delivered by the USPS, and is entitled to summary judgment. If not, then Airborne is entitled to summary judgment only if it can prove that the USPS was not in a fundamentally different position than third-party contract agents and common carriers that were covered under the Insurance Policy; obversely, St. Paul is entitled to summary judgment if it can prove that the USPS was in a fundamentally different position than such entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Accordingly, we remand for these further findings and conclusions as to whether Airborne remained liable to its customers for packages mishandled by the USPS.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">AFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART and REMANDED. Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b508-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.

While it is true that \u201c[p]arties are generally deemed to contract in reliance on existing law,\u201d <em>Caritas Servs., Inc. v. Dep't of Soc. and Health Servs., </em>123 Wash.2d 391, 869 P.2d 28, 36 (1994) (en banc), this principle \u201cis generally applied in connection with contract \u2018construction' (determining the legal effect of a contract) rather than contract \u2018interpretation\u2019 (determining the meaning of words used in a contract),\u201d 11 Richard A. Lord, <em>Williston on Contracts </em>\u00a7 30:19, 219 (4th ed.1999). In the instant case, the issue is one of contract interpretation \u2014 i.e., the meaning of the word \"agent,\u201d as understood and intended by the contracting parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
