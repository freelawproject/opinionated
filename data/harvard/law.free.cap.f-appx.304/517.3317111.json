He appeals his conviction and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>sentence on the one count that charged violation of the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 (CANSPAM Act), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7701-13 <em>&amp; </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1037 (2006). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Although we agree with Goodin that including the \u201crelated to\u201d clause in the jury instructions impermissibly expanded the scope of the statute, our review is for plain error because Goodin stipulated to the instruction and failed to object on this basis. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <em>United States v. Peterson, </em>538 F.3d 1064, 1070-71 (9th Cir.2008); Fed.R.Crim.P. 30(d) &amp; 52(b). He has not shown that the error was plain. <em>See United States v. Turman, </em>122 F.3d 1167, 1170-71 (9th Cir. 1997). Although Goodin now suggests that the evidence was insufficient, we cannot say that it was. The evidence was sufficient for the jury to conclude that the email was a \u2018commercial electronic mail message,\u2019 as that term is defined in 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7702(2)(A), and that it did not come within the exception for \u2018transactional or relationship messages.\u2019 Furthermore, Goodin did not argue at trial that the e-mail was outside the scope of the statute. \u201cA failure to give a jury instruction, even if in error, does not seriously affect the fairness and integrity of judicial proceedings if the defense at trial made no argument relevant to the omitted instruction.\u201d <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>201 F.3d 1145, 1152 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">The district court calculated a loss for purposes of United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1) and restitution based on the PSR\u2019s recommendation and submissions by Earthlink at trial and for sentencing. To us, Earthlink\u2019s theory appears seriously flawed. It is difficult for us to see a causal connection between the cost of servers and Goodin\u2019s conduct. However, Goodin never objected to Earth-link\u2019s calculation on this basis. While he did claim that the math was fuzzy and that Earthlink was profitable thus its loss was fictional, Goodin failed to put the causation issue on the table by challenging Earth-link\u2019s methodology or otherwise letting the district court know that there was a real dispute to resolve. As a result, the issue was not joined and the record is undeveloped. In these circumstances, we see no plain error requiring reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b541-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
