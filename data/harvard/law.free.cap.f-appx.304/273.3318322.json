Because the district court did not sufficiently articulate its reasons for awarding attorneys\u2019 fees, we vacate the award, in part, and remand for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-17\">This case arises from a dispute between Lemon and Liberty over a disability policy issued pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cERISA\u201d). In the district court, Lemon alleged that Liberty wrongfully denied her disability claim. Video surveillance, however, indicated that Lemon was not nearly as disabled as she claimed. Accordingly, the district court granted Liberty\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Liberty then filed a motion for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs pursuant to \u00a7 502(g)(1) of ERISA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court granted the motion and ordered both Lemon and Plummer to pay $7,498. The court did not declare the legal basis for the award, but granted the award for two succinctly stated reasons: (1) Lemon had lied to her doctor and exaggerated her pain, and (2) Plummer had maintained a baseless suit and misrepresented his client\u2019s condition to the court. Each of these reasons appears to be in the nature of a sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">In ERISA cases, we review an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs for abuse of discretion. <em>Wade v. Hewlett-Packard Dev. Co. LP Short Term Disability Plan, </em>493 F.3d 533, 541 (5th Cir.2007). It is an abuse of discretion for a district court to assess attorneys\u2019 fees without considering the factors announced in <em>Iron Workers Local No. 272 v. Bowen, </em>624 F.2d 1255, 1266 (5th Cir.1980). <em>See Wade, </em>493 F.3d at 543 n. 8. The award of costs, however, is subject to the \u201cprevailing party\u201d test. <em>Id. </em>at 543.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">In order for this court to review the award of fees, the district court must explicitly state the statutory basis for its decision. It must also clearly and thoroughly state the factual justifications for the award. In its Order on Attorneys Fees, the district court did neither.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Because the award of costs is governed by the \u201cprevailing party\u201d test, we AFFIRM the award of costs against Lemon. We VACATE and REMAND the award of costs against Plummer. We also VACATE and REMAND the award of attorneys\u2019 fees against both Lemon and Plummer. On remand the district court should state the statutory or other basis for each award and articulate, in some detail, the evidence and the reasoning that support each award.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">AFFIRMED, in part, VACATED, in part, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b298-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b298-18\">. \"In any action under this subchapter ..., the court in its discretion may allow a reasonable attorney's fee and costs of action to either party.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(g)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b299-8\">. Liberty\u2019s motion cited \u00a7 502(g)(1), but the district court did not reference that provision. The applicable statutory authority is particularly important in this case because the court ordered Plummer to pay fees and costs. This circuit has not considered whether \u00a7 502(g)(1) permits the assessment of fees against a party\u2019s counsel. The Second Circuit has noted that statutes, such as \u00a7 502(g)(1), that are silent on awards against the attorney, are usually not a proper basis for such an award. <em>See, e.g., Healey v. Chelsea Res. Ltd.., </em>947 F.2d 611, 624 (2d Cir.1991) (\u201cWhen a fee-shifting statute that authorizes the courts to award attorneys\u2019 fees to prevailing parties does not mention an award against the losing party\u2019s attorney, the appropriate inference is that an award against attorneys is not authorized.\u201d). Fee-shifting or sanctions may be warranted in this case under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927 or Rule 11, but we cannot evaluate such an award without knowing the statutory or other authority under which it was made. We indicate no opinion on any aspect of the award of attorneys\u2019 fees against a party\u2019s counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
