It is</p>\n<p id=\"b906-22\">Ordered and Adjudged that the petition for review of an order of the Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d or \u201cCommission\u201d) is hereby denied essentially for the reasons stated by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-23\">Crawford\u2019s claim on appeal is that he received inadequate notice that his proposals could be precluded by another applicant\u2019s earlier-filed proposal. The disposition of this claim is controlled by this court\u2019s decision in <em>Crawford v. FCC, </em>417 F.3d 1289 (D.C.Cir.2005). There, the court rejected Crawford\u2019s claim of inadequate notice on virtually identical facts, stating that the Notice of Proposed Rule-making, <em>In the Matter of Amendment of Section 73.202(b), Table of Allotments, FM Broadcast Stations, </em>15 F.C.C.R. 15809 (2000) (\u201cQuanah NPRM\u201d), and the FCC\u2019s regulations, 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.420(d), \u201cput all interested parties on notice that their proposals could be precluded by <em>any </em>counter proposal \u2014 whether foreseeable or not\u2014 that was filed by the deadline, mutually exclusive with the Quanah proposal, and mutually exclusive with their own.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>417 F.3d at 1296 (emphasis in original). Here, the Quanah NPRM likewise gave Crawford adequate notice that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>late-filed, conflicting proposals would be subject to the FCC\u2019s cutoff rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or rehearing <em>en banc. See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C. Cir. R. 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
