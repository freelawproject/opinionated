We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to remand, and review de novo claims of due process violations, <em>Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 968, 972 (9th Cir.2004), <em>amended by </em>404 F.3d 1105 (9th Cir.2005), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-22\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying Andazola-Rivas\u2019 motion to remand because the BIA considered the evidence she submitted and acted within its broad discretion in determining that the evidence was insufficient to warrant remand. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>295 F.3d 1037, 1039 (9th Cir.2002) (The BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to remand shall be reversed only if it is \u201carbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law.\u201d). Andazola-Rivas\u2019 contention that the IJ erred and violated due process by refusing to hear new evidence is unavailing because the BIA considered the evidence on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-23\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b643-31\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
