Specifically, he argues there was insufficient evidence to support the district court\u2019s finding that he made his home available for drug distribution. He contends the attendant eighteen-month sentence is accordingly unreasonable. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s revocation of supervised release for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>53 F.3d 638, 642-43 (4th Cir.1995). The district court need only find a violation of a condition of supervised release by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (2006). Factual determinations informing the conclusion that a violation occurred are reviewed for clear error. <em>See United States v. Carothers, </em>337 F.3d 1017, 1018 (8th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. Whalen, </em>82 F.3d 528, 532 (1st Cir.1996). We conclude that there was sufficient evidence to support the revocation of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-13\">We further find Hooper\u2019s sentence reasonable. This court will affirm a sentence imposed after revocation of supervised release if it is within the applicable statutory maximum and is not plainly unreasonable. <em>United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433, 437, 439-40 (4th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>549 U.S. 1283, 127 S.Ct. 1813, 167 L.Ed.2d 325 (2007). Hooper\u2019s eighteen-month sentence was within the advisory policy statement range of twelve to eighteen months and was well below the statutory maximum of two years. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). Furthermore, the district court considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2006) factors in sentencing Hooper, noting Hooper\u2019s medical and mental health history, his minimal criminal history, his involvement in drug activity similar to conduct leading to his prior conviction, and his lack of success with drug treatment. Applying the analysis articulated in <em>Crudup, </em>we find Hooper\u2019s sentence for violating the conditions of his supervised release is not unreasonable, much less plainly unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-14\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order revoking Hooper\u2019s supervised release and imposing an eighteen-month sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
