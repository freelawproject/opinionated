Harris was then tried and convicted of aggravated assault, criminal attempt, recklessly endangering another person, and a firearms violation. He was sentenced to 13.5 to 27 years imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">After an unsuccessful direct appeal and challenge under the Pennsylvania Post-Conviction Relief Act (\u201cPCRA\u201d), Harris filed a writ of habeas corpus in the Western District of Pennsylvania. A Magistrate Judge recommended the dismissal of all Harris\u2019s claims for either procedural default or lack of merit. The District Judge adopted the reasoning of the Magistrate Judge and dismissed the claims. This Court granted a Certificate of Appealability on a single issue: whether trial and appellate counsel were ineffective for failing to raise Harris\u2019s claim that he was denied counsel during his preliminary hearing. We will affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">Inasmuch as we write primarily for the parties, who are familiar with this case, we need not recite additional factual or procedural background.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-12\">Under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), a defendant must establish the following two elements to succeed on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim: (1) \u201ccounsel\u2019s performance was deficient,\u201d namely that \u201ccounsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment,\u201d and (2) \u201cthe deficient performance prejudiced the defendant,\u201d such that \u201ccounsel\u2019s errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Although the Supreme Court \u201cdiscussed the performance component of an ineffectiveness claim prior to the prejudice component,\u201d it instructed that \u201cthere is no reason for a court ... to approach the inquiry in the same order or even address both components of the inquiry if the defendant makes an insufficient showing on one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 697, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-13\">In the present case, the state PCRA court found that Harris had not demonstrated prejudice. It stated that, while Smith identified Harris during the preliminary hearing, this was not prejudicial because: (1) Smith\u2019s identification was based on his prior acquaintance with Harris, rather than on the preliminary hearing; and (2) Harris was \u201cunable to demonstrate that some action by counsel at his preliminary hearing would have changed the outcome of this case.\u201d Applying AEDPA\u2019s deferential standard of review, we do not find that this analysis is contrary to or an unreasonable application of federal law. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b106-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>The evidence supports the state court\u2019s determination that Harris was not prejudiced by Smith\u2019s identification during the preliminary hearing: Smith was acquainted with Harris prior to the shooting, identified Harris based on his voice, and immediately conveyed his identification of Harris as the shooter to a resident of the home where the shooting occurred and to police shortly thereafter. Nevertheless, Harris argues that, if he had counsel during the preliminary hearing, counsel would have subjected Smith to cross-examination, revealed weaknesses in Smith\u2019s identification, and developed testimony that could have been used to impeach Smith at trial. These arguments, however, are unpersuasive. Trial counsel extensively cross-examined Smith to undermine the identification. Thus, it is unlikely that doing so at the preliminary hearing as well would have changed the trial outcome. Furthermore, the impeachment value of Smith\u2019s preliminary hearing testimony is weak. As the Magistrate Judge noted, the \u201cincremental value of such impeachment is negligible, and essentially cumulative, in light of the actual impeachment done at trial and in light of the actual challenges to the victim\u2019s credibility raised in the defense closing.\u201d Because we find that the state PCRA court\u2019s determination that Harris did not establish prejudice is not contrary to or an unreasonable application of federal law, we need not consider whether Harris\u2019s counsel was deficient for failing to raise this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">Harris also argues that, rather than consider his case under <em>Strickland, </em>this Court must apply a presumption of prejudice under <em>United States v. Cronic, </em>466 U.S. 648, 650, 104 S.Ct. 2039, 80 L.Ed.2d 657 (1984). In <em>Ditch v. Grace, </em>479 F.3d 249 (3d Cir.2007), this Court determined that a preliminary hearing is a critical stage in a criminal prosecution in Pennsylvania such that a defendant is entitled to the assistance of effective counsel. <em>Id. </em>at 253. Nonetheless, the denial of counsel at a preliminary hearing does not require automatic vacatur. <em>Id. </em>at 254. We stated that <em>\u201cCronic </em>should be read in a more limited fashion,\u201d such that prejudice should be presumed \u201conly with regard to those critical stages of litigation where a denial of counsel would necessarily undermine the reliability of the entire criminal proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 256. For the reasons stated above with regard to the <em>Strickland </em>prejudice analysis, we cannot conclude that Harris\u2019 denial of counsel during the preliminary hearing undermined the entire criminal proceeding. Accordingly, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment, denying Harris\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b105-11\">.
