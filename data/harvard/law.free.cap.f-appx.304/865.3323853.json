Shultz, appeals a decision of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims affirming a Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals decision that: (1) denied her claim for service connection for her husband\u2019s actinic keratoses and basal cell epithelioma, and (2) denied her claim for additional monthly dependency and indemnity benefits. <em>Shultz v. Nicholson, </em>No. 05-0637, 2007 WL 2846663 (Ct.Vet.App. Sept. 28, 2007). We <em>dismiss </em>for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-23\">Our authority to review a decision of the Veterans Court is limited. We may review such a decision only to the extent that it pertains to the validity of \u201ca rule of law or of any statute or regulation ... or any interpretation thereof (other than a determination as to a factual matter),\u201d or \u201cto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>interpret constitutional and statutory provisions, to the extent presented and necessary to a decision.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7292(a), 7292(c). Absent the presentation of a constitutional issue, we do not otherwise have jurisdiction to review either \u201ca challenge to a factual determination\u201d or \u201ca challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">Shultz does not assert that the Veterans Court misinterpreted a statute or regulation or that her case presents constitutional issues. Instead, she challenges the board\u2019s factual determination that her husband\u2019s actinic keratoses and basal cell epithelioma were not caused, or chronically worsened, by his service-connected malignant melanoma. Furthermore, she asserts that she is entitled to additional benefits because the Veterans Court should have found that her husband was 100 percent disabled from melanoma as of 1958.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">This court lacks jurisdiction to \u201creview any challenge to a factual determination or any challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.\u201d <em>Buchanan v. Nicholson, </em>451 F.3d 1331, 1334 (Fed.Cir.2006) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted); <em>Ferguson v. Principi </em>273 F.3d 1072, 1074-75 (Fed.Cir. 2001). Because Shultz\u2019s appeal involves only challenges to factual determinations regarding service connection, we are without jurisdiction to consider it.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
