His primary contention is that the district court improperly lengthened his term of imprisonment to increase his chances of getting into rehabilitative programs while in custody.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons set forth below, we agree with that contention and will therefore remand for resentencing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">Inasmuch as we write primarily for the parties who are familiar with this case, we need not set forth the factual or procedural background except to the extent that may be helpful to our brief discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">The following exchange occurred at sentencing as the district court diligently and thoroughly explained her consideration of the history and characteristics of the defendant, the nature and circumstances of the offense of conviction, and the other sentencing factors contained in \u00a7 3553(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AW\">THE COURT: The Court notes too that you\u2019re requesting that you be recommended for some training, electric and plumbing along those lines, so you can work when you come out?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-6\">MR. HAMILTON: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-7\">THE COURT: Is there any other kind of vocational training that \u2014 if they don\u2019t have those, would you want to be eligible for whatever other class?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-8\">MR. HAMILTON: I want to learn as much as I can.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-9\">THE COURT: Okay. I\u2019ll make it broader than that. I am worried about the violence in your background.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-10\">MR. HAMILTON: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-11\">THE COURT: I mean, from the time you were 14 years old you were in trouble.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-12\">MR. HAMILTON: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-13\">THE COURT: The trouble that you get into frequently did involve guns. There were guns around for several of the instances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-14\">MR. HAMILTON: This is the second incident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-15\">THE COURT: The alcohol seems to be a problem for you as well. MR.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ax\">HAMILTON: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-16\">THE COURT: Drinking and that type of thing, I think that exacerbates the situation for you because whatever emotional problems you have are problematic as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-17\">I\u2019m going to recommend that you volunteer for what I call the 500-hour Residential Program. It\u2019s mainly for people who have abuse problems, drug and alcohol, trying to help them to control the triggers in their life that cause them to act in inappropriate manners.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-18\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-19\">I think there could be some programs that might be beneficial for you along those lines. I\u2019m not sure that you\u2019ll qualify for time off with a 500-hour program because of the violence. It\u2019s just something you would have to do because you want to do it. It\u2019s going to help you when you come out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-20\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-21\">Honestly, if you come out again and you repeat and you come back into either the state or the federal system, the sentence is just going to get longer and longer because of your criminal record and your background.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-23\">It\u2019s a great tragedy. It\u2019s a tragedy for your family. It\u2019s a tragedy for you. <em>So I feel that when I\u2019m sentencing you, I need to give you a longer sentence rather than a short sentence because I think you really need to get the training.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-25\">App. 67-70. (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-26\">The judge then sentenced Hamilton to 63 months, to run concurrently with the remainder of Hamilton\u2019s state sentence, a term of supervised release of three years, and a $100 special assessment. The court then explained each of the sentencing fac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>tors she had considered in great detail. After the court explained all of the reasons for the sentence, defense counsel objected \u201cto the Court\u2019s statement that a lengthy sentence is necessary to provide [Hamilton] with ... needed treatment and to take advantage of the programs.\u201d App. 83. Counsel pointed out that there was no evidence in the record regarding the time necessary to get into any particular program \u2014 or evidence that Hamilton could or would utilize the programs. <em>Id. </em>The court\u2019s response included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-5\">My understanding is that he \u2014 if you do the 500-hour, you have to have a term of imprisonment generally at least two to three years in length because by the time you get into the system and you want to qualify for it, there\u2019s a waiting list that you have to have a significant sentence in order to qualify for that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-6\">For training programs, there may also be some waiting lists. I can\u2019t assure that he will not be sitting for a few years before he gets the training.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-7\">On the other hand, I think with that type of sentence, the likelihood that he will be able to participate in some program is greater. I\u2019m not saying that anything is an assurance because I have no control over what happens in the Bureau of Prisons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-8\">I think a lengthy sentence within the guideline range is appropriate because of the history of violence, and I want to give him the maximum opportunity to obtain treatment in the system and also the training. If he doesn\u2019t take advantage of it or they can\u2019t provide it as timely, there\u2019s not much that this Court can do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-9\">I think that\u2019s a factor I have to look at in terms of determining the sentencing, the appropriate sentence; and given the individual\u2019s background and taking all of the other factors into account, while I recognize that I can\u2019t give 100-pereent assurances that he be able to be certified for a journeyman or reach some level of certification in a trade, at least he will have a sufficient length of time to attempt to take advantage of those programs and to receive some credible training so that when he comes out he can look for gainful employment and hopefully won\u2019t have to go into a training program where he may not have an income which could lead back to the problems that he has today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-11\">Nothing here can be assured; but on balance I think when I look at all of the factors, I think it is an appropriate sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-12\">App. 83-85. Defense counsel continued to object based upon the uncertainty that Hamilton would receive the anticipated rehabilitative treatment while in custody, and the AUSA responded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-13\">MS. HOUGHTON: If I may respond to that. Your Honor has made it very clear that was one factor; but Your Honor clearly outlined other factors here, and that is the nature of this offense wherein he had a loaded weapon and endangered an officer by refusal to obey the officer\u2019s instruction as a felon.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZ\">App. 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-15\">At the outset, we note that it is impossible to review the entire sentencing transcript without being impressed with the careful and individualized manner in which the district court attempted to fashion an appropriate sentence for Hamilton that would satisfy each and every sentencing consideration, including the sometimes opposing objectives of punishment and deterrence on the one hand and rehabilitation and the needs of the defendant on the other. Nevertheless, it is clear from our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>reading of the sentencing transcript that the court increased the term of imprisonment imposed in order to increase Hamilton\u2019s chances of accessing rehabilitative programs while incarcerated. The court\u2019s intentions in doing so are nothing short of laudatory. Nevertheless, despite the court\u2019s good intentions, after the sentence was imposed we decided <em>United States v. Watson, </em>482 F.3d 269 (3d Cir.2007), and <em>United States v. Manzella, </em>475 F.3d 152 (3d Cir.2007). There we held that \u201ca court can not ... impose or lengthen a term of <em>imprisonment </em>for the purpose of providing correction and rehabilitation.\u201d <em>Watson, </em>482 F.3d at 275 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">Although the government now argues vociferously that the court did not increase Hamilton\u2019s term of imprisonment for rehabilitative purposes, we see no reason why we should ignore the court\u2019s own declaration to the contrary. As we noted above, the judge explicitly stated that \u201cI need to give you a longer sentence rather than a short sentence because I think you really need to get the training.\u201d She also stated, \u201cI think the longer term of imprisonment to provide you with some educational training in the 500-hour program will be of benefit.\u201d (App.80) Moreover, as we have also just noted, in response to defense counsel\u2019s objection, the AUSA argued: \u201cYour Honor has made it very clear that was one factor____\u201d Of course, neither the court nor the AUSA had the benefit of <em>Watson </em>or <em>Manzella </em>at the sentencing. However, that can not be said now and the government nevertheless insists on arguing that the sentencing judge either did not say what she meant, or that she did not mean to say what she clearly said, and what the AUSA at sentencing understood her to say. Accordingly, we are less than sympathetic to the adversarial zeal that appears to be driving the government\u2019s objection to a remand, and we are convinced that a fair reading of the sentencing proceedings in view of <em>Manzella </em>and <em>Watson </em>require the remand we will order.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">For the reasons set forth herein, we will remand for the district court for resentencing consistent with this opinion. At resentencing, the the district court can impose an appropriate sentence pursuant to the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) without increasing any sentence of imprisonment for rehabilitative purposes. In doing so, we pause to note that we appreciate that the cases that dictate this result were decided after the court imposed this sentence and we reiterate our belief that the manner in which the court went about determining this sentence and the court\u2019s explanation of it were otherwise exemplary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b93-20\">. He also contends that the court unreasonably failed to grant a downward variance because the facts of his offense were not \"typical\u201d for the crime of felon-in-possession. Given the sentencing court\u2019s meticulous consideration of the various factors relevant to sentencing, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), that contention can be dismissed without discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b93-31\">. \"We review criminal sentences for a 'violation of the law\u2019 [ ] which includes (i) matters of statutory interpretation over which we have plenary review [], as well as (ii) ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>tions about reasonableness, []\u201d <em>United States v.
