We granted a certificate of appealability on the following issues: (1) whether, in light of <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925, 936 (11th Cir.1992) (en banc), the district court was required to address all of the claims in Reed\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, and (2) if so, whether it failed to address Reed\u2019s claim that the Government breached the plea agreement by failing to recommend a sentence at the low end of the guideline range. Reed argues \u2014 and the Government <em>concedes </em>\u2014 Clisby applies to his \u00a7 2255 motion, and the district court violated <em>Clisby.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b832-18\">We review the district court\u2019s legal conclusions in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings for clear error. <em>Devine v. United States, </em>520 F.3d 1286, 1287 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-19\">In <em>Clisby, </em>out of \u201cdeep concern over the piecemeal litigation of federal habeas petitions filed by state prisoners,\u201d we exercised our supervisory authority over the district courts and instructed them to resolve all constitutional claims for relief raised in \u00a7 2254 habeas corpus petitions, regardless of whether habeas relief was granted or denied. 960 F.2d at 935-36. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>We noted \u201cthe obligation of federal courts to consider the important interests of comity and finality implicated in federal habeas review of state convictions and sentences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 935. Thus, we \u201cwill vacate the district court\u2019s judgment without prejudice and remand the case for consideration of all remaining claims whenever the district court has not resolved all such claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 938.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">This Court has not addressed in a published opinion whether the rule announced in <em>Clisby </em>barring piecemeal litigation applies to \u00a7 2255 motions to vacate. This Court has held, however, the legal principles developed in \u00a7 2254 proceedings generally apply to \u00a7 2255 motions to vacate. <em>Gay v. United States, </em>816 F.2d 614, 616 n. 1 (11th Cir.1987). Furthermore, the Government concedes <em>Clisby </em>applies. Thus, we hold <em>Clisby </em>applies to Reed\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion, and the district court was required to address all of the constitutional claims Reed raised in his motion to vacate.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">Having concluded <em>Clisby </em>applies to Reed\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion, we next must determine if the district court violated <em>Clisby </em>by failing to address Reed\u2019s claim that the Government breached the plea agreement by failing to recommend a sentence at the low end of the guideline range. There are three elements of a <em>Clisby </em>violation: (1) the appellant raised a claim (2) that affected constitutional rights, and (3) the district court failed to address this claim. <em>See Clisby, </em>960 F.2d at 936.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">Reed\u2019s memorandum in support of his \u00a7 2255 motion expressly raised the issue of whether the Government breached the plea agreement by failing to recommend a sentence at the low end of the guideline range. Furthermore, this claim implicated Reed\u2019s constitutional rights because this Court has held the breach of a plea agreement is a violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. <em>See United States v. Harvey, </em>869 F.2d 1439, 1443-44 (11th Cir.1989) (en banc). Finally, the district court did not address this claim in its order denying Reed\u2019s motion to vacate. Accordingly, as the Government concedes, the district court failed to comply with the requirements of <em>Clisby.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b833-9\">Thus, we vacate, without prejudice, the district court\u2019s order denying Reed habeas relief, and remand his remaining claim for consideration by the district court. After ruling on the merits of Reed\u2019s claim, the district court shall also determine whether to grant a certificate of appealability. <em>See Callahan v. Campbell, </em>396 F.3d 1287, 1289 (11th Cir.2005). We retain jurisdiction over the appeal, pending the district court\u2019s decision. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b833-10\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
