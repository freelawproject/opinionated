It is</p>\n<p id=\"b908-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>ORDERED and ADJUDGED that the petition for review is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">On November 8, 2006, the SEC affirmed findings of the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) that Raghavan Sathianathan made unsuitable recommendations to two clients, Anjan Venkatramani and Srikar Srinath, to buy: (i) Class B mutual fund shares in multiple fund families, rather than Class A shares in fewer fund families; and (ii) mutual funds and warrants on margin, secured by the shares of a volatile stock. The SEC also affirmed NASD findings that Sathianathan undertook discretionary trades in Venkatramani\u2019s account without written authorization. Finally, the SEC sustained a bar on Sathianathan from associating with any NASD member in any capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">Sathianathan petitioned for review on January 3, 2007. The SEC contends that we have no jurisdiction over Sathianathan\u2019s petition because it was \u201cfiled before the challenged action [wa]s final and thus ripe for review.\u201d <em>TeleSTAR, Inc. v. FCC, </em>888 F.2d 132, 134 (D.C.Cir.1989). The SEC argues that Sathianathan had tried to file a motion to reconsider, which would mean his petition was filed too early and that he was required to file a new petition after his motion to reconsider was denied. However, the SEC itself stated, in an order issued on February 2, 2007, that Sathianathan \u201cnever made a filing in compliance with the Rules of Practice and, therefore, no motion to reconsider [the November 8, 2006 Opinion] is pending before the Commission.\u201d <em>In re Raghavan Sathianathan, </em>Securities Exchange Act Rel. No. 55227, 2007 WL 310012 (Feb. 2, 2007), Supplemental Appendix 191. Based on the SEC\u2019s own characterization of the record and its statement that Sathianathan did not file a motion for reconsideration, the challenged SEC action <em>was </em>final when the petition was filed. Accordingly, under the unusual facts of this case, we have jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">Turning to the merits of the petition, substantial evidence supports the SEC\u2019s findings that Sathianathan made unsuitable recommendations and unauthorized trades. Sathianathan admitted that he urged Venkatramani and Srinath to purchase Class B shares in different mutual fund families, on margin and collateralized by volatile stock, and that he discussed the relative risks of Class A and B shares only cursorily. Sathianathan also admitted that he could not get in touch with Venkatramani while he was in India in May 2001, but nonetheless proceeded to buy 13,000 shares of stock on his behalf. The SEC\u2019s conclusions that Sathianathan\u2019s recommendations were unsuitable and that he lacked price and time discretion to make the trades in Venkatramani\u2019s account are supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-8\">The SEC\u2019s sanctions for the violations were not an \u201cabuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Stoiber v. SEC, </em>161 F.3d 745, 753 (D.C.Cir. 1998). Sathianathan had previously been on probation, and his risky recommendations flouted both his employer\u2019s express guidelines and NASD policy while causing substantial financial injuries. The associational bar is thus appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-9\">Finally, Sathianathan\u2019s remaining claims that he was targeted because he was a whistleblower, selectively prosecuted because of his race, and subjected to unfair or biased NASD proceedings lack merit. The SEC\u2019s rejection of each of these arguments was reasonably explained and supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-10\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>hearing or rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. R. 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
