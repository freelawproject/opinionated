Apr. 8, 2008), <em>aff'g </em>No. A95 710 136 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Apr. 19, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">When the BIA affirms the IJ\u2019s reasoning and supplements it, we review the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Wala v. Mukasey, </em>511 F.3d 102, 105 (2d Cir.2007). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Dong Gao v. BIA </em>482 F.3d 122, 126 (2d Cir.2007). For applications governed by the REAL ID Act of 2005, the agency may, considering the totality of the circumstances, base a credibility finding on an asylum applicant\u2019s demeanor, the plausibility of his or her account, and inconsistencies in his or her statements, without regard to whether they go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii); <em>see also In re J-Y-C-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 260, 265 (BIA 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">As a preliminarily matter, we are without jurisdiction to consider any arguments regarding Zhao\u2019s claims for withholding of removal or CAT relief because she failed to exhaust any challenge to the IJ\u2019s denial of those claims before the BIA. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Karaj v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 113, 119 (2d Cir.2006). Accordingly, we dismiss her petition for review to that extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">Regarding Zhao\u2019s asylum claim based on her alleged practice of Falun Gong, we find that substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination. For example, the agency properly noted the inconsistent testimony of Zhao and her uncle as to the last two occasions she practiced Falun Gong before her hearing, and the implausibility of her unproblematic departure from China despite her claim that she was sought by police. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii). In addition, we defer to the IJ\u2019s observations that her demeanor during her testimony suggested that she was testifying from a script rather than from her actual experiences. <em>See id,.; Shu Wen Sun v. BIA, </em>510 F.3d 377, 380-81 (2d Cir.2007). Moreover, because Zhao\u2019s testimony was not otherwise credible, it was not improper for the IJ to rely on the absence of any corroborating statements from, e.g., her father, her former boyfriend or his parents. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(ii); <em>see also Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 341 (2d Cir.2006).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under the REAL ID Act, these findings were sufficient to support the agency\u2019s conclusion that Zhao was not credible. <em>See Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 167 (2d Cir.2008). Accordingly, the agency\u2019s denial of asylum was not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-12\">As a final matter, we find no abuse of discretion in the BIA\u2019s denial of Zhao\u2019s motion to remand. <em>See Li Yong Cao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>421 F.3d 149, 157 (2d Cir.2005) (motions to remand are reviewed for abuse of discretion). Zhao sought remand to the IJ for consideration of her alleged fear of persecution under China\u2019s coercive population control policy based on the impending birth of her second child. In denying that motion, the BIA found that she had failed to provide adequate evidence in support of her motion and, in any event, the only country conditions evidence in the record suggested that she would not face sanctions rising to the level of persecution. First of all, we find that Zhao\u2019s failure to challenge any of the actual reasons the BIA articulated in its deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>sion is fatal to her petition for review. <em>See Nwogu v. Gonzales, </em>491 F.3d 80, 84 (2d Cir.2007) (denying the petition for review where petitioner failed to raise \u201cany of the issues relevant\u201d to BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen). Regardless, Zhao\u2019s only argument \u2014 that the BIA improperly engaged in <em>de novo </em>review when deciding her motion \u2014 is without merit when the BIA had the necessary authority to analyze whether she established <em>p\u00f1ma facie </em>eligibility for asylum based on the newly alleged facts. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a), (c)(1), (c)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED in part and DISMISSED in part. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b958-7\">. We find no error in the IJ\u2019s decision to give no weight to a letter from Zhao's aunt in China when she had no personal knowledge of the events about which she wrote. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen, </em>471 F.3d at 342 (noting that the weight afforded to record evidence lies largely within the IJ\u2019s discretion).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
