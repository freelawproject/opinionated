We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. While the magistrate judge advised Gumbs that failure to timely file specific written objections to the report would result in waiver of the right to appeal from the district court\u2019s judgment, Gumbs failed to file any objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation. Therefore, Gumbs waived appellate review of his claims. <em>See United States v. Midgette, </em>478 F.3d 616, 621-22 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 3032, 168 L.Ed.2d 749 (2007). Moreover, Gumbs\u2019 claims of attorney error provide no basis for relief. <em>See Sanchez v. United States Postal Serv., 785 </em>F.2d 1236, 1237 (5th Cir.1986) (holding that there is no right to effective assistance of counsel in civil cases). Accordingly, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-17\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
