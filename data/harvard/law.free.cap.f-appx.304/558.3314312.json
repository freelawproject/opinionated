We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. <em>Fernandez-Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>468 F.3d 1159, 1163 (9th Cir.2006). Reviewing de novo, <em>id., </em>we grant the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">The BIA\u2019s decision preceded this court\u2019s recent opinion in <em>United States v. Gomez-Leon, </em>545 F.3d 777 (9th Cir.2008). The Attorney General acknowledges that, as in <em>Gomez-Leon, </em>the certified administrative record in Sandoval-Macias\u2019 case does not establish whether he was credited for his initial 180-day sentence, a condition of probation, in his subsequent 352-day sentence after a probation violation. This ambiguity results from Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 19.2, which restricts a trial court from sentencing a defendant to more than 365 days in jail as a term of probation absent a waiver by the defendant pursuant to <em>People v. Johnson, </em>82 Cal.App.3d 183, 147 Cal.Rptr. 55 (1978). <em>See Gomez-Leon, </em>545 F.3d at 784-85. Under <em>Gomez-Leon, </em>the BIA should not have added Sandoval-Macias\u2019 sentences together to conclude that he is removable as an aggravated felon for committing \u201ca crime of violence ... for which the term of imprisonment [is] at least one year.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F). The government has therefore not met its burden of demonstrating Sandoval-Macias\u2019 removability. <em>See Gomez-Leon, </em>545 F.3d at 785.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-11\">In light of our disposition, we need not address Sandoval-Macias\u2019 remaining contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-12\">We deny the Attorney General\u2019s motion to remand \u201cto adduce further evidence.\u201d <em>See Fernandez-Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>466 F.3d 1121, 1133-35 (9th Cir.2006) (en banc). We vacate Sandoval-Macias\u2019 removal order and remand for further proceedings consistent with this disposition. <em>See Ruiz-Vidal v. Gonzales, </em>473 F.3d 1072, 1080 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b583-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
