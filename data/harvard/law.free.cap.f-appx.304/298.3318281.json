We review the dismissal of a complaint on the pleadings de novo, employing the same standard applied to dismissals for failure to state a claim under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). <em>Johnson v. Johnson, </em>385 F.3d 503, 529 (5th Cir.2004). Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-20\">The Prison Litigation Reform Act requires prisoners to exhaust administrative remedies prior to filing a \u00a7 1983 complaint challenging prison conditions. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a); <em>Woodford v. Ngo, </em>548 U.S. 81, 88-89, 126 S.Ct. 2378, 165 L.Ed.2d 368 (2006). Gonzales was required to file a grievance within ninety days of the alleged incidents. La. Admin. Code tit. 22 \u00a7 325(A)(2) (2008); <em>Johnson v. La. ex. rel. La. Dept. of Pub. Safety &amp; Corr., </em>468 F.3d 278, 280 (5th Cir.2006) (per curiam). According to Gonzales\u2019s own pleadings, including the complaint that he signed under penalty of perjury, the earliest date that he submitted a grievance was October 18, 2006, the ninety-first day after the July 19 incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-21\">Gonzales argues that he was prevented from timely filing because he was denied access to writing materials. Gonzales did not raise this argument in the district court, and we need not consider it here. <em>See Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999) (per curiam). Further, Gonzales\u2019s argument is conclusory and unsupported by any citations to evidence in the record. In sum, the dismissal of Gonzales\u2019s complaint for failure to exhaust administrative remedies was not erroneous. Accordingly, we need not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>reach the determination that the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections is immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment, although that determination is supported by our precedent. <em>See Champagne v. Jefferson Parish Sheriffs Office, </em>188 F.3d 312, 313-14 (5th Cir.1999) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Finally, Gonzales has filed a motion for summary judgment in this court. He must file any such motion in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">The judgment is AFFIRMED. The motion for summary judgment is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b322-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
