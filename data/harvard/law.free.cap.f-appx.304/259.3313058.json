Macias does not dispute that he was the driver of a car that caused U.S. Customs and Border Protection Officer Ronald Kraft to lose control of his motorcycle or that Officer Kraft was injured in the resulting crash. Macias argues, however, that the evidence shows only that both men were negligent and that there is no evidence that Macias acted intentionally. Macias further argues that the evidence fails to show that he assaulted Officer Kraft on account of the performance of his official duties because there is no evidence that Macias was aware that Kraft was one of several Customs and Border Protection officers who searched Macias\u2019s vehicle earlier that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-22\">Our review of the evidence shows that a rational jury could have concluded that Macias intentionally assaulted Officer Kraft and that the assault occurred on account of the victim\u2019s performance of his official duties. <em>See United States v. Pruneda-Gonzalez, </em>953 F.2d 190, 193 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b283-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
