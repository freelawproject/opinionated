Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), when a defendant\u2019s lawyer\u2019s cross-examination is adversely affected due to the lawyer\u2019s prior representation of that witness?\u201d We have jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b611-15\">In our prior opinion, this court vacated the district court\u2019s denial of Alberni\u2019s application for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to \u00a7 2254(a) based on its determination that his Sixth Amendment right to conflict-free representation was not violated by his trial counsel\u2019s cross-examination of a prosecution witness who had been a former client of Alberni\u2019s counsel. <em>Alberni v. McDaniel, </em>458 F.3d 860, 874 (9th Cir. 2006). We directed the district court to conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine whether \u201csome effect on counsel\u2019s handling of particular aspects of the trial was likely\u201d due to the potential conflict. <em>Id. </em>at 874. In its mandate, this court also stated that, \u201c[s]hould the district court conclude that an actual conflict of interest existed, Mr. Alberni need not show prejudice.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b611-16\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b611-17\">Upon remand, the district court held an evidentiary hearing. It found that Alberni\u2019s attorney\u2019s \u201cperformance at Petitioner\u2019s trial was adversely affected by [his] prior representation of [his former client].\u201d <em>Alberni v. McDaniel, </em>No. 3:01-CV-00725 (LRH-RAM), 2007 WL 4591786, at *3, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 95732, at *12 (D.Nev. Dec. 27, 2007). Thus, there was a conflict of interest. The district court also opined that this court erroneously conclud<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>eel that prejudice need not be presumed because of its \u201cdeference to the Nevada Supreme Court\u2019s dicta.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *4, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 95732, at *11. In footnote 4 of its order, the district court stated: \u201cThis court will consider the Nevada Supreme Court\u2019s response to this question as controlling precedent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *4, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 95732, at *12 n. 4. The district court granted Alberni leave to file an interlocutory appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Alberni asks this court to vacate the district court\u2019s certification to the Nevada Supreme Court the question whether under <em>Strickland </em>prejudice should be presumed where the record shows that trial counsel had an actual conflict of interest because he had previously represented a witness for the prosecution. Alberni contends that the district court violated the rule of mandate in failing to enter an order granting his application for a writ of habeas corpus upon finding that his counsel had an actual conflict of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">This court has previously held in <em>United States v. Garcia-Beltran, </em>443 F.3d 1126 (9th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>549 U.S. 935, 127 S.Ct. 319, 166 L.Ed.2d 239 (2006), that \u201c[t]he rule of mandate requires a lower court to act on the mandate of an appellate court, without variance or examination, only execution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1130. The rule of mandate doctrine provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-7\">When a case has been once decided by this court on appeal, and remanded to the [district court], whatever was before this court, and disposed of by its decree, is considered as finally settled. The [district court] is bound by the decree as the law of the case, and must carry it into execution according to the mandate. That court cannot vary it, or examine it for any other purpose than execution; or give any other or further relief; or review it, even for apparent error, upon any matter decided on appeal; or intermeddle with it, further than to settle so much as has been remanded.... But the [district court] may consider and decide any matters left open by the mandate of this court....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-9\"><em>United States v. Thrasher, </em>483 F.3d 977, 981-982 (9th Cir.2007) (citing <em>In re Sanford Fork &amp; Tool Co., </em>160 U.S. 247, 255-56, 16 S.Ct. 291, 40 L.Ed. 414 (1895)). In <em>United States v. Houser, </em>804 F.2d 565 (9th Cir.1986), this court held</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Afj\">A trial court may <em>not, </em>however, reconsider a question decided by an appellate court. When matters are decided by an appellate court, its rulings, unless reversed by it or a superior court, bind the lower court. Upon remand, an issue decided by an appellate court may not be reconsidered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 567 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-11\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b612-12\">The district court violated the rule of mandate in holding that \u201c[t]his court will consider the Nevada Supreme Court\u2019s response to this question as controlling precedent.\u201d Under the law of mandate, this court\u2019s decision is the controlling precedent regarding the question whether a petitioner who demonstrates that his counsel had an actual conflict of interest at his trial is entitled to a writ of habeas corpus without a showing of prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-13\">Accordingly, we VACATE the district court\u2019s order certifying the question whether prejudice must be shown under these circumstances to the Nevada Supreme Court. Appellant\u2019s request that we instruct the district court to grant his application for a writ of habeas corpus and vacate his conviction is DENIED without prejudice. This court\u2019s jurisdiction in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>interlocutory appeal is limited to the question whether the district court erred in certifying the question whether prejudice must be shown under these circumstances to the Nevada Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">VACATED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b611-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
