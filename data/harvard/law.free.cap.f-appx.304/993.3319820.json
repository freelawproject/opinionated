For the reasons that follow, we will deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-29\">I. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1017-30\">Petitioner Hari Djati Intan is a native and citizen of Indonesia. Intan entered the United States in April 2000 as a non-immigrant visitor and unlawfully remained longer than permitted. In February 2003, Intan applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Conven<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>tion Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d), claiming he experienced past persecution and feared future persecution in Indonesia because he is an ethnic Chinese Christian. Intan, represented by counsel, appeared before an Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) and conceded removability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">On August 5, 2005, after several hearings, the IJ issued an oral decision. The IJ held that Intan was not eligible for asylum because he applied more than one year after his arrival in the United States. The IJ also held that Intan failed to meet his burden of burden of proof to establish eligibility for withholding of removal or protection under the CAT. He therefore denied Intan\u2019s applications. Intan appealed to the BIA, which issued an opinion affirming the IJ\u2019s decision and dismissing the appeal on September 19, 2007. This timely petition for review followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-5\">II. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1018-6\">Intan\u2019s sole argument on appeal is that he is entitled to withholding of removal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> To qualify for withholding of removal pursuant to INA \u00a7 241(b)(3)(A) [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A) ], Intan bore the burden of demonstrating a \u201cclear probability\u201d of future persecution \u2014 that \u201cit is more likely than not\u201d that he would be persecuted. <em>See INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 449-50, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). Intan claims his documentary evidence established a \u201cpattern or practice of persecution of a group of persons similarly situated to the applicant____\u201d, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(2), in Intan\u2019s case, ethnic Chinese Christians in Indonesia. We review the BIA\u2019s determination under the deferential substantial evidence standard.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Chen v. Ashcroft, </em>376 F.3d 215, 223 (3d Cir.2004). Thus, \u201c[t]o reverse the BIA finding we must find that the evidence not only <em>supports </em>that conclusion [that Intan would more likely than not suffer persecution], but <em>compels </em>it.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-12\">We have not conclusively addressed whether a pattern or practice of persecution of ethnic Chinese Christians in Indonesia exists at the present time. <em>See Sukwanputra v. Gonzales, </em>434 F.3d 627, 637 n. 10 (3d Cir.2006). However, we have held that information in the 1999, 2003, and 2004 State Department Reports does not establish persecution sufficiently \u201csystemic, pervasive, or organized\u201d to constitute a pattern or practice. <em>See Sioe Tjen Wong v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>539 F.3d 225, 233-34 (3d Cir.2008); <em>Lie v. Ashcroft, </em>396 F.3d 530, 537 (3d Cir.2005). For example, the 1999 report shows that the \u201cIndonesian government officially promotes religious and ethnic tolerance\u201d and the interreligious violence that did arise \u201cseem[ed] to have been primarily wrought by fellow citizens and not the result of governmental action or acquiescence.\u201d <em>Lie, </em>396 F.3d at 537. Similarly, the 2003 and 2004 reports \u201cgenerally emphasize the steps taken by the Indonesian government to promote religious, racial, and ethnic tolerance and to reduce interreligious violence ... [and] indicate that private parties, not government officials, are the predominant cause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>harassment and violence.\u201d <em>Sioe Tjen Wong, </em>539 F.3d at 233-34.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">Like the applicants in <em>Lie </em>and <em>Sioe Tjen Wong, </em>Intan relies on State Department Reports. While Intan relies on more recent reports \u2014 including State Department International Religious Freedom Reports for 2005 and 2006 \u2014 these reports are similar to those discussed in <em>Lie </em>and <em>Sioe Tjen Wong </em>in that they contain evidence undermining the pattern or practice claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Indeed, in <em>Sioe Tjen Wong, </em>we noted that recent State Department Reports actually show <em>improved </em>treatment of ethnic Chinese Christians in Indonesia. <em>Sioe Tjen Wong, </em>539 F.3d at 234. Thus, the BIA could reasonably conclude that these more recent reports also do not establish a pattern or practice of persecution of ethnic Chinese Christians in Indonesia. Because the evidentiary record does not compel a contrary conclusion, <em>see Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, the BIA\u2019s decision rests upon substantial evidence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1019-6\">III. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1019-7\">The documentary evidence provided by Intan is insufficient to compel a reasonable adjudicator to conclude Intan would <em>more likely than not </em>be persecuted. The BIA\u2019s ruling rests on substantial evidence, and we will therefore deny the petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1018-9\">. In his brief, Intan does not dispute the BIA\u2019s other holdings, including the denial of asylum for failure to apply within one year of his arrival in the United States, <em>see </em>INA \u00a7 208(a)(2) [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)], and the denial of relief under the CAT for failure to show he would more likely than not be tortured if removed. <em>See Obale v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>453 F.3d 151, 161 (3d Cir.2006). We therefore need not address these issues because they are waived. <em>See Voci v. Gonzales, </em>409 F.3d 607, 610 n. 1 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1018-14\">. Because the BIA provided its own analysis and did not expressly defer to or adopt the IJ's decision, we review the BIA's decision. <em>See Voci, </em>409 F.3d at 612-13; <em>Miah v. Ashcroft, </em>346 F.3d 434, 439 (3d Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1019-8\">. Similarly, the BIA held in <em>In re A-M-, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 737, 741-42 (BIA 2005), that a 2002 State Department Country Report concluding that \"Government acquiescence [in Chinese Christian persecution] is not the norm\u201d and that \"the Indonesian Government 'officially promotes racial and ethnic tolerance' \u201d did not establish the petitioner's pattern or practice claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1019-9\">. For example, the 2006 State Department Report on International Religious Freedom notes that \"the Government generally respected freedom of religion,\u201d that \"[t]here was little change in respect for religious freedom during the period covered by the report,\u201d and that \"[m]ost of the population enjoyed a high degree of religious freedom.\u201d A.R. 317.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1019-10\">. Intan relies heavily on the Second Circuit's decision in <em>Mufied v. Mukasey, </em>508 F.3d 88 (2d Cir.2007), in support of his claim of a pattern or practice of persecution of ethnic Chinese Christians in Indonesia. However, the petitioner in <em>Mufied </em>was not ethnic Chinese, but rather a Christian of \u201cManadois\u201d ethnicity. Perhaps even more importantly, the Second Circuit <em>did </em>not find as a matter of law that ethnic Manadois Christians suffered a pattern or practice of persecution, but rather held that because the BIA did not consider the issue in the first instance, the case was proper for remand. In contrast, here, the BIA did consider Intan\u2019s pattern or practice evidence and found it insufficient. <em>See </em>BIA Opinion at 2 (noting, for example, that the 2005 State Department Report \"does not support the respondent's contention that a pattern or practice of persecution against Chinese Christians exists in Indonesia\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
