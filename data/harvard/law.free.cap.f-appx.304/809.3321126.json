After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-14\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b834-15\">In 1991, a jury found Edwards guilty of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and a mixture containing cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846. At sentencing, Edwards\u2019s base offense level was 38, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(3) (1990), because he possessed more than 1.5 kilograms of crack cocaine. After receiving a three-level role enhancement, Edwards\u2019s total offense level was 41. Edwards was designated a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 based on his two prior violent felonies, which gave him a criminal history category of VI. Edwards\u2019s resulting guidelines range was 360 months\u2019 to life imprisonment. The district court imposed a life sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-16\">In March 2008, Edwards filed a \u00a7 3582 motion to reduce his sentence. Edwards\u2019s motion was based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which lowered the base offense levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 for crack cocaine offenses. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amends. 706, 713; <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1325 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-17\">The district court denied the motion, concluding that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) did not authorize a reduction in sentence. The district court explained that because Edwards was sentenced as a career offender, Amendment 706 did not lower his guidelines range of 360 months\u2019 to life imprisonment. Edwards filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-18\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b834-19\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court has discretion to reduce the term of imprisonment of an already incarcerated defendant if that defendant \u201chas been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>ant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(1) (Supp. May 1, 2008). However, \u201c[wjhere a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330; <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B) (Supp. May 1, 2008).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">Here, the district court did not err in concluding it lacked authority to modify Edwards\u2019s sentence. After Amendment 706, Edwards\u2019s base offense level would be 36 instead of 38, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(e)(2) (Supp. May 1, 2008), and his total offense level would be 39. <em>See United, States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000) (explaining that, in recalculating a defendant\u2019s sentence under an amended guideline, \u201c[a]ll other guideline application decisions made during the original sentencing remain intact\u201d). As a career offender with a criminal history category of VI, however, Edwards\u2019s sentencing range would remain 360 months\u2019 to life imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. Sentencing Table (providing a sentencing range of 360 months\u2019 to life imprisonment for a defendant with a criminal history category of VI and an offense level between 37 and 42). Thus, Amendment 706 did not lower Edwards\u2019s sentencing range, and \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in his term of imprisonment. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327-28; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B) (Supp. May 1, 2008). Because Edwards does not qualify for resentencing under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the district court had no occasion to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the advisory guidelines or to exercise its discretion to impose a new sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">To the extent Edwards argues that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) entitles him to a sentence reduction, <em>Booker </em>does not provide a jurisdictional basis for \u00a7 3582 relief. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1369 (11th Cir.2008). Edwards\u2019s challenges to various sentencing calculations made at his original sentencing are outside the scope of this \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, and we do not address them. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (limiting proceedings under the statute to cases where a retroactive amendment affects the applicable guidelines range); <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining that all original sentence determinations remain unchanged in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding except for the amended guidelines range).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b835-6\">.
