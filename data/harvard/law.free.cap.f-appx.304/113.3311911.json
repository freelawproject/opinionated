For the reason that follows, we will deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-25\">On September 18, 2008, Mitchell filed an \u201cApplication for Leave to Intervene and for a Writ in the Nature of a Prohibition\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>in the aforementioned lawsuit. The District Court dismissed the amended complaint in that case on October 27, 2008, for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted pursuant to subsections (b)(1) and (6), respectively, of Rule 12 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. In a separate order entered on the same day, the District Court dismissed as moot all pending motions in the case. Mitchell filed his petition for a writ of mandamus with this Court on November 6, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">As the District Court has already done what Mitchell seeks to have this Court order it to do \u2014 rule on his motion to intervene \u2014 Mitchell\u2019s petition is moot. <em>See In re Surrick, </em>338 F.3d 224, 229-30 (3d Cir. 2003) (discussing constitutional and prudential dimensions of mootness and noting that \u201cthe central question of all mootness problems is whether changes in circumstances that prevailed at the beginning of the litigation have forestalled any occasion for meaningful relief.\u201d). Accordingly, we will deny his petition for a writ of mandamus.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
