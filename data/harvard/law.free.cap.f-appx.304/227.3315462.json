The district court held that Defendants\u2019 allegedly fraudulent representations did not constitute a warranty under Maryland law, that PFB\u2019s lost income projections on its claims for fraud and breach of contract were speculative, and that PFB failed to prove it had incurred any recoverable out-of-pocket expenses. We have thoroughly reviewed the record and find the district court did not err in concluding that PFB could not recover benefit-of-the-bargain or lost profit damages on its fraud and breach of contract claims, as PFB failed to establish such damages with reasonable certainty. Furthermore, we find the district court did not err in holding that PFB failed to provide sufficient evidence to permit recovery of out-of-pocket expenses. Accordingly, we affirm these rulings for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See PFB, LLC v. Trabich, </em>No. 1:07-cv-00961-WDQ (D.Md. Apr. 24, 2008). However, for the reasons stated below, we vacate the district court\u2019s dismissal of PFB\u2019s breach of contract claim and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">The district court dismissed PFB\u2019s fraud and breach of contract claims on the ground that PFB failed to prove it suffered any actual damages. However, while other jurisdictions require proof of actual damages to sustain a breach of contract action, Maryland courts have held that \u201c[i]t is well settled that every injury to the rights of another imports damage, and if no other damage is established, the party injured is at least entitled to a verdict for nominal damages.\u201d <em>Cottman v. Maryland, Dep\u2019t of Natural Res., </em>51 Md. App. 380, 443 A.2d 638, 640 (Md.Ct. Spec.App.1982) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); <em>see also Planmatics, Inc. v. Showers, </em>30 Fed.Appx. 117, 118-20 (4th Cir.2002) (unpublished) (citing <em>Stueber v. Arrowhead Farm Estates Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>69 Md.App. 775, 519 A.2d 816, 818 (Md.Ct.Spec.App.1987)). Accordingly, even though PFB failed to provide evidence sufficient to support its claims for lost profits or out-of-pocket expenses, its cause of action for breach of contract cannot fail as a matter of law because PFB is entitled to, at the very least, nominal damages, if the fact-finder determines there was a breach. <em>See Planmatics, Inc. v. Showers, </em>137 F.Supp.2d 616, 624 (D.Md. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-11\">In this case, the district court made no finding as to whether Defendants committed fraud or bi\u2019eached the operating agreement, as PFB\u2019s action was dismissed due to its failure to provide sufficient and reliable evidence of actual damages. Therefore, we remand this matter to the district court to determine whether Defendants were in breach of their contractual obli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>gations and, as a result, are liable for nominal damages. Furthermore, we leave for the district court on remand to address whether PFB is entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to the terms of the parties\u2019 operating agreement,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as well as the issue of whether punitive damages are available and warranted in this case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s ruling as to PFB\u2019s failure to establish compensatory damages in regard to its claims of fraud and breach of contract, vacate the district court\u2019s dismissal of PFB\u2019s contract action, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b253-8\">.
