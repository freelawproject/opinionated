Koeltl, District Judge for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b931-26\">\n<em>SUMMARY ORDER</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b931-27\">Third-Party-Plaintiff-Appellant appeals from a judgment of the District Court (Seybert, J.) granting Third-Party-Defendants-Appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff-Appellant\u2019s claims of negligence and negligent infliction of emotional distress. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, procedural history, and scope of issues presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-28\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Jaramillo v. Weyerhaeuser Co., </em>536 F.3d 140, 145 (2d Cir. 2008). \u201c[W]e are \u2018required to resolve all ambiguities and draw all permissible factual inferences in favor of the party against whom summary judgment is sought.\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number><em>Terry v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 128, 137 (2d Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Stern v. Trs. of Columbia Univ., </em>131 F.3d 305, 312 (2d Cir.1997)). \u201cWe review discovery rulings for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>In re Agent Orange Prod. Liab. Litig., </em>517 F.3d 76, 102 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">Summary judgment against Plaintiff-Appellant on the negligent infliction of emotional distress claim was proper. New York courts have expressed a \u201clongstanding reluctance to recognize causes of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress, especially in cases where the plaintiff suffered no independent physical or economic injury.\u201d <em>Broadnax v. Gonzalez, </em>2 N.Y.3d 148, 777 N.Y.S.2d 416, 809 N.E.2d 645, 648 (2004). The cause of action \u201cmust generally be premised upon a breach of a duty owed directly to the plaintiff which either endangered the plaintiffs physical safety or caused the plaintiff fear for his or her own physical safety.\u201d <em>Lancellotti v. Howard, </em>155 A.D.2d 588, 547 N.Y.S.2d 654, 655 (App. Div.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">Given the absence of any special circumstances in this case that raise a \u201clikelihood of genuine and serious mental distress ... [and that] guarantee that the claim is not spurious,\u201d <em>Johnson v. State, </em>37 N.Y.2d 378, 372 N.Y.S.2d 638, 334 N.E.2d 590, 592 (1975) (internal quotation marks omitted), the plaintiffs failure to show that defendant \u201cendangered his physical safety or caused him fear for his physical safety\u201d is fatal to his claim. <em>Peter T. v. Children\u2019s Village, Inc., </em>30 A.D.3d 582, 819 N.Y.S.2d 44, 47 (App.Div.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-6\">Likewise, the district court properly granted summary judgment against Plaintiff-Appellant on his negligence claim. Plaintiff-Appellant has introduced no evidence into the record that would allow a jury to conclude that Providian was negligent in selecting agencies to collect on Plaintiff-Appellant\u2019s unpaid debts, nor did he introduce any evidence from which a jury could find legally compensable damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-8\">We also find that Plaintiff-Appellant had ample opportunity to conduct discovery, and find no abuse of discretion in the District Court\u2019s refusal to extend the time for discovery. The information sought in the extension request was at best of minor relevance to the issues in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-9\">We have considei\u2019ed Plaintiff-Appellant\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
