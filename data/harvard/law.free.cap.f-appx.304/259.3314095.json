The IJ found that Chay\u2019s testimony that a gang member had attempted to kill her brother while the family was living in Guatemala was credible. Chay argues that she was a member of a social group consisting of young Guatemalan women that was persecuted by gangs that targeted them for recruitment. She contends that the incident involving her brother establishes past persecution and that she has a well-founded fear of future persecution if she returns to Guatemala.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-17\">We review the BIA\u2019s determination that an alien is not entitled to asylum or withholding of removal for substantial evidence and will not reverse the BIA\u2019s decision unless the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>Chen v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d 1131, 1134 (5th Cir.2006). To obtain asylum, an applicant must demonstrate \u201cpersecution or a well-founded fear of persecution\u201d on the basis of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 904 (5th Cir.2002) (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (2000)). The standard for obtaining withholding of removal is even higher, requiring a showing that it is more likely than not that the applicant\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened by persecution on one of those grounds. <em>Id. </em>at 906. The BIA did not err in determining that Chay failed to demonstrate that she was a member of a particular social group entitled to protection. Her contention that as a young <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>Guatemalan woman, she is a member of a social group that gangs are targeting to recruit is overly broad and does not establish a meaningful basis for distinguishing her from other people. <em>See Perez-Molina v. Gonzales, </em>193 Fed.Appx. 313 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Sanehez-Trujillo v. INS, </em>801 F.2d 1571, 1576-77 (9th Cir.1986). Additionally, she did not show that gang members had ever threatened her or attempted to recruit her. Accordingly, there is substantial evidence to support the BIA\u2019s denial of asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See Efe, </em>293 F.3d at 904-06.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b284-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
