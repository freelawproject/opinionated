Reyna argues that the district court violated the law of the case doctrine and the mandate rule by increasing his base offense level for a prior conviction for a controlled substance offense and calculating the guideline range to be greater than 41 to 51 months. He contends that in his previous appeal, this Court held that the properly calculated guideline range was 41 to 51 months and remanded expressly because it was unclear whether the district court would have imposed a variance of up to 120 months when starting from the correct range as articulated by this Court. He notes that the Government never moved to supplement the record on appeal with any documents pertaining to his 2000 conviction and never moved this Court for rehearing. He argues that this Court should again vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s application of the remand order, including whether the law of the case doctrine or mandate rule forecloses the district court\u2019s actions on remand. <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>470 F.3d 200, 204 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">In our prior opinion, <em>United States v. Reyna, </em>243 Fed.Appx. 824, 826 (5th Cir. 2007), we held that \u201cthe district court erred in determining, based on the PSR\u2019s description of his conduct, that Reyna\u2019s prior conviction was a controlled substance offense.\u201d We did not purport to limit the ability of the district court to consider other evidence on remand bearing on the issue whether Reyna\u2019s prior offense was a controlled substance offense. There is nothing in our mandate which would prohibit the district court from looking at the charging documents and judgment and making a new determination on this issue. The issue arose out of the correction of the sentence by this court in the first appeal. <em>See United States v. Lee, </em>358 F.3d 315, 320-22 (5th Cir.2004); <em>United States v. Marmolejo, </em>139 F.3d 528, 531 (5th Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-11\">The new evidence shows that Reyna pleaded guilty to delivery of cocaine by constructive transfer, which makes the pri- or conviction a controlled substance offense. <em>See United States v. Roberts, </em>255 Fed.Appx. 849, 850-51 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 1728, 170 L.Ed.2d 531 (2008). The district court did not err in considering the new evidence in determining that the base offense level was 20, yielding a guideline range of 78-97 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-14\">Reyna argues, alternatively, that the district court once again reversibly erred by enhancing his sentence for a pri- or conviction for a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d because his 2000 Texas conviction for delivery of a controlled substance did not qualify as a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d for another reason he did not raise in the prior appeal or in the district court on remand. Reyna contends that the Sentencing Guidelines define a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d in part as \u201can offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.\u201d He argues that, using the analysis called for by a recent Supreme Court opinion, <em>United States v. Rodriquez, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 1783, 170 L.Ed.2d 719 (2008), his prior state offense was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>\u201cpunishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">Under the law of the case doctrine, \u201c[t]he only issues on remand properly before the district court are those issues arising out of the correction of the sentence ordered by this court. In short, the resentencing court can consider whatever this court directs-no more, no less. All other issues not arising out of this court\u2019s ruling and not raised before the appeals court, which could have been brought in the original appeal, are not proper for reconsideration by the district court below.\u201d <em>Marmolejo, </em>139 F.3d at 531. If an issue not raised in the original appeal is not proper for consideration in the district court on remand, a fortiorari, it is improper for this court to consider it on appeal after remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Reyna argues that the law of the case doctrine should not apply because of two exceptions, an intervening change of law by controlling authority and manifest injustice. Although Reyna\u2019s plea agreement allowed him to be sentenced to eight months in prison, under Texas law, the offense remains a felony punishable by law for up to two years, even if the offense is sentenced as a misdemeanor. <em>See United States v. Rivera-Perez, </em>322 F.3d 350, 351-52 (5th Cir.2003). Reyna argues that <em>Rodriquez, </em>128 S.Ct. 1783, provides new law which changes the analysis used in <em>Rivera-Perez.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\"><em>Rodriquez </em>has no bearing on Reyna\u2019s case. It is clear from Texas law and the documents in Reyna\u2019s state case that he faced the possibility of a sentence up to two years, and he entered into a plea agreement for a sentence of 8 months. His plea agreement does not change the fact that his felony conviction was \u201can offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.\u201d \u00a7 4B1.2(b). The problem in <em>Rodnquez </em>was that it could not be determined from looking at the statute of conviction whether the defendant was subject to the enhanced sentence as a recidivist. 128 S.Ct. at 1791. No such problem exists in this case in determining, by looking at the statutes, that Reyna\u2019s offense was punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year. <em>See </em>Tex. Health and Safety Code Ann. \u00a7 481.112(b); Tex Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 12.35(a). Reyna has not shown that any exceptions to the law of the case doctrine apply which would allow consideration of his new argument raised for the first time in this second appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">Reyna argues that the district court committed reversible error by imposing an unreasonable sentence substantially above the applicable Guideline imprisonment range. Most of his arguments are predicated on the incorrect assumption that his correct guideline range was 41 to 51 months, and those arguments are thus without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">Reyna also argues that the district court committed procedural error in violation of <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) by failing to adequately explain the sentence it imposed. He contends that the district court failed to explain why a variance up to 120 months was justified. Reyna never raised procedural unreasonableness for failure to articulate reasons in the district court. When a defendant argues for the first time on appeal that the sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to adequately explain its reasons for the sentence, appellate review of that issue is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 806 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 625, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-14\">The guideline range was correctly determined by the district court to be 78-97 months. The district court explained that it was varying upward based on the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>that the Sentencing Commission had amended the Guidelines to again provide for a base offense level of 22 for possession of a semiautomatic pistol such as the one Reyna possessed. The district court acknowledged that it could not apply the 2007 version of the Guidelines to determine Reyna\u2019s advisory guideline range, but it stated that it could consider the new Guideline in determining whether a non-guideline sentence was appropriate. This is an adequate explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Lastly, Reyna argues that the sentence was unreasonable and excessive because it is well beyond that necessary to comply with the purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a). Starting with the correct guideline range of 78 to 97 months, and considering the district court\u2019s reasons for the upward variance to 120 months, the sentence was reasonable. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b289-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
