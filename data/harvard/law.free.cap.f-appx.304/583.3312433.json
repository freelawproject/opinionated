The BIA held Bentacourt did not comply with the requirements for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel set forth in <em>Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), <em>aff'd, </em>857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir.1988), and further Bentacourt \u201chas failed to establish prejudice as a result of the allegedly ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d Bentacourt timely filed this petition for review on February 28, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-12\">We review the BIA\u2019s factual determinations and its denial of Bentacourt\u2019s motion to remand for abuse of discretion. <em>Castillo-Perez v. INS, </em>212 F.3d 518, 523-24 (9th Cir.2000). We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-13\">Not only did Bentacourt fail to comply with the requirements of <em>Matter of Lozada, </em>he cannot prove any prejudice from his counsel\u2019s failure to file an application for section 212(c) relief, because he is statutorily ineligible for 212(c) relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-14\">Bentacourt\u2019s alleges his counsel was \u201ccontracted or retained\u201d by his wife for $5,000, but there was no contract or proof of payment of the fee. The affidavit alleges his counsel was responsible for \u201call of my applications for relief\u2019 but does not specify the relief to be sought. Bentacourt has no documentation he contacted his former counsel. He claims he telephoned his counsel, but counsel ignored his calls. There is no evidence the requirement to contact the attorney was met and there has been no response from counsel. Bentacourt\u2019s complaint to the California Bar is also deficient because there is no evidence it was filed. He gives no explanation why it was not filed. Therefore, Bentacourt\u2019s motion to remand does not meet the requirements set by <em>Matter of Lozada.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b608-15\">More importantly, it would have been useless for his attorney to file an application for 212(c) relief. Bentacourt is statutorily ineligible for such relief because (1) he was convicted of sexual abuse of a minor and (2) he was not seeking relief from an order excluding his admission to this country, he was seeking relief from an order of removal. Each factor indepen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>dently makes him ineligible to apply for 212(c) relief. <em>Abebe v. Mukasey, </em>No. 05-76201, 2008 WL-(9th Cir. November 18, 2008) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b608-16\">. Both parties refer to Carlos Rubio-Bentacourt by different names.
