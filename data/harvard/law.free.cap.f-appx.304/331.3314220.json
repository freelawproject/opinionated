Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, the career offender provision, the district court sentenced Gutierrez to 262 months in prison, based in part on a previous New Mexico guilty plea conviction for distribution of marijuana by possession with intent to distribute. On appeal, Gutierrez asserts that the district court erred in sentencing him as a career offender because neither his New Mexico conviction nor his instant conviction qualifies as a \u201ccontrolled substance offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-16\">A defendant can be classified as a career offender if (1) he was at least 18 years old at the time of the commission of the instant offense; (2) the instant offense is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense; and (3) he has at least two prior felony convictions that were either crimes of violence or controlled substance offenses. U.S.S.G \u00a7 4B1.1(a). Section 4B1.2(b) of the Guidelines defines a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAo\">an offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) or the possession of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-17\">The New Mexico statute at issue provides in relevant part, \u201c[ejxcept as authorized by the Controlled Substances Act, it is unlawful for a person to intentionally distribute or possess with intent to distribute a controlled substance or a controlled substance analog____\u201d N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 30-31-22(A) (1978). Gutierrez specifically argues that the statute is overly broad because it prohibits \u201ccontrolled substance analogs,\u201d which are not mentioned in the Guidelines\u2019 definition of a controlled substance. A de novo review, <em>see United States v. Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d 345, 347 (5th Cir.2006), reveals that Gutierrez\u2019s argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-19\">Under the categorical approach set forth in <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>(1990), a district court must look to the elements of a prior offense, rather than to the facts underlying the conviction, when classifying a prior offense for sentence enhancement purposes. <em>United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 273-74 (5th Cir.2005). However, \u201c[i]f a statute contains multiple, disjunctive subsections, courts may look beyond the statute to certain conclusive records made or .used in adjudicating guilt in order to determine which particular statutory alternative applies to the defendant\u2019s conviction.\u201d <em>United States v. Bonilla-Mungia, </em>422 F.3d 316, 320 (5th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). We have held that determining whether a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d occurred categorically falls within the \u201crange of cases where the court may consider information other than the statutory definition of the offense.\u201d <em>Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d at 273. We also must treat the determination of whether a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d occurred in the same manner, since the Guidelines\u2019 definition for \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d is identical to the Guidelines\u2019 definition for \u201ccontrolled substance offense.\u201d <em>See United States v. Ford, </em>509 F.3d 714, 718 n. 2 (5th Cir.2007) (comparing \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b) cmt. n. 1 and \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. 1(B)(iv)), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 44, 172 L.Ed.2d 51 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Therefore, in this case, the district court was free to consider the statutory definition of the offense, the charging paper, jury instructions, the written plea agreement, the guilty-plea transcript, and factual findings by the trial judge to which the defendant assented. <em>Bonilla-Mungia, </em>422 F.3d at 320. The district court was not permitted, however, to rely on the PSR\u2019s characterization of the offense for enhancement purposes. <em>See Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d at 274.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">This court need not determine whether the prohibition of \u201ccontrolled substance analogs\u201d makes the New Mexico statute overly broad because Gutierrez was charged in the state court indictment with conduct that actually falls within the definition of a controlled substance offense as that term is defined in \u00a7 4B1.2 of the Guidelines. The indictment charged Gutierrez with \u201cknowingly and intentionally transfer[ring], causing] the transfer, attempting] to transfer or possessing] with intent to transfer marijuana.\u201d According to the judgment of conviction, Gutierrez pled guilty to the offense of distribution of marijuana by possession with intent to distribute, a fourth degree felony. The language of both the indictment and the judgment clearly indicates that Gutierrez\u2019s conviction involved actual marijuana and not a \u201ccontrolled substance analog.\u201d Because the conduct described in Gutierrez\u2019s state court marijuana indictment and judgment of conviction is equivalent to the offense of possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute, the district court did not err in enhancing Gutierrez\u2019s offense level under \u00a7 4B1.1(a). <em>See Ford, </em>509 F.3d at 717.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">Gutierrez argues for the first time that the district court erred in relying exclusively on the statutory definition and the judgment of conviction to determine whether his New Mexico conviction was a \u201ccontrolled substance offense.\u201d He asserts that the district court was required to examine the charging document and the jury instructions before making a decision. As we have noted, under the modified categorical approach, the district court was permitted to look beyond the elements of the offense and consider other conclusive documents such as the charging paper, jury instructions, the written plea agreement, the guilty-plea transcript, and factual findings by the trial judge to which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>defendant assented. <em>See Bonilla-Mungia, </em>422 F.3d at 320. However, there is no requirement that the district court must review all of these alternative documents or must specifically review the charging instrument and the jury instructions. Here, the district court properly considered the judgment of conviction, which expressly states that Gutierrez pled guilty to distribution of marijuana by possession with intent to distribute, and the statutory definition of the offense to conclude that Gutierrez\u2019s prior New Mexico conviction qualified as a controlled substance offense. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">In addition, Gutierrez argues for the first time that his instant conviction for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 100 kilograms or more of marijuana does not qualify as a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d under the Guidelines because conspiracy is an inchoate crime. However, a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d includes the offenses of aiding and abetting, conspiring, and attempting to commit such offenses. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b), cmt. n. 1. Accordingly, the district court did not commit error, plain or otherwise, in sentencing Gutierrez as a career offender. <em>United States v. Baker, </em>538 F.3d 324, 332 (5th Cir.2008), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Dec. 2, 2008) (No. 08-7559).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b356-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
