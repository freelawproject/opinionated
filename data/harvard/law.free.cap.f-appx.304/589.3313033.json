The parties are familiar with the facts of this case, and we repeat them only to the extent necessary to understand our disposition. This court has jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-10\">Under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the district court at sentencing \u201cmust verify that the defendant and the defendant\u2019s attorney have read and discussed the presentence report [PSR] and any addendum to the report.\u201d Fed. R.Crim.P. 32(i)(1)(A). Although a district court \u201cneed not specifically inquire whether a defendant has read the presentence report,\u201d the sentencing judge must \u201creasonably rel[y] on evidence indicating that a defendant has read the presentence report and discussed it with counsel.\u201d <em>United States v. Soltero, </em>510 F.3d 858, 863 (9th Cir.2007) (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). Failure to complete this verification \u201cmay be excused if it is clear that no prejudice resulted.\u201d <em>See United States v. Davila-Escovedo, </em>36 F.3d 840, 844 (9th Cir.1994) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-13\">The district court did not specifically ask Marcial-Gonzalez whether he had read the PSR and discussed it with his attorney. There is no evidence in the record that he in fact read and discussed it, and he now claims he did not do so. Given that he cannot speak or read English, evidence that he received the PSR or supposedly concurred in it does not indicate the document was translated for and explained to him. The district court therefore violated Rule 32(i)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-14\">Furthermore, the record suggests that, if Marcial-Gonzalez had read and discussed the PSR with his trial counsel, he would have disputed the June 1, 2004, conviction it attributed to him and might have thereby succeeded in lowering his criminal history category and eventual sentence. Thus, he was harmed by the district court\u2019s error.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-15\">Because of our holding on this issue, we need not reach Marcial-Gonzalez\u2019s other claims that his sentence was miscalculated.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>We VACATE Mareial-Gonzalez\u2019s sentence on the ground that the district court violated Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i)(1)(A), and REMAND the matter for resentencing and an evidentiary hearing to determine whether Marcial-Gonzalez actually committed the June 1, 2004, offense.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b614-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
