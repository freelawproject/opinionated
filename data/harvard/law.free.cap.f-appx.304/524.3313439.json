Hubbard (\u201cHubbard\u201d) appeals his conviction in the district court after pleading guilty to five counts of health care fraud under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1347. Hubbard claims that his guilty pleas were not voluntary or knowingly given and that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty pleas. Because the parties are aware of the facts, we recount them only to the extent necessary to understand this disposition. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm Hubbard\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-18\">The district court\u2019s denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United, States v. Garcia, </em>401 F.3d 1008, 1011 (9th Cir.2005). \u201cA court abuses its discretion when it rests its decision on an inaccurate view of the law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Richard S. v. Dep\u2019t of Developmental Servs., </em>317 F.3d 1080, 1085-86 (9th Cir.2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-19\">Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(d)(2)(B), a defendant may withdraw a guilty plea after its acceptance but before sentencing if the defendant shows \u201ca fair and just reason for requesting the withdrawal.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(d)(2)(B). The \u201cfair and just reason\u201d standard \u201cis applied liberally.\u201d <em>Garcia, </em>401 F.3d at 1011 (citing <em>United States v. Ortega-Ascanio, </em>376 F.3d 879, 883 (9th Cir.2004)). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>\u201cFair and just reasons for withdrawal include inadequate Rule 11 plea colloquies, newly discovered evidence, intervening circumstances, or any other reason for withdrawing the plea that did not exist when the defendant entered his plea.\u201d <em>OrtegaAscanio, </em>376 F.3d at 883. Hubbard has not demonstrated fair and just reasons for withdrawal of his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">\u201cA plea is voluntary and intelligent only if it is entered by one fully aware of the direct consequences of his plea.\u201d <em>Little v. Crawford, </em>449 F.3d 1075, 1080 (9th Cir. 2006) (internal citations omitted) (citing <em>United States v. Amador-Leal, </em>276 F.3d 511, 514 (9th Cir.2002)). \u201cA consequence is \u2018direct\u2019 where it presents \u2018a definite, immediate and largely automatic effect\u2019 on the defendant\u2019s range of punishment.\u201d <em>United States v. Kikuyama, </em>109 F.3d 536, 537 (9th Cir.1997) (quoting <em>United States v. Wills, </em>881 F.2d 823, 825 (9th Cir.1989)); <em>see also Torrey v. Estelle, </em>842 F.2d 234, 236 (9th Cir.1988) (\u201cThe distinction between a direct and collateral consequence of a plea turns on whether the result represents a definite, immediate and largely automatic effect on the range of the defendant\u2019s punishment.\u201d). Thus, \u201c[bjefore a court may accept a defendant\u2019s guilty plea, the defendant must be advised of the range of allowable punishment that will result from his plea.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 235 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThe essential ingredient is notice of \u2018the maximum possible penalty provided by law.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Barrios-Gutierrez, </em>255 F.3d 1024, 1027 (9th Cir.2001) (quoting Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Here, it is clear from the record that Hubbard\u2019s plea was knowing and voluntary. Hubbard was made aware of the maximum statutory penalty. Hubbard was informed of the recommended sentencing guideline range, and of his likely sentence. The district court also spent a significant amount of time discussing the potential collateral consequences of Hubbard\u2019s guilty plea and any waivers of rights. Although Hubbard asked many questions, the district court spent a significant amount of time addressing each of his concerns. In light of the significant efforts made by the district court to answer all of Hubbard\u2019s questions, we are not persuaded that Hubbard, a well educated doctor, would have had any doubts as to the consequences of pleading guilt. Moreover, despite being warned that it would be very difficult to withdraw his guilty plea after the change of plea hearing, Hubbard repeatedly stated that he understood the consequences and expressed his desire to plead guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">Additionally, Hubbard\u2019s belated claims of innocence at the sentencing hearing are insufficient to warrant withdrawal of his guilty plea. An unsupported claim of innocence is not a fair and just reason for withdrawal. <em>See United States v. Turner, </em>898 F.2d 705, 713 (9th Cir.1990) (affirming the denial of a motion to withdraw guilty plea despite the defendant\u2019s claim that he was \u201cbeing blamed for a lot of stuff that [he] didn\u2019t do\u201d). Accordingly, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Hubbard\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b549-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
