During his tenure, Day periodically took leaves of absence in order to serve in the United States Navy Reserve. In August 2004, after a seven-year absence due to a series of orders to deploy for service, Day was honorably discharged from active duty and sought to return to his former position at Lockheed. On December 6, 2004, Lockheed reemployed Day, and on January 1, 2007, Day retired.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">On June 29, 2007, Day sued Lockheed, alleging that it violated the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act, 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4301, <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cUSERRA\u201d) when it delayed his reemployment, denied him a higher salary and other benefits, and failed to follow its corporate policy. Lockheed moved for summary judgment, alleging that Day was not covered by USERRA because, during his seven-year absence, he had failed to timely apply for reemployment and therefore forfeited USERRA\u2019s protections. The district court granted Lockheed\u2019s motion, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">USERRA\u2019s purpose is, inter alia, to \u201celiminat[e] or minimiz[e] the disadvantages to civilian careers and employment which can result\u201d from non-career military service. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4301(a)(1). However, USERRA requires service members who return from active duty and wish to continue their previous civilian employment to timely notify their employers. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 4312(a)(3). In this case, because Day did not do so, he is not entitled to USERRA\u2019s benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-12\">The notification which a service member must give to their previous employer depends on the length and circumstances of their service. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 4312(e). On September 14, 2001, Day was ordered to serve for a period of 180 days, requiring him to submit an application for reemployment within fourteen days after completing that order. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4312(e)(1)(c). Day completed the order on March 30, 2002, but did not reapply within fourteen days. Once Day failed to timely reapply, the terms of his employment with Lockheed were no longer covered by USERRA. Although he makes much of the reasonableness provision of \u00a7 4312(e)(1)(C), Day did not raise any argument under \u00a7 4312(e)(1)(C) before the district court, and this Court will not consider this argument for the first time. <em>See Nissho-Iwai Am. Corp. v. Kline, </em>845 F.2d 1300, 1307 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-13\">Lockheed was nevertheless required to follow its corporate policy. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 4312(e)(3). The district court correctly found that nothing in that policy required Lockheed to comply with USERRA when the statute did not otherwise apply. Instead, the policy stated that employees must return to work when they complete their approved leave. Having forfeited the protections of USERRA, Day was not entitled to the relief he seeks through his employer\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-14\">Accordingly, after reviewing the record and finding no reversible error, we hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>that the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b321-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
