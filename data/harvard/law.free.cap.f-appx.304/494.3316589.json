Although he was tried and convicted along with Sigerseth, Avila was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>sentenced separately and their appeals are currently unconsolidated.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">The district court\u2019s finding that Avila made his <em>Faretta </em>motion for the purpose of delay was not clearly erroneous, and the district court therefore properly denied the motion. <em>See United States v. George, </em>56 F.3d 1078, 1084 (9th Cir.1995). The record does not support Avila\u2019s argument that the district court prejudged his <em>Faretta </em>motion and denied him the opportunity to make a full record regarding his purpose for bringing the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Avila challenges his sentence on several grounds. For all of them, we review the district court\u2019s decision for plain error because Avila did not object on any of these grounds at his sentencing hearing. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Rendon-Duarte, </em>490 F.3d 1142, 1146 (9th Cir.2007). Sigerseth\u2019s objection several months later at a separate sentencing hearing did not preserve Avila\u2019s challenge to the inclusion of Sigerseth\u2019s tax loss for 1998-2000 in the calculation of Avila\u2019s base offense level. <em>Cf. United States v. Hardy, </em>289 F.3d 608, 612 n. 1 (9th Cir.2002). Avila\u2019s tax-evasion assistance to Sigerseth included helping Sigerseth avoid paying his 1998-2000 taxes by (among other things) managing and restructuring Sigerseth\u2019s various trusts and acting as Sigerseth\u2019s representative. The district court therefore did not commit plain error when it included Sigerseth\u2019s tax losses for 1998-2000 in its calculations of Avila\u2019s base offense level. <em>See </em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2T1.1, cmt. n. 2 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">The district court determined, based on the limited evidence in the record, that Avila derived a substantial portion of his income from the tax evasion scheme. Because this determination did not conflict with any controlling authority, the district court did not commit plain error by imposing a two-level sentencing enhancement under U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2T1.4(b)(1)(A). Nor did the district court commit plain error by imposing a two-level enhancement under \u00a7 2T1.4(b)(2) for engaging in an offense that involved \u201csophisticated concealment,\u201d in light of the evidence showing that Avila helped Sigerseth move and hide assets through the use of trusts and trust bank accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b519-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b520-6\">. We decide Sigerseth\u2019s appeal, No. 07-10012, in a separate memorandum disposition filed concurrently with this one. On October 31, 2008, Avila moved to join in Sigerseth\u2019s \"jury instruction argument\" and \"tax assessment argument.\u201d Because we reject both of these arguments on the merits in Sigerseth's memorandum disposition, we deny Avila\u2019s motion as moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
