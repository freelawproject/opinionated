Denying his request for a sentence that varied from the advisory guideline range, the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced Ostrander to a term of 180 months in prison. Ostrander appeals, arguing that the court committed procedural error by considering the nature and circumstances of his offense as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), while failing to consider his history and characteristics as also required by section 3553(a)(1). He further contends that his sentence is greater than necessary to satisfy the purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2), and thus is unreasonable, because the court failed to consider the section 3553(a)(2) factors in light of his extenuating circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-24\">We conclude that the court did not fail to consider Ostrander\u2019s history or characteristics, as the record shows that the court reviewed his motion for a variance (which was based on his lack of a criminal history and his family situation), heard defense counsel\u2019s relevant arguments at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>sentencing, and heard numerous supporters of Ostrander speak on his behalf. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) (in reviewing sentence for abuse of discretion, appeals court must first ensure there was no significant procedural error \u2014 such as failing to consider \u00a7 3553(a) factors \u2014 and then assess substantive reasonableness of sentence); <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (sentencing court should set forth enough to satisfy appellate court that it has considered parties\u2019 arguments and has reasoned basis for exercising its own legal decisionmaking authority); <em>United States v. Fields, </em>512 F.3d 1009, 1013 (8th Cir. 2008) (noting that district court\u2019s awareness of defendant\u2019s arguments precludes conclusion that district court abused its discretion by failing to consider them).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">We also conclude that Ostrander\u2019s sentence is not substantively unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Watson, </em>480 F.3d 1175, 1177 (8th Cir.) (listing circumstances where sentencing court abuses its discretion, resulting in unreasonable sentence), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 305, 169 L.Ed.2d 219 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b490-16\">.
