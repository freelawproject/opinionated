The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania had jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231, and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742. We will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment because agents from the Drug Enforcement Agency (\u201cDEA\u201d) had probable cause to seize the vehicle, and Adames has not alleged an unconstitutional violation of the DEA\u2019s inventory search policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-19\">Title 21, Section 881 of United States Code authorizes the seizure of any vehicles \u201cwhich are used, or are intended for use, to transport, or in any manner to facilitate the transportation, sale, receipt, possession, or concealment of\u2019 controlled substances. We have held that such a seizure does not violate the Fourth Amendment if agents \u201chave probable cause to believe that the vehicle is subject to forfeiture.\u201d <em>United States v. Bush, </em>647 F.2d 357, 368-70 (3d Cir.1981). Here, the DEA had probable cause to believe that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>Adames\u2019 vehicle would be used to transport controlled substances. Agents arrested Adames after he and another individual picked up a substantial quantity of cocaine \u2014 30 kilograms \u2014 from a motel room. Adames\u2019 vehicle was the only vehicle parked in the section of the motel parking lot directly behind the room. Its keys were the only set of vehicle keys in Adames\u2019 or the other individuals\u2019 possession at the time of their arrest, and the motel was in an area not readily served by public transportation nor generally accessible without a car. Therefore, the DEA\u2019s seizure of Adames\u2019 vehicle is both statutorily and constitutionally permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">If a seizure is lawful, an ensuing inventory search is constitutional \u201cprovided that the inventory is \u2018conducted according to standardized criteria or established routine.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Salmon, </em>944 F.2d 1106, 1120 (3d Cir.1991) (quoting <em>Colorado v. Bertine, </em>479 U.S. 367, 374 n. 6, 107 S.Ct. 738, 93 L.Ed.2d 739 (1987)). Here, DEA policies state that \u201c[a] complete inventory shall be made of all property that is taken into custody by DEA for safekeeping, regardless of whether probable cause exists to search the property____ Inventory searches need not be made contemporaneous with the arrest of any person or at the time of seizure, but must be made as soon as practical after the property to be searched has been transported to a DEA or other law enforcement facility.\u201d (J.A. 90.) Adames argues that the DEA failed to follow standardized criteria or established routine because agents searched the vehicle in the motel parking lot, not after it had been moved to a DEA or other law enforcement facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">At most, Adames has alleged a technical violation of the DEA\u2019s policies. We require adherence to standardized criteria or an established routine in order to \u201cstrike! ] a balance between the government\u2019s legitimate interests in such searches and the owner\u2019s legitimate expectation of privacy in the content of the seized vehicle.\u201d <em>Salmon, </em>944 F.2d at 1120. To strike this balance, our constitutional inquiry focuses on those aspects of the criteria or routine that \u201climit the officer\u2019s discretion regarding <em>whether </em>to search a seized vehicle\u201d and \u201climit an officer\u2019s discretion regarding the <em>scope </em>of an inventory search....\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, Adames has asserted a policy violation that does not concern whether the vehicle could be searched, nor the scope of that search. Therefore, the alleged violation was merely technical, and does not render the inventory search unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">The DEA seized and searched Adames\u2019 vehicle in accordance with federal statutory and constitutional law. Accordingly, the District Court properly denied Adames\u2019 motion to suppress physical evidence, and we will affirm its judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
