We review de novo the district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a \u00a7 2254 habeas petition. <em>Bean v. Calderon, </em>163 F.3d 1073, 1077 (9th Cir. 1998). Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), a petitioner seeking habeas relief must demonstrate that the state court\u2019s decision on the merits was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law\u201d under United States Supreme Court precedent, or that the decision \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1)\u2014(2); <em>see also Lockyer v. Andrade, </em>538 U.S. 63, 70-73, 123 S.Ct. 1166, 155 L.Ed.2d 144 (2003). None of the three alleged errors meets this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">The first challenged ruling was the admission of Smith\u2019s statement to the baby\u2019s mother, several weeks before the baby died. This statement was not admitted to show propensity, but only to show motive, intent or absence of mistake or accident. The jury was informed of the limited purposes for which the statement could be considered. <em>See Windham v. Merkle, </em>163 F.3d 1092, 1103 (9th Cir.1998) (holding that the admission of evidence \u201cwill violate due process only when there are <em>no </em>permissible inferences the jury may draw from the evidence.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">The second piece of evidence was a photograph of the defendant. Because there was no objection to its admission at trial, the Hawaii Supreme Court held that Smith was procedurally barred from raising it on direct appeal. Smith is also procedurally barred from contesting its admission in federal habeas review. <em>Park v. California, </em>202 F.3d 1146, 1150 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Smith\u2019s third challenge was to a PowerPoint slide presentation, during opening and closing arguments, that included autopsy photographs of the infant\u2019s body and allegedly inappropriate captions. The presentation was hotly disputed at trial. The trial court was fully aware of the positions of the parties and the potential effect of the material on the jury, and gave the jury limiting instructions that opening and closing statements are not evidence. Bearing in mind the extensive nature of the victim\u2019s injuries, the use of the photographs themselves could not have amounted to prosecutorial misconduct, and the captions did not result in any additional prejudice that rendered the trial unfair. <em>See Darden v. Wainwright, 477 </em>U.S. 168, 181, 106 S.Ct. 2464, 91 L.Ed.2d 144 (1986) (noting that it \u201cis not enough that the prosecutors\u2019 remarks were undesirable or even universally condemned.... The relevant question is whether the prosecutors\u2019 comments so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)); <em>see also Ceja v. Stewart, </em>97 F.3d 1246, 1253 (9th Cir.1996) (\u201cCounsel are given latitude in the presentation of their closing arguments, and courts must allow the prosecution to strike hard blows based on the evidence presented and all reasonable inferences therefrom.\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">The admission of the evidence, even when cumulatively considered, did not implicate Smith\u2019s constitutional rights to due process or a fair trial. Under the AEDPA standard which we are bound to follow, the decision of the Supreme Court of Hawaii upholding the conviction was not, therefore, contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b559-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
