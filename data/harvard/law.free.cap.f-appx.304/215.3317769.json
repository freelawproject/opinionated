Jordan was determined to be a career offender and sentenced to a total of 322 months\u2019 imprisonment. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-15\">Counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), questioning whether Jordan\u2019s sentence is reasonable. Jordan was notified of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but did not do so, and the Government elected not to file a responding brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-16\">When determining a sentence, the district court must calculate the appropriate advisory Guidelines range and consider it in conjunction with the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2006). <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Appellate review of a district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence, \u201cwhether inside, just outside, or significantly outside the Guidelines range,\u201d is for abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 591. Sentences within the applicable Guidelines range may be presumed by the appellate court to be reasonable. <em>United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">The district court followed the necessary procedural steps in sentencing Jordan, appropriately treating the Sentencing Guidelines as advisory, properly calculating and considering the applicable Guidelines range, and weighing the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Furthermore, Jordan\u2019s sentence, which is at the low end of the Guidelines range and no greater than the applicable statutory m\u00e1ximums, may be presumed reasonable. Thus, we conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing the chosen sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
