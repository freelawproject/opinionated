We affirmed Millsap\u2019s convictions and sentences. Millsap then filed a motion for reduction of sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on Amendment 706 of the Sentencing Guidelines, which reduced base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine. The district court applied the amendment, calculated a new guideline imprisonment range, and reduced Millsap\u2019s total term of imprisonment to 390 months. After the time for filing a notice of appeal had expired, Millsap filed a motion to file an appeal out of time, which the district court denied. Millsap now appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to file an appeal out of time. Millsap argues that the district court should have applied Fed. R.Civ.P. 4(a)(6) to allow him to file out of time because he did not timely receive a copy of the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) order and, thus, he showed good cause and excusable neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-15\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s interpretation of federal rules of procedure. Ve<em>ncor Hosps., Inc. v. Standard Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co., </em>279 F.3d 1306, 1308 (11th Cir.2002). A motion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u201cis not a civil post-conviction action, but rather a continuation of a criminal case.\u201d <em>United States v. Fair, </em>326 F.3d 1317, 1318 (11th Cir.2003). Therefore, it is governed by procedural rules that apply to criminal cases, not civil cases. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b857-16\">Ordinarily, in a criminal case, \u201ca defendant\u2019s notice of appeal must be filed in the district court within 10 days after\u201d the entry of the order being appealed, under Rule 4(b)(1)(A). Fed.R.App.P. 4(b)(1)(A)(i). This requirement is \u201cjurisdictional and strictly applied.\u201d <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>225 F.3d 1198, 1200 (11th Cir.2000). Although the clerk of court must provide notice to the defendant regarding any order entered on any post-arraignment motion, a clerk\u2019s failure to do so \u201cdoes not affect the time to appeal, or relieve \u2014 or authorize the court to relieve\u2014 a party\u2019s failure to appeal within the allowed time.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 49(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-18\">However, under subsection (4) of Rule 4(b),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-19\">[u]pon a finding of excusable neglect or good cause, the district court may \u2014 before or after the time has expired, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>or without motion and notice \u2014 extend the time to file a notice of appeal for a period not to exceed 30 days from the expiration of the time otherwise prescribed by this Rule 4(b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">Fed.R.App.P. 4(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">Where a criminal defendant has filed a notice of appeal more than 10 days after the entry of an order, but within 40 days after the entry of an order, the district court has the responsibility to determine whether excusable neglect authorizes an extension of time. <em>United States v. Ward, </em>696 F.2d 1315, 1318 (11th Cir.1983). However, a district court may not extend the time for filing a notice of appeal more than 30 days beyond Rule 4(b)\u2019s 10-day deadline. <em>See United States v. Grant, </em>256 F.3d 1146, 1150-51 (11th Cir.2001). While Fed. R.App.P. 4(a)(6), which applies to civil cases, provides relief in civil cases based upon a lack of notice, Rule 4(b), which covers criminal appeals, does not contain a similar provision. <em>Compare </em>Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(6)(B) <em>with </em>Fed.R.App.P. 4(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">The record shows that Millsap\u2019s motion to file a notice of appeal out of time was filed more than 30 days after Rule 4(b)\u2019s 10-day deadline. Therefore, the district court did not err in denying Millsap\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
