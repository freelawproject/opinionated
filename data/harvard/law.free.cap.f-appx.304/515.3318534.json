Korman, Senior United States District Judge for the Eastern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b540-7\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">Defendant-Appellant Kayo Oil Company (Kayo) appeals the district court\u2019s denial of attorney fees following an award of summary judgment in favor of Kayo. As the facts and procedural history are familiar to the parties, we do not recite them here except as necessary to explain our disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">I. The District Court\u2019s Order Granting Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">We find the district court\u2019s December 22, 2006 \u201cOrder Granting Defendants\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment\u201d too ambiguous to permit us to rule on most of the issues appealed in this case. We therefore vacate the order and remand the case to the district court with instructions that it articulate a reasoned basis for its December 22, 2006 order, and provided a reasoned decision, based in the record, on whether the case is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-11\">II. Attorney\u2019s Fees Under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12205 and California State Law</p>\n<p id=\"b540-13\">Depending on the district court\u2019s resolution of the mootness issue, it may consider Kayo\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees. A district court has discretion to award attorney\u2019s fees to a prevailing defendant \u201cupon a finding that the plaintiffs action was frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation.\u201d <em>Summers v. Teichert &amp; Son, Inc., </em>127 F.3d 1150, 1154 (9th Cir.1997) (quoting <em>Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, </em>434 U.S. 412, 421, 98 S.Ct. 694, 54 L.Ed.2d 648 (1978) (noting that defendant may be entitled to attorney\u2019s fees even where the action was \u201cnot brought in subjective bad faith\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-18\">Depending on the district court\u2019s resolution of the mootness issue, it may also consider Kayo\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees under state law in light of our recent holding in <em>Hubbard v. SoBreck, LLC, </em>531 F.3d 983 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-19\">III. Sanctions Against the Hubbards\u2019 Counsel Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927</p>\n<p id=\"b540-20\">Section 1927 of United States Code Title 28 allows a court to charge an opponent\u2019s costs and fees against \u201c[a]ny attorney ... who so multiplies the proceedings in any case unreasonably and vexatiously.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927. The district court found that the Hubbards did not so multiply the proceedings, especially because they conceded during the summary judgment stage. The record does not demonstrate that the district court\u2019s decision on this issue constituted an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-21\">IY. Sanctions Against Kayo or its Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b540-22\">The Hubbards suggest that Kayo and its counsel deserve sanctions for their alleged \u201caspersions,\u201d \u201cunprofessional slurs,\u201d and for misstating the record in this appeal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>The Hubbards\u2019 suggestion is without merit, and we reject it.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b540-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
