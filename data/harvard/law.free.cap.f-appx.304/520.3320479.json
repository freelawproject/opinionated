Breyer, United States District Judge for the Northern District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b545-11\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-12\">Carole Page appeals the district court\u2019s order upholding the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s (ALJ) denial of disability insurance benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 401-434. We reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-17\">The ALJ rejected Dr. Knower\u2019s opinion that Page\u2019s symptoms would result in regular absences from a full time job, and Dr. Moore\u2019s opinion that Page\u2019s symptoms would require her to lie down for one hour of an eight-hour workday. \u201cTo reject [the] uncontradicted opinion of a treating or examining doctor, an ALJ must state clear and convincing reasons that are supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Ryan v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>528 F.3d 1194, 1198 (9th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \u201c[A]n ALJ does not provide clear and convincing reasons for rejecting an examining physician\u2019s opinion by questioning the credibility of the patient\u2019s complaints where the doctor does not discredit those complaints and supports his ultimate opinion with his own observations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1199-1200. This holding applies with no less force to the opinions of treating physicians. <em>See Orn v. Astrue, </em>495 F.3d 625, 632 (9th Cir.2007)</p>\n<p id=\"b545-18\">The ALJ held that Dr. Knower\u2019s opinion as to Page\u2019s limitations was not consistent with his \u201cmild clinical and examination findings,\u201d and that Dr. Moore\u2019s assessment that Page must lie down during the workday was not consistent with her examination reports. Dr. Knower\u2019s treatment reports, however, consistently diagnosed Page with chronic pain stemming from degenerative disc disease and facet arthrosis. These reports included clinical observations such as Page\u2019s inability to sit comfortably during the appointments. Dr. Moore\u2019s 2005 examination report likewise stated, based on her review of an MRI, that Page has \u201cdegenerative disc disease <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>with disc bulge without herniations.\u201d Her report also included a subjective finding of \u201cpersistent back pain and leg pain,\u201d described in detail where Page was experiencing this pain and concluded that \u201cDr. Knower has very appropriately started [Page] on pain medications.\u201d Nothing in the reports of Page\u2019s other treating physicians contradicts these conclusions. <em>See Ryan, </em>528 F.3d at 1200.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">Dr. Goodman, a non-examining physician, relied on the same clinical findings as Drs. Knower and Moore. His conclusions therefore do not constitute \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d sufficient to reject Drs. Knower\u2019s and Moore\u2019s opinions and the ALJ erred in doing so. <em>See Orn, </em>495 F.3d at 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The ALJ also erred in rejecting Page\u2019s subjective testimony. When a claimant presents medical evidence and shows that her impairments could reasonably be expected to cause some degree of her symptoms, and there is no evidence of malingering, the ALJ must offer \u201cspecific, clear and convincing reasons\u201d for rejecting the claimant\u2019s testimony. <em>Lingenfelter v. Astrue, </em>504 F.3d 1028, 1036 (9th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The ALJ\u2019s finding that Page\u2019s testimony about her pain was \u201cnot entirely credible in light of information contained in the medical reports and other evidence in the record\u201d is not supported, given that her testimony was consistent with the medical reports discussed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">The Commissioner argues that the ALJ properly rejected Page\u2019s testimony because she said she worked five to six hours per week at the onset of her disability in 2003. Dr. Knower\u2019s reports show, however, that Page developed a new \u201cL1-L2 disc herniation\u201d in May 2004 that exacerbated her symptoms, so Page\u2019s part time work in 2003 does not discredit her testimony as to the nature of her symptoms in 2005. The Commissioner also cites Page\u2019s testimony that she walked two to three miles in the week before her hearing as being inconsistent with her claim she can stand for only 15 to 20 without experiencing pain. Page went on to testify, however, that she could walk only a quarter of an acre without stopping, and that she sold her house because she is unable to walk up stairs. Page\u2019s overall testimony is consistent with her claimed limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">Because the ALJ gave legally insufficient reasons for rejecting Page\u2019s testimony and Drs. Knower\u2019s and Moore\u2019s opinions, we credit this evidence as true as a matter of law in light of Page\u2019s advanced age and the delay she has experienced since her application for benefits. <em>See Hammock v. Bowen, </em>879 F.2d 498, 503 (9th Cir.1989). We remand for further proceedings, however, because it is still not \u201cclear from the record that the ALJ would be required to find the claimant disabled.\u201d <em>Benecke v. Barnhart, </em>379 F.3d 587, 593 (9th Cir.2004) (citing <em>Harman v. Apfel, </em>211 F.3d 1172, 1178 (9th Cir.2000) (stating circumstances when court should remand for an immediate award of benefits)). The record includes vocational expert testimony indicating that if Page has the limitations stated in her testimony and in the opinions of Drs. Moore and Knower, she would not be able to perform her past relevant work. It remains unclear, however, whether Page would be capable of performing \u201cany other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(2)(A). We therefore remand so the ALJ can develop the record on this issue, giving full consideration to Page\u2019s testimony and Drs. Knower\u2019s and Moore\u2019s opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">We do not address whether the ALJ provided adequate reasons for rejecting Page\u2019s father\u2019s lay testimony, because its substance is reflected in the opinions and testimony that we credit as true. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>reject Page\u2019s contention that the ALJ improperly ignored evidence of the side effects of her pain medications; as the district court correctly found, there is no evidence in the record on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">REVERSED and REMANDED for reconsideration to the Commissioner of the Social Security Administration.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b545-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
