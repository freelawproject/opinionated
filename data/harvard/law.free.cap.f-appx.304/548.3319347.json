Conlon, United States District Judge for the Northern District of Illinois, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b573-5\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">We affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Plaintiff-Appellant T.L.\u2019s complaint for failure to first exhaust the administrative remedy of a due process hearing under 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">T.L. styles his action as one for breach of an April 5, 2006 written settlement agreement, and he argues that exhaustion would be futile because issues of noncompliance with settlement agreements are beyond the limited scope of a due process hearing under Cal. Educ.Code \u00a7 56501(a), such that the California Office of Administrative Hearings (\u201cOAH\u201d) would be required as a matter of law to dismiss T.L.\u2019s compliance complaint for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See Wyner v. Manhattan Beach Unified Sch. Dist., </em>223 F.3d 1026 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">On the facts of this case, however, we are not convinced that exhaustion is necessarily futile. T.L. alleges a past and a continuing failure by the school district to provide T.L. with required educational services, and he seeks relief for both. Even assuming the school district has breached the express and implied terms of the settlement agreement as T.L. alleges, and even if OAH is unable grant T.L. all the relief he seeks, OAH still may be able to grant T.L. appropriate relief, which may include revising T.L.\u2019s educational placement and providing for a more detailed schedule of services going forward. Exhaustion is therefore required. <em>See </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l); <em>Robb v. Bethel Sch. Dist. # 403, </em>308 F.3d 1047, 1049-50 (9th Cir.2002) (\u201cThe dispositive question generally is whether the plaintiff has alleged injuries that could be redressed to any degree by the IDEA\u2019S administrative procedures and remedies. If so, exhaustion of those remedies is required.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b573-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
