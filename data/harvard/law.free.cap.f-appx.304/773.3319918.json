On appeal, George argues that she was eligible for a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because her sentence was partially \u201cbased on\u201d the drug quantity guideline. She submits that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 must be disregarded insofar as it conflicts with <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and the limiting clause of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) should be construed as advisory under <em>Booker. </em>She claims that the district court had inherent equitable power to give effect to Amendment 706 and reduce her sentence. She also asserts that Amendment 709 changed the definition of \u201crelated cases\u201d such that she would no longer be a career offender under the current Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-13\">We review \u201ca district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to [\u00a7 3582(c)(2)], based on a subsequent change in the sentencing guidelines, for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir. 2003). However, in the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) context, we review <em>\u201cde novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-14\">A district court may not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed except where expressly permitted by statute or by Fed.R.Crim.P. 35. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(B). One statutory exception to this general rule includes relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-15\">[I]n the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. [\u00a7 ] 994(o), upon motion of the defendant or the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or on its own motion, the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) ] to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b798-16\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The Sentencing Commission\u2019s recently revised policy statement on retroactive amendments to the Guidelines provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>In a case in which a defendant is serving a term of imprisonment, and the guideline range applicable to that defendant has subsequently been lowered as a result of an amendment to the Guidelines Manual listed in subsection (c) below, the court may reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment as provided by [\u00a7 3582(c)(2) ]. As required by [\u00a7 3582(c)(2) ], any such reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment shall be consistent with this policy statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AmCb\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(1) (made effective on March 3, 2008, by Amendment 712). The policy statement emphasizes that \u201c[a] reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment is not consistent with this policy statement and therefore is not authorized under [\u00a7 3582(c)(2) ] if ... [a]n amendment listed in subsection (c) does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B). In this regard, the commentary to \u00a7 1B1.10 explains that a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is not authorized if the \u201camendment ... is applicable to the defendant but the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision <em>(e.g., </em>a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.1(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">On November 1, 2007, the Sentencing Commission promulgated Amendment 706, which amended the Drug Quantity Table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c). U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 706 (2007). The effect of Amendment 706 is to provide a two-level reduction in base offense levels for certain crack-cocaine offenses. <em>See id. </em>The Commission made this amendment retroactively applicable, effective as of March 3, 2008. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G., App. C, Amend. 713 (Supp. May 1, 2008) (listing Amendment 706 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(c) as a retroactively applicable amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">A district court lacks authority to grant a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u201c[wjhere a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir. 2008). Section 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduced sentence where a defendant was sentenced in accordance with a statutory mandatory minimum sentence. <em>United States v. Black, </em>523 F.3d 892, 892-93 (8th Cir.2008) (persuasive authority), <em>cert. </em>denied, - U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 665, 172 L.Ed.2d 639 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-9\">Although the Guidelines are effectively advisory under <em>Booker, </em>the district courts are still bound by statutory minimum sentences. <em>United States v. Ciszkowski, </em>492 F.3d 1264, 1270 (11th Cir.2007). While district courts may grant variances based on the crack-to-powder disparity, they are still \u201cconstrained by the mandatory minimums Congress prescribed.\u201d <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 574, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-12\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no error. The district court did not err in finding that Amendment 706 had no effect on George\u2019s offense level because she was sentenced to the statutory mandatory minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
