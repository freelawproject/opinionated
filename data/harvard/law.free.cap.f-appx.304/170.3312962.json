Hernandez\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising one issue but stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Although informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, Hernandez has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-22\">Counsel questions whether the district court erred in its assessment of a three-level enhancement under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3B1.1(c) (2002), for Hernandez\u2019s leadership role in the conspiracy. Our review of the record leads us to conclude that the district court did not err in applying the enhancement. In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Hernandez\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Hernandez, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>the United States for further review. If Hernandez requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Hernandez.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
