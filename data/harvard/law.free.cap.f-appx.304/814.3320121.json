Newsome appeals <em>pro se </em>the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>\u00a7 1983 complaint, in which he challenged his state civil commitment proceedings on constitutional grounds. Because the district court did not abuse its discretion in abstaining from deciding the merits of Newsome\u2019s claims, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">Newsome is a convicted sex offender who is currently being detained under Florida\u2019s Jimmy Ryce Act (\u201cJRA\u201d), Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 394.910-934, which establishes \u201ca commitment procedure for the long-term care and treatment of sexually violent predators.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 394.910. During the pendency of his civil commitment proceedings, Newsome filed <em>pro se </em>the instant \u00a7 1983 civil rights complaint in the Southern District of Florida against: (1) the Broward County Office of the Public Defender, Howard Finkelstein, the Public Defender of Broward County, Florida, and Robert Jakovich, the Assistant Public Defender assigned to Newsome\u2019s civil commitment proceedings; (2) the Broward County Office of the State Attorney and Michael J. Satz, State Attorney of Broward County, Florida; (3) the Hon. Dale Ross, Chief Judge of the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit; (4) the Florida Department of Corrections and its Secretary, James R. McDonough; and (5) the Florida Department of Children and Families and its Secretary, Robert Butterworth. R1-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 1, 13-23. In his complaint, Newsome alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that his pre-trial detention without a probable cause hearing violated his Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment due process rights and that the public defender appointed to represent him in the civil commitment proceeding violated his Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel by failing to demand a probable cause hearing and to confer with him about his case. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 1, 2, 7, 54-55, 63-68, 72, 74-81. He further alleged that Fla. Stat. \u00a7 394.915 was unconstitutional both on its face and as applied, and that Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 394.913(1) and 916(1) were unconstitutional as applied.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 33 n. 2, 35-36, 43-45. Newsome included in his complaint a request for a declaratory judgment that the challenged provisions of the JRA are unconstitutional and an injunction ordering the defendants to \u201csubmit and implement a plan correcting the constitutional and statutory deficiencies alleged in this complaint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-10\">The district court dismissed Newsome\u2019s complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) for failure to state a claim, finding that the complaint was barred under <em>Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971) because the relief Newsome sought would have the practical effect of enjoining the pending state civil commitment proceedings. R1-9 at 1-2.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Newsome appeals, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>arguing that <em>Younger </em>did not require the district court to abstain from deciding his constitutional claims. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to abstain from exercising its jurisdiction for an abuse of discretion. <em>See 31 Foster Children v. Bush, </em>329 F.3d 1255, 1274 (11th Cir.2003). Under <em>Younger, </em>federal courts may not enjoin state court proceedings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 401 U.S. at 41, 91 S.Ct. at 749. Accordingly, federal courts ordinarily must refrain from deciding the merits of a case when (1) there is a pending state judicial proceeding; (2) the proceeding implicates important state interests; and (3) the parties have an adequate opportunity to raise any constitutional claims in the state proceeding. <em>See Middlesex County Ethics Comm. v. Garden State Bar Ass\u2019n, </em>457 U.S. 423, 432, 102 S.Ct. 2515, 2521, 73 L.Ed.2d 116 (1982). With respect to the first <em>Middle-sex </em>factor, the relevant inquiry is \u201cwhether the federal proceeding will interfere with an ongoing state court proceeding. If there is no interference, then abstention is not required.\u201d <em>31 Foster Children, </em>329 F.3d at 1276.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">It is clear in this case that the pending state civil commitment proceedings would be impermissibly disrupted, if not wholly invalidated, were the district court to grant a declaratory judgment in New-some\u2019s favor finding the JRA unconstitutional. <em>See Younger, </em>401 U.S. at 41 n. 2, 91 S.Ct. at 749 n. 2 (\u201c[DJeclaratory relief is ... improper when a prosecution involving the challenged statute is pending in state court at the time the federal suit is initiated.\u201d). It is equally clear that this case involves an important state interest, namely, Florida\u2019s need to ensure that violent sex offenders do not harm its citizens after the expiration of their incarcerative sentences. Finally, although Newsome asserts that he has been unable to vindicate his constitutional rights, he has not shown that he has been procedurally prevented from raising his federal claims in the state courts. In fact, the record reflects that in September 2007, Newsome challenged the validity of his pre-trial detention in a state petition for writ of habeas corpus, which was denied.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See </em>R1-1 at 66, 70; <em>Newsome v. Butterworth, </em>969 So.2d 1147 (Fla. Dist.App.2007). Newsome thus had, and availed himself of, a meaningful opportunity to present his constitutional claims in state court. <em>See Pompey v. Broward County, </em>95 F.3d 1543, 1551 (11th Cir.1996) (affirming dismissal of \u00a7 1983 complaint under <em>Younger </em>where plaintiffs, incarcerated following civil contempt hearings for failure to pay child support, could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>sought habeas corpus relief in Florida state court). The fact that Newsome\u2019s claims were unsuccessful on the merits is immaterial. <em>See Pompey, </em>95 F.3d at 1551 (noting that \u201cfor abstention purposes, whether a claim would likely be successful on the merits in the state court is not what matters ... [but rather] whether the plaintiff is <em>procedurally </em>prevented from raising his constitutional claims in the state courts\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">Because each of the <em>Middlesex </em>factors was satisfied in this case, the district court did not abuse its discretion in abstaining from deciding Newsome\u2019s claims. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court dismissing Newsome\u2019s complaint is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b839-7\">. Section \u00a7 394.913(1) requires the Florida Department of Corrections to give notice of a potential civil committee\u2019s anticipated release date to the state attorney and to provide certain medical and other information to a multidisciplinary team of health professionals for a determination of whether the person is a sexually violent predator within the meaning of the JRA. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 394.913(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">Section 394.15 provides, in relevant part, that \u201d[w]hen the state attorney files a petition seeking to have a person declared a sexually violent predator, the judge shall determine whether probable cause exists to believe that the person named in the petition is a sexually violent predator.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 394.15.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-12\">Section 394.16(1) requires the trial court to conduct a civil commitment trial within thirty days of a probable cause determination. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 394.916(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b839-13\">. The district court found additionally that Newsome's complaint was due to be dismissed under <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), because a judgment in his favor necessarily would call into question the validity of the state commitment proceedings. <em>See </em>R1-9 at 2-3. Because we conclude that Newsome\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>suit was properly dismissed pursuant to the <em>Younger </em>abstention doctrine, we need not decide whether his claims also were Heck-barred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b840-8\">. \"Although <em>Younger </em>concerned state criminal proceedings, its principles are fully applicable to noncriminal judicial proceedings when important state interests are involved.\u201d <em>31 Foster Children, </em>329 F.3d at 1274 (quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b840-9\">. Florida courts consistently have held that habeas corpus is the appropriate remedy for challenging pre-trial detentions in civil commitment proceedings under the JRA. <em>See Murray v. Regier, </em>872 So.2d 217, 222 (Fla. 2002) (holding that the writ of habeas corpus \u201cremains available to test pretrial detention\" because \"[a] detainee should not be foreclosed from raising a constitutional claim pretrial if the resolution of that claim could end a lengthy pretrial detention\u201d); <em>see also Valdez v. Moore, </em>745 So.2d 1009 (Fla.Dist.App.1999) (granting habeas petition based on petitioners\u2019 due process challenge to pre-trial detention under the JRA without probable cause hearing); <em>Manning v. State, </em>913 So.2d 37, 38 (Fla.Dist.App.2005) (holding that involuntary committee under JRA must raise ineffective assistance of counsel claim through habeas corpus petition).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
