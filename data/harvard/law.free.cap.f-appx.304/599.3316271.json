Although Mr. Rogers was not the actual suspect that the police officers sought, the police K-9\u2019s biting of Mr. Rogers constituted a seizure under the Fourth Amendment. <em>See Brower v. County of Inyo, </em>489 U.S. 593, 596, 109 S.Ct. 1378, 103 L.Ed.2d 628 (1989) (\u201cA seizure occurs even when an unintended person or thing is the object of the detention or taking ... \u201d) (citation omitted). Substantial evidence supported the finding that excessive force was used. <em>See Harper v. City of Los Angeles, </em>533 F.3d 1010, 1021 (9th Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-16\">2. The district court did not err in denying qualified immunity to the appellants. <em>See Torres v. City of Los Angeles, </em>548 F.3d 1197, 1210-11 (9th Cir.2008). Nor did the district court err in declining to instruct the jury regarding federal qualified immunity. The jury\u2019s finding that the appellants committed an unconstitutional seizure in conjunction with this court\u2019s prior ruling in this ease that a reasonable officer would have been aware that such conduct violated Plaintiffs\u2019 rights, fully resolved the qualified immunity issue. <em>See Rogers v. City of Kennewick, </em>205 Fed.Appx. 491, 493-94 (9th Cir.2006) (unpublished disposition).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-17\">3. The district court did not err in concluding that it is possible to reconcile the jury\u2019s verdicts. <em>See Vaughan v. Ricketts, </em>950 F.2d 1464, 1470 (9th Cir.1991). Considering the jury instructions as a whole, including the different elements for each of the claims, it is possible to reconcile the jury\u2019s verdicts, and therefore we are bound to do so. <em>See California v. Altus Finance S.A., </em>540 F.3d 992, 1004 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-18\">4. Substantial evidence supported the jury\u2019s award of future economic damages. <em>See Harper, </em>533 F.3d at 1028 (\u201cUn<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>less the amount is grossly excessive or monstrous, clearly not supported by the evidence, or based only on speculation or guesswork, we uphold the jury\u2019s award.\u201d) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">5. The jury\u2019s award of punitive damages was not excessive considering the officers\u2019 conduct and the amount and proportion of the damage awards. <em>See Mendez v. County of San Bernardino, </em>540 F.3d 1109, 1120 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\"> 6. The district court did not err in declining to certify to the Washington Supreme Court the question of whether the City of Kennewick was strictly liable under Washington\u2019s dog bite statute, R.C.W. \u00a7 16.08.040. <em>See Micomonaco v. State of Washington, </em>45 F.3d 316, 322 (9th Cir.1995). Nor did the district court err in concluding that the plain language of the statute dictated that the City be held strictly liable for the K-9 bites Mr. Rogers sustained. <em>See McCandish Elec., Inc. v. Will Const. Co., Inc., </em>107 Wash.App. 85, 25 P.3d 1057, 1062 (Wash.App. Div. 3 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">7. The district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney\u2019s fees and costs to the Rogers. Awarding fees based on work done on the entire case, even though the Rogers prevailed on only one claim, was reasonable, as Plaintiffs\u2019 claims were all related. <em>See Dang v. Cross, </em>422 F.3d 800, 813 (9th Cir.2005). Contrary to the appellants\u2019 assertions, the district court declined to award fees it deemed repetitive or unnecessary, and its order reflects \u201ccareful consideration\u201d of the billing statements and fees sought. <em>Armstrong v. Davis, </em>318 F.3d 965, 975 (9th Cir.2003). Finally, the district court acted \u25a0within its discretion in setting the lodestar rate for fees based on its consideration of comparable market rates for attorneys with similar experiences and clients. <em>See Welch v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>480 F.3d 942, 946 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">8. Because the appellants\u2019 arguments were not wholly without merit, we deny the Rogers\u2019 motions for sanctions. <em>See Orr v. Bank of America, NT &amp; SA, </em>285 F.3d 764, 784 n. 34 (9th Cir.2002), <em>as amended.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b625-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
