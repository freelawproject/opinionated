We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-14\">In 1996, Menoken brought an action in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey alleging violations the Family and Medical Leave Act (\u201cFMLA\u201d), the Americans With Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d), and the Civil Rights Act of 1991. <em>Menoken v. Standard Form, Inc., </em>D.N.J. Civ. No. 96-1774 <em>(\u201cMenoken I </em>\u201d). Following discovery and briefing by the parties, the District Court dismissed Menoken\u2019s claims, with the exception of an FMLA claim, which was later resolved in Menoken\u2019s favor after a bench trial. The District Court entered its final judgment on June 16, 2000. On appeal, we affirmed the District Court\u2019s partial dismissal of Menoken\u2019s claims and reversed the District Court\u2019s finding of liability on the FMLA claim. <em>See Menoken v. Standard Forms, Inc., </em>275 F.3d 36 (3d Cir.2001) (table).</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-15\">In 2002, Menoken filed suit in New Jersey Superior Court against the defendants in <em>Menoken I </em>and their attorneys, raising claims of tortious interference with prospective economic advantage and fraudulent concealment of material evidence. <em>Menoken v. McNamara, </em>D.N.J. Civ. No. 02-3341 <em>(\u201cMenoken II </em>\u201d). The defendants removed <em>Menoken II </em>to the District Court, which determined that it had federal question jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. Menoken then voluntarily dismissed the action, but three months later, in January 2003, he moved the District Court to reverse its ruling -with respect to subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b). The District Court denied Menoken\u2019s motion. <em>See Menoken v. McNamara, </em>213 F.R.D. 193, 197-98 (D.N.J.2003). Menoken appealed, and we granted the appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See Menoken v. McNamara, 88 </em>Fed.Appx. 550 (3d Cir. 2004) (not precedential).</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>Menoken filed the present action in the Superior Court of New Jersey on August 13, 2007. The claims in Menoken\u2019s amended complaint \u2014 which is virtually identical to the complaint he filed in <em>Menoken </em>II\u2014 concerned alleged misconduct during the discovery process and summary judgment proceedings in <em>Menoken I. </em>The principal dispute centered around the defendants\u2019 disclosure of, and statements regarding, an Asset Purchase Agreement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendants removed the case to the District Court, which, after determining that it had jurisdiction, granted certain defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss and granted the remaining defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. The District Court\u2019s decision was based on its conclusion that New Jersey\u2019s six-year statute of limitations for non-personal injury actions barred Menoken\u2019s claims. <em>See </em>N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2A:14-1. Menoken appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">Significantly, the alleged harm caused by the defendants\u2019 failure to turn over the Purchase Agreement, and by the defendants\u2019 alleged misrepresentations concerning a list of DVBF employees attached to that Agreement, was known to Menoken before the District Court entered its final judgment in <em>Menoken I </em>on June 16, 2000. During a case management conference, Menoken\u2019s attorney admitted that the Asset Purchase Agreement was provided to Menoken on October 15, 1998, and that it was at that time that Menoken first learned that SFI \u201chad been misleading ... with regard to whether this employee list was actually part of that agreement.\u201d The District Court concluded that Menoken \u201cwas [not] harmed in any way by not having obtained a copy of the agreement sooner than [he] did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-7\">Menoken failed to raise his allegations of fraud and misrepresentation after entry of the final judgment in <em>Menoken I; </em>he did not appeal the District Court\u2019s discovery rulings; he has not alleged that the judgment should be set aside because of fraud upon the court; and he has not sought to initiate an independent federal action to obtain relief. In other words, Menoken has never pursued an appropriate available remedy in the District Court, and now any attempt to do so would be time-barred and/or meritless. Furthermore, to the extent Menoken\u2019s claims are cognizable under state law and were properly removed to federal court, we agree, for the reasons stated by the District Court, that the claims are barred by New Jersey\u2019s six-year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-8\">Accordingly, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">. The Agreement pertained to the acquisition of Menoken's former employer, Delaware Valley Business Forms (\u201cDVBF\u201d), by Standard Forms, Inc. (\"SFI\u201d). SFI's purchase of DVBF took place while Menoken was out of work due to injuries he suffered during a street mugging. When Menoken sought to return to work, SFI claimed that DVBF had not identified him in an exhibit to the Asset Purchase Agreement listing DVBF employees who would become employees of SFI after the transaction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
