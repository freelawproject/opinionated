We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen. <em>Lo v. Ashcroft, </em>341 F.3d 934, 937 (9th Cir.2003). We grant the petition for review and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-17\">The BIA abused its discretion in denying Donoso-Ortiz\u2019s motion for failure to comply with the requirements of <em>Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), in his claim of ineffective assistance by his third attorney. Donoso-Ortiz substantially complied with the <em>Lozada </em>requirements by submitting a detailed affidavit, evidence that notice was given to the attorney, and his reason for not filing a disciplinary complaint against the attorney. <em>See Lo, </em>341 F.3d at 937-38 (strict compliance not required where petitioner sufficiently explained absence of bar complaint and <em>Lozada\u2019s </em>policy goals to discourage baseless claims and collusion were met); <em>see also Ray v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 582, 588 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-18\">The BIA also abused its discretion in denying the motion on the ground that Donoso-Ortiz\u2019s evidence was, or should have been, previously available. The record establishes that the bases for DonosoOrtiz\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>his second and third attorneys were not readily apparent until shortly before he filed the motion on review, due to the alleged ineffective assistance of these attorneys. <em>See Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 895-96 (9th Cir.2003) (motion to reopen requirements met where evidence of ineffective assistance was not \u201cas a practical matter discoverable\u201d until petitioner reviewed case with his new counsel).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">The BIA abused its discretion in denying the motion on the ground that the claim of ineffective assistance regarding Donoso-Ortiz\u2019s third attorney lacked merit because Donoso-Ortiz\u2019s first motion to reopen was untimely and he could not \u201ccure an untimely motion with a second motion.\u201d The BIA\u2019s reasoning fails to acknowledge that a \u201cfinding of ineffective assistance regarding the <em>second </em>motion to reopen [would] <em>necessarily undetmine </em>[ ] the validity of the BIA\u2019s decision to deny that first motion on procedural grounds.\u201d <em>Ray, </em>439 F.3d at 591.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Finally, the BIA erred in denying the motion as time- and number-barred .without addressing Donoso-Ortiz\u2019s contention that equitable tolling should apply. <em>See Singh v. Gonzales, </em>416 F.3d 1006, 1015 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">We therefore grant the petition for review and remand for the BIA to consider equitable tolling and, if appropriate, the merits of Donoso-Ortiz\u2019s motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b653-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
