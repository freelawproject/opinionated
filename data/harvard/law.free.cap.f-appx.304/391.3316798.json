GIBSON, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b416-21\">Vernon Greg Smith appeals from the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment against him and in favor of Caterpillar, Inc. Smith contends that he was wrongfully discharged from an implied employment contract with Caterpillar after he threatened to report potential safety issues to the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration. He further alleges that Caterpillar breached his implied employment contract and that Caterpillar and its employees tortiously interfered with his employment. Finally, he asserts that the district court erred in denying his motion to amend his complaint and that the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>trict court judge was biased against him. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Smith was employed as a maintenance technician at the Danville branch of Caterpillar, Inc. from March 22, 1999 until September 19, 2000. Caterpillar\u2019s plant uses a \u201cheat treat line\u201d to harden metallic parts. A fault card in the computer monitors the heat treat line. If it senses a mechanical problem, it automatically stops the line. In early 2000, Smith claimed that a short in the wire connecting the heat line to the computer caused the heat line to repeatedly stop when no fault actually existed. Smith\u2019s supervisor Douglas and another maintenance technician worked on the problem, but they resolved the problem by disconnecting the fault card and not solving the underlying issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">Smith approached Douglas with technical diagrams showing that the heat treat line was a safety hazard, but Douglas stated that he had investigated the issue and disagreed with Smith\u2019s assessment. Smith spoke to Greg Rziplinksi, Douglas\u2019s supervisor, about the issue but came away equally dissatisfied. Several weeks later, Smith told his fellow employee Jeff Lamb that if Caterpillar did not fix the problem, he would call OSHA about repairing it. The day after, Smith met with Ron Griffith, the plant manager, who told him that he did not believe the disconnected card was a problem. Nevertheless, Griffith sought the advice of an electrical engineer, Aaron Kinney, who, after reviewing the wiring diagrams, thought that the fault card could be a problem. Griffith directed maintenance to address the issue in a way that kept the fault card connected to the heat treat line.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">Smith alleges that around this time, he began receiving negative performance reviews from Douglas and that Allen Shepherd, the operations manager, began to inquire about his job performance. On September 15, 2000, Shepherd conducted a \u201cturnover meeting,\u201d which is held at the end of each shift to allow the outgoing technicians to inform the incoming technician about the status of repairs and further work that needs to be done in the following shift. During the meeting, Shepherd asked Smith what machines he had serviced that evening, to which Smith named some of the machines but then paused, prompting Shepherd to ask what other machines he had worked on. Smith replied that he had worked on an accumulator. Shepherd asked which one and, in frustration, cursed at Smith. Shepherd informed Smith that he was disappointed with his lack of preparation for the turnover meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">After the meeting, Smith told Shepherd that he had no right to talk to him the way he did, to which Shepherd reiterated his expectation that Smith should know which machines he repaired during his shift. Shepherd asked Smith if he understood these expectations, and Smith did not respond. Shepherd told Smith that he would be fired immediately if he did not respond. Smith replied that he could fire him if he so desired. Shepherd did not fire him but reported the incident to Ken Hartwig, Danville plant\u2019s human resources manager at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-11\">The next day, Hartwig prepared a written warning documenting the incident and asked Lamb to bring Smith to his office. Smith claims that Lamb told him that he would be fired if he did not quit. Smith met with Hartwig and Lamb in Hartwig\u2019s office. Hartwig told Smith that he needed to sign the document, indicating that he had received a written warning. Smith refused, and contends that Hartwig told him that he would be fired if he did not sign the warning. Smith refused to sign <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>the warning. Hartwig claims that Smith quit; Smith maintains that he was fired. Smith signed an agreement to return any Caterpillar property within his possession and left the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Hamilton v. Starcom Mediavest Group, Inc., </em>522 F.3d 623, 627 (6th Cir.2008). Summary judgment is properly granted where no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">A. Wrongful Termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">Under Kentucky law, an employment relationship is generally terminable at will. <em>Firestone Textile Co. Div. v. Meadows, </em>666 S.W.2d 730, 731 (Ky.1983). This means that \u201c[a]n employer may discharge his at-will employee for good cause, for no cause, or for a cause that some might view as morally indefensible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, an employee can state a claim for wrongful discharge if his termination \u201cis contrary to a fundamental and well-defined public policy as evidenced by existing law....\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Brockmeyer v. Dun &amp; Bradstreet, </em>113 Wis.2d 561, 335 N.W.2d 834, 835 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">Smith contends that he was wrongfully discharged because Caterpillar fired him for threatening to call OSHA. Smith failed to specify which well-defined public policy his purported discharge would violate, although during his deposition, he specified the federal OSHA statute. As the district court recognized, both the federal OSHA statute, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 660(c), and the Kentucky OSHA statute, Ky.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 338.121(3), specify that public policy forbids firing in retaliation for complaints filed under their respective OSHA statutes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-9\">No person shall discharge or in any manner discriminate against any employee because such employee has filed any complaint or instituted or caused to be instituted any proceeding under or related to this chapter or has testified or is about to testify in any such proceeding or because of the exercise by such employee on behalf of himself or others of any right afforded by this chapter. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 660(c)(1); Ky.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 338.121(3).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">But under Kentucky law, the public policy rule applies only when the statute creating the public policy does not provide a structure for pursuing a complaint under the statute. <em>Grzyb v. Evans, </em>700 S.W.2d 399, 401 (Ky.1985). Here, both the federal OSHA statute, at 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 660(c)(2), and the Kentucky OSHA statute, at Ky. Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 338.121(3)(b), outline a procedure whereby, a complaint shall be filed with the Secretary of Labor or the Executive Director of the Office of Occupational Safety and Health. \u201cWhere the statute both declares the unlawful act and specifies the civil remedy available to the aggrieved party, the aggrieved party is limited to the remedy provided by the statute.\u201d <em>Grzyb, </em>700 S.W.2d at 401. Therefore, Smith can state no separate claim for wrongful discharge. <em>Hines v. Elf Atochem N. Am., Inc., </em>813 F.Supp. 550, 552 (W.D.Ky.1993) (holding that both federal and Kentucky OSHA statutes preempt wrongful discharge claims based on OSHA).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-11\">B. Breach of Implied Contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-12\">Smith contends that Caterpillar breached an implied employment contract when it discharged him from his employment. While employment for an indefinite period of time may be terminated by either party at will, parties can modify the at-will relationship by entering into an em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>ployment contract that is terminable only pursuant to express terms of the contract. <em>See Shah v. Am. Synthetic Rubber Corp., </em>655 S.W.2d 489, 491-93 (Ky.1983). Here, nothing altered Smith\u2019s at-will employment status. Indeed, he admitted as much in the third paragraph of his complaint. (\u201cMy employment was [] terminable at will either by the employer or the employee.\u201d). He reiterated this view during his deposition, though he \u201creserve[d] the right to add something to it later\u201d because he may not have understood \u201cwhat\u2019s going on.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Smith nevertheless argues that he had an implied employment contract because he thought that (1) Caterpillar was a good company, (2) Caterpillar was a wealthy company, and (3) he was a good worker. None of these reasons can transform his at-will employment status into an implied contract. There being no contract, his breach of contract claim necessarily fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">C. Tortious Interference.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">Smith contends that Caterpillar tortiously interfered with his employment. Under Kentucky law, tortious interference with employment requires a showing of the following elements: (1) the existence of a contract; (2) defendant\u2019s knowledge of the contract; (3) defendant\u2019s intent to cause breach; and (4) defendant\u2019s conduct that caused the breach. <em>Lovely v. Aubrey, </em>188 F.3d 508, 1999 WL 701921 at *4 (6th Cir.1999) (unpublished) (citing <em>CMI, Inc. v. Intoximeters, Inc., </em>918 F.Supp. 1068, 1079 (W.D.Ky.1995)). Even if we assume that there was a contract between Smith and Caterpillar, Caterpillar, as a party to an agreement, cannot tortiously interfere with the performance of its own contract. <em>Rawlings v. Breit, </em>2005 WL 1415356, at *3 (Ky.Ct.App. Jun.17, 2005) (unpublished). Moreover, Shepherd, Griffith, and Hartwig were acting on Caterpillar\u2019s behalf, not in their own interests. Smith did not point to any admissible evidence that would support a claim that the individual defendants were acting on their own behalf. Therefore, the individual defendants are similarly absolved from this claim. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">D. Denial of Motion to Amend Complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to amend the pleadings on the ground that the motion was untimely and prejudicial. <em>Parry v. Mohawk Motors of Mich., Inc., </em>236 F.3d 299, 306 (6th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-11\">The Federal Rule in effect when the motion was decided provided that leave to amend \u201cshall be freely given when justice so requires.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a). Nevertheless, to take advantage of the Rule\u2019s liberality, the party requesting leave \u201cmust act with due diligence.\u201d <em>Parry, </em>236 F.3d at 306 (quoting <em>United States v. Midwest Suspension &amp; Brake, </em>49 F.3d 1197, 1202 (6th Cir.1995)). Factors that may be considered in deciding whether to permit an amendment include undue delay in filing, lack of notice to the opposing party, bad faith by the moving party, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by previous amendments, undue prejudice to the opposing party, and futility of amendments. <em>Coe v. Bell, </em>161 F.3d 320, 341-42 (6th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-12\">Here, all motions to amend the parties\u2019 pleadings were due no later than April 28, 2006. After the defendants filed their motion for summary judgment, Smith filed his second motion to amend on November 28, 2006, alleging claims for tortious interference of a prospective advantage and tortious interference with employment. The district court properly deemed that seven months\u2019 delay between the last date for amendment in the scheduling order and the motion for leave to amend, coupled with the prejudice to the defendants of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>reopening a case that was \u201cessentially closed,\u201d justified denial of Smith\u2019s motion to amend. <em>See Coe, </em>161 F.3d at 341-43 (considering filing motion to amend seven months after last date for amendment \u201csubstantial\u201d and combined with prejudice to the opposing party of filing new answers and motions \u2014 in essence re-opening the case \u2014 justified denial of motion to amend). Moreover, the district court had already granted him one motion to amend. There was no abuse of discretion by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">E. Judicial Bias and Other Claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Smith claims that District Judge Coffman was biased against him because she was appointed by President Clinton with the help of Terry McBrayer, a man who Smith claims to have sued and who, as a result, harbors animus against him. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 144 and 455(a). However, recusal is necessary only where a \u201creasonable, objective person, knowing all of the circumstances, would have questioned the judge\u2019s impartiality.\u201d <em>See Hughes v. United States, </em>899 F.2d 1495, 1501 (6th Cir. 1990). This is an objective standard and it is not based \u201con the subjective view of a party.\u201d <em>Browning v. Foltz, </em>837 F.2d 276, 279 (6th Cir.1988). Here, Smith\u2019s subjective speculation alone is insufficient to form the basis of a judicial bias claim. <em>See Hughes, </em>899 F.2d at 1501.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">On appeal, Smith raises other issues such as the constitutionality of the time limitations for bringing a lawsuit, his grandfather\u2019s previous lawsuit, and the immorality of big corporations like Caterpillar. These claims are either irrelevant or lack factual or legal basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-10\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on all claims.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
