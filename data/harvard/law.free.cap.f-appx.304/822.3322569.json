On appeal, Campbell argues that he qualified for a two-level sentence reduction, despite the fact that he originally was sentenced to the mandatory minimum. Campbell further argues that the district court did not conduct a proper analysis of the pertinent factors, including his post-sentencing conduct, before denying his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-8\">We review the district court\u2019s decision to deny reduction of a defendant\u2019s sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1219 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may not reduce the term of imprisonment of an already incarcerated defendant unless that defendant has been sentenced pursuant to a guideline range \u201cthat has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission....\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Amendment 706 provides for a two-level reduction in the base offense level for certain crack cocaine offenses. <em>See </em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual app. C, amend. 706. This amendment was effective retroactively as of March 3, 2008. U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual app. C, amend. 713.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-10\">In addressing a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, a district court must engage in a two-part analysis: (1) recalculating the sentence based on the amendment, leaving \u201c[a]ll other guideline application decisions ... unaffected;\u201d and (2) exercising its discretion, based on the 18 U.S.C. 3553(a) factors, to impose a new sentence or to retain the original. U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 2; <em>see United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 760 (11th Cir.1998). This requirement, however, \u201cis triggered only by an amendment ... that lowers the applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-12\">For example, \u201ca reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is not authorized where the amendment ... is applicable to the defendant but the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision (e.g. a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment).\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327-28 (11th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted) (emphasis omitted). This is true because, to the extent the mandatory minimum is greater than a portion of the guideline range, the mandatory minimum replaces its lower boundary, and where the mandatory minimum \u201cis greater than the maximum of the guideline range,\u201d it becomes the guideline sentence. <em>United States v. Pope, </em>58 F.3d 1567, 1569 (11th Cir.1995) (per curiam). <em>See also </em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 5G1.1(b), (c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-13\">We conclude that Campbell was not eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction. Campbell was originally sentenced to 120 months, which was and remains the mandatory minimum. While Amendment 706 reduced Campbell\u2019s base offense level, it did not lower his applicable guideline range because his sentence was controlled by the mandatory minimum. Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>the district court lacked authority to grant relief to Campbell under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), and it was not required to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">We find that the district court did not abuse its discretion. Accordingly, we affirm Campbell\u2019s 120 month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
