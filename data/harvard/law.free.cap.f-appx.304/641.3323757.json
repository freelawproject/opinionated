Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1015 (9th Cir.2003), and we deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-24\">The BIA denied Manuhutu\u2019s asylum application as time barred. Manuhutu does not challenge this finding in his opening brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-25\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s denial of withholding of removal.

Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 922, 927-29 (9th Cir. 2004) applies to Christian Indonesians seeking withholding of removal, Manuhutu failed to demonstrate a clear probability of future persecution if he returns to Indonesia. <em>See Hoxha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179, 1184-85 (9th Cir.2003). We lack jurisdiction to consider Manuhutu\u2019s contention that he is eligible for withholding of removal because of the potential harm in Indonesia to his United States citizen daughter because he failed to exhaust it before the BIA. <em>See Barron v.
