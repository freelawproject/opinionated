Philips Elecs. N. Am. Corp., </em>No. 06 Civ. 6090, 2007 WL 959374 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 30, 2007), and dismissing her complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, <em>see Falcon v. Philips Elecs. N. Am. Corp., </em>489 F.Supp.2d 367, 368 (S.D.N.Y.2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">Falcon challenges the District Court\u2019s determination that she could not serve as an adequate class representative, a determination that provided the basis for the District Court\u2019s denial of Falcon\u2019s motion for class certification. Our review of a district court\u2019s denial of class certification is for abuse of discretion, <em>see Cordes &amp; Co. Fin. Servs. v. A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>502 F.3d 91, 98 (2d Cir.2007), and we identify none here. \u2018When a district court is vested with discretion as to a certain matter, it is ... empowered to make a decision \u2014 of <em>its </em>choosing \u2014 that falls within a range of permissible decisions.\u201d <em>Zervos v. Verizon N.Y., Inc., </em>252 F.3d 163, 168-69 (2d Cir.2001). A district court commits an \u201cabuse\u201d of discretion when \u201c(1) its decision rests on an error of law (such as application of the wrong legal principle) or a clearly erroneous factual finding, or (2) its decision \u2014 though not necessarily the product of a legal error or a clearly erroneous factual finding \u2014 cannot be located within the range of permissible decisions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 169. The District Court\u2019s conclusion that Falcon \u201ccannot serve as an adequate class representative,\u201d <em>Falcon, </em>2007 WL 959374, at *2, falls well within the range of permissible decisions supported by the record in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-7\">In its Memorandum Order, the District Court explained that Falcon could not serve as an adequate class representative because (1) her husband, and not she, had purchased the Philips television set; (2) her husband\u2019s disposal of the television set prevented her from obtaining the relief sought \u2014 namely, the repair or replacement, at Philips\u2019s option, of the set; and (3) without the allegedly defective television set, Falcon \u201cwill likely have much more difficulty showing design defect than would someone who could produce the product for examination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Falcon contests the District Court\u2019s finding that her husband purchased the television set, arguing that her husband did so on her instructions and was therefore acting solely as her agent. Even if we were to agree with Falcon on that score, the disposal of the television set, standing alone, was sufficient to support the District Court\u2019s exercise of discretion. Pursuant to Rule 23(a)(4) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a class representative must \u201cfairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.\u201d When a \u201cputative class representative is subject to unique defenses which threaten to become the focus of the litigation,\u201d she cannot serve as a class representative. <em>Gary Plastic Packaging Corp. v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., </em>903 F.2d 176, 180 (2d Cir.1990); <em>see also Baffa v. Donaldson, </em>222 F.3d 52, 59 (2d Cir.2000). This is so because of the \u201cdanger that absent class members will suffer if their representative is preoccupied with defenses unique to it.\u201d <em>Gary Plastic, </em>903 F.2d at 180. Falcon\u2019s disposal of the television set presented such a danger \u2014 both with respect to (1) proving a design defect and (2) defending against a charge of spoliation of evidence \u2014 and it was far from an abuse of discretion for the District Court to conclude, in light of that danger, that Falcon could not serve as an adequate class representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>Falcon also challenges the District Court\u2019s denial of her motion to reopen discovery in order to identify a substitute class representative. The District Court characterized this motion as a request \u201cto go fishing, through further discovery, in the hopes of finding [an adequate class representative].\u201d <em>Falcon, </em>489 F.Supp.2d at 369. Denying the motion, the District Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b922-4\">While there might be cases where this would make sense, this is not such a case. Plaintiff filed this action over nine months ago. The deadlines for both class certification discovery and merits discovery have come and gone. Plaintiff cannot plausibly argue that she never considered that, as someone who neither purchased nor retained a defective Philips television set, she might not adequately represent a class of persons consisting of those who did purchase such sets and who seek to get them repaired. Plaintiff has had ample opportunity to conduct discovery to locate ... another representative who could more adequately represent the class, and she has failed to do so. Having carefully considered all of the underlying facts and circumstances, the Court determines that further discovery at this time would be grossly unfair to defendant and hence must be denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b922-5\"><em>Id. </em>A district court\u2019s discovery rulings are reviewed for abuse of discretion, <em>In re \u201cAgent </em>Orange\u201d <em>Prod. Liab. Litig., </em>517 F.3d 76, 102 (2d Cir.2008), and, pursuant to that standard, we see no basis to disturb the District Court\u2019s denial of Falcon\u2019s motion to conduct additional discovery. Falcon was on notice that her adequacy was contested, Answer 1115, and she had ample opportunity to identify other plaintiffs to serve as class representatives \u2014 both through discovery and public sources. At this late stage of the litigation, we cannot say that it was an abuse of discretion for the District Court to deny Falcon\u2019s motion to reopen discovery in order to \u201cgo fishing\u201d for another class representative. <em>Cf. Reed v. Bowen, </em>849 F.2d 1307, 1313-14 (10th Cir.1988) (\u201cNo court has held, in a factual context similar to this case, that counsel has a right to use the power of the courts, through the Rules of Civil Procedure, to find a client who could be intervened as a plaintiff in a suit which has no party plaintiff.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-7\">For the forgoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
