R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b662-28\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-29\">Guriqbal Singh, a native and citizen of India, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 order summarily dismissing his appeal from an immigration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) decision denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence. <em>Sidhu v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1085, 1088 (9th Cir.2000). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s explicit adverse credibility finding because the IJ properly relied on discrepancies in Singh\u2019s passport and testimony about events leading up to his departure from India. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003) (affirming negative credibility finding based on, <em>inter alia, </em>discrepancies regarding petitioner\u2019s identification documents); <em>Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1043 (9th Cir.2001) (affirming negative credibility finding based on, <em>inter alia, </em>inconsistencies in petitioner\u2019s testimony about events leading to his departure). Because the IJ had reason to question Singh\u2019s credibility, the IJ reasonably took into account Singh\u2019s failure to provide corroborating evidence in support of his claim of persecution, <em>see Sidhu, </em>220 F.3d at 1090-92, and we are not compelled to conclude that corroborating evidence was unavailable, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(D). Thus, Singh failed to establish eligibility for asylum. <em>See Farah, </em>348 F.3d at 1156.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Because Singh failed to demonstrate eligibility for asylum, it follows that he did not satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">Because Singh\u2019s CAT claim is based on the same testimony the IJ found to be not credible, and Singh points to no other evidence the IJ should have considered, he has failed to establish that the record eompels a finding of eligibility for CAT relief. <em>See id. </em>at 1157.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b662-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
