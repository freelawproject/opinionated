She pleaded guilty to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>concealing assets and making a false declaration or statement in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(1) and (3), respectively. The district court sentenced her to 60 months\u2019 imprisonment, plus three years of supervised release, and ordered her to pay restitution. This timely appeal from the resulting judgment challenges only the application of a 2-level sentencing enhancement for a vulnerable victim under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.1(b)(1). Reviewing the finding of victim vulnerability for clear error, <em>United States v. Weischedel, </em>201 F.3d 1250, 1252 (9th Cir.2000), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">The district court did not clearly err in finding that Defendant\u2019s mother was particularly susceptible to the criminal conduct at issue, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.1(b)(1) cmt. n.2. The court relied on a combination of factors, including the mother\u2019s age (82) and her isolation, which Defendant herself caused. <em>See United States v. Veerapol, </em>312 F.3d 1128, 1133-34 (9th Cir.2002) (upholding a vulnerable victim enhancement where the defendant\u2019s actions caused the particular vulnerability). Among other things, Defendant told nursing home officials (falsely) that her mother had Alzheimer\u2019s disease, making it less likely that her mother\u2019s complaints of victimization would be believed by authorities and therefore more likely that Defendant\u2019s criminal scheme would succeed, and transferred all her mother\u2019s banking mail to herself. As a result, Defendant\u2019s mother became particularly susceptible to theft by her daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b547-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b548-6\">GRABER, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AQJ\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">I respectfully dissent, because the district court clearly erred in finding Defendant\u2019s mother to be especially vulnerable. The district court relied in part on a finding that Defendant\u2019s mother was \u201crather unsophisticated,\u201d but the record can support only the opposite conclusion. The mother had transferred about $100,000 more from a Texas account into a Montana account than she was entitled to have from her late husband\u2019s estate; she then reinvested the proceeds in CDs in her own name and Defendant\u2019s name to keep funds out of the hands of the executor of her late husband\u2019s estate. In addition, in my view the record does not support a finding of isolation. It was the mother\u2019s idea to move to a nursing home in Montana, she could phone the bank at will, and she had access to staff members who helped her. Finally, the fact that her daughter forwarded her mail did not make her -vulnerable to the kind of theft that occurred here.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
