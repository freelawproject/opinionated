Donahue appeals from the order of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, granting summary judgment in favor of the United States Postal Service (USPS) and Postmaster General John E. Potter. The District Court exercised jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 and 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(b)(2). We have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. For the reasons set forth below, we will affirm the order of the District Court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b88-20\">Donahue filed a civil action in 2005 alleging that he was discriminated against by his employer in violation of the Rehabilitation Act on the basis of a mental disability. According to Donahue, the USPS discriminated against him when it suspended him from work because of concerns about his fitness for duty, required that he submit to a psychiatric evaluation, and subsequently placed him on forced leave because he failed to submit to a third psychiatric evaluation. Donahue also alleged that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>USPS retaliated against him because he filed a challenge with the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) of the USPS\u2019s decision suspending him until it was determined he was fit to return to work. In a subsequent civil action, Donahue appealed the MSPB\u2019s decision, which concluded that the USPS did not err by imposing forced leave status in March of 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">After discovery, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The District Court concluded that Donahue\u2019s discrimination and retaliation claims failed as a matter of law as Donahue failed to establish either a prima facie case or that the USPS\u2019s reasons for its actions were a pretext. In addition, because the MSPB\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence, the District Court refused to disturb it.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Donahue challenges the District Court\u2019s ruling on each of his claims. He asserted that he was discriminated against on the basis of a mental disability in violation of the Rehabilitation Act. With regard to the prima facie case, the District Court assumed that he had a disability and that he suffered an adverse employment action. It concluded, however, that he \u201cfailed to present any competent evidence that he was \u2018otherwise qualified[.]\u2019\u201d Dr. Bonovitz\u2019s report, however, was competent evidence, and it stated that Donahue was not a danger to himself or others. Thus, there was a genuine issue as to whether Donahue was fit for duty and therefore \u201cotherwise qualified\u201d for his job. For that reason, we conclude that Donahue adduced a prima facie case of discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">The fact remains, however, that Dr. Bonovitz\u2019s report did not resolve all of the USPS\u2019s concerns about Donahue\u2019s fitness for duty. The USPS explained that its decision to suspend Donahue, to require a psychiatric examination, and to place him on forced leave status was based on its inability, after reviewing Dr. Bonovitz\u2019s report, to determine whether Donahue was in fact fit for duty. The District Court concluded that this was a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the USPS\u2019s actions, and that Donahue failed to show that this reason was pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">Donahue does not explain how the District Court erred in its determination that he failed to cast doubt on the USPS\u2019s proffered reasons for its actions. Because Donahue has not identified any evidence that would cast doubt on the proffered reasons for the actions that were taken, and because we cannot discern any basis that the USPS\u2019s reason is a pretext, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on Donahue\u2019s claim of discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act. <em>See Fuentes v. Perskie, </em>32 F.3d 759, 764 (3d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-10\">Donahue\u2019s retaliation claim was defeated on summary judgment on the same grounds as his claim for discrimination. On appeal, Donahue argues in a single page that there is sufficient evidence to show a causal connection because of the ongoing activity before the EEOC and MSPB regarding his leave status. This is plausible, and we conclude that Donahue adduced sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case. Donahue does not take issue, however, with the District Court\u2019s determination that the USPS had a legitimate reason for its action. Inasmuch as the record supports the USPS\u2019s explanation and because there is no evidence casting doubt on the USPS\u2019s explanation, we will also affirm the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on Donahue\u2019s retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-11\">Finally, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on Donahue\u2019s appeal of the MSPB claim that his enforced leave was improper. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>District Court concluded that the MSPB decision, which affirmed the AJ\u2019s decision, was supported by substantial evidence. After reviewing the record, we agree.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b88-12\">. \"We exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment and apply the same standard that the District Court should have applied.\" <em>Shuman ex rel Shertzer </em>v. <em>Penn Manor Sch.
