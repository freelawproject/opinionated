The district court sentenced Garnett to thirty months of imprisonment, to be followed by a three-year term of supervised release. Garnett contends on appeal that the district court clearly erred in denying a reduction in sentence for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3E1.1 (2007). Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">A district court\u2019s determination as to the defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility is a factual question reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Ruhe, </em>191 F.3d 376, 388 (4th Cir.1999). The burden is on the defendant to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that he is entitled to the adjustment. <em>United States v. Urrego-Linares, </em>879 F.2d 1234, 1238-39 (4th Cir. 1989). A guilty plea does not automatically entitle a defendant to a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 3E1.1, comment. (n.3). A defendant may not be entitled to a sentencing adjustment for acceptance of responsibility if the defendant engages in conduct inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility. <em>Id. </em>In this case, the district court found by a preponderance of evidence that Garnett obstructed justice in unsuccessfully attempting to influence his wife to testify falsely and that Garnett gave false testimony at sentencing in that regard. We find no clear error in the district court\u2019s conclusion that Garnett\u2019s conduct after he pled guilty was inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-12\">Accordingly, we affirm Garnett\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
